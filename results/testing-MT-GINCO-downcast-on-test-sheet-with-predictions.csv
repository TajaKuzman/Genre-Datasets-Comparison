2	Project INNOVAge and the Oreli Institute <p/> The Oreli Institute responded to an invitation from the Development Centre of the Heart of Slovenia, which, in the framework of the INNOVAge project, had the task of bringing external experts in the field of elderly care, telecare, e-health, eco-innovations in housing and houses adapted to the elderly, to a study visit in Helsinki, Finland. 13 European partners are involved in this project, including the Heart of Slovenia Development Centre as the only Slovenian partner. <p/> The main objective of the INNOVage project is to transfer good practices in Europe in the field of active ageing and independent living of older people in their own homes, supported by smart ICT (information and communication technologies). <p/> So, from 10 to 12 June 2013, we visited the activities and the current situation in Finland. We prepared a presentation of our innovative model of helping the elderly in their homes, which we developed in Kamnik. After the successful presentation and after organising networking events and networking with partners and external experts of partners, we held several meetings. We received confirmation that the Slovenian - Kamnik project is innovative, of high quality, grew out of the needs on the ground, supported by expertise and interesting to implement in other settings. <p/> We found it interesting that a lot of experts are developing ICT to a very high level, but we heard little or nothing on the subject of support systems that would enable the concrete use of ICT in practice. At the Oreli Institute we are aware that it is necessary to have not only the tools, but above all the knowledge and infrastructure to use a well-developed tool.	Promotion	News/Reporting

Let the drops creep under my armpits, in my ear, below my waist, in my perineum. Rain, wash away all the grease of summer sweat! <p/> DREAMS <p/> While playing at work, with the first kiss on the floor, innocently late in the experience of memory. <p/> On the verge of bursting into tears, while walking the tightrope of freedom, I hold back the wishful melody into a cry. <p/> All spilled in a pool of tears. <p/> END <p/> What shall I whisper to the echoes of the immortals? Should they not cease if they are conceived? <p/> Advice to the wind that scatters them? Promises nailed to the backs of hearts? <p/> To whom shall I toast a sip of wisdom to a stranger's memory or a son's farewell? <p/> How shall I suddenly forget my father, how shall I forget my mother's cares? <p/> When I am going away, I will not extinguish the stars, I will leave them in peace, let them shine! <p/> HIP <p/> Damn the seconds that flow into minutes, that hours drag by the nose, that months pass into years, a decade passes like a shiver, a century is here like a flash, only don't let anyone tell me that a millennium is dragging on forever, because sooner or later the whole era will be over, before we realise that it will all be over in a moment.

18	Almodovar in town <p/> 16/05/2013 <p/> The last film of the famous Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, Lovers Above the Clouds, will be screened at the Komuna cinema from today. <p/> The director of Talk to Her and Come Back presents the funny story of a plane that breaks down on its way to Mexico and is forced to circle over Spain until rescuers can prepare the airport for an emergency landing. With a trio of wacky flight attendants in charge of the plane's morale, an unpredictable pilot duo at the controls and a passenger cabin full of hangdog characters, the precarious wait high in the sky turns into an unexpected carnival of laughter, crying, amorous adventures and irrepressible fun.

25	Seu d'Urgell, 23 May (STA) - As in the first World Cup event in Athens, Simon Hočevar managed to qualify for the final with a tenth semi-final result. After his sixth place in qualifying, he rowed reliably in the semi-final, especially in the second part of the course where he was among the fastest. In the final heat, he overtook Martikan to finish ninth. Dejan Kral missed out on a place in the final by a whisker, finishing 12th. Both he and Hočevar almost repeated their positions from the first World Cup race. <p/> Among the canoeists, Dejan Stevanovic also paddled in the semi-final, finishing 19th , and Nada Mali was in the same position, losing a lot of time with an Eskimo turn. Fedja Marušič and Uroš Kodelja finished just outside the top 30. Marušič was 31st and Kodelja a place behind him. Ferrazzi, Lefevre, Pecshier, Ratcliffe and some others did not qualify for the final, but the first place in the semi-final of the winner of the international race in Sochi a fortnight ago, Italian Molmenti, was certainly surprising. <p/> The Slovenian team leaves Seu d'Urgell directly for Merano, where they will compete again for World Cup points at the weekend.

29	"First memory book <p/> A first memory book is the most beautiful gift at the birth of a child. New subscribers to My Toddler magazine receive it as a gift! <p/> How quickly it's forgotten which baby name suggestions were made by mummy and which by grandma, exactly when baby first rolled over on his side, which toy was his favourite at eight months, who came to celebrate his first birthday, what the toddler called the bottle when he was very small.... Wouldn't it be nice to capture some of those sweet memories forever? <p/> Baby Memory Book <p/> When there is a baby or a young child in the house, young parents certainly have no time to spare. That's why many young parents don't even think of writing down the small and big events of their baby's earliest years, because they are so tired every day that they can hardly wait for a good night's rest. And yet... How quickly childhood passes and how we love to go back to it! Little bigger children want to know everything about their early childhood - what toys they played with, what shoes they wore, what their first bedding was like... We could listen to stories about this for hours. But it's amazing how quickly these tiny everyday details slip from parents' and grandparents' memories! <p/> And it's not just the little kids, teenagers and adults alike love to go back to their first childhood. It is as if they want to reconstruct a time that they remember only vaguely, only in a hunch. It is only when their parents or grandparents put it into words for them with their own memories that they seem to have linked their feelings and memories into events that make sense and can be explained. The satisfaction they feel in doing so is certainly worth the effort of writing and editing their first memory book. Why not give it to them? Such memories bind adults and children together with a warm bond of love, knowing how much we have always loved them and also - what they have done for us over the years. Isn't that worth writing a line here and there in the first memory book or sticking a photograph in it? <p/> Support for parents What should we write in the first memory book? No, the problem is not that nothing important happened in the baby's life. Too much is happening, because in the first year a baby grows from an almost helpless newborn into a toddler who is already taking his first steps. And in the next year he starts to talk more and more, and better and better, and by the age of three he can do almost ""everything"" - talk, run, fall asleep on his own, catch and throw a ball, draw... The child just needs to deepen and sharpen his knowledge. There is indeed much to write about in the first three years of a child's earliest childhood. <p/> The first memory book is therefore designed so that in each month from birth to the child's third year, the developmental path of the average child is described - his physical development, his motor development, the development of his ability to communicate, etc. And then there is enough space to write down, for each month, information about your own child, an exceptional, beloved and inimitable individual. It is not a question of comparing the average child, or what a child 'should' already know, with our own child, because every child is an inimitable being who is loved for who he or she is, not for what he or she has already achieved. Each child develops at his or her own pace and has every right to do so. The description of developmental characteristics covers only what is common to all children. What young parents want to know is what they can expect in the coming months. <p/> The average developmental characteristics of each month of infant and child age will give parents enough support to also assess what is worth writing about their child. In addition, there is enough space in the first memory book to stick baby's photos, first drawings, descriptions of first funny events, a list of birthday party invitees and so on. <p/> What was it like when I was little? They hardly speak, children want to know what it was like when they were little. They are not at all bothered by the thought that they are, in fact, still small. And they are right - why not look forward to every new step in their development? Just watch a child proudly comparing their 'big' hand with the tiny handprint and sole you have glued in their first memory book! A photo of his first cot will spark a conversation about how he used to sleep and how big he is now. And the photo of him lying next to his first teddy bear will remind you how tiny his body used to be... Children will also love looking at their memory book because each page features cute and playful characters from his childhood - teddy bears, ladybirds, butterflies, elves, Santa Claus, pets... <p/> Jealousy of the baby Such memories, written in the book and in the photographs, can also help a child facing the arrival of a baby brother or sister, a baby who is not difficult to be jealous of because he or she needs so much love and care from their parents. In the conversation around his first memoir, we can show him that, even though he is now a ""bigger"" child, he needed and received all that love and attention too. Perhaps it will be easier for the child to understand that a sibling will one day be as big and independent as he or she is now, that he or she will become a playmate and companion. <p/> If we also write and furnish the baby's first memory book for a sibling, the older child will be able to keep up-to-date with how his or her sibling is developing. Parents will also benefit from such a comparison, because it is nice to know that a child's development always ends the same way, even if at times the moments seem to drag on forever, and at other times time seems to pass at an unbearable speed. <p/> First time at sea, first Christmas and New Year... Children find it difficult to understand the dimension of time - what was six months ago and what will be two years from now. They live primarily in the present moment, which is why it is so difficult for them to wait, even if ""just a little"". At three years old, last summer, when we were at the seaside, seems infinitely far away. Don't be surprised if he doesn't remember anything more than if he had never been to the seaside at all. Because for him, last summer really is very far away. It happened in the previous third of the child's life. If you are thirty years old, that would mean to you that it happened ten years ago... Joking aside. It's much easier for children (and adults too) to reminisce when they see photographs. That's why the first memory book has a special space dedicated to records and photos of your child's first Christmas and New Year, first trip to the seaside and first birthday. Looking at the photos together often brings back memories that you have not kept, but that grandma or grandpa, or sometimes the child, may surprise you and tell you something else that can take you back to happy times. <p/> A gift for a child or grandparent? You can also write and furnish your first memory book almost in secret. Perhaps one day you could give it to your child as a very special gift, telling him or her how much you have always loved him or her and how much you have cared for his or her happiness. You could give it to your child when they come of age, when they get married or when their first child is born. <p/> Or your first memory book can be a nice gift for your grandparents. It will be nice if you write it and give it to them already completed. Or you can give it blank, unfilled. Grandparents usually have more time than a young family, and they are very eager to have contact with their child. They may enjoy filling out their first memory book. The grandparents will also find the record of their child's development in the book helpful, because many grandparents, after many years of being young parents themselves, have forgotten what it is like to have a baby and how babies develop into toddlers. It is a great pleasure for them to recall this old knowledge, and also the memories of their own children that come to mind. <p/> A gift at birth It is also a good idea to give a first memory book to the parents-to-be or the new parents. You don't always have to give knitted slippers and two bodysuits, and there are bound to be a few teddy bears before the new parents can buy the first one to their liking. It is much better to be original and give a first memory book that the young family will enjoy for years after they have received it. <p/> Get your first memory book as a gift with a new subscription to My Toddler magazine."

31	When you receive a baby in your arms, it's like receiving a book as a gift. Its pages are still unwritten and shine into our eyes with the beauty of sunshine. With every breath of a child's life, a line is written in the book of life. How thick the book will be at the end, we do not know. We only know that we must keep it carefully and open it anew every day and write in it as many beautiful moments, hugs, kisses, smiles, etc. as we can. But the pen does not run smoothly through all the pages of the book. Every now and then a paw drops on a blank sheet of paper, the edge of the page curls up, or the pen just scribbles stiff words... It is not always easy for her, but we are here to stand by her side, to hold her light when she is in the dark and her umbrella when she is standing in the rain. <p/> To make sure that the pen writes as many verses as possible and that life brings joy, happiness and success to your child's book, the 4me Centre offers the following programmes:	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

The whole SloWolf team gathered and presented the activities and products carried out, and the financial part of the project was also scrutinised. <p/> Visit of the external Life+ monitors from Slovenia and the monitors from the European Commission (photo U.M.) <p/> The monitors also had a closer look at the equipment for collecting non-invasive wolf samples during winter tracking, which is distributed annually among hunters and other volunteers during field work. (photo: U.M.) <p/> In a series of five facilitated workshops held in January and February 2011, we invited representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions representing stakeholders related to wolf conservation in Slovenia to draft a proposal for the Action Plan for Wolf Management in Slovenia. More information about the workshops can be found here. <p/> The hunting season for wolves started in October, following a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. As it takes an enormous amount of work to catch a live wolf, both by researchers and by the hunters who help us (on average over 100 field days for one successful catch), every, otherwise legal, kill of a collared wolf would negate a lot of the effort put in, and would also deprive everyone of the interesting and valuable information that collars provide. <p/> In good light conditions, which allow a reliable shot, the collars are visible - the band is light green (Vojko), brown (Slavc) or light blue (Luka), and all the battery cases are white. The list of hunting families in whose hunting grounds the three wolves equipped so far this year are as follows: LD Bukovje, LD Col, LD Črna jama, LD Divača, LD Dolenja vas, LD Draga, LD Gradišče Košana, LD Hrenovice, LD Javornik Postojna, LD Kozina, LD Kras Dutovlje, LD Loški Potok, LD Materija, LD Nanos, LD Obrov, LD Pivka, LD Planina, LD Podgorje, LD Prestranek, LD Raša Štorje, LD Ribnica, LD Rižana, LD Senožeče, LD Sodražica, LD Tabor Sežana, LD Vojkovo, LD Vreme and LD Vrhe Vrabče (see also maps of wolf movements to date). In addition, members of neighbouring LDs should also pay special attention, as we expect the movement areas of both packs to increase slightly during the winter. The young wolf Luka could also have left his natal pack by this time and headed to another area. <p/> Regular wolf culling has started. Watch out for wolves with collars! <p/> On Friday, 6.5.2011, a wolf was caught near Slavnik in Primorska and fitted with a GPS-GSM telemetry collar. The male wolf weighed 39.5 kg and was about 7 years old. He was named Vojko. He tolerated the training well and retreated to the nearby forests shortly after his release. The results of the biometric measurements are available on the wolf ID card page. <p/> The wolf was caught on the edge of the territory of the ""Slavnik"" pack. A wolf named Brin was also hunted nearby and collared in April 2010, but was subsequently killed half a year later. Genetic analyses and data from the telemetry collar will be sent in the coming days to determine the social status of the wolf Vojko. <p/> TV Slovenia's Education Programme has produced a documentary on wolves in Slovenia entitled ""Wolf"" as part of the series ""Biotopes"". The film also presents the activities taking place within the SloWolf project. TV Slovenia broadcast the film on 30 April 2011 and you can watch it online at this link: <p/> We have prepared an analysis of the effectiveness of wolf culling in reducing damage to domestic animals. In addition to the analysis of the impact of wolf culling on the level of damage in Slovenia, the report also reviews the results of foreign research on the effectiveness of wolf culling in Europe and North America. The report also includes management recommendations on the implementation of wolf culling and the prevention of damage to domestic animals. <p/> Participants in the workshop included representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions (Faculty of Biotechnology (experts in agronomy, forestry, biology and zootechnics), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Nature Conservation Institute, Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, Forest Institute, Dinaricum Association, Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry, Association for Animal Liberation and Animal Rights, Federation of Small Animal Breeders' Associations, Special Purpose Hunting Grounds and the Kolpa Landscape Park), representing interest groups related to wolf conservation in Slovenia. The main purpose of the workshops is to first define, through a participatory approach involving all stakeholders, the threats and challenges to wolf management in Slovenia and coexistence with people. In the following workshops, we will try to find the most effective solutions that will allow both the long-term existence of wolves and the reduction of conflicts and improve coexistence between wolves and people. <p/> In our management planning we will also follow the Guidelines for the Transboundary Management of Large Carnivore Populations in Europe, as wolves in Slovenia are only part of the larger Dinaric-Balkan population and are constantly crossing borders with neighbouring countries, especially Croatia. The first workshop was therefore also attended by representatives of the Croatian Institute for Nature Conservation, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia and the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb. <p/> Representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the Hunting Association of Slovenia, local associations of small stock breeders and associations against animal torture are also expected at the next two workshops on Thursday and Friday (3 and 4 February 2011). <p/> In the January issue of the magazine ""Lovec"" we published an article on the life of the wolf Tina, in which we summarise the 4-year follow-up of the wolf, which was fitted with a telemetry collar in 2007 after she accidentally got caught in a lynx trap. The article is available here: <p/> In order to present the public with as objective a picture as possible and to allow for a more constructive debate, the following link presents the position of the SloWolf project team on the culling of wolves in Slovenia: <p/> Over the course of the four-year project, we will be publishing four issues of a project newsletter, which we have named Wolf Herring. The main purpose of the newsletter is to keep you regularly informed about the results and planned activities of our ""wolf"" project. The content will follow the red thread of the project, which is to ensure the long-term conservation of the wolf population, its prey and habitats, and the coexistence of humans and wolves in Slovenia, in an interesting way. We have printed 700 copies, which we will distribute to libraries and other centres in the wolf range to reach as many readers as possible from the local population in the area.The electronic version of the newsletter can be found here. <p/> Training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb <p/> Within the Life + SloWolf project, the Forest Institute (ZGS), Department of Forest Animals and Hunting, organised a training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species, this time with a focus on large carnivores. <p/> The training was held at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb (VF in ZG), both due to the unpreparedness of the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana to organise such training, and due to the experience of Croatian colleagues who regularly organise such training for their delegates. Due to the large number of delegates and the limited space in the secirnice of the Faculty in Zagreb, the training took place in two groups on 2 and 3 November 2010. The attendance was very good as practically all delegates assessing damage from large carnivores in the ZGS organisational units attended. We were also joined by the Director of ZGS Mr. Jošt Jakša, the Head of the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Marko Jonozovič, the Senior Adviser at the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Miha Marenče and the Head of the LPN Service of ZGS Mr. mag. Janko Mehle and some colleagues from the Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Ljubljana. <p/> The participants of the educational workshop were welcomed at the beginning by the Dean of the Faculty of Biology in Zagreb, and then we went through the comprehensive lectures of Mr. Tomaž Skrbinšek (Department of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Ljubljana), Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak, Dr. Andrea Gudan Kurilj and Dr. Janis Kusak. Dr. Ana Beck (all from the Faculty of Science, Zagreb), upgraded their knowledge in the field of recognition of signs of killing and consumption of prey of large carnivores, premortem and postmortem changes on carcasses, and potentially dangerous diseases that can be transmitted by carcasses of killed animals. Mr Skrbinšek briefed the delegates on the procedures of saliva collection from carcasses of killed animals for DNA identification of wolves, which will start in 2011 in the framework of the SloWolf project. The first part of the training was in the form of lectures, and after lunch we went to the Faculty's dissection room. There, we consolidated the knowledge we had acquired through concrete cases, where we together examined several carcasses of sheep killed by wolves. <p/> Practical part of the training of the ZGS Damage Assessment Officers at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb with the lecturer Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak. (Photo: Rok Černe) <p/> In the early morning hours of 20 October 2010, a wolf ""Brin"", equipped with a GPS telemetry collar, was shot in a pasture in the vicinity of the settlement of Petrinje in the Kozina LD. <p/> The male was caught on 13.4.2010 in the area of Slavnik. During the telemetric monitoring, his pack was moving in the area from the Glinščice Valley near the border with Italy to Čičaria and Učka above Opatija in Croatia. <p/> Juniper was stalked in a pasture when five wolves attacked sheep. The collar was not seen by the captor in low light conditions. The male weighed 40 kg and was in good condition. He was shot as part of a regular wolf cull (12 wolves are scheduled to be cull in Slovenia between the beginning of October 2010 and the end of February 2011). Genetic analyses will be carried out in the coming days to determine whether Brin had the status of the alpha male of the pack. <p/> As part of Action A.4 - Assessment of wolf damage in agriculture, we have produced maps of wolf damage between 2003-2005, between 2007-2009, a map of the potential wolf range in Slovenia in the event of a spatial expansion of the wolf population, and a map showing the areas where wolf attacks on small livestock can be expected, given the current distribution of sheep. The maps are included in the final report of the campaign, which included a review and analysis of wolf damage in Slovenia. The report also includes management recommendations for reducing wolf damage."	News/Reporting	News/Reporting

43	Press releases <p/> Yesterday, Monday, 13 February 2012, in the meeting room of the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, a meeting of the Council for Improving the Safety of Citizens in the Municipality of Velenje was held. The meeting was chaired by the Chairman of the Council, the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje Bojan Kontič. <1. Opening hours of bars in the Municipality of Velenje 2. Accommodation of workers who will work on the TEŠ 6 project 3. Under the first agenda item (Opening hours of restaurants in the municipality of Velenje), the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, Mr Bojan Kontič, presented the dilemmas that arise in connection with extending the opening hours of restaurants, because on the one hand, citizens want peace and quiet at night, and young people want open restaurants where they can have fun. Extended opening hours are, of course, also important for catering businesses for business reasons. According to the Catering Act, the approval of opening hours for catering establishments is the responsibility of the local authority, which can also withdraw or not grant approval at all. <p/> Catering establishments serving food and drink (restaurants, pubs, cafés, patisseries, cafeterias, snack bars and bars), located in buildings with flats or in buildings in a residential area intended for living and ancillary activities, may only operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Operating outside these hours shall be considered as extended opening hours, for which the caterer must obtain the written consent of the local authority. The relevant local authority shall decide on this on the basis of the adopted criteria laid down in the Rules on the criteria for determining the extended opening hours of catering establishments and farms catering in the municipality of Velenje. The Rules lay down the procedures and conditions for obtaining approval for extended opening hours, as well as the procedures and conditions for withdrawing such approval. The Municipal Regulation also obliges caterers to carry out their activities in such a way that they do not disturb the environment. <p/> According to Alenka Rednjak, Head of the Investment and Development Office, the Municipality of Velenje is in the process of amending the municipal regulations to provide that the opinion of the district or local community in whose area the restaurant is located is to be taken into account when issuing a consent for extended opening hours. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič informed the attendees that the Velenje Police Station had submitted two proposals to the Velenje Municipality for the cancellation of the extended opening hours, namely for Bar Max Klub, s.p. (Šaleška cesta 3, Velenje), where the opening hours are Monday to Thursday from 10 pm to 1 am and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 5 am, and for Pit Stop bar (Celjska cesta 2, Velenje), where the bar is open 24 hours. According to the Velenje Police Station, the above-mentioned bars have had to intervene several times due to public order violations, including fights, and occasionally the detention of offenders. <p/> Drago Alenc, Commander of the Velenje Police Station, explained that due to the extended opening hours of the restaurants, problems and violations occur mainly in the vicinity of the Red Hall, where the restaurants are open until 3 or 5 am. Police officers note that after the closure of the Red Hall, guests go to the Pit Stop bar, which is across the road by the petrol station. For the safety of pedestrians on the road, police officers are repeatedly carrying out enhanced traffic controls on this stretch of road, as pedestrians are crossing the road in this part of the carriageway, which is not illuminated and in a place where there is no marked pedestrian crossing. Police officers note that many pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol. The Velenje Police Station considers that the frequent violations, which are mostly recorded at night on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, are a problem for public order, traffic and general safety in this part of the city. <p/> The Director of the Municipal Administration, Andreja Katič, pointed out that the request for more police officers should be re-submitted to the line ministry. <p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that on the basis of the proposal of the Velenje Police Station to cancel the extended opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar, the Velenje Municipality had cancelled the consent for the extended opening hours of the above-mentioned establishments.<p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that the Municipality of Velenje had also cancelled the opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar. The owner of the Pit stop bar appealed against the revocation of the consent and, following the new measures, provided more adequate security for the bar and was granted a new consent for extended opening hours by the municipality. However, Bar Max Klub, s.p., only has consent for extended opening hours at weekends, when concerts are held in the bar. <p/> The mayor pointed out that the municipality had not yet made a final decision on the issue of consents for extended opening hours for the bars in the Red Hall Velenje, as they wanted to find a compromise with the owners of the bars so that they could be open at night and at the same time would not violate the Act on Public Order and the Ordinance on General Order in the Municipality of Velenje. <p/> Under the second item on the agenda (Accommodation of workers to be employed in the TEŠ 6 project), the Director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Unit 6 Project, Mr. Miran Žgajner presented the project, which represents a new chapter in Slovenia's energy supply and is currently Slovenia's largest energy investment. It is a modern, highly efficient unit that will gradually replace the existing units. He stressed that Unit 6 is a replacement and not an additional generating facility, which is being built to provide more environmentally friendly electricity at a competitive price. The construction of Block 6 does not represent an additional encroachment on the site, as it will be built on the existing site. Of course, all the measures required by the Environmental Impact Report will also be implemented during construction. The construction of the 600 MW Block 6 will take until 2014. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič pointed out that the members of the Council, who act as a preventive body in this environment, would like to know in particular the number of workers who will be living in the valley during the construction of the block. In this way, the institutions could also prepare themselves for a larger number of clients. <p/> Mag. Mr Žgajner said that during the most intensive works, there would be between 1,500 and 1,800 workers on site, most of them foreigners. Those responsible for the construction of the unit have further increased security on site, as each worker will now have his or her own photo identification card. This will limit free movement on the site and ensure that workers can be properly identified off-site. In the coming days, Termoelektrarna Šoštanj will also conclude an agreement with PV Invest on mutual cooperation in organising accommodation for workers. <He added that road traffic to the construction site will be routed in such a way as to minimise disruption, and attempts will be made to bring as much material as possible by rail and at night. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič stressed the importance of the good cooperation of the Velenje Police Station and the Velenje Health Centre with those responsible for the Block 6 project. This is also due to the good and timely information provided to the police officers about the mode of transport of the cargo. The police officers ensure the safety of both our citizens and foreigners who come to work here. <p/> The Director of the Velenje Health Centre, Jože Zupančič, is negotiating with those in charge at Alstom about the provision of health services for foreigners coming to work in the valley. He said that the health centre will make sure that an emergency medical team will be available as close as possible to the construction site during the operating hours. A new doctor has also been recruited at the Šoštanj Health Station and will be available to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients. <p/> The Block 6 Project Director concluded by stressing that if the Government of the Republic of Slovenia does not adopt the Act on the State Guarantee for the Loans for Block 6 of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant by tomorrow, 15 February 2012, the Block 6 project may also come to a halt. <p/> Under Other Business, the Director of the Centre for Social Work Velenje, Zlatka Srdoč Majer, presented current information on the Centre's activities. It is encouraging to note that recently there have been fewer incidents of domestic violence and fewer applications for social assistance. However, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the new social organisation will have to wait until the end of March. By then, they expect to have issued all the decisions for 3 140 applicants.

49	The history of hunting is as old as mankind. However, like man, the meaning of hunting has changed over time. Today, hunting is no longer a struggle for human survival, but is primarily about protecting nature and preserving wildlife so that we can preserve both for our descendants. <p/> Many people do not understand our mission, so in our LD Fram we have decided to present part of our activities to the people under the slogan Take care of the birds. <p/> So in 2011, we took part in a fair in the courtyard of the castle in the municipality of Rače - Fram with our presentation. Since we have 51 members, we symbolically made just as many bird feeders, for which wood was donated by farmers from our area. They also thought our idea was original and good. Then, with the help of the carpenters in our LD, we made the bird feeders. We also lit our logo on each one to remind the recipients of our charity. Of course, we didn't forget the bird feed we also asked for. <p/> Our LD has hunting horn players who take care of hunting music, which is part of hunting culture, and it was to them that the honour belonged to play the opening melodies and announce the start of the fair. We decorated our stand appropriately, as befits hunters, with our emblem, and we also provided food and drinks. <p/> The response of the visitors was very positive, as the food and feeders ran out quite quickly. We were also pleased, as we made contact with people and introduced them to our mission, our care for nature and wildlife.	News/Reporting	News/Reporting
53	VIRUSES IN CHILDREN <p/> Winter time and cold temperatures are the perfect opportunity for some viruses to spread quickly. These include viruses that cause gastrointestinal infections. The most common causes of intestinal infections in childhood are rotaviruses. Intestinal infection is manifested by diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, cramps and fever. <p/> CAUSERS <p/> The most common causes of diarrhoea in childhood are viruses, rotaviruses being the most common. Rotavirus infections occur every year, all year round, although more people are usually ill during the cold months. During these months, rotaviruses cause infection mainly in children up to 2 years of age.Entericadenoviruses cause diarrhoea and fever lasting for several days, with or without vomiting, in infants and young children, and may be accompanied by signs of a common cold. Of the bacterial agents, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are the most common, and diarrhoea can also be caused by parasites. <p/> SYMPTOMS <p/> The typical clinical picture of a child with a gastrointestinal tract infection is defecation and vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, headache and muscle pain. The problems last for a day or two. A child with a gastrointestinal infection, vomiting and diarrhoea loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes. Fluid loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. <p/> Signs of dehydration include: thirst, dry mouth, bright red lips, sore eyes, less urination. Then the child may become markedly tired or irritable, breathing is deep and rapid, as is the heart rate. In a dehydrated baby, the large lobe of the head drops, the urine may be darker and smaller in volume, the baby becomes more drowsy or irritable. Such a condition definitely requires immediate medical attention. <p/> TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION <p/> Infection spreads easily between children because even a small number of viruses are enough to make a person infected and ill. Viruses are transmitted by contact with an infected person, by touching toys or surfaces that have viruses on them, or by eating contaminated food or drink. When a child is ill, viruses are shed in high concentrations in the faeces for a few days to 14 days, or longer. During this time, apparently healthy children are infectious to the surrounding area. <p/> TREATMENT <p/> Fluid and electrolyte replacement is very important in gastrointestinal viral infections. The child should drink plenty of fluids (tea, isotonic drinks, soups, etc.) several times a day, in small amounts, and fizzy drinks are discouraged. Various oral rehydration solutions are also available in pharmacies. If the child is breastfed, breastfeeding should be continued. As this is a viral and not a bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, the infection should not be treated with antibiotics. <p/> WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR <p/> A child with an intestinal infection loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhoea. This loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Therefore, insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. A doctor should be seen if the condition does not improve after two days.A doctor's visit is also necessary for dehydration. <p/> PREVENTING TRANSMISSION <p/> Frequent and correct hand washing is very important. In particular after using the toilet or changing nappies, and before preparing food and before eating, hand washing should be regular and thorough. Foods eaten without pre-cooking should be thoroughly cleaned with hygienic water. Children attending kindergarten or school should return to the collective at least 24 hours after the cessation of diarrhoea or vomiting, preferably after three days. <p/> DOES CEPIVO exist? <p/> There is a vaccine against rotavirus infection. It is not given by injection, but is injected into the mouth. Two or three doses are needed, with at least 4 weeks between each dose. It is intended for young children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. There are insufficient data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in older children. Research to date has shown that protection against rotavirus infection by vaccination lasts for at least 2 years.	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
55	"Yesterday's news from the municipality about the dismissal of two vice-mayors is still reverberating around Ravenna. It is likely that the Mayor's decision was also the result of public pressure. One of these was published in Dnevnik 3 days ago, where Mojca gave a detailed description of the situation in the municipality and its staffing, which is very true. Mojca Marot's article is published in full. <p/> In Ravenna, more and more people are dissatisfied with the staffing of the SDS mayor Tomaž Roženo, as they have loudly and clearly pointed out at the recent protests. ""We have had enough of clientelism and nepotism, of immoral and unethical moves by our mayor,"" was one of the slogans at the only protest in Carinthia so far, which took place in Ravenna. After we wrote about the functions and remuneration that vice-mayors receive for their work across Slovenia, and highlighted the outcry from young Social Democrats in Ravne, several people from Carinthia who attended the recent protest drew our attention to this slogan, which was lost in the crowd. <p/> The two vice-mayors are brother-in-law and sister-in-law <p/> In a recent article, we mentioned that many people feel that three vice-mayors in Ravenna are too many for the municipality, given its size and the professionalism of Mayor Tomaž Roženo, and that they are also costing the municipal budget a lot. Rožžen assured us that he does not intend to give up any of them, as he believes they are crucial for consensus in the municipal council. But many consider this statement to be far-fetched. Two of them, Milan Škafar and Vera Krajnc, as Ravenč citizens have pointed out to us, are in any case members of his SDS party and, incidentally, they are also related to each other. Kranjc is said to be the sister of Škafar's wife, which means that they are brother-in-law and sister-in-law, while the third deputy mayor, Peter Oder, who runs the Eurosplet company (the Carinthian Student Service, which he and Rozen founded in 1999), is also a ""mayor's"" cadre. According to the Supervizor website, more than €3.6 million has flowed into this company from various public institutions over the last ten years, but the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption concludes that there have been no irregularities. In any case, the 22-member municipal council of Ružen is made up of 10 SDS party representatives, and if we take into account all those who belong to the so-called coalition, it is clear that Ružen does not need a consensus at all. <p/> Not political framing, but a reward for good work? <p/> ""His actions are immoral and unethical, to say the least, and the main concern of both the mayor and the councillors is that they are appointing people loyal to their political option to key positions, i.e. to management positions in public institutions. Half of their relatives have already got a job this way,"" the people of Ravenč are angry. They are particularly surprised by the reincarnation of the Vice-Mayor Škafar, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his own party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is once again a member of the SDS party's executive committee. Incidentally, shortly after the local elections, passions were already running high on this issue at one of the municipal councils in Ravenna. SD councillor Zlatko Halilovič raised his voice against the appointment of three vice-mayors. ""We don't need three vice-mayors, unless it's political spoils for the SDS party,"" he said at the time, adding that councillors are accountable to all citizens, not just to the SDS party. <p/> SDS monopoly in public institutions <p/> The debate became even more heated when it came to appointing members to the boards of public institutions and companies, where Halilovič was joined by a few other supporters in protesting that they were dominated by SDS members. ""Are you going to change the law of physics so that one being can be in several places at the same time? Nine parties have made it to the council, not just SDS, so it is right to balance things"", Halilovic said at the time, referring to the apparent clientelism. The mayor and Krajnčeva dismissed the accusations, saying that just because someone is related to someone else does not mean that they do not have the right to be elected or delegated to an institution's council, moreover, it is a reward for good work, which was apparently also recognised by the voters. Yet it is strange that 23 of the 53 seats, almost half, on the boards of public institutions and companies are held by SDS members, some of whom have even been appointed to several boards at the same time. Robert Brezovnik and Dušan Dretnik also pointed this out, but were overruled by other members of the Elections and Appointments Commission. Surprisingly, even SDS councillor Enriko Plevnik was self-critical in the debate at the time. He said that ""the list is really strange"", while the Mayor said that the seats were distributed in proportion to the election results. These days, however, many people in Ravenna are very interested in who will occupy the director's chair of the Institute for Sport. The current first man of this institution, Aleksander Kotnik, also a councillor of the SDS in Ravenna, is moving to the helm of the music school. <p/> People are also wondering about the reincarnation of Milan Škafar, the Deputy Mayor, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his SDS party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is again a member of the party's executive committee. <p/> One of the vice-mayors, Peter Oder, who is also a director of Eurosplet, d. o. o., - Koroški Student Services, refused to comment on yesterday's decision. However, he was disturbed by Saturday's article, in which we wrote that, according to the Supervizor website, €3.6 million had been transferred from various public institutions to Eurosplet - Koroški Student Services over the last ten years. In his view, this figure is misleading and casts him and the Mayor in a bad light. ""Of this amount, approximately €2.84 million represents direct earnings of students. However, the recognised costs to Eurosplet over ten years amounted to only €128,000 or €12,800,"" explains Oder. He adds that around two thirds of the income generated by public institutions is generated outside the municipality of Ravne, while the recognised costs of doing business with all public institutions in the municipality average just €4,300 per year."

88	Coronary heart disease <p/> Share: <p/> Coronary heart disease is a condition that develops when the coronary arteries, the main blood vessels that supply the heart with food and oxygen, become damaged or diseased. Coronary artery disease is most often caused by plaque deposits (plaques), which contain cholesterol. <p/> Plaque on the walls of the arteries narrows the artery and reduces blood flow, which means that the heart receives insufficient oxygen and nutrients. Reduced blood flow can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. When a blood vessel is completely blocked, a heart attack can occur. But this never happens from today to tomorrow. In fact, coronary heart disease is a disease that takes years and decades to develop before it shows its teeth. For a long time, the patient has no symptoms and is not even aware of it, which is why it is so dangerous. Because it develops slowly, the patient is also unaware of the changes in his or her lungs, which he or she most often attributes to ageing. Then, suddenly, he is struck by a heart attack (another name for myocardial infarction). That is why it is important to protect ourselves against coronary heart disease while we have time, while our actions will be most effective. The recipe for this is well known: healthy living or lifestyle changes: a healthier diet with less fat, good quality fats, more fresh vegetables and fruit, lots of smaller meals, chewing food for a long time, more fish and less red meat, but also less alcoholic beverages, no smoking and as much exercise as possible. It's a recipe we all know, but it can be hard to follow. <p/> If the coronary arteries are narrowed, they cannot supply the heart with the blood that gives it oxygen. When the heart is beating strongly, for example during physical activity or if we are under severe stress, this lack of oxygenated blood is particularly dangerous. In the beginning, poor blood flow will not cause any major problems. However, as the plaque builds up and the coronary arteries have less and less flow, the patient will have various health problems. One of the best known is chest pain, a tightness or squeezing, as if someone were squeezing your chest. This pain is usually caused by the physical or mental stress mentioned above. Women typically feel the pain slightly differently from men: as a stabbing and very sharp pain in the abdomen, back or arm. A fairly typical warning sign is shortness of breath. If we walk up some stairs that not long ago we could jump up and down without any problems, but now we are short of breath, we should be alert and tell our doctor. Extreme tiredness, exhaustion, can also be a sign of illness. <p/> When the pain is very severe, do not wait. You should see a doctor immediately. It will be best if such a patient is taken straight to the emergency room. Time is very precious in such cases and timely and correct action can save a life.

104	"Use your face instead of a joystick! <p/> Until now, online game players have been using a joystick, mouse and keyboard - what if you could use your face to control the game for a change? This cool new idea is now available for the first time in the form of Red Bull Formula Face - turn on your webcam, relax your facial and neck muscles, tilt your head, blink and take the first turn with turbo acceleration. <p/> The new online game is based on the latest technology, where you use your face to navigate around the track. It's a world premiere. The user uses a webcam to track their facial expressions. The game is free, suitable for both PC and Mac, does not need to be downloaded to your computer and can be tested at www.redbullformulaface.com. <p/> Red Bull Formula Face does away with the joystick altogether. It used to be about the player's manual dexterity to win or lose, but now all you need is a webcam and your face. A wink to turbo acceleration and a head tilt to cornering? It's easy with Red Bull Formula Face. You're just a few steps away from your first interactive race: turn on the webcam, choose your favourite character, personalise it with your own photo, choose a Formula 1, NASCAR or rally car and your personal avatar is ready to go! There are three different levels to battle against the computer. <p/> The facial control technology developed for Red Bull Formula Face is both simple and revolutionary: tilt your head left or right to manoeuvre your car on the track. The aim of the game, which has a paper-like appearance, is to score as many points as possible. Flicking your eyes triggers turbo accelerations that can leave your opponent in a puff of smoke. You can activate the add-ons you collect during the game at any time, and they give you a decisive advantage: a pair of wings to propel you far forward, monster tyres to run over your opponent, or glue and scissors to stop them. <p/> Photo bonuses give you lots of extra points and guaranteed laughs: they start as soon as you hit one of the cameras hovering over the track. They reward the player who mimics the facial expressions shown as closely as possible. You can save the photos you take to your Red Bull Formula Face profile and share them with your friends on Facebook. The result of the last race is also posted - and you can bet that your friends will race to beat you and post the craziest photos they can. For those who are good at handwork, you can download a PDF of your avatar and build an origami racer to take to the table. <Stefan Becker from BUZZIN MONKEY, the company responsible for the concept and creation of Red Bull Formula Face, had this to say about the innovative new game: ""For the first time ever, you can control the game without any special hardware such as a console or joystick - all you need is your face and facial expressions - and it's all tightly integrated with the social network. ""Red Bull Formula Face is available in multiple languages and can be played worldwide. <p/> Let's face it - joysticks are a thing of the past - facial expressions are the future! So put on your racing face and visit www.redbullformulaface.com for the very first experience of playing an online game using facial expressions. <p/> What exactly do they do? Don't worry, they're not crazy, they're playing Red Bull Formula Face - the first online game where you control your car with your facial expressions - smiling activates special effects, if you shut up,..."

123	Renče during World War I <p/> A captured moment of the demolition of the Renče church bell tower during World War I in 1916. The Austrian High Command decided that the Renče church bell tower and the chimneys of the surrounding brickworks should be demolished so that they would not serve as an orientation point for the Italians. After the fall of Gorizia in the Sixth Battle of the Soča on 9 August 1916, Renče found itself in close proximity to the military operations on the Soča Front. The Austro-Hungarian line of defence ran only a few kilometres away from Renče: over St. Mark's Hill above Šempeter, the hills of Vrtojben and Biljen, crossing the Vipava River at Miren and ascending to the Karst past Miren Castle. The Italians wanted to cross the relatively low hills into the Vipava valley. More shells fell on Renče every day, and the village slowly began to turn into a pile of rubble. ... <p/> Renče Square during the First World War. The houses and the church show the effects of the bombing. <p/> Those inhabitants who had not yet taken refuge had to leave their hometowns in the greatest haste. From the newspapers of the time, we learn that they stayed in various places (Ljubljana, Novo mesto, Zagorje ob Savi, Loidelstahl in Lower Austria, Hollern, Gertaus and Pachfurt in the Bruck district of Lithuania) and camps (Wagna, Bruck, Steinklamm, Mlatz in Bohemia) in the then Austro-Hungarian monarchy. <p/> The interior of the Rhenish church after the demolition of the bell tower in 1916. <p/> Church and secular authorities also had to move. From August to October 1916, the parish priest of Rennes, Valentin Pipan, was stationed in Vižmarje near Št. The Renče parish had its seat on Rimska cesta in Ljubljana in October 1916, and from May to October it was in Št. Vid above Ljubljana. In December 1917, the parish was temporarily located in Ajdovščina, and the parish priest Valentin Pipan moved from Renče to Vedrijan. <p/> View of Renče from the bell tower looking north.

127	"Why a GTi when there's an XY <p/> Peugeot has offered two special versions of its little 208. Choose the GTi, or the considerably cheaper XY, which, despite its slightly weaker power unit, meets the needs of dynamic drivers. <p/> Nomen est omen, a name is a sign, goes the Latin proverb. Janez Novak is the name of a hard-working Slovene who does not take the right to spend his holidays on a towel by the sea, who is willing to change all his nails for the victory of our basketball players, who is happy with two beers, now and then, he also manages, following the example of ""the rich ones"", to outsmart the state on a levy or squeeze reimbursement from the insurance company for the damage caused to his car by a stranger in the car park in front of his best neighbour. <p/> Not a cliché <p/> With the car code XY, similar clichés might be in the foreground. Ixipsilon it is. But they aren't. The Peugeot 208 XY is actually a very nice refresher, and something of an example that there is still a reserve even in the classic B-segment and that taking buyers between crossovers is not necessarily the right solution, not even for their wallets. The special equipment and extras of the little Peugeot give it a considerable boost on the street. Different front light cues with distinctive white daytime running lights, 17-inch wheels, rear spoiler, chrome inserts including logos, a bold choice of purple for the name... <p/> Parallels with the chunky GTi <p/> Inside, the premium sporty feel is also very much in evidence thanks to the seats, the led lighting and trim, the large screen of the powerful, at times over-complicated infotainment, the dual-zone climate control, the self-dimming mirror, the metal gear lever (a very uncomfortable feeling in weather extremes)... there are plenty of other parallels with the chunkiest of the litter, the GTI. <p/>Both are three-door only, both have wider tracks and a stiffer chassis. And both have unusually positioned gauges for the sake of clarity, so you sit up high, higher than is appropriate for a car inspired by its illustrious predecessors, because, like the GTI, the XY has an ancestor in one of the more civilian versions of the little ripper from 25 years ago. <p/> 156 hp the right choice <p/> So the 208 XY has plenty of sporty driving talent, so despite the diesel option, it's a real sin not to be powered by the (cheaper! ) 1.6 THP engine. Fortunately for the tester, it is. You could say that the powertrain was very lively most of the time, i.e. during normal journeys and during known distances. Good consumption, torque at low revs, good cooperation with the gearbox. When it had to, the car left the figure in the drawer and became a little wrecker, 115 kilowatts at low weight is just not that easy. It didn't shy away from corners either, the chassis and small steering wheel making it easy to handle even close to the limits of physics. It's almost a sin to write, but in a corner it was even more unrelenting than the much sportier RCZ. <p/> A thoroughbred aristocratic underclass yet very talented, this XY. When a GTI pulls up alongside it, there's no end to the embarrassment. Is the extra 40-odd horsepower of the GTI, which is the only real difference between the two cars, even worth almost four grand extra? Indeed, at a discount of just over 16 grand, with all that equipment and power for an iksipsilon, it seems like just the right ""deal."" And both sexes can enjoy it equally."	Promotion	Promotion
133	JEDRO: The sum of two insurance benefits from two insurance contracts cannot be taken into account because each of the insurance contracts constitutes an independent factual and legal basis for the dispute. As none of the amounts claimed exceeds the audit threshold, no audit is admissible. <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <p/> REFERENCE: The applicant claimed payment of insurance benefits under two insurance contracts. He claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the supplementary accident insurance, taken out at the same time as the compulsory motor insurance, and SIT 955 603 under the collective accident insurance. Thus, by his primary claim, he claimed payment of SIT 1 655 603, and by his subordinate claim he claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the first contract and EUR 5 356 under the second contract, in which the sum insured was denominated in DEM. The Court of First Instance ruled that the defendant must pay the plaintiff SIT 170 000, dismissed the primary claim in excess and further ruled on the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Second Instance allowed the applicant's appeal only in part by modifying the costs order, but otherwise dismissed it and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance. <p/> The review was delivered to the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and served on the defendant, who did not reply. <p/> The review is not allowed. <p/> According to Article 367(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 73/2007 ZPP - UPB3), a review is admissible in property disputes if the value of the contested part of the second instance judgment exceeds the amount of EUR 4,172.926 (formerly SIT 1,000,000). The applicant has indicated an amount of SIT 1,485,603 (now EUR 6,199.31) as the review value of the dispute, but such a definition is not correct for the purpose of determining the review value of the dispute. It is the sum of two amounts which he was unsuccessful in the litigation: the rejected amount of SIT 530 000 (now EUR 2 211,65) in respect of the first insurance contract which he himself had concluded and the total rejected amount of SIT 955 603 (now EUR 3 987,66) in respect of the collective accident insurance. The sum cannot be taken into account because each insurance contract is independent, concluded at different times and with different content, and therefore the contracts also constitute different factual and legal bases for the dispute. Since the condition laid down in Article 41(1) of the CCP in conjunction with Article 39 of the CCP for aggregating the amounts in dispute is not met, the value of each individual claim must be taken into account under the second paragraph of the same Article. <p/> None of the amounts mentioned exceeds the audit threshold. Therefore, pursuant to Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Appeal decided on the applicant's unauthorised revision as set out in the operative part of the present decision, which also includes a decision on the applicant's claimed revision costs.

155	"Opening address <p/> The Inter-Municipal Administration of the municipalities of Bovec, Kobarid and Tolmin, with its seat in Bovec, was established in mid-2006 by the Decree on the establishment of a joint municipal administration body ""Inter-Municipal Administration of the municipalities of Bovec, Kobarid and Tolmin"". The Decree, which was discussed and adopted separately by the municipal councils of the three founding municipalities, represents an additional element of cooperation between the three municipalities. With the establishment of the joint municipal administration, the three municipalities of the Sopo region have also formally established cooperation in areas where it makes sense and, above all, is rational. <p/> With the aim of reducing costs and streamlining operations, the Inter-Municipal Inspection was established as an internal organisational unit within the Inter-Municipal Administration to perform the administrative and professional tasks of the municipal administrations of the founding municipalities. It performs the tasks of municipal inspection, municipal road inspection and municipal policing for the founding municipalities, as well as other tasks in accordance with the regulations of the respective municipalities. Due to the nature of the tasks performed for the municipalities by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate is also the infraction authority of the founding municipalities, and its authorised persons conduct the infraction proceedings and decide on infractions defined as such by laws and municipal ordinances, according to the local jurisdiction of each municipality. This is the main reason why we want your active participation in our work. Your informed comments, opinions and suggestions will enable us to carry out our work better and more efficiently, and to bring it closer to you, to the citizens, and to all occasional and casual visitors to the Upper Posočje region."

How many women are touched by this is a story in itself. But no matter which route is taken, there is always a warning not to do it in areas where there is a wound on the skin. <p/> Before we hit the shelves with teeth whitening products in our quest for a shiny, white smile, it's a good idea to think about, or consult a dentist about, which types of tooth staining actually bother us. Whether it is external staining caused by smoking, eating highly pigmented foods such as coffee, tea, red wine, etc., or internal staining, which can be caused by certain medications (e.g. tetracyclines in antibiotics) and ageing. <p/> During the Lent Festival, specifically from 1 to 6 July, a Healthy Smile Workshop will take place at the Art Kamp venue. Participants will be given a free live demonstration of the correct technique for using a toothbrush, and it will be a great opportunity to ask anything you have always wondered about healthy smiles but never had the chance to ask. All participants will receive a Curaprox CS 5460 ultra soft toothbrush and lots of useful information. Visit us in Maribor City Park! When? 1-5 July from 16h to 20h and 6 July from 10h to 13h. <p/> Have you ever been in the company of someone with bad breath? Have you ever suspected yourself of having halitosis? What did you do then? Chewed gum, ate a menthol candy? Rushed to the nearest toilet and immediately brushed your teeth? If we want to get around halitosis, then the various ""fragrance facades"" will not do us much good. We need to find out why. We need to find out where the bad breath is coming from. <p/> The causative agents of gingivitis are the bacteria in soft plaque, whose toxic secretions trigger inflammation after the body's immune response. When we approach the management of gingivitis, our attention is directed towards the causative agent. Logically, if we remove the causative agent, the inflammation will not occur. <p/> As part of the Youth Week, which will take place in Kranj from 10 to 18 May 2013 and brings together many interesting, fun and useful events, a Healthy Smile Workshop will be held on 13 May in the Main Square. During the workshop, participants will be given a free 'live' demonstration of the correct techniques for using a toothbrush and interdental brush. It will also be a great opportunity to ask anything you have always wondered about maintaining a healthy smile, but haven't had the chance to ask. Join us on 13 May between 4 pm and 8 pm at the Main Square in Kranj. <p/> The mouth is a place that most people don't pay attention to in their daily oral hygiene routine. Flossing seems too time-consuming for many people, and brushes are considered too thick to clean their interdental spaces. With today's range of interdental toothbrushes, the latter is more of an excuse than the truth. <p/> Nowadays, it is not unusual to see a youngster with metal clasps shining from his teeth. Orthodontic treatment for growing children has become commonplace, and adults are opting for it too. Is it a fad or something else?"	List of Summaries/Excerpts	List of Summaries/Excerpts

185	"Seventh Heaven <p/> 25.01.2008 <p/> ""Fasten your seat belt and tighten your harness. Bring the helmet buckle together with the red buckle on your left seat belt strap. Lean into the carbon plate under your feet, but make sure you don't pinch the windscreen washer button, which is down there. We'll be bounced around a bit, but you can hold on to the roll cage with your hands,"" Nicolas explained to me as we prepared to start our adventure in the cockpit of the works car. <p/> No, it wasn't a flight in a military jet fighter, but the experience was very similar. Two adrenaline-fuelled men (well, at least one of them certainly was), both wearing flame-retardant pyjamas, helmets on their heads, strapped firmly into a clam seat, chatting in the cockpit of a hellishly expensive machine, surrounded by wires, switches, levers, monitors and carbon-fibre components. The hot, bare metal interior is permeated by the intoxicating, almost slightly intoxicating, smell of high-octane propellant. Mhm ... it really does smell like mint tea. How soothing and calming. It should also be prescribed drop by drop in pharmacies to all petrol addicted racing drivers and journalists. <p/> When the cabin door closes, a mad but sadly all too brief adventure begins, which is actually akin to driving a jet fighter. With one difference. That, of course, those of us who have had the opportunity to ride in a jet military aircraft are, after all, outnumbered by those of us who have sat behind the wheel or in the passenger seat of such a vehicle. In Russia, for many years now, it has been possible to take a ride in a MiG, and at the airport in Slovenj Grad it is also possible to buy a ticket for a ride in a south-eastern seagull. <p/> You cannot buy a ride in a Peugeot 307 WRC. For no money. Especially not a drive in a factory car, behind the wheel of which, just a few days ago, former World Rally Champion Marcus Gronholm was still sitting. Well, it's true that it is possible to buy a 307 WRC, or it will be possible next season. But it's also true that you will only be able to get your hands on this car with good connections and if you have at least a few virtuoso drives or if you can boast World Rally Championship-level results beforehand. <p/> Well, then, you are only a modest few hundred thousand euros away from buying such a hand-built racing car. The official figure, according to the men from Peugeot's motorsport department, is between 700 thousand and a million euros. But as one local racing driver said, once you've bought the car, all you need is a bucket and a cloth. At least to clean it every now and then, because you're not going to drive it anyway. Unless you've also bought, for almost the same amount, the spare parts and the big truckload of equipment needed to maintain such a race car. And you need a team of four or five mechanics (read engineers) who are skilled in maintaining, servicing and handling this sophisticated apparatus on four wheels. <p/> Jeep, the Peugeot 307 WRC is no longer just a racing car. It's a top-quality machine for achieving the highest goals. It is a machine for winning rallies in the World Rally Championship. <Let's get back in the car! Having driven a few laps of Peugeot's previous 206 world rally car on this same circuit two years ago, I kind of knew what to expect. Well, at least I had a hunch, unlike Avtomagazin's Dusan and Alyosha, who were about to be baptised by fire. Several years of active participation in the domestic rally championship, and two years as a co-driver before that, had given me the courage to sit in the passenger seat for the three demonstration laps, completely relaxed and smiling ear to ear. To see what a little Frenchman can do behind the wheel of a big Frenchman. Come on, poba, scare me if you can, I thought, because the man doesn't know anyway that I'm no stranger to racing and that I've driven a similar car on this very track. <p/> But my smile and my courage did not last long. Even though I knew that the car allowed everything that was already beyond the limits of what was possible and had nothing to do with the law of gravity and the rest of physics, after the first metres and the turns, I was breathless. No, I wasn't afraid that something would go wrong, because I trusted the driver, the car and the safety of the track. I was more amazed at what the car really could do and how docilely controllable it was in the hands of a true master. You know, when you're behind the wheel yourself, the first thing you want to do is to get the whole car back, because the Peugeot people wouldn't be too impressed if I tipped their toy on the roof. The question is whether, after such a misfortune, they would have let me get behind the wheel of, say, a 308 WRC in 2008. <p/> After half a lap I started to enjoy it again. With one eye on the track in front of us, I was watching to see if the owners had changed any of the corners in two years, and with the other eye I was watching Vouilloso twisting the steering wheel, when to change gear, when to apply the handbrake, how he was pressing on the accelerator, whether he was braking with his left foot or his right foot, and so on. Our two laps were over too quickly, but I was quite happy. It was a pure pleasure to drive, but the fact that we finished meant something completely different. That we were going to change seats. For the next three laps, the little Frenchman goes into the passenger seat, and I cram myself into a seat that is too narrow, the steering wheel too long. To give him back his dear soap. <p/> The journalist colleagues in front of me have already worn out the Michelin racing tyres for the gravel, so Nicolas motions for me to pit. <p/> ""Let's get a fresh set of tyres and refuel,"" he says, and it occurs to me that sometimes it's not a bad idea to be last in line. New tyres! Yes, when I'm racing alone, I hear that word too rarely, unfortunately. Meanwhile, I pull the Peugeot into the red service area and the engineers roll out a set of new tyres from the big service truck, which is resplendent with stars and wreaths indicating the number of World Championship wins. Mhm, just for me. And I'm enjoying every moment. <p/> The vehicle is lifted onto four special pedestals by two cranes and all four wheels are taken off at the same time. The four of them struggle to replace them and all I hear behind the wheel is the shrill beeping of the electric wheel-bolting guns. The head of engineering lifts the bonnet and plugs in a laptop computer, checking that the engine is OK. <p/> And I am still sitting behind the wheel, waiting for the team to do their job. The guys wipe down the windows, scrape the mud, soil and stones that have accumulated around the wheels off the undercarriage and, in the meantime, someone opens the tailgate and uses a pump to pump high-octane, highly flammable, fast-burning, volatile racing petrol into the car's fuel tank. <p/> Mama mia, if only moments like that lasted forever! Can you imagine how soothing such a situation is for the ego of a casual and hobby racer from the sunny side of the Alps? ! Like valerian drops. Sitting in the factory car of a former world champion, with the team around you trying to prepare the car for your drive, while you chat about the car's special features with your co-driver, the guy who stunned the world this year with a great drive and top times in the Rally de Catalunya. Yah, and what good does that do him? He can still just be my co-driver! <p/> Joke aside: Nicolas Vouilloz is a nice man. The multiple world downhill mountain bike champion has a two-year contract with Peugeot. He competes in eight World Championship rallies in last year's 206 WRC under the Peugeot factory team. The world got to know him at this year's Rally de Catalunya, where he finished 10th overall and twice finished second on stages, once just three tenths of a second behind the winner. Talent! The driver of the future? Undoubtedly, as he was also behind multiple World Champion and reigning champion Peter Solberg and this year's champion Sebastjan Loeb. <p/> Nicolas tells me to pull the metal lever on the steering wheel quickly and hard towards me. The car twitches slightly and a big orange R appears on the screen in front of the driver. I move the same lever away from the steering wheel. I pull the lever. Position 1. First gear. Let's go. Slowly to the racetrack. I look at my co-driver, who knows exactly what I'm interested in. <p/> He just nods his head. You can do it! Greeemooooooooo! Gaaaas! Jihaaaaaaa! The cake goes off like a cannon. With two carbon rings on the steering wheel, you shift up and down with just the finger of one hand. It's just like Formula 1, but instead of buttons on the steering wheel, there's a ring. Why? Because you have to turn the steering wheel rapidly as the car slides sideways through corners, and the gearshift button is always close at hand. That way, the steering wheel is always in place in any position. Where you need it. <p/> After the first lap, my co-driver opened the door to a world of heaven by moving the knob on the centre console two laps. He switched the engine electronics programme from the stage position to the post-stage position. The car breathed at the top of its lungs. The loud popping of the electronics of the turbine-powered vehicles was virtually inaudible in the car. Only the electronic hiss and shifting of the turbo gearbox, combined with the waterfalls of rocks loudly blasting the bottom of the car as the wheels spin idle under the sheer force of the power, caress the ears. <p/> The Peugeot soars over rough potholes. And every new gear is rewarded with a jolt to the shin and a new sticking of both occupants deep into the racing seat. By far the most impressive thing about the car is the insanely good chassis. It absorbs potholes you think will rip the wheels off and makes sure that even on long jumps, the car lands unfeelingly on the wheels. Crazy! The brakes are the same, stopping the car at 100 or 130 km/h before a corner as if it were cemented in place, after just a gentle touch of the racing shoe. And that's on gravel. <p/> I can say that I have never driven a more drivable, more beautiful, more docile and predictable car. The 307 WRC is a true special, a car that drives itself. Well, just the wrong way. In fact, it's the only car that really is driven by the driver, not the other way around. Once you get a taste of this machine, you realise that in a ""civilian"" car, the car is still being driven by the driver, who is trying very hard to keep it on the road. <p/> It is a testament to how tame this beast can be that, believe it or not, during our drive, my co-driver, the very saintly Nicolas Vouilloz, also grabbed the safety cage firmly with his right hand on several occasions, and unexpectedly hissed ""ssssssssss"" through his teeth into my intercom, which could only mean that the boy does not like to ride in the passenger seat very much, or that I was unexpectedly fast in certain corners, even for such a master of the steering wheel. Yes, you'll never imagine what a great compliment it is for a racing driver when such a master inadvertently utters, ""Ssssss! "" <p/> And so we're driving home in a 90-horsepower diesel, lazily making our way along the straight highways of France, Germany and Austria to Ljubljana, when my TV colleague Stropnik throws me a bone: ""Dude, what fools we are! We are driving 1300 kilometres there and 1300 kilometres back. We spend two days in the car and a lot of money on fuel and tolls. All to drive three laps there - in the car! Who can understand that? At least if you were there after driving for twelve hours, you could run around for three laps or ride a bicycle, instead of just getting in another car, doing three laps and then skating home for another twelve hours..."" <p/> Hm, actually David is quite right. We are indeed weirdos, but at the same time I know very well that he thinks exactly the same as me. For three more laps in that car, we'd turn back again in a heartbeat... <p/> ID card <p/> Title: Peugeot 307 WRC (world rally car) <p/> Year built: 2004 <p/> Owner: Peugeot Motorsport France <p/> Number of examples in existence: 2 registered, about 6 built <p/> Driver: Marcus Gronholm <p/> Price: not for sale <p/> Value: €800,000 to €1,000,000 <p/> Mission: to win individual events and the world rally championship"	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

202	"Boris Pahor, writer, fellow-traveller and harsh critic of all three totalitarianisms of the 20th century, visited Kamnik <p/> Kamnik (4.5.2010) - Boris Pahor, writer, academic, Prešeren laureate, Knight of the French Legion of Honour, multiple Nobel Prize nominee, and recent recipient of Austria's highest state decoration, visited Kamnik today, where in front of a packed hall of the Kamnik Parent Library he spoke about his views on Slovenian society in the present and the past, both in his native Slovenia and abroad. His sparkling critical remarks touched everyone, regardless of political or ideological affiliation. In short, despite his 97 years, Boris Pahor is still at the centre of a critical shake-up of our society. <p/> VIDEO: Writer Boris Pahor thanks for the invitation to Kamnik and critically evaluates the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia. <p/> Short biography <p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920, and later witnessed the fascist persecution of the Slovenes, which led him to join the national liberation movement during the Second World War.<p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the Fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920. In 1944, he was arrested and sent to the concentration camps of Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof and Bergen-Belsen, which he survived with resilience and returned to Trieste after receiving treatment in a French sanatorium. After graduating from the University of Padua, he took a job as a teacher at the rebuilt Slovenian school in his hometown. <p/> Outline of his literary work <p/> Boris Pahor is considered one of Europe's best-known Slovenian writers.His works deal with the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps, often touch on the subject of the Slovenian minority in Italy and the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region, and he is also known for his social and political engagement. Among his best-known works are the collection of novellas The City in the Bay and the novels Nomads without an Oasis, Clash with Spring and, above all, Necropolis, which has been translated into several European languages. Boris Pahor's literary works were re-evaluated only after Slovenia's independence, when he was awarded the Prešeren Prize and the Honorary Medal of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia. To this day, however, the writer maintains a critical stance, for example in the controversy over the Italian Day of Remembrance for the post-war killings and the departure of Italians from Istria, accusing Italy of forgetting about fascism, while also criticising Slovenian restraint. <p/> The discussion with the writer Boris Pahor took place under the title ""Witness to the past"" and was moderated by the young writer Mitja Čander. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""The minority should be united in its political speech"" <p/> As a left-wing democrat, the writer Boris Pahor, together with the Catholic writer Alojz Rebula, laid the cultural foundations of the Slovenian minority in Italy after the Second World War. The renewed Slovenian cultural and political life encouraged Pahor to become involved in it by editing magazines such as Zaliv. Throughout, the writer from Trieste maintained a critical distance and view of Slovenian reality, defending his independence of thought, which naturally led him to clashes with the then dominant left-wing component in the Slovenian minority and with the new communist government in Slovenia. Although he himself was politically left-leaning, he never agreed with the position of Slovenians within the Italian left-wing parties, but instead advocated independent political action. <p/> Boris Pahor attracted a very diverse audience. Kamnik has not seen an event in a long time that brought together citizens of such different political and ideological persuasions. <p/> ""The TIGR fighters were the first fighters against fascism"" <p/> Boris Pahor stressed that the members of the TIGR organisation were the first to resist fascism. Their activities were multifaceted, including the collection of arms for a possible anti-Italian uprising in the event of an Italian attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Unlike the Communists, however, they were concerned to ensure that their actions caused as few casualties among the Slovene population as possible. When they killed one Italian in an action and this led to the Italians killing four Slovenes in revenge, they realised that such a struggle was not worthwhile. <p/> Pahor also pointed out that the post-war oblates refused to recognise the TIGR, and only recently has the TIGR been gaining ground again. Now, young people are also joining the organisation and are committed to the cause of slovakia. On the other hand, Pahor has repeatedly warned against the sale of Slovenian land in Primorska to the Italians, which would lead to the re-Italianisation of Primorska. He was also very critical of Ljubljana, or central Slovenia, which showed no great interest in Slovenians abroad. In Pahor's opinion, Slovenian school textbooks also do not sufficiently inform young people about the suffering of the Primorje people under fascism. Pahor is also against defending the struggle against the liberation movement as merely a struggle against communism. <p/> Matej Tonin listened attentively to Boris Pahor's thoughts. <p/> ""Slovenia behaves towards its neighbours like a war loser"" <p/> On the one hand, Boris Pahor also regrets the break-up of Yugoslavia, although he has never been against an independent Slovenian state. Slovenia's problem is that it does not have the same power as the former Yugoslavia, but our country's main problem is that it is too humble in its demands on its neighbours when it comes to asserting its national interests and protecting its national community. ""Slovenia is behaving as if it had lost the war, not won it"", Pahor added. <p/> Several books by Boris Pahor were also available for purchase in the foyer of the hall. <p/> ""The post-war massacre of Home Army soldiers - a morally reprehensible act"" <p/> Pahor took the former regime in the former Yugoslavia by storm with the publication of the booklet ""Edvard Kocbek, a Witness of Our Time"", which he and Alojz Rebula wrote in 1975 on the occasion of Kocbek's 70th birthday. In the accompanying interview, Kocbek spoke for the first time about the post-war massacre of returned Slovene Home Army soldiers, which raised a lot of dust, and Pahor was banned from entering the country by the Yugoslav communist authorities. <p/> For Boris Pahor, he is a victim, a victim no matter which political-ideological pole he comes from. That is why, despite the fact that he was taken to a German camp precisely because of his betrayal of the Home Army, he condemns the post-war killings of Home Army soldiers (around 10 000), because they were killings of unarmed prisoners of war. In this context, Boris Pahor advocated that the killings in the fojba, which in recent years have been exploited by Italian nationalists and even the highest representatives of the Italian state, should be placed in the broader context of events and it should be said that there were even bigger abysses in mainland Slovenia, where the communists after the war threw Slovenians - political opponents - and that the fojba should also be seen in the broader historical context of the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region under fascist Italy since 1918 or, in other words, in the period of the Nazi occupation of the territory of the Littoral region. Italy, unlike Germany, which carried out a consistent denazification, did not carry out a de-Fascistisation. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""Communism was a religion, even though it did not recognise God Stalin, in organising this ""Communist Church"", modelled himself on the institutional structure of the Catholic Church: with a Pope, cardinals, bishops and chaplains - of course, by other names.... There are 15 beasts in every man, and if a man lives in a totalitarian system, every such system acquires certain collaborators and believers who are ready to support it with all their being. This could explain the emergence of various leaders, e.g. in our case the ""udbovtsy"", who blindly trusted the Party and, like true believers, believed in communism, without giving a second thought to not deceiving their neighbours... Josip Broz Tito could be considered a criminal by many criteria, but he also has the merit of having Primorska annexed to Yugoslavia and Slovenia."" <p/> Speaking of the Christian socialist Edvard Kocbek, whom he knew well, he said that communism should be realised in Slovenia, on the Christian-socialist foundations that Kocbek envisioned. But because the Slovenian communists had taken a different path, one that restricted freedom of thought and the individual, the communist model ended as it did in failure - and according to Pahor, communism as it was deserved it. <p/> In Pahor's view, Christians and parties that defend Christian values and the welfare state, like Krek and Kocbek, should also participate in any government. Only this, in Pahor's view, can lead to balanced development. <p/> However, the writer was also critical of Christians because, in his opinion, they put too much emphasis on wealth and appearances. In his opinion, it is difficult to become a good Christian from a Catholic ..."	News/Reporting	Information/Explanation
207	"Sometimes when I go to Celje, I see it frozen in that bronze. With a suitcase. Then I go to McDonald's, and Alma just stands there and seems to have got used to the city. And the city has (at least a little) got used to her. It's been a long time since I found her. Or rather, she found me. That's what one girl, a fortune teller, said when I told her the story. Namely, Alma died on the same day I was born. Not the same year, but the same day of another year. She died in Sveta, I was born in Sveta. She was buried covered in white paint, which somewhere in Haiti, or wherever, means reincarnation. <p/>Of course, it would be foolish for me to claim now that I am the reincarnation of Alma Karlin, because I am probably the reincarnation of some perfectly ordinary animal. But it was crazy the year I dealt with it. I was the first one to find her and dig her out of oblivion. People knew her, some individuals, but I was the first to bring all the knowledge about her together in a documentary. Then they rushed after it, ""Oja"", they rushed. Feminists, actors, sociologists, literary historians... and they discovered her, it was a joy. But this has been happening to me all my life. I find someone or something, I introduce it to the public, and then everyone else takes credit. Because I'm an unambitious shit-baker from Svečina. <p/> Alma was then presented as a heroine, a theosophist, a traveller, a Nobel Prize candidate, blah, blah, blah. She was one confused lady who travelled around the world and kept yammering about why she was travelling around the world. Apart from that, she wrote badly, or rather mediocrely. And she made things up. And she was German and at least a little homosexual... For me, Alma will remain, the memory of the day when I was wandering around the ruins of her hut, there under the stumps of the Celje castle, and it was as if I was knee-deep in some strange, chaotic fate."

211	"Fortune Telling - Tricks Revealed <p/> Man has always been curious about what the future holds. In the past - and still today for some primitive peoples - the future was foretold from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, but today we have a variety of divination techniques at our disposal: the horoscope, the crystal ball, palm or coffee grounds divination, numerology, charts, runes and the list goes on and on. Is it just a good trick or does fortune-telling really predict the future? <p/> "" A sucker is born every minute "" <p/> is a statement attributed to P. T. Barnum, an American entertainer and businessman who was famous for his pranks. The Barnum effect, on which fortune-telling is based, is named after him. It is the idea that a person recognises his own personality traits in common or stereotypical descriptions of personality. He even finds the descriptions incredibly true for him! <p/> Divination is often based on claims that cannot be verified or disputed, e.g. "" You have great potential within you .""; "" You have a need to be liked .""; describes characteristics that are typical of a certain age, gender or status e.g. a fortune teller tells an elderly woman that her hearing is probably deteriorating and she will need a hearing aid predicts events that will happen to each of us sooner or later e.g. "" You will soon receive an interesting phone call ."". The word ""sometimes"" is often used in predictions e.g. "" Sometimes you say what you think clearly, but sometimes you bite your tongue to avoid resentment."" <p/> Divination is more convincing when it involves personal information: name, date of birth, date of marriage, etc. It is also important that divination evokes a sense of magic or special energies, e.g. divination using magic crystals. For example, dressing in magical clothes or in a cloak that reflects negative energy adds a special impression of magic. <p/> The use of unusual or repetitive hand movements, steady strokes or sounds serves to bring the divination into a trance state where the individual is even more receptive to what is being said. <p/> When the prediction comes true <p/> The fortune teller has told us what is in store for us, and then we go out into the world with this knowledge. When we expect something to happen, even completely unrelated and coincidental events can be perceived as connected. For example, a fortune teller tells you: "" You are going to have a car accident because of a flat tyre, you better not drive your car for a while. ""Just in case, you really don't get behind the wheel. A week later, your friend tells you that the last time he had a flat tyre, he narrowly avoided a collision. "" The guessing paid off! Good thing I wasn't driving! "", you utter, relieved that you have perceived two coincidental events as connected. <p/> Fortune-telling skills <p/> Good language skills are important for fortune-telling. A fortune teller speaks clearly, fluently and quickly enough that you cannot hear your own thoughts or reach out to him. At times he makes a claim and waits for your response. If you agree with the claim, he will reinforce it in the future. If you disagree, he will take the conversation in a different direction. Sometimes he will only make part of the claim and it is up to you to complete it as you see fit. <p/> A fortune teller must also be a good observer. He or she needs to recognise what you are communicating through your posture and facial expressions, what your clothes and fashion accessories say about you, your status and your lifestyle. Based on these insights, the fortune teller will be able to choose expressions that are even more suited to you. <p/> Fortune-telling is also helpful to the individual <p/> When fortune-telling predicts pleasant events and the successful achievement of goals, it can have a very motivating effect on the individual. He or she will embark on the journey to achieve his or her goals with confidence, working harder and better, as all his or her energy will be directed towards the goal. <p/> Divination can show a person a new way of looking at a problem and new solutions that they would not have thought of on their own. <p/> Is it possible to predict the future? <p/> So far, no divination has accurately predicted the future - so the claims could be scientifically verified. Perhaps in the future, as humanity comes to new knowledge, this will also be possible. But for now, keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket and your hand on your wallet, as the psychologist M. H. Birnbaum wrote."	Opinion/Argumentation	Information/Explanation

It is also very important to check who you are doing business with, because it is easy to run into unpaid invoices,"" Berić advises on how to tap into foreign markets. <p/> Multinationals - challenge or threat? <p/> ""Multinationals are a challenge to everyone in the market. But there are two sides to the coin, just as multinationals are a threat to us because of their size, we are a threat to them because of our small size and agility, because it is easier for us to reach our customers, listen to them and offer products and support,"" explains Berić. <p/> ""Our target group is all people who travel, have travelled or intend to travel.

226	"A BLUE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> DADS IN THE COURT <p/> The clock was already close to 00 when I was watching a film in the kitchen. Occasionally I heard a noise in the yard. It was in the form of some sort of shuffling, of harder objects in a crate or in a sack. It was getting more and more intense, it was pulling my firbec to lift my ass off the bench. At first I was eavesdropping by the balcony door in the dark. Then I tiptoed out onto the balcony and hid behind the longest parts of the yawn that was drying. <p/>The shifting stopped periodically as if eavesdropping on me. It was clear to me that someone was in the shuppa where it was as dark as a tunnel. The night was also dark. My vivid imagination had sketched the robber to perfection, poking at the punks. What should I do? I'm not going down there. <p/> I slowly open the balcony door again and explain to the hinges that they wouldn't dare to make any treacherous noises. And towards the living room, to my son who was at the computer, I call psssss psssss psssss psssss. I hinted as quietly as I could to my son that there was a thief in the yard. I couldn't hear myself very well, because I was talking so quietly, expecting my son to hear me. When I had talked him out of it, he came out onto the balcony. <p/> Now we were both eavesdropping on the robber. I confess that the trousers of my tracksuit were shivering. I can't imagine what a scream I would have let out if something had, um... <p/> You wait here, says my son. I was so hard with fear that I didn't know whether he was going to wake up Father Key. Or was I going to face the robber who was still robbing. I kept my eyes on the yard, so I wouldn't miss anything, so I would turn on the light at the right time, so I would shout at the right time,... I thought about what I would have to do. <p/> I see something white in the open. I was shocked at first. I couldn't believe it, but it was what I was seeing. It just popped into my head. What I saw were the underpants of my father. All the other bare skin merged with the darkness. Bravely, that's what, the barefoot went towards the shupi. My son and I looked at each other. I thought I would put my fist in my mouth if I had to, because at this time I couldn't afford to let out an animal scream. <p/> Finally, the brave ata shone his torch towards the point from where the thieving rattling was coming. Out comes a cat. <p/> A PALE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> Today I guess it must have been 68 when I assess Marjetka's age and what she remembered most. I compare her with my children when they were her age. I must remember to be more lenient with her, because I know that she and her mother lived on the margins of society and that affected everyone. They were brought so far by Mariette's father, who was dominated and ruled by alcohol until it drove him to his grave. It was not difficult to clear out the fridge and the wardrobes of clothes, slippers and shoes because there was still enough empty space. Mum did her best, but it was still small and tiny. My place is different today, better, but in the flood of everything in the shops, it gets lost in the lack of space. <p/> Marjetka already knew how to walk and didn't know where she and her mother were going until they entered through the entrance into a narrow hall, with tables covered with tablecloths and children, and Santa Claus sitting at the front. She might have heard of him, but this was the first time she had seen him. White-cell lanterns hung from the ceiling, filling the room with a yellow glow. I don't know how she managed to reach for the bag, which contained a pair of one-fingered gloves in sky-blue, with a white furry border at the wrist. She doesn't remember how she found her mother when it was over. But she remembers the warm gloves on her hands when they went home. <p/> Today she would like to know which good fairy gave her the gift of seeing Father Frost for the first time, she still wears those mittens in her heart, and her heart still sits on the little stool at the coffee table, timidly drinking tea from a cup. She would like to visit that aunt or uncle and thank them for their kindness in opening the joy in her heart, which, like a faded mural on the wall in December, breathes in the colours of memory. She worries if she or he would understand how much it would mean to her to see the kindness in her or his eyes and to be told that her mother would not be able to take her and she would be left without the memory of Santa Claus. <p/> EROTIC FANTASIES <p/> The windows were wide open, cooling the cramped room. The curtains with embroidered cranes allowed the presence of the moon to be felt in the room with open mouths. She stopped under the beam. A fluttering inside her body, like the underflutter of a butterfly's wings she had caught while riding a swaying bus. It awakened stocked desire and submerged waves, unexpectedly dug up and stirred. <p/>""Oh, those wooden seats,"" Olla groaned, looking towards the moon and letting her thoughts escape back to the experience of the ride. Pressing down on the hard seat, she felt a volcano awakening from the forest and a star tunnel opening. Each press brought a firmer embrace of warmth. The wood cooled her thighs, which were massaged by the rhythmic rocking, stopping, accelerating. Occasionally she squeezed her thighs, wanting more... Her eyes caught the fading landscape and suddenly she stood up as if the chair was too hot and walked to the door. She got off the bus, which had fewer passengers at each stop. <p/> A strange new feeling seeped into her from the strangers on the other side of the road and who surrounded her in front of the pedestrian crossing. The eye-contact as they passed each other frightened her, lest she betray them. <p/> ""What would I betray? ""to long for. ""But it's not written on my forehead,"" her thoughts argue and protest. <p/> She could hardly wait to step into the hall and cross the wooden stairs. She ran the last ten and rushed for the door as if someone was chasing her. She unlocked and locked it behind her. She hung the bag from her shoulder on the coat rack in the wardrobe. <p/> She went into the room and stood under the moonbeam. They would be alone this evening and night, as the folks back home were still enjoying their vacation when she had to get to work. She blinked and lifted her head to feel the caress. She covered her face with her right hand and stroked her hair from her forehead over the temples and down to the nape of her neck. She touched her cheek and face to the soft part of the raised hand, increasing the pressure of the touch. She stood with her chin resting on her chin. Her left hand, fingers spread, stroked across her stomach to her right hip and back. She was becoming more demanding, encircling now one ample breast and returning to the other. She lifted her head up and offered her neck to the moon beam to caress it. She turned her head to the right and left to receive more moonlight. The fingers of her right hand began to undo the tiny buttons on her white shirt. The blouse landed, on the floor by her bare feet, with her bra on top of it. Her left hand slipped out, the pads sliding slowly, over the hot soft skin of her breast. The nipples tensed, calling out to play the strings of the harp. The awakened strings tensed and waited for the others to play in the sounds of love and acceptance of the naked body. The long hair used up the nakedness of her back and caressed it as she moved her head gently left and right. The pads of her fingers threw away their inhibitions and caressed her body with the lightness of a delicate feather. They freed themselves from the rest of the laundry that had landed on the parquet floor. Pulled the linen sheet from the bed, wrapped and unwrapped herself as her hands danced around her naked body, exposing it to the moon and covering it. The warm skin called out for heat, for shit... She knelt at the foot of the bed and crawled like a cat to the middle. The two breasts danced, and with her right hand she took their weight away and squeezed them to her body. She moved towards the navel and the volcano, waiting impatiently for the eruptions. The star tunnel tingled pleasantly. She lowered her warm body onto the bed, cooling it just enough to make the anticipation grow. She let go of the weight of her body to feel its lightness. Turned onto her back, then onto her stomach, letting the pads wander and explore, letting the strings strain one after the other. The heart yearned, chased and gasped for air and acceptance. The heat was smouldering and ignited the eruption of a volcano. The body was engulfed by wild waves and enveloped in majesty."	Other	Other

243	"The Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia (IVZ) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia are participating in a large-scale European project entitled ""Transmission of patients' key health information for treatment abroad"" or epSOS (Smart Open Services for European Patients). The project aims to make key medical data available for the healthcare of citizens seeking medical assistance in another European country, while respecting the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy. <p/> As European citizens become increasingly mobile, travelling and working abroad more and more, they increasingly need medical assistance abroad. In order to provide quality medical treatment, the doctor abroad also needs the patient's vital health information. Modern information technology has long allowed authorised health professionals to access important health data collected in the patient's home country, based on the patient's consent. This is why many initiatives have been launched in Europe to create the right environment and conditions to make use of such technical possibilities for the benefit of better healthcare for European citizens. <p/> The epSOS project involves 47 partners from 20 European Union (EU) countries and three non-EU countries. The aim of the project is to carry out pilot projects to establish two cross-border services - the transmission of summary patient data and e-prescribing and e-medication. Therefore, the key tasks will be to organise the relevant legal bases in each participating country, to ensure an appropriate organisation of the work and to put in place the technical solutions. The initial phase of the project will test the feasibility and acceptability of the general-technical, organisational and legal coherence of the proposed solutions. The epSOS services, which include patient summaries and e-prescribing/e-dispensing, will be available on a trial basis in some countries already at the end of this year. <p/> Slovenia will test data exchange in 2012, probably first with Austria and Slovakia. <p/> For more information in English on epSOS, please visit the project website www.epsos.eu."

244	Admission of financial instruments to regulated trading <p/> The decision to list a financial instrument on a stock exchange is one of the most important decisions to be taken by a company or its owners. Listing your company's shares on a regulated securities market will increase your company's reputation and visibility. This is expected to be reflected not only in your upstream and downstream markets, but also in attracting new quality staff to your company and, last but not least, it will make it easier for your company to raise fresh debt or equity capital, while the market price movement of the share will also reflect your performance and that of your employees. Of course, the decision to list must be made in a considered manner, as, in addition to the benefits mentioned above, listing also brings additional requirements and costs for the company: ensuring transparency, keeping the entire investing public informed of important developments in the company's business or assets, etc. <p/> Is this your situation? <p/> You are an entrepreneur or co-owner of a family-owned company, you have no successor and you wish to withdraw from active management of the business and divest your ownership interest in the company or part of it. <p/> You are planning a high growth business which will be difficult to finance from your own resources and you need additional sources of finance, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain finance from banks or venture capital providers. <p/> You intend to increase your company's presence abroad. <p/> We can help you... <p/> Our team of experts can help you: <p/> services related to the initial or resale sale of securities, <p/> advice on the promotion prior to the issuance of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities. <p/> advice on the obligations related to becoming a public company, in particular advice on ensuring that all stakeholders are equally informed (disclosure of controlled information) and advice on the drafting of internal acts and policies (definition of the flow of inside information and protection of its confidentiality, establishing a list of persons with access to inside information, defining the conditions, permitted and obligatory practices in relation to trading in the issuer's shares, etc.), <p/> advising on the establishment of an investor relations function/department, etc. <p/> Financial and business advice to help you go beyond existing frameworks.

248	We women love make-up and we love to go to the chemist for a new eye shadow and spend a fraction of our salary on a new powder. But all that money can be thrown away if we don't use a proper, good quality brush that is designed for the task we are using it for. One look at the wide range of brushes on offer can be confusing for even the most skilled in the art of make-up artistry. So which brushes to choose? <p/> The quality of the brush depends on the quality of the bristles used. Although you might think that natural bristles are the best, this is often not the case. When buying natural brushes, we need to know what kind of hair they are. Often animals are even killed just for their hair. The best brushes are those made from hair that has only been shaved off, preferably the first time. The second clipping still leaves the top of the hair clipped and therefore sharp. Of course, you can also choose synthetic brushes, but these are mainly used for applying foundation and concealer. Artificial bristles harden over time, while natural bristles become softer. <p/> Foundation brush <p/> If you want velvety skin, invest in a good foundation brush. This will cover imperfections better and more accurately and, above all, when applying a liquid foundation, it will smoothly blend with sponges and fingers. <p/> Kabuki <p/> These little brushes are packed with bristles. They are perfect for applying mineral make-up. Make-up applied with these brushes is applied in thicker layers due to the large number of hairs in the brush. <p/> Concealer brush <p/> There are several types of concealer brushes, but they are usually a smaller version of the foundation brush, making it easier to apply concealer precisely to areas around the eyes, pimples and other imperfections. If you apply concealer with a brush, it will last longer than if you apply it with your fingers, as the latter way of applying the concealer mixes with the oil on your fingers. <p/> Fan brush <p/> Fan brushes are used when you want to apply a small amount of foundation - for example, on areas where your skin is oily and shiny. Because of its specific shape, we need to choose a brush that keeps its shape. <p/>Blush Brush <p/>This is a special brush that is used to precisely blend and highlight the cheekbones. It can also be used to sweep away bits of eye shadow that have fallen onto the face during application. The brush must be large enough to cover the entire part of the face to be shaded in one stroke.

252	"Merkel would agree to minimum wage <p/> Berlin, 21 November (STA) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel today signalled that Germany is on the verge of introducing a minimum wage. Ahead of a crucial negotiating phase in the coalition talks, she stressed that she was ready to compromise and estimated that the Social Democrats (SPD) would not sign the coalition agreement if it did not contain a deal on the introduction of a minimum wage. <p/> According to Merkel, ""a grand coalition is not a politician's heart's desire"". But the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the SPD must respect the will of the electorate, she said. <p/> ""The Social Democrats will not conclude negotiations without a legally defined universal minimum wage,"" Merkel said, according to the French news agency AFP. Her CDU, however, opposed such a move and the Chancellor insists that she and her party "" will try to do everything to prevent job losses "" as a result of this measure. <p/> The CDU believes that the minimum wage should be non-binding and limited to specific industries or regions, while the SPD insists on the introduction of a universal minimum wage of €8.5 per hour. <p/> Otherwise, the issues of dual citizenship and homosexual rights remain among the more contentious sticking points in the negotiations. Merkel insists that a deal is possible. ""We will see in the next few days if we succeed. ""According to the Chancellor, the coalition treaty should stand next Wednesday. <p/> According to the negotiators, there are still more than 100 policy areas open. It has even gone so far that CDU representatives have started mentioning new early elections. <p/> Today, after several meetings in small working groups, the negotiators of the three parties will meet for a seventh round of talks in a large group. They will discuss financial and health policy. They are also expected to touch on integration, with a deal on dual citizenship unlikely to be reached today. <p/> If the negotiations with the SPD are successful, Germany will be led by a grand coalition for the third time since the Second World War. In 2005, negotiations on the formation of a coalition government lasted 65 days. <p/> But even if the negotiations are successful, there is one more hurdle to overcome. According to the SPD's statutes, it is up to all of the party's 470,000 or so members, many of whom are not in favour of a coalition with Merkel, to decide whether to join a coalition. In 2009, after four years in Chancellor Merkel's government, the Social Democrats had their worst ever election result."	News/Reporting	News/Reporting

257	"London - David Beckham has put together the perfect eleven for the World Cup. Beckham had to say goodbye to the England national team because of injury, but he still accompanied the players to South Africa and kept an eye on the action at the World Cup. He put together what he considered to be the ideal squad for the British media, including players from Uruguay, Ghana, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and England. <p/> London - The English Football Association (FA) has not terminated its cooperation with England's selector Fabio Capello, despite the national team's failure at the World Cup. Capello will therefore retain his role as selector despite the humiliating loss of the England squad to Germany 4-1 in the quarter-finals of the World Cup in South Africa. <p/> London - Two days before England's World Cup elimination, tired English football star Wayne Rooney has booked flights for a weekend holiday on the Caribbean island of Barbados. The British media have picked up the information and are reporting another of their ball-playing scandals. <p/> London - The England national team returned to the UK this morning with their heads bowed. The players, visibly tired and out of sorts, landed at Heatrow Airport at 6.20 am. <p/> The two teams with the most supporters at the World Cup said goodbye to the World Cup in the eighth round, which is also a blow to South Africa's tourism economy. There were more than 50 000 English people here, and only a few fewer Americans, both of whom are very good consumers. This also applies to Slovenians, of whom there were around 1 000. Now the Germans have the biggest fan army, with 13 000 visitors, and some of them will travel to the big quarter-final match against Argentina. <p/> At Frank Lampard's shot, Fabio Capello (pictured) crossed his fingers and celebrated the equaliser, but only moments later he realised that the referee had disallowed the goal. The cajoling didn't help and England never got back into the game. Worse: it was a disaster. <p/> Johannesburg - Journalists from many countries around the world were surprised and horrified when the English Football Association held a press conference lasting just 5 minutes and 12 seconds before the World Cup eighth-final match against the Germans at 16:00 today. <p/> The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, spent a long hour in Parliament yesterday explaining the ""emergency"" budget that will force all the Islanders, from the Queen downwards, to tighten their belts... But then what! Who cares! <p/> London - Manchester United's first professional man Alex Ferguson has revealed that he has been so concerned in recent days about the poor performances of Red Devils star Wayne Rooney at this year's World Cup that he has interrupted the summer break to call in his protégé. The Scot fears that England have placed too much expectation on the shoulders of the 24-year-old striker. <p/> In a country where football is a man's religion and football millionaires are gods, football believers have not been so disappointed, unhappy, angry, clever, desperate for a long time... Their faith in their football gods may be restored not only by victory but by the ""destruction"" of the Slovenians in tomorrow's World Cup match. <p/> Rustenburg - Speaking to English journalists, England international Frank Lampard distanced himself from John Terry's remarks against selector Fabio Capello, saying that there was no collective rebellion among the players against the coach. ""Everything is overblown. I am not a rebel and there is no rebellion,"" said the 32-year-old Chelsea player. <p/> England defender John Terry is demanding that Joe Cole plays in the final Group C match against Slovenia, where England desperately need a win to progress. ""Cole and Wayne Rooney are the only two in our squad who can tear down the opposition defence,"" the Chelsea captain said in Rustenburg on Sunday. <p/> Johannesburg - After the match against Algeria, the England national team management is unhappy with some of Capello's decisions and the players have lost confidence. Capello needs to revise his tactics and ""restore hope"" to the players before the Slovenia game. <p/> Cape Town - After the 0-0 draw with Algeria, English football star Wayne Rooney, frustrated by the booing of the fans, kicked a pitch-side camera and, in his first statements, accused the fans of letting the team down. But after a night's sleep, he apologised to them, saying his behaviour was the result of great frustration. <p/> Johannesburg - Germany's Francz Beckenbauer, a legend of world football, was not gentle with England's Fabio Capello and English football in general after the 1-1 World Cup Group C opener between England and the USA - Slovenia are top of the group after their win over Algeria. <p/> Two days before England's first appearance at this year's World Cup, against the USA, England's selector Fabio Capello had already decided which 11 players would take the field first. The Italian has not yet revealed the details, nor which goalkeeper he has decided on, which has been the most pressing issue in recent days. <p/> Rustenburg - England captain Rio Ferdinand injured his left knee during a training session today at the national team base in Rustenburg, South Africa, and is almost certain to miss the World Cup, English media reported. The 31-year-old defender left the hospital where he was examined on crutches. <p/> London - Fabio Capello has signed an amendment to his contract with the English Football Association (FA) and will remain England's selector until the end of the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine. The Italian was initially uncertain about his fate due to the resignation of FA President Lord David Triesman. <p/> England <p/> London - Rio Ferdinand will be one of the key players for the England national football team at this year's World Cup, and he and John Terry will be the best defensive duo in the South...

But it doesn't have to be, sometimes only a close analysis of a photo or a sharp eye can reveal their flaws - some of them hide them quite well, but there are many who obviously don't care. Feet certainly tell a lot about people's habits and personal hygiene, something that the following famous faces are probably not aware of: <p/> It's true that Naomi Campbell is one of the most successful models of all time, but that title has taken its toll - her feet look deformed. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Iman is absolutely beautiful, but the sandals are too small for any feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Even though Holly Madison is a former Playboy bunny and ex-girlfriend of Hugh Hefner, she could do a lot better with her feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Some people just don't have nature's way with every part of their body, so Jennifer Garner's slightly odd toes are not her fault. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Christina Hendricks didn't follow the rules this time - no matter how much you like your shoes, you shouldn't choose them if your foot is too big, or in this case, especially too wide for them. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Sarah Jessica Parker's effortless prancing around the streets of New York in heels as Carrie Bradshaw clearly had its drawbacks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> As with Naomi, Kate Moss' feet have walked countless catwalks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Kim Kardashian refused to give up her high heels even when she was heavily pregnant, and the result was a defeat. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Britney Spears clearly hurt herself in this case, but she could have done with at least a hint of special, opaque make-up.

We recognised a great opportunity in the project to present our new BABY & KIDS NATURAL cosmetics to both existing and potential new customers. Considering the number of contacts established and the positive reactions from visitors, we believe that our participation in the Children's Bazaar has been extremely successful both years. We have fulfilled our main objective - to get closer to our target group of customers: mainly parents, but also toddlers. For the latter reason, we plan to participate in the Children's Bazaar again next year. <p/> Nastija Egartner Marketing Communication Kozmetika Afrodita d. o. o. <p/> The Children's Bazaar in Maribor and Ljubljana presented many opportunities for families to spend quality time together. That is why Sava Hotels & Resorts was not missing among the suppliers. While children were eagerly participating in children's workshops at our stand, their parents and older companions were interested in active holidays in our destinations. We are delighted to have recorded a large number of bookings for family holidays as a result of our presentation at the Otorka Bazaar, and we recommend this type of cooperation to other organisations and companies. <p/> Slavica Rešeta Market Administrator - Slovenia Sava Hotels & Resorts <p/> At the 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana, we had a very pleasant experience with the organiser of the fair, Proevent d.o.o., with our fair performance, where we presented the project ""I like to eat fish"". The staff of this company is characterised by their exceptional professionalism, professional and responsible attitude and their great sense of care for exhibitors and visitors. We look forward to working with them in the future. <p/> This is the first year we have participated in the Children's Bazaar in Ljubljana. Our company is still young, but we aim to be the best provider of developmental or didactic toys for children of all ages. The Children's Bazaar is the best way for us to get in touch with our customers and direct users of our toys. We were very satisfied with the attendance and the atmosphere on the fairground and we will definitely see you in 2013. <p/> Peter Goričan Singa d.o.o. <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana in the media <p/> As we are a very young company, this year was our first time participating in the Children's Bazaar. We were delighted with the atmosphere at the event, as there was really no shortage of positive energy. We achieved our business goals: we presented our organic cotton products for babies and toddlers to young parents and pregnant women. We had a unique response to our stand and got confirmation that we are heading in the right direction. This customer contact is very important for our online shop, so we will definitely be back next year. <p/> Alenka Bombažek d.o.o. <p/> Before the Children's Bazaar event there was a lot of apprehension about how critical visitors would react to our promotion of craft professions. Up to now, we have mainly targeted primary school pupils in the last third of the school year when promoting craft professions, but we were pleasantly surprised by the decision to focus on younger pupils this time. The response from the children, and especially from their parents, has been overwhelming. The Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would also like to highlight the exemplary cooperation with the organiser Proevent d.o.o. and would like to take this opportunity to thank them very much. <p/> Mitja Korunovski Education Centre of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry <p/> We participated in the Children's Bazaar for the second year in a row. Last year, when we participated for the first time, we were surprised and delighted by the visit, but at the same time, we were not adequately prepared to communicate with the visitors. This year we prepared better and offered visitors an animation - Frisbee golf, which is one of the activities in our Summer Park on Krvavec, new this season. Attendance at this year's fair was once again very good and certainly above average compared to other fairs we attend. We are also pleased with the response of visitors to the fair, as a number of them have already visited our park and redeemed benefits/prizes from our animation game from the fair. A big thank you to the organisers for listening and coordinating. <p/> Luka Vrančič RTC Krvavec, d.d.<p/> Today, we visited the Children's Bazaar at the Economic Exhibition Centre with the children from the Najdihojca kindergarten in Ljubljana (Butterflies and Magpies groups). We had a free guided tour of the fair. The tour guide was very nice and we must praise her for making a great effort. The Bazaar itself is interesting and offers a variety of activities for both young and old. Thank you on behalf of the children and staff of the Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit - Butterflies and Magpies Group. We will come again. <p/> Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit <p/> The future is in the hands of our children, let's make sure it is full of life, peace, happiness, beauty, joy of work and learning... We brought a piece of this idea to life at this year's Children's Bazaar. With our Montessori room and the Montessori materials and other developmentally-didactic toys presented, we wanted to add a touch of the importance of education. Visitors approached with great interest, with many questions, eager for information. The Montessori room was full of our little ones throughout the fair and surrounded by many observers, to whom we gave away great prizes. We are definitely still in touch with our visitors. <p/> Katarina Zver Belovič World of Children <p/> The large turnout at this year's Children's Bazaar event for families is a real confirmation that the organisers know how to listen to both children and parents. The pleasant and unobtrusive sales approach of the exhibitors, the educational activities and the charity campaigns provide a pleasant atmosphere for visitors and for us - the companies presenting our products or services. <p/> Tanja Pirc Podobnik Mercator d.d. <p/> Ljubljanske mlekarne has already presented itself at the Children's Bazaar several times. We have been developing the idea for the presentation ourselves over the years, but GR Engineering's support has always been welcome in its realisation. The team, which is competent in various areas (technical, communication, organisational, etc.), has always been there to help us achieve our goals. The Children's Bazaar is well organised and we will definitely be back again this year. <p/> Sara Wagner Ljubljanske mlekarne d.d. <p/> At the Children's Bazaar, which took place at the Gospodarské razstaviště Exhibition Centre, children from the Oton Župančič Kindergarten were given the opportunity to visit various exhibitions, and at the same time, they participated with their own items and also performed on stage. The professionals decided to take the children to the Children's Bazaar in the future, which offered a variety of activities for children. <p/> Ksenija Grabovica Assistant Director of the Otona Župančič Kindergarten <p/> The Children's Bazaar made a very positive impression on us, especially the freshness of the young families and their interest in experiencing nature and our ethnological workshops. <p/> Nives Brezovnik Rogatec Institute for Culture, Tourism and Development <p/> In 2010 we participated in the Children's Bazaar for the first time. The organisation of the event (exhibition spaces and assistance with their equipment, communication with the organisers, etc.) is at a very high level. The wide range of exhibitors and the free entry for visitors ensure that the attendance is really high.

312	"Are systematic examinations really compulsory? <p/> At the Association for Freedom of Choice, we are receiving an increasing number of indignant letters from parents informing us of the unacceptable practice of paediatricians and school doctors in cases where a child is not brought for a systematic check-up. Some parents are even threatened with reporting to the CSD for ""neglecting"" their child, while others are told that they will no longer be their doctor of choice if they do not come for a check-up (even if the child is healthy! ). Clearly, there is increasing pressure on parents from paediatricians and some state institutions, which is not least reflected in increased dissatisfaction and resistance from parents. <p/> The health centre is threatening one family directly in writing - without any legal basis! - that if they do not bring their baby for a systematic check-up, the Social Work Centre will be sent to their door. In the accompanying document, I am sending you an official clarification from the Ministry of Health (from January 2011), which makes it clear that systematic examinations are a RIGHT in Slovenia and that they are NOT MANDATORY. <p/> What is the situation with these systematic examinations now, are they compulsory (ZZVZZ) or not (statements of the Ministry of Health)? Do you get the CSD by the scruff of the neck in this country if you don't go for such a check-up? Where and why, who gives them this right to send the CSD over parents and de facto impose systematics as compulsory? Are such threats and pressures from doctors and the state permissible? <p/> We believe that this is an intensive increase of pressure on parents beyond all permissible limits, and therefore civil society movements are considering a form of public protest against the intensification of repression against parents by paediatricians and the state. If we fail to stop this - will soon every parent who fails to turn up with their child for a systematics session receive threats or even a CSD hearing? <p/> This practice by paediatricians and other actors in the health sector is contrary to legislation and guidelines for good practice for paediatricians, as well as to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Republic of Slovenia is in flagrant breach of by failing to regulate this area by law. <p/> Article 18 emphasises that the primary responsibility and care for the growth and development of the child in all respects belongs to the parents (or in special cases, legal representatives), and the best interests of the child are the primary parental concern. In order for parents to be able to achieve this goal, States Parties must provide them with appropriate support and establish institutions and services that parents can use to achieve this goal. Article 24 highlights the right of the child to enjoy the highest standard of health and to have access to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. It is the role of the State to ensure access to these facilities and technologies and to ensure that all segments of society, especially parents and children, are informed about these options, have access to education about them and to basic knowledge about child health and nutrition, the benefits of breastfeeding, hygiene and a clean environment, and disaster prevention. Nowhere in the Convention does it say that families must submit to compulsory procedures in the area of preventive health and medical examinations and interventions. The fact is that, because of pressure from paediatricians, a good number of Slovenian parents are already going abroad for check-ups, mainly to Austria. There, many parents are even asked what they have come for, because the child is healthy and, in their opinion, would not need so many examinations. More proof that something is very wrong in Slovenia. <p/> It is also a fact that recently the CSDs have taken children away from some families for similar reasons. Will we parents have to fear our own country in future? If you find this topic interesting, we invite you to contact our association for more information, the contacts are listed below. Above all, the Ministry of Health owes the Slovenian public an immediate clarification on all this."	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

317	Since we were extremely lucky to have Boštjan Romih visit us at the faculty and give us a very entertaining lecture on oratory and public speaking, here are some pointers that I found most useful and interesting. <p/> As we know, eye contact is the cornerstone of contact and there are two principles to be observed in relation to it: uniformity and randomness. It is therefore necessary to be careful to look at each listener for approximately the same amount of time. At the same time, we need to avoid patterns that could be picked up by the listeners. <p/> When speaking, we should also not apologise in advance (e.g. I apologise in advance for not having had time to prepare well for the talk. ). It is very likely that listeners/viewers will then only be more aware of our mistakes. When public speaking, we also avoid smiling to show fear and discomfort (no smile is preferable to being forced). <p/> When speaking in public, we often don't know where to put our hands. It is best to position them at belly button height (more chance of actually using them than if they are hanging by the body). Markers, power point remotes, sheets of paper (but they should be smaller - e.g. A5, and the notes should be legible and in a large enough font) can help as a fixation point. But then we have to make sure that we gesticulate with the hand that is free, and that we are not holding these tools. <p/> If you want to practise speaking with distinctness, try speaking with a pencil between your teeth.

They used conventional hygienic toilet paper, which often caused clogging of the drains. Emptying the septic tank was an additional cost and resulted in unpleasant odours. <p/> Needs and solution: They needed something that would allow them to: - eliminate the clogging of drains, - reduce the cleaning intervals of septic tanks, - eliminate odours in toilets, - reduce the costs associated with this, - be more environmentally friendly. We have made this possible with Bio Active toilet paper, which is based on BATP technology.<p/> Result: HIGH SEWAGE DISCLOSURE, RESULTING IN: <p/> - reduction of drain blockages by more than 50, - reduction of costs for faeces disposal and drain cleaning by more than 50, - elimination of odours (especially when the weather changes) - increased care and environmental friendliness. <p/> We have got suitable paper for a larger number of visitors. The paper is rapidly degradable. All in all, it is cheaper. Bernard PETROVČIČ	Promotion	Promotion
355	Toronto Another Bust Abroad <p/> At this year's first edition of the Slovenian Music Week, representatives of prominent foreign festivals (Exit, Terraneo, Sziget, Vienna Waves) selected a few Slovenian artists to perform on individual foreign stages. In Odzven we have already introduced the band Dandelion Children, who performed at Exit in Serbia, with a short video-interview, and this time we asked some questions to the Toronto band Drug Bust, who will perform at Terraneo in Croatia on 7 August, and two days later at Sziget in Hungary. (In the autumn, we will also introduce the band Zebra Dots (ex-London), who will perform at Waves Vienna in Austria. ) <p/> Toronto's Drug Bust is one of the more exposed Slovenian protagonists of so-called indie-rock. The band was formed as an international project in London in 2007 by frontman Izak Košir (also a music journalist) and Canadian musicians Neil Leyton and Rich Ragany. Shortly after the launch, the latter two left the band and Košir was joined by Finnish musician Rami Helin. The current line-up consists of only Slovenian musicians, along with Košir, Vid Polončič Ruparčič (guitar), Nejc Kržič (bass), Tamir Gostiša (guitar) and Dorian Granda (drums). For the debut album Enfant Terrible, released in 2010 on Sedvex Records, Helin was in charge of recording and production. The album was distributed in the USA and was available on the most well-known online retailers such as Amazon, CD Baby and iTunes.	Information/Explanation	News/Reporting

363	"The opposition SDS party, headed by former Prime Minister Janez Janša, has submitted proposals to Parliament for measures and 5 laws to improve the economic and social crisis. The starting point is the claim ""Slovenia entered the crisis in good shape"", which SDS and J.J. MPs keep repeating. It is true that the period from 2004 to 2008 was a very successful one, both in this country and in the world, but on the other hand, both in the world and in this country, it has been shown that high economic growth and prosperity are based on unrealistic foundations, that a giant inflated bubble has been created which has infamously burst. Slovenia, led by the government of Janez Janša, unfortunately made some big, irreparable mistakes in this ""golden age"", which are plaguing us today in the crisis: Firstly, it did not make the necessary structural changes in any of these favourable times, it did not invest enough in knowledge, research and technological progress. For example, in 2008, the Janša Government allocated a whole million euros for technological and scientific projects in small and medium-sized enterprises; now the figure is already EUR 14 million. Second: In otherwise good times, it has run up huge debts (e.g. motorways were built entirely on credit during this period), it has not reduced the deficit, and what is more, it has even increased it during these fat cow years. Thus, in 2008, gross indebtedness increased by 161 compared with 2004, or from 57% of GDP to 112% of GDP. In order to embellish the balance sheet of your term of office with the accounts, you were prepared to create and trigger a crisis of international proportions because we were not prepared to approve a fictitious budget surplus. The new Government and the crisis that awaited it as soon as it began its work was an empty treasury, nothing, a hole. What is more, the J.J. Government left the new Government full of uncovered bills for pre-election promises that had yet to be found through budget adjustments: money for the extremely damaging public sector wage reform, and thus wage increases that will give us a massive headache, money for student meals, for free nursery schools for the second child ... The previous Government could not have left us a worse bill of goods than yours, Mr Janša. And last but not least, it was the previous Government that allowed and silently monitored the granting of tycoon credits for management takeovers in the so-called state-owned banks NLB and NKBM, which our MEP Vili Trofenik first pointed out, but the information was hidden from him, Minister Bajuk dodged and then disappeared somewhere. Much of the high economic growth was based on credit-financed accelerated construction activity, which also pushed up inflation. Many companies, which were more or less strongly influenced by the state and managed by dedicated personnel close to the government of the day, got into trouble, performed badly and are today on the verge of collapse: Interevropa, Luka Koper, Paloma, Elan, Hit. Not to mention, in particular, the controversial operations at Dravske elektrarne (21 million credit to the Maribor diocese), Eles (financing of Canadian rowers, and Pavlin's Olympics), or the unreasonable decision to build a new building for the Ministry of the Interior, the absurd and excessive purchase of Patrias and a warship, the 200 million increase in the cost of the construction of Block 6 at TEŠ due to the delay in issuing the consent, the inadequate management of the construction of oncology, paediatric and neurological clinics, the new emergency room at the KC ... sad and wasteful stories, which I list with one purpose and one question: do the successors and creators and promoters of all this really have the moral right to criticise, to smarten up, to offer themselves as great saviours? Is it not all just a disguised manoeuvre to divert attention from their own culpability and complicity? The fact is that the previous J.J. Government is unequivocally co-responsible for the difficult situation in which SLO finds itself at the moment. <p/> For a long time, the SDS and the Government of J.J. did not want to and did not acknowledge the crisis that was already prevailing in the world. It was not concerned about the high rise in inflation, which we in Zares, especially our MEP Matej Lahovnik, have been pointing to as the first sign of an unhealthy situation in the economy. Last autumn, you were still saying out loud that there was no crisis in Slovenia and that there would be no crisis, you were doing everything you could to play down the public's predictions of trouble, and you were saying all the time that Slovenia would not be affected by the financial crisis. When the crisis was already here, when experts (e.g. Umar) were already opposing Virjant's public sector wage reform, Virjant was still pushing ahead, and it is precisely this move that has led to the most criticism from the OECD, which is why we are having major problems in the budget. <p/> J.J. said at the Brdo conference on managing the economic crisis a few days ago that the anti-crisis measures of the current Government are ill-advised, those in power do not know what to do, they should rely only on others. Are things really as simple as they are explained by omniscient saviours such as former ministers Vizjak, Grims, Černač ... The whole world is in crisis, the leaders of individual countries are looking for different rescue measures, groping around in the dark, so to speak: some things are proving to be appropriate and effective, others are like a shot in the dark. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists are not unanimous, economists think differently, individual governments look for different ways. Each country has to find its own appropriate way of dealing with the crisis, and in doing so we have to be aware that Slo is not an isolated island, that our economy, which is predominantly an export economy, is influenced by other economies. It is even more true that the resources at our disposal to deal with the crisis are very limited, and we need to think hard about what measures to direct them towards. Is the deliberate and prudent action of the current Government really a harmful delay? Are the measures really unwise, or is it perhaps just a case of recognising that it is really easy for the opposition to propose measures because it does not have to think about global finance, debt, sustainability ... Is it not perhaps just too easy to propose tax cuts and relief in all sorts of areas, while at the same time offering a whole range of 'gifts' such as contributions towards the purchase of housing for young families or a new car - nice, no less. But is it not better to help Revoz and the many manufacturers of parts for the car industry in Slovenia directly than to help the entire global car industry and, in particular, car dealers and car sellers in Slovenia.The Government has prepared a comprehensive response, and we in the Zares Group of MEPs support it. We believe that it has acted appropriately, with the first two packages of measures being prepared primarily to stabilise the financial system, ensure the liquidity of banks and provide funds for the normal operation of businesses. A number of measures were also adopted to ensure better and more efficient absorption of EU funds. The second part of the measures was aimed at preserving jobs, both by encouraging shorter working hours and by encouraging and increasing funds for development investment. The OECD assessed that the measures to help banks were adequate but not yet working. Much can certainly be expected from the guarantee schemes, which have long been blocked because of a veto by the Council of State. In the meantime, 1 500 new companies and 15 000 new jobs have been created with state aid as a result of the measures. We are now facing the coordination and adoption of the measures in the third package. The vast majority of them are generally considered to be good and appropriate. Slovenia needs to find the right mix of measures, given its specificities (e.g. the fact that it generates 70% of its GDP from exports), that will work on the money supply, on the demand for goods and investment and on entrepreneurial activity, but also those that will mitigate the social consequences of the crisis. <p/> A word about the broader dimensions of the SDS and its most exposed members. It is a deliberate action in several directions:first, we are witnessing an increasingly serious and threatening behaviour in the National Assembly, aimed at giving the impression that the functioning of Parliament is anarchic, uncontrollable, full of procedural evasions, procedural gymnastics, creating the impression of an emergency, deliberately prolonged debates, blockages in the work of committees, extraordinary sessions, etc. The Government's performance is portrayed as poor, inadequate, mismanaged, delayed, insufficient, based on internal frictions and inefficiencies. Behind such inflammatory criticism, there is a tacit hope that the Government might lose its compass and stumble into inappropriate and ill-considered solutions that could lead to even greater outrage. But we in the Zares Group of Deputies believe that it is precisely times of crisis that require a lot of talks, coordination, clashing of opinions and concepts of views, social dialogue... In times of crisis, the impression is created that we need a more firm and decisive, authoritative hand, and SDS is already offering it in a certain way. But such a hand can very quickly become a leaden hand. What is happening? People today no longer believe in moderate and reasonable solutions, they are not satisfied with small steps in times of need, they demand quick and radical moves. They are demanding that the guilty be found, that convictions and punishments be handed down, that the scoundrels be dealt with, that there be more order and discipline. And it is not difficult to invite such people, in need and in trouble, into the streets, to goad them against the real and imaginary culprits of their plight, and this is a wonderful warm bed, as Boštjan M. Zupančič says, for various forms of fascism, chauvinism and psychopaths of all kinds. And times of crisis are already known in psychiatry as a paradise for psychopaths. These are already very dangerous matters, which I hope will not be played out in the SLO.In your proposal for measures, you also set out your analysis of the crisis and said that capitalism will emerge from the crisis better, also in value terms, because of its flexibility. A very outdated and ossified mentality. Indeed, many of us are pointing out that economic growth and the model of prosperity that it generates, and that has so far guided global economic growth as a neoliberal and financial model, has not produced good results. It has benefited only a narrow, privileged group, with the rich getting richer and richer, the poor getting poorer and poorer, with capital and ownership privileged and labour deeply undervalued and humiliated and excluded from decision-making. These models were close to your government for most of its mandate (after all, you substantially reduced taxes on the richest, you did not tax wealth) and it was only at the end of your mandate that you started to advocate a social model of the market economy in the light of the forthcoming elections and the poor public image. The current economic growth model is therefore, in our view, socially unjust and, given the limited natural opportunities and goods and the disregard for nature, ecologically unacceptable. Politics also bears a heavy share of the blame for this, as it has been deeply complicit in unethical and immoral behaviour, where power and money have been the only sacred things. Quick money without work. And corruption has become socially acceptable behaviour and the norm. Unfortunately, it has also become rampant in our country and, unfortunately, it has become particularly rampant in recent years, under your government. <p/> Let me conclude my presentation of the Zares Group's views on the measures with a direct assessment of the proposals: <p/> among the measures there are many good, useful and appropriate ones, which the Government will take into account <p/> a whole series of measures that you want to present as your own are merely copied, regurgitated, and are taken verbatim from those already announced and published by the Government <p/> many of the proposed measures are clearly unrealistic, populist, and prepared in order to achieve quick kiss-and-meet-you-good-effects. <p/> While the measures were rejected as inappropriate in the Committee, we would like to stress that, for two reasons in particular <p/> Firstly, as this is only a consideration of the decision that the DZ supports the package of measures, but cannot intervene in their substance, amend or supplement them, the decisions as they stand make it impossible to consider and define each one of them. So in a way: take it or leave it - all or nothing. Is this really what the proposers are saying: that they would like to cooperate and propose to the Government, to help - but their proposal is such that it is virtually untouchable. A very self-important and omniscient move, so to speak. <p/> And secondly: it is an unstoppable and inappropriate method of mixing up normal and established powers between the two branches of government - between the powers that Parliament has and those that the Government has as the executive branch of government. Measures are not merely a matter of setting out a principled direction, but rather of providing concrete guidance for binding action, which is a matter for the Government. The Government must continue to be the policy-maker of the country, which must otherwise be bound by the frameworks set by the National Assembly. What the proponents of the measures are proposing, however, would fundamentally interfere with the role of the Government, even limiting and making it impossible. This, too, suggests that there is, after all, a deliberate dismantling of the three branches of government, as is also indicated by some of the amendments to the Constitution for the Second Republic that are being proposed at the same time. This is already a very dangerous game. That is why we in the Zares Group will not support the measures."	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

368	"Source of the survey, which is also at the bottom of this article. Author of the column. Thirty years ago, his parents might have had a problem with this innocent childish line. If there is a cult of personality and the state is a proletarian dictatorship - and in the SFRY it was almost a constitutional principle that the proletariat was in power - then children in schools must not make a fool of the supreme authority. <p/> Indeed, until the end of the 1980s and the Slovenian constitutional amendments, Article 133 of the Penal Code, which criminalised freedom of conscience and expression, was also in force. The verbal offence meant that one was not allowed to speak over the state, the system and the leaders. The statement ""Comrade Tito has a fat arse"" would have caused problems with the authorities in the SFRY. <p/> For many people who are strangers to Slovenia's obsession with socialism and Titoism, it is inconceivable how, in 2012, so many sensible people can be fascinated by the figure of one of the typical dictators of the 20th century. Because twenty years ago, nobody thought about Josip Broz.In the late 1980s, when democratisation was beginning, you would have laughed at someone idolising a marshal or even dressing in similar uniforms. <p/> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it did not occur to people to deplore Yugoslavia, Titoism or self-management. There were too many challenges, and faith in the future was strong. Interestingly, there was no noteworthy event at Dražgoše in that period either. Third-class officials spoke, a few hundred people gathered. <p/> At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Titoism died out in Slovenia. <p/> Then something started to change at the beginning of the new millennium. Dražgoše suddenly took on a whole new glow and significance. They became a kind of value centre for an orthodox, pre-modern and quasi-partisan political rallying cry, aimed at mobilising the far-left electorate. In the light of historical facts, Dražgoše became Lažgoše. <p/> On a broader, social level, a reinterpretation of Titoism and history in Yugoslavia began to take place. Instead of historians shedding light on all the characters of the time - the only exception being Professor Jože Pirjevec's biography Tito and Comrades - and honestly saying that Slovenia had a semi-colonial attitude towards the southern fraternal republics (no, Slovenians will never admit that), an avalanche of amateurish interpretations of our heroic history took hold. <p/> Suddenly, we became the only nation to have preserved the tradition of Titoism. Only in Slovenia is the attitude towards Josip Broz markedly positive, and the memories of the SFRY bright and nostalgic. <p/> What is the reason for this, why is it so? <p/> Probably from our social pathology. Because other, much larger and more historic nations, which have the historical traumas of the 20th century, face similar problems in evaluating their psychopathic leaders - regardless of the degree of their autocracy. The Spanish, for example, with Franco. But Franco was at least as benevolent a dictator as our Tito. <p/>The Italians did not come clean with Mussolini. Partly because of a horribly incorrect education system which has not yet established the right degree of critical distance from the fascist period. <p/> The Russians are reviving the cult of the Georgian Stalin. They, too, have freaks dressing up in uniforms just like those worn by the Generalissimo with the moustache and going around, addressing people, appearing at obscure and less obscure events, pinching children's cheeks and saying that they are Stalin. <p/>Sick. But in societies that have not come clean about their traumas and fears, it happens. There is not such a big difference between Russia and Slovenia in this respect. <p/> The only reason Germans can't openly emulate Hitler (except right-wing extremists, whose political activities are largely banned) is because they have been sent through a process of denazification by their Western allies. The Austrians got away with it, hence Haider. <p/> There are more problems with the Slovenes. I have already written about this. The worse the present, the better the memories of the past. Since there can be no biological link with Titoism in the younger generations, institutionalised nostalgia for the old days is reinforced. This is no longer an innocent joke perpetrated by a certain Godnič. The revival of memories of the Day of Youth and the Titoist relay is a phenomenon per se. It is yet more proof of how lost, hopeless and pre-oedipal our 'liberal' and 'democratic' society is. <p/> So that there is no misunderstanding: the cult of Tito, of Franco or of Mussolini should be cultivated by people in peace in their own homes and, for my sake, in their cellars. In their private lives, they can do whatever they want. They cannot do it in public, or even within the framework of public institutions. <p/> Can you imagine if we had been lamenting Titoism in 1988 or 1992? Of course not. Only a few radicals did it then. Most Slovenians were happy to be out of the SFRY and out of the poverty of a failing country. <p/>Why, then, does it feel different today? Because of the economic and social situation? Certainly, the middle class is already or will soon be impoverished, more and more people are living on the poverty line, and in such a crisis situation it is understandable to recall times that most people no longer even remember, but are considered socially just (nobody went hungry, everybody was employed and similar wingnuts). But only in a society that is still a long way from maturity. Only in a country that is not aware of the foundations of its statehood. <p/> The idolatry of Titoism and the cult of personality is not irrational, as many people think. In my view, it all comes together in the context of Slovenian social pathology. We lived a relatively comfortable life materially and socially in the SFRY. The party elite in general. When the system collapsed because it was based on economically unsustainable assumptions, we decided to try capitalism. <p/> Capitalism has not worked very well in Slovenia. A friend of mine, who is a top workaholic and manager, says that the reason it has not is that the Slovenes have been 'Balkanised' by Yugoslavia and simply do not want to work any more. <p/> That is probably true to a certain extent. But the key problem of the hysteria about Tito and the Day of Youth can be identified very easily: as a country we have no identity, as a nation we have no will and no energy. <We really do not deserve a country of our own. And to paraphrase our beloved Titoists, Josip Broz would never have given it to us either. <Josip Broz symbolises socialist Yugoslavia after the Second World War: the reconstruction and construction of a war-torn country, socialist self-management, resistance to Stalin and the policy of non-alignment. It symbolises peace and full employment. On the other hand, it symbolises the cult of personality, the Naked Island, the beheading of liberals and the post-war killings. Under his leadership, Yugoslavia enjoyed great prestige in the world, and he will be remembered as an exceptional statesman. <p/> Špela Šipek, editor <p/> I think most people remember Tito as the figure of the commander who led the partisan army to victory over the fascist invaders and traitors. He symbolises the figure on the pedestal through which the PR machine promoted positive values such as comradeship, brotherhood, education, strengthening of mind and body. And, on the other hand, it symbolises the crime against those killed immediately after the end of the war and the persecuted political opponents. It thus symbolises the trauma of a part of the Slovene nation whose ancestors were killed or imprisoned, and of a part of the Slovene nation that is proud of its resistance against fascism. Although Josip Broz-Tito symbolises the past in its entirety, he also symbolises the division of the Slovenian nation, which is no less fervent now than it was twenty or sixty years ago. <p/> Janez Furman, parish priest <p/> Broz and Kardelj once came to the cross while walking along Brdo and looked up at Christ. Edi begins to explain how their lives were not always exemplary, yet they had come so far and this poor man had worked for the good of mankind and finally ended up on the cross. The marshal replies, ""Eddie, when we die, they will have no nails. ""And indeed, at the time of their deaths, you had a hard time coming up with nails. Before a critical historical distance can place Tito in the real context of his era, there will be spears being broken about his personality and his time in charge of the late SFRY. The abuse and the immature view of democracy have led many to associate the Marshal's figure as a mythical hero. Others who survived the Naked Island or any other repression would have erected a memorial to his sacrifice. Despite his glorification, we are all ordinary mortals together. <p/> Nina Ivanič, actress <p/> It is difficult for me to answer this question objectively, because as a primary school pupil I was constantly listening to and learning about Tito as someone who was all goodness, honesty, heart, ability and I could go on and on. In our childhood eyes, he was a great hero and a man with a big heart. That is what we were taught, that is what we believed. But there are two sides to every story, and so there are two sides to Tito's story. Over the years, many things have been revealed and all the glamour around Tito has slowly dissipated. In my adult eyes, he now symbolises something quite different from all of the above. Behind the pretty veneer, there is often an ugly and dirty side. <p/> Jure Apih, columnist <p/> There is not one Tito, there are many Tito's. He is the locksmith apprentice from Zagorje who learned to play the piano without any schooling, who won a medal in sabre fencing from the Austrian army and danced with the Queen of England on his island. He is a Bolshevik agent who mysteriously survived Stalin's purges. He is the leader and marshal of the only real resistance army in the Second World War. He is the war criminal responsible for the greatest indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners and civilians in Europe. He is the only leader who dared to stand up to Stalin and to lead his people on a third path between socialism and capitalism, between one-man rule and self-rule. He is the historic spiritual leader of a non-aligned world, of more than half of humanity, and his funeral brought together a crowd of world leaders like never before. He was a thistle and a ""sweetheart white"". Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo is the apprentice against him. <p/> Irena Prijovic, economist <p/> JBT symbolises the leader of Yugoslavia. What this symbol means to whom depends on the individual. It depends on which generation one belongs to, whether one is and how one lived at that time, whether one is a foreigner or someone who was once a Yugoslav. It depends on how history is summarised and interpreted. Personally, I associate Tito with a peaceful childhood, my own ignorance and the kind of illusion we were living at the time. <p/> I have just returned from Berlin and I am still under the impression of the symbols of the divisions of post-war Germany in that city. While the East Germans demolished the wall for a long time in various ways, and once it physically fell, we ourselves paid the highest possible price by fighting a war on the premises of the former state. <p/> Dr. Samo Rugelj, columnist <p/> It depends for whom. For some of the older generation, Tito is often still a symbol of the ""good old days"", when life was more carefree, albeit with a lower standard of living and political monogamy, but without existential fears. To my generation, Tito was a great leader who was forged into heroic heights for us with stories and songs, but personally he is best remembered for his illness, his treatment at the Clinical Centre and his magnificent funeral. I no longer had any special emotional relationship with him: when I spent a good year in Belgrade a few years later in the army, I was not drawn to the House of Flowers, even though Slovenians like to go there. For the younger generations, our children, Tito is a textbook historical figure who led Yugoslavia, or the SFRY, and they need to think hard to remember what that acronym even means."

399	"The seventh solo book by Metka Klevišar, a physician and journalist, Goreči grm (Burning Bush), was published by the Celjska Mohorjeva družba. Together with it, the correspondence between St. Vincent and St. Ludovika, collected and edited by Sister Cveta Jost, and a reprint or revised edition of Robert Cvetek's book on trauma, The Pain of the Past, were presented today. <p/> What all three books have in common is that, as Andrej Arko, the editor-in-chief of the publishing house, put it at the presentation, television programmes and the press do not talk about. That human life is not perfect, that it contains not only achievements but also failures. <p/> Klevišarjeva found the inspiration for her book The Burning Bush among her notes on spirituality in the dying, but it made more sense to her to talk about spirituality in everyday life - and that is the subtitle of the book. She believes that spirituality is everyone's business, whether they are religious or not, and whatever their faith. She wanted to convey in a simple way that spirituality is ""the mystery of life, which we cannot explain, but each person interprets in his own way"". <p/> The book Letters of St Vincent to St Ludovica was published on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St Vincent de Paul and St Ludovica de Marillac. In collaboration with the Daughters of Christian Charity - the Daughters of Charity, of which St Ludovica was the founder, a Sister of that Order, Cveta Jost, has collected and edited the 421 surviving letters written by St Vincent to St Ludovica. The correspondence, she says, is a valuable document of the times, revealing the misery of 17th-century France and the efforts of both saints to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. <p/> Robert Cvetek's painful past resonated with readers, and the Celje Mohorjeva družba has published a reprint or slightly revised edition. The book deals with trauma, interpersonal relationships, family and therapy and is, as the author's colleague Katarina Kompan Erzar from the Franciscan Family Institute said, ""an attempt to talk about things that are manageable"". The work does not only present the dark side of living, but also the good news: research shows that trauma can be overcome."	News/Reporting	Information/Explanation
403	Strike at Maribor Sanitec <p/> Today at 6:00, around 200 workers of Sanitec, a subsidiary of Maribor Foundries, went on strike. <p/> Share <p/> According to Janja Veber from the Metal and Electrical Industry Trade Union (Skei) in MLM, the workers are striking because of unpaid wages and because the fate of Sanitec is not clear, i.e. they need to be told what is going to happen to them. The strike will last until called off. <p/> The Sanitec programme combines the production of sanitary and kitchen fittings and the production of forgings. <p/> It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maribor Foundries Maribor (MLM), which failed to convince enough shareholders at Tuesday's general meeting to recapitalise. <p/> At the AGM, the owners are expected to decide on a recapitalisation in the form of a new conversion of NKBM, Abanka Vipa and Probanka's receivables into equity. The planned conversion would increase the ownership of these banks to over 75%. The total increase of EUR 17.4 million in the company's share capital was to be used to cover the EUR 12 million loss incurred in the past. <p/> Mariborská livarna Maribor has been in a liquidity crunch for some time, which has led to several strike threats.

412	In January 2011, we started training 14 new Quality Advisers as part of the Quality Advisers in Adult Education project. The selected Quality Advisers will carry out the planned quality development activities through meetings at the Andragogical Centre of Slovenia, while the rest of the quality development work will be carried out concurrently in their own organisations, for 32 hours per month. <p/> At the first meeting, which took place on 26 June 2012. <p/> The participants of the first meeting of the Adult Education Quality Advisors project <p/> received basic information about the content and the way of working in the project, <p/> got acquainted with the role of a quality advisor in adult education, <p/> got acquainted with one of the qualitative methods for assessing and developing quality, namely the peer assessment method, <p/> and got acquainted with an overview of the published content on the web on assessing and developing the quality of education for adults.<p/> The participants of the first meeting of the project were invited to participate in the project. <p/> At the second meeting, on 9 March 2011, the participants devoted their full attention to preparing for the collegial visit to the six selected training organisations. <p/> Dr Tanja Možina with participants during the preparation of the peer review of the self-evaluation report <p/> In terms of the role of peer reviewers, they learned: <p/> how to judge a self-evaluation report and give a peer review, <p/> how to prepare for a discussion with different stakeholders (director/principal, teachers, participants, educational organisers... ), <p/> how to give feedback to the organisation hosting the visit, and <p/> how to prepare a record of the peer review visit which will be used as a basis for the preparation of the final report. <p/> In terms of the role of the coordinators of a collegiate visit in an educational organisation, they learnt: <p/> how to prepare for a collegiate visit in an organisation and <p/> what to look out for during and at the end of the visit. <p/> Through role-playing, the participants also role-played the process of the peer auditors' group discussion with the head teacher, a teacher, a member of the quality team and the quality advisor. The other participants acted as observers of the conversation. <p/> During the period 21 April to 24 May 2011, peer visits took place in six educational organisations. The subject of the audit during the peer visits was the internal quality system used by the educational organisations. Each organisation was audited by a team of three peer auditors who, prior to the visit, reviewed the self-evaluation report, prepared an audit against pre-defined criteria and prepared audit questions to shed further light on certain aspects or to clarify certain information contained in the report. <p/> Hosts of the Peer Visits discussing their impressions of the preparation and implementation of the Peer Review <p/> At the third meeting, held on 7 June 2011, the participants first discussed their impressions of the Peer Review method and then received some guidance on how to prepare the final Peer Review report.

She has already had a few hits, such as Time for Us, Problemom sredinc and the latest one Smile of Life. Today, the pretty Prekmurje girl is studying at the Faculty of Education, which she attends. She is looking forward to the challenge ahead of her, when one day, after she graduates, she will step into her classroom and teach children. <p/> 04.11.2013, 09:57 Rebeka Dremelj, who likes to share moments from her performances and private life with the public via her Facebook profile, posted a photo some time ago in which a man stood next to her, standing tall and wearing nothing but a hat to cover his carrot. Why did this photo upset some people? <p/> 04.11.2013, 09:56 After two decades of swimming, our top swimmer has announced that he is ending his swimming career and going to Turkey, where he has been offered a job at a new swimming club. His girlfriend, now fiancée, is going with him. <p/> 30.10.2013, 15:31 Brown-haired Nina likes to draw attention to herself, either by her behaviour or by the clothes she wears in public, but apparently her attention-seeking is not something she just does, but something that has its roots in her childhood, when she was a victim of abuse. <p/> 04.11.2013, 10:43 After shocking Slovenia with an 18-page letter and a suicide attempt, Nena Nevenka Muršič, who became known to the general public when she entered the Big Brother house, has bounced back to life. <p/> 30.10.2013, 11:52 The paparazzi's job is mainly to catch celebrities off guard, in unusual positions, making mistakes and - in the case of the fairer sex - unshaven and unkempt. But sometimes the wait is in vain, as some celebrities serve up the shots themselves. <p/> 30.10.2013, 09:54 Former teen heartbreaker Luke Perry, who shot to fame with his role in the popular 90s series Beverly Hills, has resurfaced in public after a long time. But the paparazzi would hardly recognise him. Not much was left of the former seducer, and when he turned up on the streets of London wearing a black coat and a cap, many wondered what had happened to the actor. <p/> 29.10.2013, 15:57 Balkan singer Jelena Karleuša is a fashion icon and a fan in Serbia, spending thousands of euros on clothes. Her style is imitated by many of her fans, and even those who are not the biggest fans of Jelena cannot deny that she has excellent taste in fashion. The Slovenian fashion designer Marjan Krnjič, who has been working with the singer for many years, is also credited with making sure that she is always well-groomed from head to toe. He also took care of her look during her last visit to Slovenia, and they have recently deepened their collaboration. <p/> 29.10.2013, 14:36 Three months after leaving rehab, Lindsay Lohan is back to her old habits, which have put her at odds with the law countless times in the past. But it seems that the star is still not tired of it. The 27-year-old, who has a chequered history of addiction problems, has gone off the rails again and it's only a matter of time before she finds herself in the dock in front of a judge. How this will affect her career... we dare not even think. <p/> 29.10.2013, 08:18 Retired footballer David Beckham met the police at the scene of a car accident he had caused at his home. The accident occurred when he was trying to leave his house in his luxury SUV but was struck by a passing vehicle. <p/> 04.11.2013, 10:42 Natalia Verboten recently surprised everyone by releasing the music video for her single ""Bum Bum Bum"", showing herself in a very different - even sexier - light. But apparently her new video has gone down very well with some people, and Natalija is very surprised! <p/> 29.10.2013, 10:10 When Slovenia was shocked seven years ago by an incredible bank robbery in Ljubljana, which many people did not understand how the robbers had managed to pull off, one of the victims was Mojca Javh, a failed contestant on the show Gostilna hledče šefa (Restaurant Seeks the Boss). <p/> 28.10.2013, 11:30 Hajdi Korošec, who Slovenia got to know when she was a little girl singing children's songs, most famously with the hit Our Puppy, recently announced on her Facebook profile that she is engaged, and now she has a new surname and the status 'married'! It is also rumoured that she is expecting. <p/> 28.10.2013, 11:35 Mišo Stevanović, one of the most popular commentators on Restaurant Seeking a Chef, likes to be well-groomed and well-groomed no matter what he does or where he is. He admitted to us that he is addicted to recreation. Taking care of your body is absolutely everyone's duty, says Mišo, who, in addition to regular exercise, also pays a lot of attention to the clothes he wears. <p/> 28.10.2013, 10:45 The singer Kesha has repeatedly raised dust in the past with her wild behaviour, even drinking her own urine, and her latest statement was considered by many to be the height of it. The star claims that her vagina was possessed by ghosts and that only now, after undergoing an exorcism, she is free again. ""My therapist told me that there were dead people in my vagina,"" said the singer, who shocked last year by saying that she had sex with ghosts. And apparently she hasn't finished her story yet. <p/> 28.10.2013, 08:09 A source close to the late King of Pop Michael Jackson's family raised a lot of dust a few days ago when he admitted to the media how jealous the singer's mother Katherine was that actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom Michael had a really special relationship, had stolen her baby. The resentment is said to be so deep that Katherine today does not want to hear about it, nor to sit in the chair where the legendary actress once sat. <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:53 Actress Jodie Foster admitted to being a lesbian in 2007, with tears in her eyes, when she received the Best Women in Entertainment industry award. Since then, she has been searching for happiness, and it seems she has finally found it. Her heart has now warmed to photographer Alexandra Hedison, ex-girlfriend of presenter Ellen DeGeneres. But the question still remains, who is the real father of Jodie's biological children? Is it really Mel Gibson? <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:39 Mexican reporter Andrea Vilash met with La Original Banda El Limon for an interview. But the conversation veered into completely different waters and the reporter was left without panties. And her job, of course. Watch the video! <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:39... peeing in her torn dress. American film actress Hayden Panettiere proudly showed off her new engagement ring at the recent Environmental Media Awards. She probably would have been a little less proud of the cameras if someone had told her that her dress was ripped ... <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:31 Kendall and Kylie Jenner are the younger sisters of the more famous Kardashian sisters, who are slowly following in their footsteps and rising to fame. But a few days ago, they apparently got a little off track and visited one of the notorious sex-themed nightclubs in Los Angeles. The two teenagers tricked the security guards with fake IDs, and now the US media are reporting that they are facing an investigation. <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:30 Porn star Mary Carey is in the middle of a scandal after she had to be literally dragged off a plane because she was dead drunk and threatened to sabotage a big party in Florida with naked people. It seems that the adult film actress, who had already been treated for addiction a few years ago, has succumbed to alcohol again. <p/> 22.10.2013, 11:28 American starlet Kim Kardashian gave birth for the first time a few months ago and has managed to lose almost all the extra pounds. But even before North West was born, her famous mother was already thinking about stripping for Playboy. The star was determined to sculpt her body and show the world that she was the sexiest mum in Hollywood. <p/> 25.10.2013, 13:47 ... showing her panties to everyone. British starlet Katie Price enjoyed a night out with husband Kieran Hyler, and wore a (too) short mini skirt for the occasion. This revealed not only her knickers, but also her thighs full of cellulite. While this doesn't show when Katie is standing up, it's a completely different story when she sits down. <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:26 Busty, blonde Hollywood star Pamela Anderson ran along the beach in a red swimsuit and won men's hearts in Coast Guard a few years ago. Now she's decided to take her running up a notch - she's taking part in the New York City Marathon! <p/> 25.10.2013, 15:14 For the past 15 years, every weekend (with few exceptions) has been a busy one for Croatian singer Maja Šuput. She and her band members decided to take a camera with them one weekend, record what happens to them - and publish it uncensored! <p/> 25.10.2013, 14:32 The ex-wife of former tennis ace Goran Ivanišević, Tatjana Dragović, makes no secret of the fact that she takes care of her firm body with regular workouts. Recently, her friends posted a photo on Instagram that could easily be mistaken for Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. <p/> 25.10.2013, 11:58 Although it has been rumoured for some time that the famous marriage between the beautiful Miranda Kerr and the Hollywood actor Orlando Bloom was sizzling, the two celebrity parents have carefully protected and defended their family idyll in public. But all is not as it seemed at first sight, their spokesperson confirmed today, informing the media that the two celebrities are splitting up. <p/> 25.10.2013, 09:34 Singer Katherine McPhee made headlines around the world overnight. No, it wasn't a new musical success that launched her to stardom, but the fact that she was caught by the paparazzi kissing an older Hollywood director, Michael Morris. Nothing new, you might say, everyone cheats in Hollywood anyway, but so what when they're both still (happily) married. Well, at least it looked like it ... <p/> 25.10.2013, 09:28 Manca Špik is packing her bags and leaving for a month-long trip around Australia. And although the yellow media focused mainly on the fact that her ex-boyfriend Primož will accompany her there, the singer is looking forward to the trip mainly because she has a concert tour waiting for her there. She has been invited by Helena Blagna's ex-husband Mitja Zaman. This year, he has replaced his ex-wife with a blonde singer, and Manca has accepted the invitation with great enthusiasm. <p/> 24.10.2013, 16:07 Popular singer Jan Plestenjak was horrified to learn that the government is considering a proposal that would require firefighters to pay a tax on firehouses from now on. ""I can't even believe this is true?! "" wrote the singer on his social network Facebook, who was shocked by the decision of our country's leadership. Of course, he is not the only one, and the comments under his post have been pouring in - one after the other. <p/> 25.10.2013, 09:36 Last year's ski season was enjoyed by the whole of Slovenia and she has supporters abroad. And the one and only Tina Maze has further increased her popularity by releasing a single, My way is my decision, which will be heard exclusively on Je Bella Cesta in Slovenian for the first time today. And it's not just about music, but also about beauty in the white ski caravan. <p/> 24.10.2013, 14:11 The singer Danijela Vranić has had a number of health problems in the past year, including mental health problems, which have been repeatedly reported in the Serbian media. This is also believed to be a key reason why she has gained some excess weight in the meantime, which she has been struggling with unsuccessfully for the last few weeks. For a short period of time, she withdrew from the media because of her terrible appearance, which, to be honest, she was not the most happy with. But now, after undergoing liposuction, she is ready for a big comeback. <p/> 24.10.2013, 13:36 Hollywood is rocked by a new scandal these days, and this time the famous rapper Sean Combs - Diddy - is at the centre of it. According to the US tabloid Radar Online, the star was recently questioned by investigators who wanted to check whether the ex-boyfriend of Latin diva Jennifer Lopez really did have sex with underage boys, while he himself spoke publicly for the first time about his cheating father, who was killed when Diddy was just 3 years old. <p/> 24.10.2013, 10:18 Actor Owen Wilson is making the headlines these days after photographers caught him making out with a buxom brunette who is definitely not the girl he's expecting a baby with. Although he only admitted a few days ago that he was going to be a dad for the second time, that has apparently not stopped him one bit. He just couldn't resist the passionate kisses on the street. <p/> 24.10.2013, 10:15 Slovenian businessman Erazem B. Pintar became a dad for the second time yesterday. The new baby, Bor Benjamin, has arrived and made his mum Tej and dad Erazem very happy. The new dad wrote some very touching thoughts on his Facebook page. In an emotional outpouring, he thanked the mother of his two children and publicly confessed how grateful he was to have found her, even though he had been looking for her for a quarter of a century. <p/> 23.10.2013, 10:47 A bunch of photos showing very intimate moments of the British royal family have found their way online. One shows the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with baby Prince George in a bath, another shows the family lying on a bed, and a third shows the Queen ... <p/> 23.10.2013, 10:45 In the space of two days, two contestants on the British TV show X Factor had to be rushed to hospital. First, a pregnant contestant was taken there by ambulance, and a day later, a contestant who fell down the stairs awkwardly. <p/> 22.10.2013, 15:01 The star, who started her career as a child on Disney's children's programme, was a tiny teenager at the start of her solo career. She went on to become a woman with a perfect body, but after giving birth, the pounds started piling on uncontrollably. See how she managed to transform her body! <p/> 22.10.2013, 13:38 A 26-year-old Ljubljana man was chosen as the third person to leave last night's reality show ""Restaurant Chef"", and with it the battle for the prize worth 50 thousand euros. Žiga Šinkovec has shown himself to Slovenia as a man with a forked tongue in the weeks he has spent on the show. He was accused of being too much of an individualist, of needing to learn how to be part of a team, and his boss Bine advised him that he needed to get down to the real world from time to time. Well, in his own style, Žiga says that he ignores the criticism and stands by his words and actions. <p/> 22.10.2013, 11:45 The popular Hollywood actress, famous for her charity work, has not been in the media much lately, but with the announcement of her autobiography, she is once again becoming a hot topic in the world media. There's talk of an autobiography worth as much as 30 million! <p/> 22.10.2013, 09:56 The Slovenian entertainer Suzana Jakšič recently placed an 'advert' on Facebook about her need for artificial nails, facial and body treatments, and in return she is offering media advertising. In addition to the advert, she posted a photo that many consider to be quite daring ... <p/> 22.10.2013, 08:07 After photographer Črt Slavec, with whom the beauty Iris Mulej has been in a long relationship, was caught in the company of a dark-haired woman at the recently concluded fashion week, the media was flooded with news that he has a new girlfriend. Yes, he does have a girlfriend, he confirmed it first-hand, but the fact is that judging by the photos, the wrong companion was attributed to him. <p/> 22.10.2013, 09:53 Sofia Vergara, star of the comedy series Modern Family, became a mum at the age of 19. But do you know what the now 41-year-old sexy Colombian looked like at 19, barely a month after giving birth? <p/> 21.10.2013, 13:12 If last year, in the hugely popular reality show ""Restaurant Seeks the Chef"", we witnessed not only an open fight for the prestigious award, but also a love affair between Teja Perjet and Jani Jugovic, this year we are witnessing mostly insults, jerks and sneakiness, says last year's contestant, who met the love of her life on the show. <p/> 21.10.2013, 12:52 At least that is what a Croatian portal claims, saying that Serbian manager Milan Popovic was only 'defending' Croatian star Severina, who allegedly had a baby boy, Aleksandar, with a Serbian mafioso. Was Severina's relationship with Milan really just a media hoax? <p/> 21.10.2013, 10:08 Star magazine has a reputation for turning even the simplest news story into a drama. They have done just that with their latest cover, where they claim to have discovered the real reason why Kris and Bruce Jenner are getting divorced. According to them, the main obstacle to their marriage not working out is the fact that Bruce wants to become a woman. <p/> 18.10.2013, 15:28 Former Italian footballer Christian Vieri, also known to many as Bobo Vieri, is considered a real playboy. This time in Miami, he was caught by the paparazzi lounging on the beach with a mysterious brunette. The girl, like all Vieri's girlfriends so far, is extremely sexy. <p/> 18.10.2013, 15:33 The world-famous DJ David Guetta, who is already well known to the Slovenian public, likes to relax on the beach after a busy night of entertaining the crowds in the most prestigious nightclubs until the early hours of the morning. This time he decided to recharge his batteries on the famous Miami beach in the company of a lovely lady who is not his wife. <p/> 18.10.2013, 15:25 She wanted to celebrate her 28th birthday in style, but Nicola Roberts was not prepared for the surprise her friends had in store for her. Photos of her toe being sucked by a man wearing a black face mask in one of Amsterdam's most notorious nightclubs have emerged on Instagram."	List of Summaries/Excerpts	List of Summaries/Excerpts

439	"The Bologna Renewal <p/> The central objective of the Bologna Declaration (BD) is the creation of an open Common Higher Education Area (CEEA), allowing European students and higher education staff to move freely within it, to have comparable skills and competences, and to be employable. <p/> The Bologna Process takes its name from the Bologna Declaration, signed in Bologna (Italy) in 1999 by ministers responsible for higher education from 29 European countries, including Slovenia. The document set the guidelines for the development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process (BP) is to be implemented in the signatory countries (and other countries later associated) by 2010. <p/> The objective is to be achieved through various measures such as the establishment of comparable and transparent higher education structures and levels, mutual recognition of relevant and comparable higher education qualifications, the establishment of mutually recognised credit and quality assurance systems, the promotion of student and teacher mobility, the development of the European dimension in education and the increased competitiveness of European higher education in the world. <p/> The BP Guidelines also link to one of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, which foresees that by 2010 Europe will be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. <p/> The path to the BE is also represented by previous documents, reflecting in particular the aspirations for university autonomy, comparable qualifications and their recognition within the ERA, and their standardisation. <p/> Despite the scope opened up by the BD, it is not a comprehensive document specifying implementation and serving as a ""how-to guide"", but leaves a large degree of autonomy to HEIs and partners. Nevertheless, the CBD highlights some key points: <p/> the central role of universities in the development of the European cultural dimensions <p/> the independence and autonomy of universities <p/> the ERA as the main route to mobility and employability of EU citizens and the overall development of the continent <p/> the adaptation of higher education systems to constant social change and the evolution of scientific knowledge <p/> the international competitiveness of European higher education. <p/> The main objectives of the BD Declaration are: <p/> the adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees, including the ""Diploma Supplement"" form - in order to foster the recruitment of European citizens and the international competitiveness of the European higher education system <p/> the adoption of a system with two main levels of study, the Bachelor (minimum 3 years) and the Postgraduate (Master, PhD) degrees awarded after the first level, is also relevant for the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification <p/> establishing the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) as an appropriate means of facilitating greater student mobility Credits could also be obtained through lifelong learning <p/> promoting mobility <p/> promoting European cooperation in quality assurance, by developing comparable criteria and methodologies <p/> fostering the necessary European dimension in higher education, in particular in relation to curriculum development, inter-institutional cooperation, mobility schemes and integrated study, training and research programmes. <p/> Ministers of the signatory countries meet every 2 years to assess the state of implementation of the BP in the individual Member States and in the ERA as a whole. Each ministerial meeting is followed by a communiqué with proposals for further development. The number of associated countries has increased significantly since 1999, to 45. <p/> What does the reform of higher education bring you? <p/> At the end of May this year, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted an amendment to the Law on Higher Education, and in mid-June the Law on Recognition and Valuation of Education was adopted. These two laws constitute the basis for the implementation of the higher education reform, which is based on the guidelines of the Bologna Process, or the process of creating a single European Higher Education Area. The reform will be introduced gradually by higher education institutions (faculties, academies, etc.), and the following innovations will be the most visible for students: <p/> 1. New structure of studies <p/> a) Studies will now be shorter and divided into three diploma levels: <p/> * 1. Bachelor's degree, which lasts three or four years and is run as a higher professional degree or university degree * Bachelor's degree, or Master's degree, which lasts one or two years (so that together with the first bachelor's degree in the same field of expertise, it lasts five years) * Bachelor's degree, or Doctoral degree, which lasts three years. <p/> Exceptions are study programmes for professions regulated by European Union directives, which may be structured differently. <p/> b) Conditions for admission to the higher degree <p/> To be admitted to the second cycle, you must have completed a first cycle degree in a relevant professional field. If it is not in the same field of study (e.g. if a student wishes to continue his/her studies in economics at a second level after completing a first degree in mechanical engineering), a maximum of 60 credits of additional study may be prescribed for this transition. These can be taken as part of the electives in the first bachelor's degree, or through examinations and courses prior to enrolment in the second bachelor's degree. <p/> Admission to the third cycle is open to anyone who has completed the second cycle, who has completed programmes in professions governed by EU directives which are worth 300 credits or more, or who has completed a four-year programme at level 1 and who has demonstrated specific achievements which can be assessed at 60 credits. <p/> As a general rule, 60 credits will be awarded for admission to the new two-year programmes at the second cycle to those who have completed the old bachelor's degree programmes in the same or related fields of study. <p/> The completion of a specialisation may be used for admission to the third cycle only if there has been a notable success in research or professional work, which may be assessed at 60 credits, or if additional study requirements of 60 credits have been set. <p/> Those who have completed a master's degree under the old system shall be awarded 60 credits of study requirements on entry to the third cycle (doctoral studies). <p/> c) Deadline for the introduction of the new structure and transition period <p/> The first academic year in which enrolment in the new degree programmes should be possible will be 2005/2006, and the last academic year for the introduction of the new study structure will be 2009/2010. <p/> Students enrolled in higher education before the introduction of the new study programmes will continue and complete their studies under the conditions in force at the time of their enrolment, up to the end of the academic year 2015/2016. If a student repeats a year and the programme in which he/she enrolled is no longer available, he/she shall continue and complete his/her studies under the new study programmes. <p/> 2. Diploma Supplement <p/> All students will receive a Diploma Supplement free of charge together with their diploma, which will be issued in Slovene and one of the official languages of the European Union. The Diploma Supplement is an integral part of the diploma which includes information about the higher education system and the student's performance (grades), as well as a unified description of the nature, level, content and status of the study programme. Students will benefit from the introduction of the Diploma Supplement, as all the skills and knowledge they have acquired during their studies will now be recorded in the Diploma Supplement, which will also make it easier for them to find a good job and to enrol for further studies. <Study requirements in the study programmes will now be evaluated in terms of credit points (ECTS), which means that each student's workload in the official programme will be credited (the work a student puts in to complete the requirements, including seminars, tutorials, independent study, lectures, the preparation of a thesis, etc.). Each year of the study programme will comprise 60 credits. The first cycle will be 180 or 240 credits (three or four years), the second cycle will be 60 or 120 credits (one to two years, but in such a way that, in the same field of expertise, together with the first cycle, the programme lasts for five years), and the third cycle will be 180 credits (three years). <Joint study programmes <p/> Higher education institutions will be allowed to establish and run joint study programmes with other Slovenian and foreign higher education institutions. This means that students will study at different higher education institutions within one study programme and will obtain one joint degree at the end of their studies. <p/> ... will now be cheaper, shorter and simpler and will replace the nostrification system used until now. <p/> 6. Tuition fees and access to studies <p/> No tuition fees can be charged for full-time studies at public higher education institutions at the first degree level. Free studies at the second cycle will be provided to at least 30 % of students, with social status, regional representation and the scarcity of professions being taken into account as criteria for determining the proportion of students to be included in this ratio, in the ratio 70:20:10. <Co-governance and student participation will be increased <p/> Student membership of higher education bodies has been increased from one in seven to one in five, and students now have one in five votes in the election of university rectors. Student surveys will also be given greater importance in the area of student co-governance. Students will also be represented in the Public Agency for Higher Education, which will carry out external evaluations of higher education. <p/> 8. Foreign students: <p/> can receive scholarships in Slovenia, but only if the principle of reciprocity is applied <p/> lectures will be able to be organised in a foreign language, even if the lecture is not also organised in Slovene."

444	Frames for your posters <p/> There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering poster frames. We also need to consider where the frames and posters will be placed. If it is a marketing poster that will be installed outside, you need to be aware that it will be exposed to the weather. It is wise in this case to purchase waterproof frames so that the first storm does not destroy the posters, because in this case our efforts would be for nothing. The easiest way to find quality poster frames is online, as there are many quality manufacturers (3d art). Of course, it is always best to choose one where you can see at first glance a good price/quality ratio. Frames also differ in a few other ways, mainly in terms of where they will be hung. So you can choose from shop window frames, wall frames, hanging frames and, wouldn't you believe it, car frames. In fact, larger vehicles can be fitted with frames designed for marketing posters. Not only are frames made in traditional sizes, but you can also adjust the size of the frames to suit your needs and your poster format. Nowadays, it is well known that designers love to be creative and for creative posters you will also need creative frames. It is for the latter that some companies specialising in the production of marketing accessories will be able to help you and provide you with what you expect at the best prices. You should also consider that the frames will be functional and that you will be able to easily change the posters on display.	Instruction	Instruction

Although there is a lot of talk about it being a commercial hill, it just coughs a bit and buries you in its bowels. Just like any other. This has nothing to do with the topic, but it occurred to me, when I was talking about Clement and Jake: do you remember that you were the first professional mountaineer, not only in YU, but far and wide? We went once with my dad to the Stol and on the slopes of the Maly Stol the mountain started to, um ... swell you up. And foter promised you 5 jur for reaching the top. Then you just listened to the call of the mountain or when it rustled your banknotes :-). I don't know how much that is in today's currency but the beginnings of professionalism were there!"

457	"@ PJ. I will briefly repeat my reply to your comment: congratulations and good health to you in the future. I wonder if you have written down the diagnosis "" lame from the waist down "", and the cure somewhere. Do you keep this knowledge you have gained to yourself or are you interested in sharing it with someone else who is dealing with a similar intractable problem. <p/> For me it is a little different. A very aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis (in terms of percentage cured) was contracted by a family member. Unexpectedly, while she was waiting for surgery, I gave her a month of therapy using the procedure or technique carried out by Zdenko Domančič and his team. For 30 days, 2x a day. I did the therapies exclusively at her request, it is difficult to explain how this came about. On the third day her condition started to improve. She was able to start walking up stairs again, she hadn't been able to do it before, she had a cold all winter, she had difficulty breathing, sinus problems, chronically blocked nose, she hadn't smelled for a year. No antibiotic was helping her effectively anymore. In the meantime, while she was waiting for the operation (she had to undergo a few more tests), she was not receiving any medication to treat her cancer. When she was operated on, it was found that, of the five tumours, four had disappeared and one had gone from 15 mm to about 5 mm. I admit that I am not foolish and I do not know what we managed in the long run. Time will tell. I am still continuing with the therapies, following the advice of the people in the bioenergetician's circle. <p/> That is why I was interested in your description of the effect of the energy flow on the diseased tissue. <p/> @David: as I have said before, and I feel you are realising yourself, vanity can be a problem here and difficult to overcome. So I will just say this: the conclusion is that you are on the right path. It might be worth familiarising yourself with the content on stimulating the pituitary gland. <p/> @david: I do not know if we have understood each other correctly. I can imagine what it is like for you in the situation you are in ... We too were diagnosed with cancer three years ago with the youngest in the family. Unfortunately, at that time I was not yet aware of the therapy that was being researched in the 1960s and was supposedly achieving excellent results. <p/> As I said, it was roughly about (electromagnetic) stimulation of the pituitary gland. This resulted in the formation of bodies that fed on the malignant cells, which reduced the tumour. At the same time, the inhibitors, in turn, inhibited the development or proliferation of stem cells into malignant cells... <p/>I'm sorry I didn't go into the details, but if I had another chance, I would have. We said goodbye to the youngest in our family a year ago. I suspect, however, that what you are describing is exactly this model of treatment. <p/>David, now a word of caution: P.J. obviously brings spices that the dish does not need to tickle you in the first place, and then writes about inferring that it is a crowd that is supposed to be on the right path. This makes you an information broker for others and no longer just for yourself (different levels of responsibility, after all...). <p/> I did not follow your dialogue and I have no idea what it is about ... but I am naturally cautious about similar transitions from singular to plural. <p/> Ah, that post cut off part of the communication - but as far as I'm concerned, it's still the case that a person should give partly different information on his/her own behalf than if he/she gives it on behalf of a group (even if it's the same joint project of whatever). <p/> @ niko: thanks for the warning. It should have used a colon. I'm sprinkling myself with ashes for that mistake. <p/> As for responsibility, I have to agree with you. In caring for the patient, we (each individual who accepts this role - not to get bogged down with interpretation again) are about to take (again, each individual) full (co-) responsibility for the outcome. <p/> P.S.: Perhaps a clarification on why the change from singular to plural (or, as written, more correctly - dual). <p/> In most treatments there is a patient and a therapist. The course of treatment and cure also depends on the patient and not only on the therapist. Hence the sentence that both of you (all involved), judging by the results described, are (are) on the right path. <p/>@PJ. Now I understand. I can see that you have had quite a few difficult ordeals. Actually, this technique that I am using is the work of Zdenek Domančič. Personally, I think that this therapy has a holistic effect on the patient's immune system (I have seen it myself in several patients after only a few days) and that the body may (or may not, depending of course on the patient's condition) react positively and fight the condition more easily. Although the very act of laying on of hands makes the cancer cells feel unwell. Anyway, if you are interested in more, go to youtube and type in the name of the bioenergetician mentioned, there is a lot said there and research has also been done at various institutions around Slovenia (jozef stefan, I think also at the oncoloske) ... <p/> @Niko, thank you for your concern, but I no longer worry about being unfairly grouped somewhere or thrown in some trash can. I've been called everything from a janissist, to a right-winger, to a pro-Russia, left-winger, and so on, on blogs <p/> @Niko, I don't resent anyone. We're all just human, which is why blog-level resentment is absurdly fucking ridiculous. Which ends up being cruel when someone keeps slandering and moderating you. And yet absurd if the cause is ""virtual"" <p/> I'm not saying I don't resent things too, I do, but it has to be related to a greater amount of money, time, and consequently unattained planned goals. <p/> Man, you weren't disciplining anyone - you were just defending yourself. There was no talk of overstepping the bounds of power. , <p/> There is a note somewhere here among the older posts about how it came about that I put Dajana in spam (etting) and she no longer has access to this blog - the only one and it really wasn't my intention to oppress anyone in such a way, but with her all the normal solutions fall away (the woman is polluting all over the place for absolutely no reason). She only understands that one step too far towards the abyss. <p/> I forgot to leave this link here, under this heading, which was the trigger for the end-to-end, over-amplified and predictable clichéd parroting with the noticeable manifestations of dementia of the blogger Dajana and of the gentleman who has sovereign mastery of the knowledge and functioning of the egos of bitches, Mr Ervinatro. <p/> For your amusement, nobody has given me as much publicity as these two have done on the siol! <p/> werner, you must be very young, I can tell by your naive euphoric conclusions, hehe ... <p/> but I find this strange: in all the American films, the Russians are Americans - well, sometimes Yugos In no time at all, all the ""Russians"" speak English <p/> and then they make the film in such a way that the Russians are made to look like cowards. ------- similarly with the commentators on the net ... ........................ . hint: for me, the ""smart"" person is the one who gives me money and pays me for it - all the others are ballast that I shake off <p/> You don't know, but my teachers know that there is so much of what I do in me - purely from within, without reading, imitating or going anywhere to get knowledge ... , I just like to go and test what is in me. And I get confirmations. <p/> Dear Dragica, ************ the guspa who is so fond of mentioning us misses us = will and love. That is a fact. ****** = she gets bo if she has a boyfriend (she mentions quite a few guys from her life), and love in such a way that everyone would bow down to her and it should be her way. *************** But the guspa herself does nothing to make any of it happen. Because she is hateful and labile. Not even Abraham helps her! ! Maybe I will - because I do everything with love. I will show love to her too. In a slightly different way. ******************** Actually, I feel sorry for her. She's deprived of everyone she expected anything from. But that's her own fault. When she realises that she is doing injustice to countless people by slandering them and spreading lies about them, she will be on the right path to realising love. ************************************************** And when she does, I will be the first one to embrace her. I promise. *************************************************** P.S. If a man wants to get something, he has to give it. And if a man wants to get love, he has to give it. *************************************** But if a man sows hatred, he gets back only hatred. ********************************************* And here the guspa is enormous. ******************* The mind will meet it when it knows what love really is. ******************************************** <p/> My dear Dragica, publicity is only for the benefit, hehe, not for the detriment. ************************************** Many people want to meet me, and you too, and NIkota, because of what is written about us. which is a plus for us. ********************************* And whoever wants to have a clear and clean picture, and a mirror, comes to us, isn't it? And then we meet all the wonderful people. Which is worth gold. <p/> Dear Mrs Vlatka: there will be no food or drink from IF and KO ... KO / IF and KO do not germinate for too long. And I can guarantee you, dear lady, that there will never be anything. A little fear, a little mudslinging - then her nose gets used to the new smell. <p/> You just go be a do-gooder, as long as it's not at someone else's expense (you know, even when someone is patient, considerate, forgiving, etc. in such a case, it's only fair as long as insults are flying at their expense: being tolerant of pyromaniacs while they're burning down your neighbour's house is not tolerance...). <p/> Extremely well written and admirable. I am conditioned to find a grain of truth through reading when I learn it from myself, so I am doomed to plagiarism in anything I recognise as good. <p/>The teacher who imparted knowledge to me left me a few years ago after 25 years of teaching, after letting me know that he had learned enough from me to feel that he had fulfilled his task and was leaving this world. So I continue my mission as a disciple, absorbing knowledge from all those who are eager to learn."	Forum	Other
461	Dragana is in pain and bleeding after sexual intercourse. What are the possible causes of this problem? <p/> A couple of days ago my boyfriend and I had sex. Suddenly I felt a pain from below and after a while I started bleeding quite a lot. It calmed down after three days. It happened again on the fourth day. I have been taking the Logest pill for 5 months. I am 20 years old. I really wonder what it could be? Is it possible that something has broken? <p/> Dragana <p/> You have bled a few times after intercourse. Without an examination, of course, we can only guess what the cause of these bleedings is: * since you have been having sex for quite some time, a genital injury is very unlikely * it could be bleeding from an inflamed cervix * or bleeding after a ruptured ovarian cyst (only theoretically) * or coincidentally, bleeding related to the use of Logest. If the matter has not resolved while you have been waiting for an answer, I recommend that you see your gynaecologist of choice to find out the cause of these symptoms.	Other	Other
472	"Polona Požgan Štorman, a graduate in political science and a graduate in history, is known to most people as the presenter of the morning programme on Radio Centre. She has been working at the radio for 16 years. She fell in love with it at the beginning of her student years, when she started working at Radio Student in Maribor. ""Everything related to speech and communication inspired me so much that I decided to make radio a part of my life. And it did,"" explains Polona, continuing, ""In all these years, I never thought about driving to work at 5am. Working in radio is a pleasure. Good company, good music, laughter, raving around the studio at the crack of dawn, morning coffees, sunrises, sometimes even a bit of a grumble, and I'm always pampered by my two radio men - Sašo Papp and Štefko Bratkovič. "" <p/> A committed radio personality, she is also a homemaker and enjoys cooking. Her favourite hobbies are cooking and baking. She has two very grateful eaters - her son and her husband. She loves cooking so much that she might be a professional chef if she were born again. ""Maybe I imagine myself in this role a little too much like Catherine Zeta Jones in No Reservations, but... why not? ! "" she remarks wryly. <p/> POLONA POŽGAN ŠTORMAN on her MAKS Of all her roles, Polona's favourite is that of a mother. ""If you were to ask Maks what he calls his mother, I would tell you that I call him 'love'. And that's the best word to describe our relationship. Max is my love and I adore him. He is three and a half years old and he is a boy like most others. He is mainly interested in toy cars, saws, lawnmowers, diggers and other motorised vehicles. I am not very good around them, so I involve him in other games, ones that are closer to me. We cook together almost every day. When he wakes up at the end of the week and sees that I am home, his first words are: ' Mum, let's go bake cakes now! ' What impresses me most is that Maks is a very happy child. He laughs and sings all day - of course he loves Taboo and knows all their songs by heart. When he gets serious and annoying, it's clear to me that something is wrong with him. He is a Leo, which means he is very stubborn. Sometimes it gives me grey hairs during this period, but I console myself with the fact that he will need this trait at some point in his life,"" Polona enthusiastically recounted. <p/> Polona's days are, in principle, meticulously planned. By Sunday evening at the latest, she knows what her schedule will be for the whole week. She gets up very early, her watch chimes at five minutes past four o'clock. ""If it rang exactly at four, I would think it was horrible, five past four is more normal,"" she explained with a laugh. She then works on the radio from five to eleven, then goes to the office or to lectures. Together with her friend Mojca Lubanjšek Pehant, she runs the school of rhetoric Retorik, d.o.o. No matter what she does or how much she works, she always has a maternal feeling inside her, which pushes her to work so intensively and so organised that she has enough time for her child. You would think that at this pace you would go to bed quickly, but that is not true for her at all, and it is true that she is in bed by 11 p.m. at the latest. <p/> Since she has had Max, her life has changed a lot, and for the better. Today, she wonders how she could ever say that she has no time or that she is sleepy. She wonders what she did before she had Max. Today, she feels that she has time for everything and does not need much sleep. Maks gives her energy in the afternoon or evening. The child never weighs her down, never tires her out, quite the opposite. <p/> She herself has never wondered what it is like to be a mother. She feels that she is a good mother. She and Primož were both very excited about Maks and when he came into the world they were mentally prepared for him. There were never any concerns, only some questions, and her mother, who used to be a midwife, solved them professionally. <p/> Every day when she comes home, Maks first plays and sings to her. ""Every day, really. He usually plays that it's Maco or Izi, they're the guitarists in the band Tabu, which his dad Primož is also part of,"" Polona told us. ""Now Maks is in the Good Fairy phase. He has a well-developed sense of humour and knows exactly how and with what to make people laugh. ""Sometimes he comes up to me with big eyes and asks me very seriously: 'Listen... are you my mummy?' He asks this because he knows that I will chase him around the flat. ""But she is happiest that he is healthy, and she tries to remind herself of that as often as possible. <p/> Primož likes Maks to be stubborn and to stick to his guns. ""I think it shows he has character,"" Polona laughs. So far, Maks has shown his true stubbornness two or three times by throwing himself on the floor and shouting, but otherwise he is very persistent. Polona is more strict, but she has often found that Primož is more of a logician when it comes to parenting. During her pregnancy, she ""devoured"" all the parenting books she could get her hands on, but she herself found that this was not the best. <p/> In the future, she wants Max to be healthy first, responsible second and independent third. If she can deduce by herself, these qualities bring happiness. But more importantly, she wants to instil in Max responsibility - for himself, for others, for work and for life. <p/> Maks has been playing with saws for two years now, and excavators and rollers and the like, and he is also moving into the Lego era. Towers are popular. But since the first year, the most used toy in his room is drums. His father, who is a drummer, bought them for his first birthday. For his third birthday he got new, more useful ones, but they are too loud for (Mum's) ears. That's why Maks now has headphones. ""He says they are green, which means they are red,"" Polona said laughing. <p/> Otherwise, the rules in their family are clear and every night Maks has a choice - either a cartoon or a game to play with Primož. During the day, cartoons and TV are not allowed. The exception is a Taboo video, which he sometimes wishes he could play drums or a children's guitar alongside. <p/> About early learning in kindergarten, Polona thinks: ""Everything in its own time. We don't have any extra-curricular activities for now. Maks still sometimes 'poops' his pants and it would be a bit funny if he was to learn English while doing that. "" <p/> Maks has been attending kindergarten since September. Polona was quite scared of going to kindergarten because he had been at home with a nanny for two years before that. But he has settled in beautifully. She is convinced that this is also thanks to the wonderful teachers, Petra and Martina. He loves them very much, he still talks about them at home. He now has friends at nursery and Primož, who drives him to nursery in the morning, says that he gets impatient if they take too long. Polona is grateful that in the first week of kindergarten they dispelled her doubts and showed her that her child is safe and happy with them."	Opinion/Argumentation	News/Reporting
480	"Why did we lose the island? Because politics has defeated the judicial branch of government <p/> Since this year, the island of Bled has also been a symbol of the church's insatiability. It is a symbol of the complot between the church and a part of politics. It is a symbol of the weak authority of the Slovenian courts. This year, the island was finally donated to the church. But the church, as the court also found, got it illegally! <p/> How? Initially, two Slovenian courts, the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, ruled that the island and its commercial real estate belonged to the state, while the church on the island was given to the parish of Bled. But the RCC wanted it all, so the first government of Janez Janša came to its rescue, donating the island and its real estate to the church. The legal proceedings were restarted and came to a tragicomic conclusion. There were two proceedings in which the court should have annulled the gift contract. But the first one fell through because the first judge said that the state should have sued the Archdiocese of Ljubljana as well as the parish of Bled. And when the state sued both in the second, the second judge said that the state should sue only the parish. <p/> Since the ""superminister"" Žiga Turk did not appeal the decision, the real estate on the island became the property of the church and the island became the property of the church. But illegally. The court wrote that ""the evidence taken in the proceedings shows that there has been an impermissible traffic in real estate"" and that the church should not have been allowed to take ownership of the properties, which were exempted from traffic under the Cultural Heritage Protection Act. ""This prohibition is absolute, it is a coercive regulation"" <p/> The Bled Island case shows very clearly how weak and God-fearing the Slovenian courts are, and how strong the church and the politicians beholden to it are at the same time."

492	Description. The type and quantity of pollutants in rainwater varies temporally and spatially depending on a number of factors that are non-linearly interrelated: climate, road surface, traffic, land use and other local specificities. Slovenia does not yet have a methodology for sampling rainwater, nor is there a comprehensive long-term monitoring study of rainwater quality. In the first part of the thesis, we have collected literature on the topic of rainwater harvesting, with a focus on Slovenian literature. The experimental part consists of the selection of rainwater treatment facilities suitable for sampling, the determination of the sampled parameters, and manual sampling of the influent and effluent during rainfall events between October 2009 and August 2010. In the first phase, we captured single instantaneous samples within the first wave of the rainfall event, and later we increased the frequency of sample collection. The results obtained were analysed and possible amendments to the current legislation on road rainfall water were proposed and conclusions were drawn to help developers of road rainfall water management methodologies, with a focus on road rainfall water sampling.

494	Description: Urban areas are characterised by high environmental pressures due to high population and economic development. In the past, these were the result of industrial plants and individual combustion plants, but now they are largely the result of increasing road traffic. A good understanding of the air pollution situation caused by traffic in the city is a prerequisite for designing effective environmental protection programmes and planning measures to reduce excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air. Emissions of pollutants from road traffic are difficult to measure and are therefore calculated on the basis of traffic data and vehicle category-specific emission factors. The methodologies used to control emissions from traffic differ in terms of input data, emission factors and the way emissions are calculated. Using the COPERT IV methodology, which is prescribed for national emissions reporting by the European Environment Agency but is less suitable for municipal reporting due to the difficulty of obtaining input data and the complexity of its application, we have determined emissions for the cities of Maribor and Celje. Based on the results of the COPERT methodology and data from the literature, we have developed a simplified methodology that requires less input data, is simple to use and at the same time efficient. Comparison of the results of the simplified methodology with the calculations of the COPERT IV methodology showed that the simplified methodology is suitable for estimating the total emissions of CO, NOx and PM10 pollutants from road traffic for the whole city of Maribor and smaller urban areas, and it is also suitable for estimating the CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic by vehicle category for urban areas with a number of registered vehicles above 20,000 and for estimating the total CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic for smaller Slovenian cities. Due to the expected changes in the structure of vehicles in cities, the simplified methodology should be reviewed and upgraded every three years Found in: keywords Summary of found:...

500	"Drava Judo Club member Klemen Ferjan competed this weekend at the Judo World Cup in Apia, Samoa, where he was the only representative of the Slovenian national team. 12 competitors took part in the category up to 81 kg. In the first round he was beaten, in the second round he was beaten by Pavlinic from New Zealand, this year's participant of the World Championships in Rio de Janiero and holder of several medals from the World Cups. Klemn managed a seven-point throw, then a final grab from which the New Zealander escaped. However, Klemn managed to save his opponent from a takedown and finished the action with a dunk. This was his first victory. He then took on Australia's Boughlan in the semi-final bout and effectively defeated him with an "" ippon "" in the first half of the fight. He only had one final fight to go, in which his opponent was New Zealand's Mark Brewer. In the final, Drava's Boughler managed to finish the fight successfully with an ""ippon"", a 10-point throw. <p/> "" I trained and prepared well for this match.

519	WE CELEBRATE THE FULL SPEECH OF BISHOP JURJI BIZJAK <p/> We celebrate the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius, Apostles of the Slavs and co-founders of Europe, and we also remember Bishop Methodius, who is being beatified today, and on the occasion of the anniversary of his ordination, his successor today extends to him his heartfelt thanks for the grace of ordination, and we all thank them for their example as a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd, and as a faithful witness to all. The Holy Brothers are, of course, an example not only for the presbyters of the Church, but also for every member of the Mystical Body of Christ, since all of us share in all three missions of the Church, each in his own order and in his own vocation. The sign of the witness is the palm branch, the sign of the shepherd is the shepherd's staff, the sign of the teacher is the lamp. <p/> The sign of the teacher is the lamp: to the prophet Isaiah the Lord said: 'It is too little for you to be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the redeemed of Israel. Therefore I will make you a light to the Gentile nations, that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth' (Isa 49:6). And the prophet Malachi writes: 'The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and instruction shall be expected from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts' (Mal 2:7). The prophet Daniel says: 'The holy teachers shall shine as the brightness of the heavens, and they that have instructed many in righteousness shall be as the stars for all eternity' (Dan. 12:3). In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord said to the disciples: 'You are the light of the world ... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven' (Mt 5:16). <Shepherds are migratory, moving with their flocks from pasture to pasture, and so their staff is also a travelling staff. When Jacob's father Jacob was preparing to meet Esau after twenty years, he was in great fear. He turned to the Lord with all his heart and prayed, 'I am not worthy of all your grace and all your faithfulness, which you have shown to your servant. For (with) my staff alone I have crossed this Jordan, and now I have grown into two camps (after 20 years!). Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau! Why I fear him, that he may come and kill me, mother and children!' (Deuteronomy 32:11-12). The shepherd's staff is also similar to the royal scepter, which is also a sign of administration and provision, so the staff is also a sign of the shepherd's care for food and drink, including care for spiritual food and drink. The prophet Isaiah threatens the capital city of Jerusalem and says: 'Behold, the Almighty, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and Judah the staff and the support, all the support of bread and all the support of water' (Isaiah 3:1). 'Your rod and your staff are a comfort to me' (Ps. 23:4). <The evergreen palm tree is first of all a sign of life and growth, but palm branches in particular are also a sign of martyrdom and eternal life. The Evangelist John describes the triumph of the elect in heaven and says: 'After these things I saw a great multitude, which no one could number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and holding palms in their hands' (Rev 7:9). To be a witness is, of course, first of all a great honour and thanksgiving, but it can also be a great effort and a miserable sacrifice. As the Lord foretold us: 'In the world you will have tribulation; but believe me, I have overcome the world' (Jn 16:33). The Apostle Paul comforts us: 'For I think that the sufferings of this present time cannot be compared with the glory that is to be revealed in us' (Rom 8:18). And the Apostle James: 'Count it all joy, my brethren, if you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness' (Jas 1:2). <p/> The holy brothers Cyril and Methodius faithfully and courageously carried out the entire threefold mission, leaving us a shining example of a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd and faithful witness. The Lord also gave them an eloquence and wisdom that all their adversaries could not oppose or contradict (Mt 21:15). May their example encourage all of us to hold ever higher the three signs of our mission: the palm branch of witness, the shepherd's staff of stewardship and the lamp of teaching. <p/> I express my gratitude to Bishop Methodius for his episcopal consecration and paternal introduction to a demanding ministry, which I have accepted with great hopes and expectations. And to you, dear brother priests and faithful, I thank you for your prayers and your closeness, your understanding and your affection. When I look at the years as a whole, I think how quickly they have passed, and when I think of all that has turned and happened in the meantime, I think when did it all happen! May the Lord look upon our work and bless it, to Him be thanks for ever and ever. Amen.	Other	Information/Explanation

523	"In reality, it is hard to imagine the incredible and unimaginable obstacles that a person encounters when seriously ill in a system that is supposed to provide him with protection in the first place. When the normal course of his life and that of his loved ones is suddenly and unexpectedly completely diverted by a serious, unpredictable illness, the outcome of which is sometimes impossible to predict. As if the diagnosis itself were not stressful and painful enough, many dilemmas, problems and questions begin to pile up, and the answers are all too often lost in a systemic maze that seems designed to complicate, complicate and steal hope at a time when, in fact, hope is the only thing left for the person in need. As if the burden of illness were not enough in itself, but the resulting rupture in life had to be echoed by the loss of social security. <p/> The time of the new coronavirus has painfully exposed the difficulties faced by dementia sufferers and their relatives or carers in this country. For these patients, who are slowly but steadily losing touch with reality, care must be all-day, every-day. As we know, this care is already extremely inadequate from a systemic point of view, as the vast majority of the burden falls on the shoulders of the relatives - but, on the other hand, this year's coronary crisis, which is again worsening at an accelerated pace, has shown that there are many more older people with these problems than we imagine. Some of them have either not yet been diagnosed or the disease is still in its early stages, so they were able to cope with the challenges of life until the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic - but when life was turned upside down, when isolation was mandated and normal interactions and social contacts were reduced, the disease surfaced... <p/> In the past, thanks to vaccination, medicine has managed to control a series of epidemics, serious infectious diseases that had previously - including in our own country - extinguished the lives of children and adults en masse. Therefore, today, with the availability of a vaccine against COVID that will be able to stop an epidemic that has been limiting our lives for almost a year, it is pointless to give up on vaccination. These are the warnings of key medical institutions, but of course the decision to vaccinate or not is a personal right and a matter for each individual's judgement. But at any time and in any way, personal freedom on the one hand and social responsibility on the other always end up in the balance. It is therefore impossible to turn a blind eye to the truth that the current epidemic can only be overcome through a common effort, regardless of attempts to politicise and trivialise one of the greatest health and social challenges of the last century. <p/> ""We will be able to cure some cancers for which the next stop would be a cemetery,"" Prof. Samo Zver, Head of the Clinical Department of Haematology at the University Hospital Ljubljana, was unequivocal about the new method of treating blood cancers with CAR-T cell therapy in an interview with Zdravstveniportal.si a year and a half ago.<p/> ""We will be able to cure some cancers for which the next stop would be a cemetery. Of course, he could not have imagined at the time that the road leading to the introduction of a treatment that could save many lives in this time would be so long and complicated. <p/> Since the prices of medical supplies and devices have been significantly higher in Slovenia since independence than in those EU Member States least burdened by corruption - Germany and the Scandinavian countries, for example - nine doctors, united in the zdravstvo.si group, have drawn up a new proposal for the procurement of these supplies. This proposal is intended to put an end to decades of anomalies in this area in our country. But do those in charge in Slovenia really want the money that would otherwise be siphoned off into the supply channels to stay in healthcare? The answer is clear: in this case, too, it has been shown that the corrupt ties that also permeate the decision-making levers in our country are apparently so strong that such improvements cannot be expected any time soon. It is therefore not surprising that this group of doctors no longer wants to take part in such 'games', which in the end hurt patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment the most. <p/> Chronic venous disease is a condition that affects women three times more often than men and is a problem for the majority (around 80%) of the adult population worldwide. <p/> ""It is one thing to have a situation on paper, but it is quite another to have a situation in real life,"" added municipal councillor Anastazija Makorič Bevčar at an extraordinary meeting of the municipal council in Kanal ob Soči, as she stood on the sidelines of more than five hours of expert explanations and the search for credible answers to the question of why the state continues to allow the pollution to cripple the central Soča valley and make its population sicker and sicker. She knows very well what she is talking about: three siblings in her family were lost to the most serious form of cancer, mesothelioma, which is rare in Slovenia and one of the most common in the area where Salonit Anhovo operates, and a fourth died of lung cancer. Today, exactly one week later, the extraordinary municipal session will be followed by an extraordinary session in the National Assembly building in Ljubljana, 130 kilometres away, where members of two parliamentary committees, on health and on infrastructure, environment and spatial planning, will discuss the same topic. <p/> Do you know anyone who has been eating fast food for decades, lighting up cigarette after cigarette, mainly, of course, as he tells himself, to relieve the stress that life throws at him, and in the afternoons, when work commitments are no longer so demanding, he ""indulges his soul"" with a good dose of alcohol, just to meet, as he convinces himself, the challenges that will arise in the home environment - especially now that the epidemic has forced us to spend most of our time with our loved ones, between the four walls of the home, where stories vary from the beautiful and loving to the extremely tragic and brutal? Do you know anyone who prefers to move from such a reality into the virtual world, where they can vent their frustrations and aggressively and arrogantly oppose all that is reasonable, just to satisfy their own powerlessness, which is rooted in ignorance and ignorance, albeit often under a fictitious name and profile? <p/> How is dentistry working, under the circumstances dictated by the now waning second wave of the epidemic? Dentist Dr Diana Terlević Dabić, MD, says that work is going smoothly in her practice in the health centre in Škofja Loka. ""We follow the protocol. We call each patient before the visit, take a medical history, give instructions on how to arrive at the dentist's office. Patients need us - and there are no short cuts in our dental treatment. We see fewer patients, there is no waiting in the waiting room, and we take more time with each patient than we did before the epidemic. In fact, I could say that COVID has helped us to improve our organisation in a unique way."" <p/> In line with the revolt of family doctors, who have recently been stepping up their warnings about the decimation of staff and the resulting overload, including and especially administrative overload, measures to improve the situation in primary care are being taken at an accelerated pace. Today, the Board of Directors of the Health Insurance Fund of Slovenia (ZZZS) gave the green light to the first eight new teams on the basis of this year's call for tenders for an additional 32 general or family medicine clinics and 21 paediatric and school dispensaries. In the Gorenjska region, where the situation is most critical, not a single application has been received; the tender remains open until the end of the year, but further applications will be considered by the ZZZS on a rolling basis. <p/> ""The difficult year 2020, which spared no severe trials, has finally brought good news, with the announcement of a significant gain as we enter the new decade,"" enthuses dentist Dr Sanda Lah Kravanja. After many years of struggle, the Ministry of Health has granted the dental practice in Bovec a concession and an additional programme for orthodontic treatment of children and adolescents from the PoSS region on a referral basis; until now, they could only receive this kind of treatment in clinics located far away, either in Nova Gorica or in Tolmin. <p/> There is no doubt that the epidemic and the related measures are already on everyone's mind. I do not know a single person who does not dream of life returning as soon as possible to the normality we were used to before the pandemic broke out. But the figures on infections, illnesses and even deaths caused by COVID simply refuse to subside. On the contrary, we are facing a third wave, underpinned by new strains of a new coronavirus, and we are once again on the verge of another closure of the country, which, this time, is being advocated unanimously by representatives of the various branches of medicine; it would probably have been the case in any case, regardless of which political option had the most votes at any given time in government decision-making, in determining and directing what happens in the country. This will be put on hold again at the beginning of April - that this is not a premature April Fool's joke is confirmed by the conviction of epidemiologists, infectiologists and representatives of other disciplines that only in this way will it be possible to effectively repel the predicted intense third wave of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections. <p/> On the old continent, an average of 2335 people die every day from a blood clot in the legs or lungs. But while immediate action is essential for arterial thrombosis, where survival depends on every second, venous thrombosis allows a little more time. <p/> The dementia epidemic should also be tackled in this country through comprehensive measures in the context of a network of memory clinics, but these are still not in place, and this progressive chronic degenerative disease is painting an uninspiring picture on the map of Slovenia. The incidence of dementia is rising sharply, disproportionately in line with the ageing of the population - but as many as three-quarters of sufferers are still without a diagnosis to explain why many individuals are slowly losing (their) minds. We will talk about how dementia can be prevented or at least delayed by a few years with very simple approaches, how patients who are diagnosed at an early stage can be helped today, and how to provide support to the relatives of the sufferer who are themselves failing because of overwork and stress, and how far science has come in the search for a cure for Alzheimer's disease and why politics should simply move beyond its short-sighted interests and act in the vital interests of Slovenian society, in an article and video interview with prof. Dr. Zvezdan Pirtošek. <p/> Severe asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, occurs in about 10% of sufferers; it often leads to exacerbations that require the asthmatic to take glucocorticoids in pill form in addition to basic medication. Taking these tablets, which have serious side-effects, does not contribute to a good and safe treatment - on the contrary, it often leads to the development of new conditions. The Slovenian Association of Pneumologists therefore warns that asthma treatment should follow the new professional guidelines for successful treatment and good asthma control, which strongly advise against the use of glucocorticoids in tablet form. <p/> Elevated blood pressure puts people at higher risk of heart and kidney disease, as well as stroke - and, as a result, sudden death. Hypertension is not an uncommon condition, according to data showing that around one third of adults today have high blood pressure, and the condition is increasingly being detected in young people. The problem is that almost half of those affected are simply unaware of this problem, which can have serious consequences - cardiovascular disease is still one of the leading causes of premature death in the population. This is why preventive check-ups, including blood pressure measurements, should not be neglected. <p/> How dangerous and professionally reprehensible must the circumstances dictating a doctor's work be for him to decide - for his own sake and for the sake of his patients - to resign? At the Kranj Health Centre (ZD), 24 doctors have decided to take this truly radical step. There has been a great deal of manipulation in the public domain about this, in the sense that it is really a blackmail for higher salaries or a covert attempt to privatise healthcare. But are such claims, which have found their home mainly on social networks or in politically dictated interludes, to be believed? Listen to the personal testimonies of five doctors from the Kranj Health Centre. <p/> In the treatment of oncology patients, one of the key procedures in modern medicine for determining the course of treatment is molecular diagnostics. It is increasingly indispensable in determining the prognosis of the disease, predicting its recurrence or response to treatment, because in the management of patients with cancer, which is a genetic disease, both molecular diagnostics and genetic markers are nowadays crucial in the choice of treatment tailored to the individual patient and the tumour he or she has to overcome. The regulation on this type of treatment, which is now publicly presented and will be financed from the health budget or from compulsory health insurance as from 1 July, bodes well for oncology patients in this area. <p/> The issue of non-emergency ambulance transports or so-called ambulance transports is not a new problem - on the contrary, it has long been a source of conundrums and ill-will in practice, and it imposes on doctors (personal or so-called referring doctors) a problem that does not depend on medical knowledge, since it is in fact a regulation conditional on the relationship between the insured and the insurer. At the end of December, the Government amended the current regime. <p/> Slovenian scientists have also been involved in the search for a vaccine to protect against SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus infections. The head of the research team at the Institute of Chemistry, Prof. Dr. Roman Jerala, presented the results of the development and pre-clinical testing of a vaccine against COVID-19, for which the Institute spent 10.000- to 100.000 €.000 times less money than was spent on such research in the USA, China or Russia, he stressed that as scientists they simply had to contribute a tiny fraction to the global effort to save the world as quickly as possible from one of the biggest medical disasters in the last 100 years, which will have snuffed out more than 1,000,000 lives by the end of the year."

Under his leadership, Zabec has transformed from a small and unknown agency into one that plays a significant role in Slovenia in all its niche markets. <p/> Never tie most of your business to one client - even though it is often easier, it exposes you to dependence on one client and puts your company in a bad position. If you have the option, even find two separate businesses: one B2B and one B2C. And ideally, separate the businesses by more than one country. <p/> 2. Work from the heart <p/> If you don't enjoy what you are doing, quit because you will lack the energy to ""pull"" it forward. <p/> 3. Not every client is worth the energy <p/> Big clients are not always manna from heaven. Appreciate the clients you work and work well with, as the work will be mutually satisfying and get done faster. The surprise follows - such clients are usually even more profitable! <p/> 4. Plan your finances <p/> If you manage your cash flow, you can anticipate problems and investment opportunities in advance. I started out using a simple Excel spreadsheet with expected income and expenditure. It is always possible to get good terms if you say exactly when you will be paid and your clients trust you. <p/> Money earned from the business is not yours! Invest it in the company, not in yourself. So what if you have a low salary - your job is to make the company grow and only later your wallet. This will ensure the company's growth and longevity."

583	"News <p/> Smashing coconuts to get your rights <p/> Professional footballers in Poland have come up with an ingenious idea to fight for their rights after some clubs started bullying them and forcing them to train on their own due to their disagreement with the terms of their new contracts and their subsequent refusal to sign them. They are smashing coconuts. The most recent and perhaps most noteworthy case is that of Slask Wrocław, which imposed a cruel 14-hour working day on striker Sebin Plak for six months after he refused to sign a new contract with more than half the amount. ""The club's management did everything to destroy me mentally,"" said Plaku. Such behaviour by clubs is common in Poland and these clubs have been given their own name in football circles, the ""Coconut Clubs"". They were named after Daniel ""Kokos"" Kokosinski, who was mistreated, bullied and harassed by Polonia Warsaw FC in 2009. As part of a campaign launched by the Polish Professional Footballers' Union PZP to mark these events, players from the second division club Olimpia Grudziaz gathered in the changing room and shouted 'let's smash the coconut' in one voice, which was then smashed with a hammer a few moments later. Lukasz Surma, who has more than 500 appearances in the Polish first league, joined the second division players on the occasion. Here you can watch a video of the players smashing coconuts in protest. <p/> Other news"	News/Reporting	News/Reporting

601	"The School Fund is a fund intended to finance activities that are not part of the work of an educational establishment and are not financed from public funds. Its mission is to provide better conditions for our children to carry out their activities in kindergarten and school, in order to ensure their successful development. <p/> The Naklo Primary School School School Fund was established by the Naklo Primary School Council at its meeting on 22 May 2008, and the first regular meeting was held at the beginning of October 2008. The School Fund operates in accordance with the Rules on the operation and organisation of the Naklo Primary School School School Fund, which can be found on our website. <p/> The School Fund is managed by a Board of Directors, consisting of a Chairperson and six members, at least three of whom are representatives of the school (presumably the Headmaster, the Accountant and the School Community Mentor). The Parents' Council appoints the Board of Directors. The school representatives shall be nominated by the school council. The term of office of the members shall be two years, with the possibility of re-election. <p/> The School Fund receives its financial resources from contributions from parents and other citizens, donations, bequests and other sources such as charity events. Every month, many parents of kindergarten and primary school children contribute a ""euro for a child"" to the fund. This shows solidarity and the will of parents to afford their children a little more. We recommend ourselves to our loyal and new donors. Anyone who would like to support the projects of the School Fund with a donation can make a voluntary contribution to the special designated account of the School Fund - IBAN: SI56 0110 0600 8339 210, ref: 00-2990001. The Fund's resources have been and will be used exclusively for projects aimed at our children. The School Fund informs the Parent Council and the Board of the Institution about its operations. <p/> The Board of Directors has decided to continue the practice of using the financial resources of the Fund for projects that benefit not only the children currently in our kindergartens and schools, but also those who come after them. This is also the most transparent way of spending funds. <p/> In recent mandates, the following investments have been financed in whole or in part by the School Fund: - playground equipment for the playground at Podbrezje Primary School, - sails at Naklo Primary School and Mlinček Kindergarten, - wheelchairs for 6 children at Jelka Kindergarten and Mlinček Kindergarten, - gym mats for gymnastics, - seeds, seedlings and tools for the school garden, - alteration of the basket with regulation in the Naklo Primary School's gym, - skate-boards at the parent school and at the two branch schools, - arrangement of the outdoor classrooms, - a slide in the playground at the Naklo Primary School. <p/> We invite you to take a look at all the acquisitions in the 2020 photo gallery.<p/> Anja Mihelič, Chairperson of the Naklo Primary School Naklo School Fund Board, October 2020 <p/> By clicking on the attachments below you can view the minutes in MS Word or Adobe Reader.

603	Digital marketing: from basics to success <p/> Basic steps to sales success with digital marketing <p/> Effective digital marketing is a profitable investment in increasing sales. It makes it possible to go big, even for the smallest. It all starts with a good foundation (analysis of the dream, the competition and the right strategy). <p/> Just like you, your customers are also searching for solutions online, regularly using search engines like Google, social networks, reading emails, searching on search engines, clicking on ads, exploring maps, reading free educational content, watching videos, attending online trainings or courses, looking for a phone number or a phone number to call. These are all opportunities that we do not miss when promoting products or services. We attack with the right message, at the right time, that engages, does not come across as intrusive, delivers value, persuades and sells. <p/> The digital consumer lives with digital technology, as guided by digital content creators. Smart solutions, rational inputs, strategic approach create success. You too can actively participate and influence what's happening and shape your tomorrow with an effective website and presence on search engines, social networks, advertising, etc. <p/> A strategic approach and thoughtful, innovative and smart solutions are the recipe for success! <p/> As we all know, without planning, there is no success. This is also true in digital marketing, which is why you need your own digital strategy in the first place. It must anticipate all the planned activities, steps, campaigns, services, solutions, tactics and tools for your success in the digital realm. <p/> Effective digital marketing is perfectly tailored to your business and objectives <p/> Poor understanding of your business or your customers by you or your digital marketing consultant, focusing too much energy on one service and not enough on others, lack of cohesion, poor preparation, ineffective communication, or lack of customer engagement are common reasons for some of the less successful online performances. <p/> The dimension of the success of a digital story is virtually defined in the pre-production and preparation of the project itself, and through the process of educating the client. Only an in-depth, research-analytical approach with strategic orientations is the right recipe for success online in today's crowded digital world. For these purposes, we recommend that before the actual strategy is developed, an in-depth competitive analysis (online) and website analysis is carried out to get complete information on the threats, opportunities and the shortest path to your success. <p/> Every winning strategy has a proven methodology and workflow behind it <p/> A proven methodology with analytical pre-preparation, a strategic approach, knowledge and global experience, WSI know how and continuous training are the keys to our and your competitive advantages and successes in digital marketing. <p/> Our solutions and services are tailored to your needs and designed based on your business dynamics, needs, desires and goals, which we discover and define in the initial, analytical phase.

606	Caracinids <p/> They have no common body feature by which they can be definitely identified.They are elongate in shape, and the size of the head is small relative to the body. The size varies widely, from less than a centimetre to over half a metre. The colour diversity is equally varied, with over 1000 species known. <p/> This family is characterised by gentle and peaceful representatives (e.g. various species of tetras - neonids, fireflies, serpa....).On the other hand, this family includes true predators, with an extremely strongly developed jaw and sharp teeth (e.g. most species of piranha).The caracinids are gregarious fish, living either in large schools or small groups, but in any case they are not solitary. The vast majority of caracinids are characterised by their vibrant colours and peaceful cohabitation with other aquarium inhabitants. However, they are also a highly predatory species, characterised by aggressiveness, as they generally do not tolerate competition in their vicinity. They breed freely, which means that they deposit their eggs freely in the water.They usually do not care about their offspring and most often eat most of the eggs themselves.If we want to breed them, we have to make sure that the parents do not get to the eggs.In professional breeding, special nets are used for this purpose, but it is enough to put a little thicker aquarium sand at the bottom of the spawning aquarium, among which the eggs fall after spawning. <p/> Serpa is a fiery red colour, the colouration depends largely on the conditions in which it lives, in darker aquariums its colour is more pronounced.It is a pronounced schooling fish, which grows up to 4 cm. <p/> A beautiful fish that has been known in the aquarium trade since 2007 and overnight became the No.1 fish in the aquarium world.

615	Nutritional counselling with Jelena Dimitrijević <p/> In the hectic world we live in, we sometimes need help to regain balance and regain good health and well-being (unfortunately, due to improper diet, poisoning, electrosmog, taking medication, insufficient exercise, negative thinking and various negative programmes and other factors, we lose it quite quickly). Many times we are not able to help ourselves, which is why it is a good idea to seek professional help. This will help us to get back on track and activate the self-healing processes. <p/> During the consultation, we talk to the client (analyse the pre-filled questionnaire), followed by a body and iris examination and a radiesthesia to determine the recommended nutritional supplements. If you have medical certificates, you can bring them with you. Based on the information obtained, we will prepare a plan for you to eat, take certain nutritional supplements and advise you on appropriate forms of exercise and spiritual-energy techniques to promote holistic healing. You will also receive written instructions (via email) after the consultation. We are at your disposal for any further questions and changes. <p/> Jelena about herself. I have always been interested in healthy living and spiritual insights, so I qualified as a Certified Nutritionist, a consultant in healthy plant-based nutrition, at the Institute of Natural Medicine. I am also involved in radiesthesia and iridology, which help me in diagnosis and counselling, and the knowledge I have gained in Ayurveda and TCM further brings me closer to understanding human nature and living according to one's primary constitution. I am constantly improving my knowledge and experience, giving various lectures, trainings and workshops. I am also currently undergoing training at the Karmic Diagnostic Biotherapist School. I am guided by personal experience and a true empathy for fellow human beings and animals.

618	"EVENING: A conversation with an ethical hacker <p/> 26 January 2015 Gregor Grosman, Večer <p/> Boštjan Špehonja is a hacker by profession, but he doesn't use his knowledge to cause harm, but offers it to companies for the benefit of discovering security holes and flaws. <p/> Hacking is done in agreement with the company, which also sets the rules for what the hacker can do and how far he can go, explains Boštjan Špehonja, who attended Unistar's RoglIT '15 conference as an independent expert. When conducting penetration tests, an ethical hacker avoids doing any harm, stealing data or deliberately disabling services, because we know that there are types of attacks that can temporarily disable a website. <p/> More vulnerabilities every day <p/> The fact that the number of intrusions is increasing does not mean that ethical hackers have more work to do. Špehonja explains that there is another constant here, as companies, both large and small, are not even aware yet of what data loss means in concrete terms. ""There is a big step to be taken here to make companies more aware. There are more vulnerabilities every day, and if an administrator falls asleep, there's no need for anyone to go after that company specifically. There are Chinese, there are Pakistanis, there are Nigerians who automatically scan the internet, public IPs, all day long. As soon as they realise that a particular system is vulnerable, an automation is running in the background to exploit that vulnerability and cause your system to be used for further attacks to mask the real attacker."" <p/> The problem lies in the belief of those in charge at many companies, who often wrongly assume that their data is of no interest to attackers. What is interesting are their computers, which hackers then exploit as bots for further attacks, explains Špehonja, who adds that while security starts with passwords, it is the human factor that he believes should be better educated in computer security. ""Safe use of the Internet seems to be a given. This is why children in school and kindergarten are not given enough emphasis on safe use of the internet, and the trends of online scams and scammers are on the rise,"" he explains, adding that, after all, you can get one email, click on a link, open a little program, and you are already infected and can lose all your data or, in the worst case, even suffer financial damage. <p/> Don't use keys found on the ground <p/> In the case of attacks on large companies, such as the ones we have seen recently, these are well-planned attacks that take months to plan, and the attackers usually send an insider. Often the hackers' work is made easier by the ""human factor"", whether it is misconfigured fire security or users clicking on them, and often hackers leave USB sticks in car parks for example, which are then found and used by employees, even though, as the ethical hacker explains, the ISO 27001 security policy states that sticks found on the ground are not to be inserted into company computers. ""These are all methods that are tested by attackers and sooner or later someone makes a mistake that opens the door to the company,"" concludes Špehonja. <p/> Anonymous well paid from behind the scenes <p/> When asked about the workings of Anonymous, the ethical hacker believes that it is a group that is well paid and run by someone, just like there are various viruses that are written specifically for the Middle East, which after seven years are found to have been funded by certain governments. ""My personal opinion is that the main men are funded by a certain side to carry out certain attacks. Of course, this is also a trend among young people, to be Anonymous and to put a mask on Facebook. It's a subculture that is being exploited. Anonymous has a whole bunch of programmes of its own, but there is also a double-edged sword here. You decide as a teenager to be a member of Anonymous, you use their program, which really gives you some advantages, because they teach you how to ""shekat"" a certain thing, which you would otherwise also get on the Internet, but by doing that you put your computer at risk, because you don't know if that little program was clean and if maybe your computer is already in the process of being prepared for some DDoS attack that they are doing in the background,"" explains Špehonja. <p/> Hackers in movies and in reality <p/> The movie Hacker is currently playing in cinemas.Visualising an intrusion is always a particularly challenging task, often with user interfaces that are either very graphically sophisticated or a simple DOS window with opaque program code or numbers flying by extremely fast. Spehonja explains how far this is from reality by saying that ""those numbers, those codes flying around, are usually laughed at by those of us who are in the field."" The IP 352.612.x.x is nonsense, because there is no such thing as a number greater than 255. ""As far as critical infrastructure is concerned, the degradation of water, transport infrastructure, electricity, etc. I would be careful what to say here, but it is also a possible attack. Of course it is possible, but of course it is more difficult. Such an attack would, of course, take a long time to prepare for, but the theoretical possibilities are there. After all, some people say that everything can be faked. Some people spend all day just writing programs that hack into other programs,"" adds the ethical hacker, who sees the movie scenes as being mostly exaggerated."

If they want to help our biggest company, Hito, which is in serious trouble, they will have to give up a hefty pile of money. On the agenda of the municipal meeting is a proposal to reduce the land-use allowance for gambling by 70%. Knowing that last year, Hit contributed a whopping EUR 1.7 million to the municipal coffers, it is understandable why the Hit people are cheering loudly for the adoption of this measure. Employees, they say, have already contributed their share with the last pay cuts, and now the state and the municipality are on the move, since the decree assessing the compensation was written in 2003, when, as we like to say, the gambling industry was, as we like to say, churning out honey and milk.

651	WHICH MALE OF THE ZODIAC IS THE HARDEST TO GET OVER? <p/> Which zodiac sign is the man born in who is the hardest to get over, depending on the astro sign you were born in? <p/> Even though they're over and you want to treat him like all exes, somehow you can't forget about him. Just one thought of his smile, his joking remarks, the way he pronounced your name is enough to keep you from getting over him completely. Wondering what sign the man you may never get over is born in, depending on the zodiac sign you were born in? <p/> LIBRA GETS OVER LIBRA THE HARDEST <p/> A romantic man born in Libra is your opposite, so strong that you're incredibly attracted to him even if you've ended the relationship. You can relive your great chemistry for years to come and no other man is as attentive as a Libra when it comes to intimate relationships. His graceful Venusian energy will long remain in the memory of the sheep, triggering the warmth that the sheep, although acting all-powerful and stable, constantly craves. <p/> Taurus is the hardest Sagittarius to forget <p/> Astrologically speaking, when Taurus and Sagittarius come together they create an element of tension, but this is precisely the reason why Taurus will not forget the spontaneous, resourceful and kind Sagittarius for a long time to come. Although they are not fundamentally compatible, a Taurus is never bored around a Sagittarius. She can relinquish control around him, which is not easy for her. When she tries to get over him, there's a problem, because she finds that she misses his messiness. <p/> Gemini is the hardest to beat in Capricorn <p/> At first glance, Gemini and Capricorn have nothing in common, but when you look a little deeper, you realise that for the distracted and irresponsible Gemini, the persistent and consistent Capricorn is the perfect match, especially if she wants to put certain areas of her life in order. When they break up, the twin perceives it all as a deep hurt, knowing that no other man will motivate her so self-sacrificingly and persistently to be consistent in her struggles and thus more successful and content. <p/> CANCER HURTS FASTEST OF FISH <p/> Cancer is one of the most sentimental zodiac signs, and after it we rank Pisces. Both signs focus on relationships and together they move into deep emotional perceptions that others may not be able to perceive. When a relationship with a Pisces man ends, it can leave a big hole in her life, as she can't connect with any other man as deeply as she can with a Pisces. <p/> LEVINS HAVE THE HARDEST TIME GETTING OVER AQUARIUS <p/> Leo has the hardest time getting over the free-spirited and resourceful Aquarius. He is her cosmic doppelganger who teaches her how to act independently and how to appreciate all values, especially friendship. Aquarius energy has a strong influence on Leo, complementing and encouraging her in everyday things. When she thinks of him, she misses his wit most of all, which must have made her laugh and smile many times. <p/> VIRGO HARDEST TO WAKE UP TWIN <p/> Virgo and Gemini tend to get on well at first because of their mutual love of intellectual pursuits. Because they stimulate each other mentally and can talk for hours about anything, it is the twin who the Virgo misses the most when she ends the relationship with him, or finds it hard to get over. When he is no longer with her, she starts to miss his sarcastic teasing and incredible curiosity. <p/> LIBRA HARDEST TO GET OVER Taurus <p/> Libra is strongly linked to Taurus because of their shared ruling planet Venus. When the relationship ends, Libra misses Taurus, who has always been stable and determined, and she also misses his stubbornness. Libra will find it hard to get over Taurus, especially those beautiful romantic moments together that were like the most beautiful fairy tale. When Libra is completely free, she often misses the bull's control. <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over, both are ruled by Mars, which means they are incredibly passionate. Scorpio will miss Aries, even though there have been various clashes between them all along. Without Aries, she may be bored. Scorpio will find it hard to find the kind of intense dynamic that she has with Aries with other signs. She misses Aries most when she goes to bed at night. <p/> Sagittarius is the hardest to impress for a Leo <p/> Sagittarius and Leo are enthusiastic, spontaneous and have a desire to live life to the full. Both are independent and always understand the other's need for space. When a Sagittarius ends a relationship with a Leo, what she misses most is his ease and incredible understanding of her way of life. Although Sagittarians find themselves quickly in a new relationship, it will take them longer to get over the Leo, if they ever do get over him completely. <p/> CAPRICORN GETS OVER CANCER THE HARDEST <p/> Capricorn is very serious and needs someone to get her riled up. Cancer is the one who constantly gives her a youthful, innocent and gentle energy that definitely brings out the feminine part of Capricorn. Capricorn misses Cancer the most because it has taught her many things, including how to give herself completely in a love relationship. Cancer is hard to get over because without it, she finds it difficult to find the right emotional balance. <p/> Aquarius finds it hardest to get over Scorpio <p/> Aquarius and Scorpio have almost nothing in common, which is why Scorpio is a great mystical enigma for Aquarius, even when the relationship ends. She misses him mainly because he is able to look at things and life in an impersonal and logical way, because he is uncomplicated and honest. Aquarius makes Scorpio feel the most beautiful and the best, and she misses his sexy compliments and passion, which is so important to her in a relationship. <p/> FISH HURTS A GIRL the hardest <p/> Pisces brings emotional depth to a relationship, so a man born in Virgo offers them stability. Pisces, although a hopeless romantic, misses Virgo for her meticulous, consistent and honest actions. When a relationship ends, the Pisces is very sad that she will no longer enjoy a loving relationship with a Virgo man who is sincere and filled with affection. Pisces also misses the working zeal and sense of the material that Virgo has.	Opinion/Argumentation	Other
661	Psychotherapy for the challenges of (in)fertility <p/> Reproduction is understood as a fundamental feature of life that allows the existence and continuation of the species. Parenthood is also a natural part of the life cycle and an important milestone in a partnership. Both are taken for granted, not as something we want from life, but simply expect. <p/> Infertility is often one of the most emotionally challenging and stressful life experiences that an individual and a couple can experience. The struggle to conceive or the decision to adopt a child can often be accompanied by feelings of loss, which are often difficult to share with friends and family. For women who are struggling to conceive, it can be extremely painful to watch a friend preparing to give birth or young mothers she meets on the street. For men, it is common to feel sadness, helplessness and frustration that they cannot solve the problem and resolve their partner's pain. <p/> Infertility is a journey that is often accompanied by feelings of loneliness, sadness, helplessness and many frustrations. Even if it appears as a great unknown, fortunately there are well-established ways to get through this difficult period. Some experiences of infertility are common to everyone, others are specific to whether you have experienced pregnancy loss, failed IVF procedures, have not chosen to have an OBMP, are single, in a same-sex partnership, are considering donor sex, or are already parents and trying to conceive again.

675	When is it time to renovate the roof? <p/> The roof is a key structural element that protects the building from the elements (rain, snow, hail, sun, wind). The quality of the roof has a direct impact on the durability of the building and the living conditions inside, which is particularly important for living in a loft. <Once it no longer meets these requirements, it is time to renovate. But every leak does not mean that the whole roof has to be replaced. What to do if the roof starts leaking? <p/> Reasons to renovate your roof <p/> Making repairs due to inadequate construction or renovation work <p/> Major roof damage due to natural disasters (windstorms, hail, etc.) <p/> Rehabilitation or reconstruction <p/> We can only repair part of the roof covering. However, if the roof is worn out or requires work such as modification of the roof structure to make extensions (to gain additional roof space) or to change the appearance of the roof for aesthetic reasons, reconstruction makes the most sense. <p/> How much will a roof renovation cost <p/> The price of a roof renovation depends primarily on the type of roofing material and its price. Prices for roofing material without installation start at: <p/> €7/m2 for concrete and bitumen roofing, <p/> €8/m2 for brick roofing, <p/> €10/m2 for metal roofing <p/> Installation costs €15-20/m2. If the roofing has to be replaced in its entirety, in addition to the price for the roofing and the installation, we have to take into account the additional works that affect the price of replacing the roofing: dismantling, removal to a landfill, the condition of the wooden structure, the other roof elements (flashings, gutters, vents, etc.). <p/> Example of a roof replacement price calculation <p/> For a 150m2 gable roof replacement (brick tiles), we will charge approximately €30/m2 for materials and installation, i.e. a total of €4500/m2. <p/> If the replacement also includes the installation of a vapour barrier, dismantling and removal of the old roofing material, this means an additional cost of at least €1000. <p/> Don't forget about the building permit <p/> Replacing the roof and roofing is maintenance work and therefore does not require a building permit, as long as it is a structural renovation that does not change the size and shape of the building. Otherwise, building documentation and a permit must be obtained.	Information/Explanation	Promotion

687	Tax relief for employing the unemployed <p/> If you employ unemployed people under 26 or over 55 who have been registered with us as unemployed for at least half a year, you can claim a tax relief for them in the form of a reduction in your tax base. <p/> Jobseeker's Allowance <p/> Who can claim the allowance? <p/> You can claim employment tax credits for: <p/> taxable persons under the Corporate Income Tax Act or <p/> taxable persons under the Income Tax Act, <p/> who newly and permanently employ unemployed persons from the defined groups, on the basis of an employment contract under the Employment Relations Act. <p/> How much is the deduction? <p/> Corporate Income Tax Act: <p/> You claim the relief as a reduction of the taxable amount of 45% of the salary of the person employed, up to a maximum of the taxable amount. <p/> You can claim the relief for the first 24 months of the person's employment in the tax year of employment and subsequent tax years until the 24 months have elapsed. <p/> Income Tax Act: <p/> You claim the relief as a reduction of the taxable amount of 45% of the salary paid to the person employed (gross 1st). <p/> You can claim the relief for the first 24 months of the person's employment in the tax year of employment and in subsequent tax years, depending on the wages paid to the person in the tax year. <p/> Who can claim the relief? <p/> You can claim the tax credit if you employ a newly unemployed person for an indefinite period of time from one of the following groups: <p/> under 26 years of age who have been registered as unemployed for at least 6 months with our Institute, <p/> over 55 years of age who have been registered as unemployed for at least 6 months with our Institute. <p/> It is important that the unemployed person you are employing has not been employed by you or a related person in the last 24 months. <p/> What are the other conditions for the relief? <p/> You can only claim the tax credit if you increase the total number of employees in the tax year or tax period in which you newly employ the unemployed person for whom you claim the credit. <p/> An increase in the number of employees means that the number of employees you have on the last day of the tax year or period is higher than the average of the 12 months in that tax year or period. <p/> In determining the increase in the number of employees, part-time employees are taken into account on a pro rata basis, while fixed-term employees are not taken into account. <p/> DO NOT CONSIDER: <p/> The tax relief for employment of the unemployed is mutually exclusive with: <p/> the tax relief for employment of the disabled (under the Income Tax Act and the Corporate Income Tax Act), <p/> the tax relief for employment of the unemployed (under the Development Support to the Pomurje Region in the Period 2010-2015 Act). <p/> From when does the relief apply? <p/> You can claim the relief in your income tax return from 2010 onwards.

700	"""Programmed Ambiance"" shows the relationship between cardboard, ambiance and numerical programming. The numerical structure is the basis of the whole art installation, on its basis the artwork produces itself. The programmed ambience consisted of 2184 drawings on cards, which were embedded in 156 hanging mobiles, the floor was covered by a carpet about 40 m long on which the numerical programme of one of the hanging card series was printed, and a horizontal grid structure that was attached just above the ceiling. The gallery hall was thus divided into three levels. The overall ambience was based on permutations of full and empty space, defined by a grid construction with 286 points - knots that measured out space to vertical mobiles. The numerical program that determined the position of the mobiles was selected on the basis of all possible 11-digit combinations of the characters 0 and 1, with the condition that they are in the ratio 5:6 and that the rows so selected follow each other in the original order, starting with the most uniform combination (1010101010101) until the given space is filled. Odd rows of the programme are read from left to right, even rows vice versa. The mobiles consisted of four card-programmed series entitled ""Ear"", ""Rifle"", ""Matches"" and a series entitled ""Day"", which was also featured as a comic strip in Problems -PU, an issue devoted to programmed art. Part of the ""Programmed Ambient"" installation was also a ""Programmed Carpet"" on which a partial numerical programme was displayed. Programmed Ambient was first exhibited at the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana in April 1969, as part of the Atelier 69 exhibition. Iztok Geister described the notion of SERIES as: the Ohoian ideoagram as a network of two sets of things: the same and different. In the vertical, the same things are arranged in the horizontal into different things, into the most perfect and the simplest world at the same time. Text."

702	MY WONDERFUL WIVES <p/> For a long time I have been preparing myself mentally and otherwise to put something on paper - but I can't - I'm too low. <p/> If only I could tell you or anyone else what I have been going through for almost four years! Since you left our home, which we had arranged so beautifully, I have been alone, so alone, without you, dearest Vida. There are only mute walls that I cannot talk to. <p/> Vida, what I experience when I come to you every day. I cannot wait for the hour that I have become accustomed to, to go to you, to hug you and kiss you. How good it feels to have you kiss me back so many times. How I would like to talk to you, but I cannot, only your loving eyes look at me so warmly and caress me. How I try and try to get you to say something, but nothing, nothing of it. How long I have been spoon-feeding you, trying every day to bring you something good that I know you loved. I love to do that for you, my beautiful wife. <p/> Vida, how happy I am that you are in such a well-kept home, where they take such good care of you and the other residents. All respect to the management and the staff in the wards who are so attentive to you. <p/> Vida, when I have been coming to see you lately, I sometimes find myself spontaneously, unconsciously hugging one of your good caregivers. How much it means to me to be able to hold her hand, to touch her with gratitude, I cannot tell anyone. I do not mean anything bad by it, but I wonder what if these girls and wives have misunderstood me. <p/> Vida, when I lose you in this way, your wonderful looks and touches, your pleasant conversations and hugs, my world falls apart. <p/> My Vida, if you only knew how many tears I shed when I realise that you are gone forever from our beautiful home. With your departure, all the warmth, all the grace has gone. I wonder where my tears are still coming from. <p/> Vida, I miss you more and more, I am more and more alone, so alone. You know I have never been weak, but now I am broken, I can't help it. I often want to talk to the staff who look after you in the home, but too often my throat catches and tears come to my eyes. It makes me feel embarrassed. Even now, it is difficult for me, it is getting harder and harder for me to find the words, so I will finish. <p/> Vida, thank you for all the beautiful moments, the warm glances that only you have given me. We all love you immensely, your lovely daughters Renata and Breda, your grandchildren Rok and Jure, and I have no words to tell you that you are mine, mine, like a good day. <p/> Yours Ivan <p/> Categories : <p/> Share :	Other	Other

Now that I see you're not as stubborn as lightning, please send me more bullets and David and I will give you an unbiased first hand assessment of the quality after a thorough examination... <p/> (16-01-2017, 21:11)apple Written by: I'd pretty much forgotten about those Arma bullets...but the early findings are this. The bullet has a harder core and consequently there is less copper coating, Los abandoned this some time ago and has the opposite...Tolerances, weight within normal limits, but on every bullet in the box, there is a matrix imprint at the transition of the radius to the tip, this is yet to be corrected, Los had the same problem and now it is solved, because such a bullet can not go abroad................................................................................. Nothing special in shooting, loading, of course for something more I would use rest, but for ipsc not even...as a type of bullet RN clean ok product. Price of bullets...wins the Moose, bold <p/> And this is the thorough test for you that you were raving about a page back? Ma dej... A 25,000 shus/year man is expected to have a concrete test, not to wash you. <p/> Mozakar has no time or else he won't reach the 25,000 norm this year <p/> Otherwise, a month and a half ago I found about 45 rounds of 147 grain in a package of 124 grain LOS 9mm kugels, FP. So even the LOS big-bore will probably have to learn, if nothing else, how to pack kugels. Price for mortals through official channels-> I don't know if LOS wins. 32€ vs 34€, at Rebec. <p/> Yeah well it says if you read it...conclusions at a glance I don't know what you expect, the point is said I have no intention of bothering with this really...why don't you give it a try yourself <p/> Great no...you'll have to learn a lot too, until then buy Arma bullets.... <p/> No I didn't buy them, if you're interested. I've bought quite a lot of LOS already, and I'm not going to stop because of this mistake. It just happens. You don't have to be a smartass like you to praise one, you probably get a ton of it for free. And especially in the Armaforce thread, when someone asked about those bullets, not the LOS. I get on LOS' nerves sometimes just because of your stupid crap. <p/> Just a quick comparison of one and the other was made, I gave my findings, but if you take that as bragging I can't help you, a hundred people are a hundred wonders <p/> Yeah well, it says here, if you read....you're the one bitching about a thorough test not me.So don't throw your fake tests at me. <p/> But you're not happy with the whole world, come on, be a little positive sometime, what is it man, what do you want to prove... I gave my findings, wrote that I had no intention of dealing with it and suggested that you find out for yourself if it's in your interest... my answer was not to your liking, you gave me a minus, you got it back... here's the way it goes in the new year <p/> The Master made the only sensible comment. The others are well below the level. I thought this was typical of jagras. But I see you are cutting us down. Armaforce made a big mistake by posting the LOS pictures. These are just marketing ploys of modern entrepreneurs. Any publicity is good, even if it is negative. It is naive to think that this was a mistake. If they know how to package the bullets (excellent packaging) then they should know how to present them to the shooters. This work was then done free of charge by Tine. You are asking for a detailed test from Apple. Why would the competition test their bullets at all? You are the top experts here on the pile. And yet you dispute Apple's brief quick findings. I am happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers my questions. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you? <p/> Ah, I told you why ipsc is considered the king of marksmanship...because of the strict adherence to the rules and the immediate DQ at the slightest violation of them...the marksmanship of the individual has nothing to do with it, the shooters who take part in these competitions are all kings, as you rightly pointed out, thank you thank you...they know how to handle their weapons according to the accepted rules, because there is no other way to do it. I know that for someone who hasn't been to these competitions it's completely alien, how else to understand posting an unacceptable video where you have your finger on the trigger when loading and unloading the gun.... Ps the video is under...[adjustable sights for rexs] but it would be better if it wasn't... if you're still wondering what you're hoping for the kings will explain :))) <p/> Apple if you look very well the finger is not on the trigger.. So I don't see anything controversial..look well the finger was not on the trigger But I told you that you are the only ""king"" who is bullshitting about IPSC being oh and all.. If you were shooting a precision shooter this discipline would be the King of Shooting... As for Los...I see that whoever comes to the market with bullets you spit on them and bullshit them with nonsense comments....You could behave more appropriately for your age...You better be respectful to others on the market,because if David behaved like that the picture would be quite different...Sometimes you really throw shit on the forum and you mumble something but it would be better to bite your tongue...So think a little if your behaviour is ""royal""...You'll have to think about that...<p/> (18-01-2017, 12:36)alojz1 Posted: I'm happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers to me. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you have them? <p/> You're already happy, but Apple is not...So far he has spat on everyone and acts like he's the big i batina at Los... Unfortunately he can't stand that others are trying to launch their bullets on the market... When MiHec started making their bullets it was the same...Only Apple was throwing shit around the forum and acting smart about bullets...as if only Los knows how to make bullets and everyone else is a loser... Come on.... That's why Tine you will never make anything of yourself,because you don't know how to accept competition... You will always be just a man who knows how to screw people over very well,instead of giving some useful information for your years.. <p/> 18-01-2017, 15:06 (This post was last modified on 18-01-2017, 15:12 by alojz1.) <p/> Sandi, about the competition, just this. Everyone has their favourites. The thing with the Jags is that they are always looking for something new, something better. In short, a bullet that always hits without damaging the roast, and the game falls on the spot. And every new one is the best until it happens..... I also have good experience with both other manufacturers here. If anyone asks for an opinion I always praise them. In my opinion they are better than the much vaunted Barnes TTSX. I myself have been using LOS since the beginning. I recently killed an 80kg pig in the thick of it. Drop on the spot. Hit through the heart. Why would I buy an expensive one when this bullet has everything I need. You just have to hit it. But if I'm shooting at paper, it's hard to find a cheaper and more accurate one. And as long as that's the case, this bullet will be in my gun. You guys can keep switching all you want. <p/> I'm not picking on anyone :-P But if folks don't accept my thinking and can't argue back...that's not my problem. Me? prove it? I have nothing to prove. You are already proving yourself...day by day... Yes, you have made the points...but you haven't made the points...that you wrote about...that David and you are going to ""debunk"". In the end, all that comes out of your side is one big....bla....bla....bla....bla... ...blah. <p/>Ma what a clever comment, please. I don't think you can do it. Sessions can't stand anything but his own opinion....some of the sheeple cheerfully follow his lead. He can be a great shot,when he has a gewehr in his hands and has great results, but when he gives answers,he shoots goats....He usually speaks in terms of LOS is the law, or 25,000 shushes/year, IPSC, etc...etc...and that too many times when he has nothing to do with the topic. Let me know, did anyone force him to test? Well, no. Did he force himself to take the test? Well, he did. Someone who is supposed to have a clue about bowling pins, because he works in a bowling pin company, is expected to make a test according to his ""tongue-twister"", not to make a test like one of the yagers in the pub behind the bar would make it. <p/> 18-01-2017, 17:55 (This post was last modified 18-01-2017, 18:02 by alojz1.) <p/> Have you removed the Master's comment? I did mention it, 765Br quotes me now but I can't find it anymore. Did I misread something or are there strange things going on here? <p/> 18-01-2017, 18:12 (This post was last modified: 18-01-2017, 18:36 by apple.) <p/> Precision...will never be a royal discipline because doing things like yours seems to be common there and I started with precision I am no stranger to it...I still hope for every match unlike you who strictly reject ipsc but it would be to your advantage if I learned to behave SAFELY with a weapon. It won't stick...what you're doing in the video is pure DQ. The rule is that your finger must be visibly away from the trigger, it's not with you. It has to be VISIBLY extended at the bolt...with a hook like that you get an instant DQ on the ipsc...not to mention where the finger is after the gun is cocked...on the TRIGGER it could only be there when you are in the target sight The rest I don't care about...I don't have the ability to read people's minds, so I just don't comment on who's who... as for the Arma bullets, I wrote what I observed and I don't see anything else flying in there... <p/> (18-01-2017, 17:55)alojz1 Wrote: Did you retract the Master's comment?

751	The decision as to whether the Fund for Agricultural Land and Forests of the Republic of Slovenia will enter into an agreement with a denationalisation beneficiary is a commercial decision which is not within the discretion of the court and is therefore not a significant question of law which would constitute a ground for allowing review. <p/> Denationalisation - review - admissibility - important question of law <p/> Deciding on an interim injunction requires a restrictive approach. In the application for interim relief itself, the claimant must specify all the circumstances and all the facts on which it relies to justify the occurrence and the amount of the damage. He must also show that such damage constitutes damage which is difficult for him to repair. <p/> The guardian has endangered the financial interests of her ward, which makes it more advantageous for the ward to have another guardian. <p/> The applicants had been informed that it was permissible to hunt bears weighing up to 150 kg. As the bear killed was significantly heavier, the inspector was justified in seizing it. <p/> In its application for financial interventions, the applicant provided incorrect information concerning the area of crops sown. As the discrepancy was greater than 1 ha, the defendant correctly ordered the recovery of the funds obtained. <p/> In the case of computer programs, the reproduction right is obtained by means of an appropriate licence agreement. In the absence of such a contract, the applicant has not acquired the relevant material copyright in the computer programs in question and is therefore not a legitimate user of them. <p/> Action by the Market Inspector - Use of unlicensed computer programs <p/> The documentation gathered confirms the suspicion that the children in the family of origin were not provided with the necessary education and care. However, the suspicion that the children were present during the ill-treatment of another child requires the intervention of the Social Work Centre. Thus, the measure of removal of the children from their parents was justified. <p/> Removal of the children from their parents and placement in a foster family <p/> In the present case, the Court of First Instance, by judgment, decided an administrative dispute concerning the refusal of medical treatment and dismissed the applicant's action as unfounded. However, pursuant to Article 73(1) of the Causes of Action Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment, which became final on 8 January 2008. <p/> Since the land in question is part of the road body and thus excluded from legal turnover or is not capable of acquiring a right of ownership (Article 19(1)(3) ZDen), it cannot be returned in kind. Therefore, the compensation for this part of the land was also correctly determined for the beneficiary in the SOD bonds. <p/>Denationalisation - obstacle to restitution of the land in kind <p/> The appeal lodged against the first instance decision has the effect of a timely and admissible appeal, even though the first instance decision was not formally served on the appellant in the correct manner. <p/> Action taken by the Planning Inspector - removal of the holiday home and restoration of the land to its former state <p/> Since the use of the Internet itself, even through the complainant, is not free of charge, since users have to pay for telephone pulses to use the Internet, which cannot be regarded as a well-known fact, since this is a relatively new form of communication, both conditions laid down in Article 12b(1) of the Act on the Protection of Competition and Competition Law are fulfilled. Advertising of free Internet access services under the brand name 'free Internet ...'... <p/> Market inspector's measure - misleading advertising - free internet access <p/> Since the applicant is the subject of a continuing enforcement action by direct coercion against a party which has failed to comply with the market inspector's prohibition, the administrative authority, in view of the fact that there is an enforcement order and that enforcement has been granted against the applicant and that he has been fined, had every legal basis for issuing an order authorising enforcement to recover the fine already imposed. <p/> The applicant did not have a legal interest in bringing the action, since he was unable to improve his legal position or obtain a more favourable settlement for himself by bringing an action against the contested decision. <p/> Customs - joint and several debtor - legal interest in bringing an action - dismissal of the action <p/> Both conditions for administrative enforcement laid down in Article 291 of the Code of Administrative Procedure are fulfilled, since the decision of the administrative authority became enforceable on the expiry of the time-limit for compliance with the obligation imposed, and the failure to comply with the obligation imposed led to the decision authorising enforcement. <p/> In the Court of First Instance's view, the facts of the present case remain undisputed, both in the administrative and judicial proceedings, since the applicant's pleas challenge only the correct application of the law. The facts of the present case consist only in the determination of the characteristics or composition of the goods, which the applicant has not disputed (nor has it adduced any other evidence as to the characteristics of the customs-cleared goods).

768	"End of Leg 4 of the Volvo Ocean Race <p/> Wednesday 04 Mar 2015 <p/> All six teams have successfully sailed into Auckland, New Zealand. Leg 4 was very interesting. Tactical decisions decided the final placings. Two were crucial. <p/> The importance of the right or wrong tactical decisions had the strongest impact on Team Brunel's final position. They sailed the first part of the leg from Sanya, China very well. Before the Philippines, they decided to sail north, where the winds were expected to be stronger. The tactical decision was the right one and they swung into first place, sailing all the way to the equator. Brunel's skipper, Bouwe Bekking, said after arriving at the finish: ""It's hard for a team that has sailed very well. We only finished in fifth place because of a mistake Andrew Cap and I made. The mistake we made cost us a good place. We were leading all the way to the equator. When we sailed with the wind to the east, things did not go as planned. The weather did not do what we expected. From the first place we had held since 15.2. we dropped to fifth on 22.2. And now we are at the finish line. For the second time in a row in fifth place. I must admit that I am disappointed. In the last few legs we have realised that very strange things can happen in a regatta. The differences between the teams are very small and many things can happen. That is the advantage of sailing on the same boats. It's just part of sailing!"" <p/> MAPFRE was the fastest team to finish Leg 4. The Abu Dhabi team followed and the Chinese boat Dongfeng came third. Team Alvimedica came in fourth ahead of Team Brunel, and the last to cross the finish line was the SCA women's crew. Despite the teams sailing over 5000 nm, the difference between the first and the last team was only 7 hours and one minute."	News/Reporting	News/Reporting

781	"News archive <p/> Government issues decree on small-scale renewable energy installations. <p/> On 5 March, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia issued a Regulation on small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration. The Regulation defines the types, size and conditions for the installation and connection of small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration, which do not require a building permit in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of buildings. The Regulation is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 14/2020. <p/> The Regulation is issued on the basis of the provisions of the Energy Act, which establishes the legal basis for the adoption of a by-law to determine the types of simple installations for the production of electricity from RES or CHP that do not require a building permit and are installed on, in or next to an existing building or civil engineering structure built in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of structures, their size and the conditions for their installation and connection. <p/> These subjects were previously regulated in the Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which also contained Chapter IV.a ""Specific features and exceptions in the field of electricity generation"", which provided that the installation of a RES/SPHPP electricity generation installation in accordance with the building regulations was to be considered as investment maintenance work (which did not require a building permit), provided that certain conditions were fulfilled. The new Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which entered into force in April 2016, repealed this Regulation and does not contain any provisions related to such production installations. This means that under the current legislation on the construction of buildings, the installation of such installations generally requires a building permit, which, given the relative complexity of their installation, constitutes an excessive administrative burden and has a disincentive effect on investment in such installations. Taking into account the fact that the Republic of Slovenia has to achieve binding targets for the production of electricity from RES (otherwise it faces high fines), investments in such installations should also be encouraged by removing administrative barriers. As will be explained below, the current building legislation allows for this, but this area also needs to be regulated in more detail in the energy regulations. Among other things, the Building Act stipulates that a building permit is not required for simple structures and maintenance of structures (Art. 5 of the Building Act). What falls into this category is derived from the Regulation on the classification of buildings, which lays down the criteria for classifying simple, non-complex, less complex, complex buildings, other building interventions and maintenance works. Maintenance work, according to point 4 (Installation of installations in, on and adjacent to the installation), includes, inter alia, the installation of new installations and associated installations for the exploitation of RES. However, as this has already been regulated in the abovementioned Energy Infrastructure Regulation, it is necessary to regulate the types of installations in the energy legislation, including power limitations, and the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of the installation and the operation of such installations.

806	Are you left without pressure in your heating system ? <p/> It has become uncomfortably cold in your home. This may be due to insufficient pressure in your system. In today's article you will find out all the possible causes and solutions. <p/> Insufficient pressure in the heating system is one of the most common causes of poor heating performance, and we receive the most calls from customers about it. <p/> Why is the pressure in your system too low? <p/> There can be several causes of low pressure. The most common causes are: <p/> Venting the system for too long: <p/> For radiators, we recommend venting before each heating season. Learn more about how to properly vent radiators. Often radiators are vented for too long, so only vent them for as long as air is coming out of them. Stop venting when water starts coming out. Venting for too long can cause a loss of pressure in your system. <p/> Safety valve too small: <p/> The safety valve protects your heating system from over-pressurisation. It opens above a certain value and starts to drain the water in your system. If the safety valve is too small, the valve will open too quickly and cause you to lose pressure in your system. This is why it is important to have a company with experience install your mechanical installations, many times boiler rooms are not sized correctly to achieve the lower prices offered on the market. <p/> Definitely the most common reason why the pressure in your system is too low. The expansion tank consists of two chambers separated by an impermeable membrane. One chamber contains the heating water - the other contains the gas, usually nitrogen. If the heating water expands as it is heated, the expansion tank regulates it: It absorbs the excess water and compresses the gas in the second chamber. If the gas pressure is incorrectly set or if the diaphragm is defective, the expansion tank will no longer work properly and the heating system will start to lose water. <p/> Water leaks from heating pipes, fittings, fittings and radiators: <p/> In rare cases, your system will leak water from a burst pipe, a fitting that is not tight enough, a radiator or even a fitting. Often the leak can be identified by puddles of water that appear at the very point where the water is escaping from the system. In the case of a burst pipe, for example, which is located under the plaster, the leak is more difficult to detect. Detection is aided by the use of a thermal imaging camera. <p/> For these reasons, it is even more important to choose a company with experience and references before deciding to install a heating system. This will ensure that you get a boiler room with quality and, of course, correctly sized materials. This will save you a lot of money and nerves :)	Information/Explanation	Instruction

The ceremony was graced by the presence of the following guests: the Mayor of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah Peter Škrlec, the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association Robert Mesarec, the Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Leopold Omerzu, the Deputy Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Franc Lakner, the Sub-Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij v Slovih goricah Fire Brigade. Gorice Robert Kukovec, Commander of the Municipal Command of the Municipality of Pesnica Jože Repa, Commander of the Civil Protection of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij Alen Breznik, local parish priest and dean Janko Goergner, representatives of the volunteer fire brigades from Benedikt, Cerkvenjak, Lenart, Svete Trojice, Svete Anna, Voličina, Selce, Gočova and Oseko; from the neighbouring firefighters' association, the event was graced by the presence of representatives of the Volunteer Fire Brigades from Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. <p/> The celebrations were introduced by a festive parade. At the beginning of the parade, we watched the bearer of the national flag, Alojz Žnofl, a junior firefighter of the 2nd level, followed by the firefighter's emblem carried by the juniors of PGD Sveti Jurij, Maja Kukovec and Nuša Najdenik. The parade was then led by. The parade commander was Robert Kukovec, firefighter newspaperman II, vice-commander of the Lenart Firefighters' Association and commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, and his assistants were Uroš Črnčec, junior firefighter newspaperman I and Tilen Kristl, senior firefighter I. <p/> This was followed by the Lenart Fire Brigades Association's Platoon of Honour, which is made up of members from all ten Lenart Fire Brigades Association companies. It was led by Jernej Sinič, Senior Firefighter, and Ivan Divjak was the flag bearer of the Honor Platoon. <p/> The flag echelon followed. The standard bearers' echelon was led by Robert Črnčec, Firefighter's Timekeeper 1st Class, Deputy Commander of the home association. The flag bearer of the home association, Jožek Zaletinger, was at the head, with the youth flag of PGD Sveti Jurij, carried by Karin Najdenik, at his side. This was followed by banner bearers from all ten Lenart Fire Brigade associations and banner bearers from the neighbouring associations of Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. This was followed by the firefighter youth echelon, commanded by Alen Breznik, senior firefighter. Next came the members' echelon, led by Dejan Najdenik, a junior firefighter, 1st level. <p/> This was followed by the echelon of fire engines. At the head was a 1982 FAP vehicle driven by Jože Sinič. This was followed by the AC16/40 special vehicle, driven by Branko Črnčec. Next was the newer Mercedes Atego GVC 16/25, driven by Žan Krajnc. Other vehicles of the Lenart Fire Brigades Association and neighbouring volunteer associations followed. <p/> After the parade, all firefighters and guests gathered for the main ceremony in the tent in front of the entrance to Jura Square. <Before the start of the ceremony, the commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, Robert Kukovec, asked the Mayor of the municipality, Peter Škrlec, for permission to start the event. <p/> In the introduction of the ceremony, the President of the Sveti Jurij Volunteer Fire Brigade in Slovenske gorice, Gregor Nudl, spoke about the activities that led to the new fire truck being among us, about the wishes for a new vehicle. As the acquisition of a new fire truck is a great financial burden, but also a joy and pride for the firefighters and all citizens, the Mayor of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah, Peter Škrlec, also spoke on the occasion of such an important acquisition for our town and praised the efforts of the Jurij firefighters for the modernisation of the fleet and the dedicated performance of volunteer firefighting activities. Of course, all the assembled firefighters and guests were also welcomed by the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association, Robert Mesarec. <p/> This was followed by the official handover of the vehicle, during which the President and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij PGD handed over the keys to the driver and the vehicle's custodian, Andrej Sinič. The new firefighting vehicle was blessed by the local parish priest and dean, Janko Gögner, who wished the users of the vehicle a happy and safe journey and to use it mainly for social purposes and as little as possible for interventions. <p/> The ceremony of taking over the new vehicle was enriched with a short cultural programme by the Jurova Octet and the young accordionist Marko Igrec. <p/> As the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle is unimaginable without financial support, the representatives of the Voluntary Firefighters' Association Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah presented a token of appreciation to all donors and godparents who financially supported the Association in the purchase of the new firefighting vehicle. <p/> We concluded the ceremony with a sincere wish for the Jurij firefighters that despite the new equipment, volunteerism, courage and helping their fellow man remain their values. <p/> After the ceremony, there was a social gathering of all the firemen and firewomen, followed by the entertainment part of the celebration, as our firefighters also provided the appropriate catering, and we were able to warm up our hands and heels to the music of the ensemble Hearty Musicians.

858	"In the media <p/> Book Heroes, Spiritually Responsible vs Spiritually Comfortable <p/> The anthropological-philosophical reflection Heroes begins with a chapter on the development of spiritual thought in the light of dualisms, such as the parallel or intertwined path of material and spiritual science, by the author Dr Lucija Mulej Mlakar. In doing so, she touches on the area of spiritual growth, which should not become a field of contradictions, as is often the case when self-proclaimed ""gurus"" take on the task of the personal growth of their followers, who in turn uncritically imitate them. The spiritual quest has its own psychopathology, which it points out even with fictitious examples such as preoccupation with appearances, calculating, easy and comfortable, or wrong attitudes towards possessions, education, etc. These seemingly clichéd truths for ""spiritual seekers"" are presented in a new and original way in the book. Through chapters on the dimension of time, the history of the heart and the integration of intelligences, the author introduces interesting ideas: time holes and time pockets, concavity and convexity of memory, generational codes or a new look at the traditional philosophy of personal time and personal karma. The ""dark night of the soul"", as she calls the inconsolable suffering, could be illuminated with the help of her guidance and her book Heroes. The word hero is synonymous with courage and strength of heart and spirit. <p/> You can order the book from the author, Dr Lucija Mulej Mlakar: lucija.mulej@budnjani.si l Price € 30."	Other	Promotion
865	hello girls! i wonder if any of you can give me some advice about the bleeding i'm having! i'm expecting my period in 5 days (i.e. saturday) and i've already started bleeding... I usually have a very heavy period on the first day, accompanied by pain... but now the bleeding is a bit weaker, and more of a watery red colour... no mucus... and the pain in my abdomen is about the same as before my period, just not as strong. in the last week or so (a day or so more) I have also noticed that my breasts are fuller than usual, my belly has swelled up a bit, my lower back hurts a bit. twice I have also noticed that I have this metallic taste in my mouth.. can I attribute this to just a little bit worse pms or... is it possible that these could be some signs of pregnancy! hope you can find your way out of this, ger sm very a.. positive of course! if by any chance something comes up I would be very happy! <p/> I'm not a girl, but still, bleeding could be a reason to be happy, which is very difficult to diagnose without a previous menstrual calendar, according to the forum.

874	Gala Event Recording <p/> 05 Aug <p/> Interested in recording a wedding, or maybe just events in general? Everyone has a few events in their life that they would like to remember, whether it's the confirmation of their children, their marriage to their partner, celebrating their father's birthday, a work party or any other celebration. These events can be remembered through photographs, but even better are videos. Nowadays, almost all small devices can record. These recordings are of course satisfactory, but for events such as weddings or something similar, it is better to have a recording team that is professionally involved. <p/> Recording weddings usually takes place from the morning until late in the evening. Usually two cameramen are present at the wedding to record the event from several angles. Filming starts in the morning, with the two cameramen recording the preparations of the bride and groom, the various customs, the wedding in the church and registry office, the entertainment, the dancing and everything else that goes along with it. Filming weddings is not an easy task, the cameramen try to capture as many events as possible while remaining inconspicuous. It's definitely worth every penny, there's a lot of post-production work to be done by the film crew, and you get a finished product and a shot of an event that you'll be able to relive for the rest of your life. <p/> I've only described one example of filming a formal event, a wedding, but as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, anything can be filmed. Although semi-professional equipment is readily available to everyone, it is really the experience that counts. If you want quality footage, hire a professional. Check out their websites and decide on someone based on what you see, if you make the right choice you will not regret it and you will share the footage with all your family and friends.

881	"Former President Donald Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference held at the Hyatt Regency on 28 February 2021 in Orlando, Florida. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) <p/>His comments were published on Friday on a new online platform he has set up to communicate with his followers. He also branded the 2020 presidential election ""fake"" while passing by both countries. <p/> Writing ""From Donald J. Trump's desk"", he said: ""At 6:31 a.m. on 4 November, 149,772 votes came in in the state of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the state miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate already begun its review of the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, or will they begin soon? If not, they would be out of office. Also, at 3.42 a.m., the state of Wisconsin received a dump of 143 379 votes, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these 'votes' come from? They were both going to national elections, and that is on top of other corruption, without even including the fact that neither state has received the legislative approval required by the US Constitution. ""<p/>Trump's comments came as the Justice Department expressed concerns about ballot security and potential voter intimidation stemming from a private Republican Senate recount in Arizona if the 2020 presidential election comes to Maricopa County. <p/>The Associated Press reported that in a letter to GOP Senate President Karen Fann, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division said the Senate, which is from 2.1 million ballots from the state's most populous district to the contractor, could violate a federal law that requires ballots. to remain under the supervision of election officials for 22 months. <p/>And Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela Karlan said the Senate contractor's plans to contact voters directly could constitute illegal voter intimidation. <p/>The Justice Department's letter came six days after voting rights groups urged federal officials to intervene or send observers to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix at the State Fairgrounds, where ballots are counted. <p/> Trump used his new online platform after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other social networks following the attack on the Capitol building on 6 January. <p/> Twitter said Trump was permanently banned from tweeting after the platform said his tweets after the action appeared to support those who engaged in violence that day. <p/> Trump's new page does not currently allow people to comment on his posts."

906	Honda's high-flying five-year plan <p/> Forecast. Honda has announced that it plans to double car production over the next five years, with a large number of new models expected to come to market, including in segments where it is currently absent. <p/>Honda's CEO Takanobu Ito said a few days ago that Honda plans to increase production to six million vehicles a year over the next five years from the current 3.1 million, with a number of new models planned, including in segments where it has not been present so far. <p/> Honda is therefore expecting a lot from the all-new generation of the Jazz, as well as from its smaller brother, the Brio, which will be aimed primarily at developing markets and will be a cheaper version of the aforementioned Jazz. To boost production, Honda plans to build new plants, one of which will be opened in Mexico by 2014, and will also focus on the Chinese market, where it plans to launch a maximum of 10 new models. <p/> The fate of the Accord in the European markets is still unknown, as Honda is not confident about the sales and profitability of the model in the old continent (photo: Honda) <p/> Much fewer new models in Europe <p/> While it is not yet known which of the new models will also enter the markets of the old continent, among the models announced are, in addition to the aforementioned brio and jazz, a smaller suv based on the latter, as well as a smaller sedan, which will be a replacement for the current Honda city. <p/> A sporty civica rally car has also been announced, which will, as usual, be given the Type-R nameplate, but enthusiasts will still have to wait until 2015 to get their hands on it. Much more numerous in terms of sales, however, will surely be the announcement of the new generation Accord, whose production for European markets is still in question for the time being, since the Accord has been a loss-making car in most European markets over the last few years, thanks to the strong yen. The same (unknown) fate in the European markets for the time being also awaits the A0 segment model, which will be called N-ONE in the Japanese markets. Among the models announced, we must not forget the NSX sports coupé, as well as the new sports roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study. <p/> For the US markets, the acura RLX is also confirmed for the Los Angeles show in November, and is expected to arrive in Europe later in the form of the honda legend. For 2015, Honda has also announced a production version of the fuel cell model for European markets, not the FCX Clarity, but an all-new and significantly cheaper model. <p/> The Honda NSX is due to arrive in showrooms very soon, and we can also expect a new sporty roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study, as well as a redesigned CR-Z hybrid coupé (photo: Honda). <p/> So, according to the announcements, the future of Honda on European soil in particular is still rather unclear, and not necessarily as rosy as it has been for quite a few years now.

923	"The EPAR (European Public Assessment Report) lists VAED as an important potential risk to be monitored and reported. Neither is implemented in Slovenia, because doctors were not informed about it during the training sessions (and afterwards). <p/> VAED (Vaccine associated enhancement of disease) has been a major obstacle in the development of SARS and MERS coronavirus vaccines, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and some other vaccines against infectious agents. <p/> It is an immunological phenomenon, mediated by antibodies or immune cells, which causes a vaccinated person to become ill, often more severely than an unvaccinated person, after coming into contact with a wild virus. <p/> This phenomenon has caused illness and death in laboratory animals in the past. In the late 1970s, the RSV vaccine caused severe illness and even death in vaccinated children. <p/> This immunological phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated by Pfizer-BioNTech because: <p/> a) it did not use the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in preclinical animal studies, but a surrogate virus - with the explanation that it does not have BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3) (EPAR, page 43). The EMA-e reviewer wrote in his report that the use of a surrogate instead of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (in vaccine research) was not even discussed (!!!!). Also, for technical reasons (!!!), the manufacturer did not specify the ratio of neutralising to non-neutralising antibodies - which was also recommended in March 2020 by scientists gathered under the auspices of CEPI, explaining that it is an important 'indicator' of the possibility of VAED in vaccinated people. <p/> b) Phase 2/3 clinical testing was mainly conducted at a time when there was little or no presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the natural environment (the registration study for the provisional authorisation included data from May to the first half of October 2020); therefore, the majority of vaccinated people could not have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, which would have been the only way to test for the possibility of developing VAED in them. The problem of testing the vaccine in the absence of the virus in the natural environment has also been pointed out by scientists in the summer of 2020 <p/> c) From a professional and scientific point of view, given the known problems of the history of coronavirus vaccines, it is therefore only appropriate to include in the registration study (on the basis of which the vaccine received provisional marketing authorisation) data also from the period of increased presence of the virus in the natural environment, i.e. late autumn and winter 2020/2021, when coronavirus infections started to occur again and vaccinees had the opportunity to come into contact with authentic (wild) SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, as noted above, the registration study did not capture this data, but mass vaccination of populations around the world had already begun during the period of re-emergence of the virus. <p/> The EPAR lists VAED as a significant potential risk (page 115). It is stated that the possible occurrence of this complication will continue to be monitored even after the provisional marketing authorisation has been granted. <p/> The Pharmacovigilance (Product Side Effects) Plan states that side effects of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTecha Comirnaty will be tracked through a specific questionnaire, which will also include verification of vaccine ineffectiveness or the occurrence of VAED (page 116). In the section on additional pharmacovigilance activities (page 118, table, study C4591001), it is stated that the occurrence of an imbalance between the vaccinated and the control (unvaccinated) group in the number of cases, especially for the more severe form of the disease, kovid 19, could suggest VAED. The possibility of VAED should be monitored for 2 years after the second dose of vaccine, the EPAR states. <p/>The fact that this is an important immunological phenomenon that may have a detrimental effect on the health of vaccinees is also evident from the peer-reviewed literature. <p/> In March 2020, a group of experts in the field of vaccine and coronavirus immunology gathered under the auspices of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation), also funded by capital and philanthropy, to examine the situation and the opportunities and obstacles to the development of a safe vaccine for coronavirus 19 disease. The problem in developing a vaccine against the 19 metalloid disease was highlighted as the possibility of VAED, in which the vaccine causes a more severe form of the disease if the vaccinated person subsequently becomes infected with a wild virus. They wrote that VAED was first observed in the 1960s in association with an inactivated RSV vaccine. Participants at the meeting recalled a case where the RSV vaccine did not prevent infection and 80% of vaccinated children became so severely ill after contact with wild virus that they required hospital treatment; 2 out of 35 children even died. <p/>It was noted that similar pathology has been described in SARS CoV-1 vaccine candidates (the causative agent of the 2002/2003 SARS pandemic) and that there is concern that similar pathology (particularly in terms of Th2 immunopathology) could occur in humans vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of kovid-19 disease). The possibility of ADE (antibody disease enhancement), another immunological mechanism directly induced by non-neutralising or sub-neutralising antibodies that allow a more efficient entry of the virus into the cells, has also been raised. <p/>They wrote that their findings should guide vaccine manufacturers in the development and testing of vaccine candidates, with the intention of avoiding the risks to humans from the use of vaccines against Covid-19. They also provided very specific guidance on the proper conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and validation of the development of VAEDs. <p/> In April 2020, scientists also discussed and warned in peer-reviewed journals about the possible occurrence of VAED after the use of the vaccine against the disease Kovid-19. They discussed the possibility of disease promotion by both humoral (antibodies - ADE) and cell-mediated (Th2 immunopathology) immunity mechanisms. Prof. Baric, an epidemiologist and expert on coronavirus, thought at the time that Th2 immunopathology would be a bigger problem, as animal models had shown that it was mainly older animals that were at risk; he expressed concern about what this might mean if the vaccine were used in older humans. <p/>We now know that the polio vaccine was first used in the elderly population; and the manufacturer's EPAR shows that the registration study included only 5 people aged 85+ among just over 18,000 vaccinees, and 804 people aged 75+, representing 4.4% of the total vaccinated (page 76, table). Some other scientists were also of the opinion that ADE pathology should not be a major problem and that the reports from China concerning re-infected people were also not suggestive of an ADE problem. <p/> Dr Graham, Executive Director of the Vaccine Development Centre at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), also mentioned the possibility of Th2 immunopathology in particular, and was supported by Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who has worked, among other things, on the development of a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine. Dr Graham expressed concern about Th2 immunopathology, stating that an inappropriate T cell response would stimulate allergy-mediated inflammation and lead to the generation of poorly functional antibodies with consequent formation of immune complexes, leading to complement activation and the damage that could result. <p/> Dr Hotez pointed to the possibility of producing a vaccine on only part of the viral S-protein, i.e. the part that binds to the cellular receptor binding domain (RBD), which could possibly reduce the adverse immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech EPAR shows that the manufacturer also tested the vaccine candidate for the RBD component of the S-protein, which was later abandoned (page 58). Dr Graham, who worked with Moderna on vaccine development, said in April 2020: 'We need to get some answers by next winter to at least be better prepared for the winter of 2021-2022'. Well, the 'vaccine', including Moderna's, had already started to be used en masse 1 year earlier, much earlier than Dr Graham expected to 'get some answers'. <p/> Prof Perlman, an immunologist and microbiologist, said that a special commission had been set up at the WHO to look into the VAED issue. He expected that the commission would be able to report in a few months' time. In April 2020, the WHO and other health experts also stressed that it would take at least a year and a half before the vaccine would be thoroughly tested in both animal models and humans, and only then might it be put into wider, commercial use. In reality, things have been accelerated; within a year of his statement, some 3 billion people have been vaccinated with a poorly tested product called 'vaccine'. <p/> Despite the EMA's warning that VAED is listed as a significant potential risk and that it should be monitored and reported in terms of post-vaccination contracting of the symptoms of metal 19, we doctors were not informed of this during the training sessions on metal 19 vaccines held from December 2020 onwards, we did not receive any (subsequent) notification of this, nor is there a form to report this immunological phenomenon which, as past experience shows, can harm or even endanger the health of those vaccinated. <p/> In April 2020, doctors received an e-mail with an article by Prof Tomažič entitled ""Covid 19: what every doctor should know"". In the article, which is now published on the NIJZ website, on page 7, Prof. Ihan states: ""It is not yet clear what role antibodies play in protecting against the disease. In a few studies, patients with higher antibody production had worse outcomes - this could indicate the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). A similar phenomenon has been described in MERS, where neutralising antibodies (directed against the viral receptor) promoted viral entry into cells. Until we know the mechanisms of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development will be more speculation than science."" <p/> The problem of VAED is therefore also known to vaccine experts in Slovenia. However, it was not brought to our attention during the training sessions on metalloid vaccines, nor were we presented with the problems of the development of past coronavirus vaccines. We have been wondering why this is so for some time. Why VAED is not recorded in Slovenia is also not clear to us. This is, however, prescribed in the EPAR issued by the EMA. Despite the ISZ's appeal to the JAZMP and the NIJZ, nothing has changed in the recording of this phenomenon. <p/> The way in which VAED is checked in the manufacturer's registration study is very unprofessional. Why? Was the manufacturer 'afraid' of a setback in the development of the vaccine, as we have seen with the other two coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS? Why did the EMA agree to the manufacturer using a surrogate virus (VSV - Vesicular Stomatitis Virus with 'embedded information' for the S-protein; EPAR, page 43) in testing the vaccine's efficacy and safety? How is it possible that someone can produce billions of vaccines against a pandemic virus without using it in pre-clinical studies on the action and side-effects of a 'vaccine' against the virus that causes this pandemic? And on the banal excuse that it does not have BSL3? And how is it possible that the regulator (EMA) finds this acceptable? And that, as the EMA rapporteur states, the use of a replacement virus was not even discussed? And how is it possible that this is acceptable to (even our) vaccination experts, some of whom are also doctors? <p/> Vaccine research with a surrogate virus could be at least as dangerous and irresponsible as a car manufacturer testing the brakes with a machine that measures, for example, the optics of bicycles. Both brakes and optics have a common denominator, the car wheel, but we know very well who is responsible for braking. SARS-CoV-2 and vesicular stomatitis virus also have a common denominator, i.e. they are both viruses, and we know very well which of them is responsible for metalloid-19. <p/> We know from domestic and foreign practice that people become ill with signs of caries after vaccination. It started last winter with vaccinees falling ill in DSOs across Europe. After initial denial of this phenomenon, explanations started to emerge later that the elderly had fallen ill because they had been vaccinated at a stage when they were already infected but not yet symptomatic (asymptomatic); that the vaccine takes time to protect the vaccinee; that the vaccine is not 100% effective. We have listened to claims that the vaccine is made in such a way that it cannot cause cystitis because it does not contain the virus. The latter is true, but what has not been said is that the disease can be caused by an immunological mechanism that can be triggered after the vaccinee comes into contact with a wild virus. VAED could also be triggered in vaccinated elderly by subsequent infection with common coronavirus, explained renowned immunologist and microbiologist Prof. Bhakdi. In the spring, when younger people started getting sick after vaccination, the British (alpha) version of the virus joined the list of culprits. We now see that, despite its presence in up to 90% of the samples analysed, the disease is on the decline. <p/> Recently, we have heard that the delta variant is spreading from India to us; and in some places, the idea that unvaccinated people are to blame for the rise in infections is already germinating. However, the official EPAR states that if there is an increase in the number of cases after vaccination, this could indicate the development of VAED or possibly an ineffective vaccine. Is this even being investigated? <p/>We are hearing explanations that people will fall ill with Chlamydia in the autumn and that 'everyone who is admitted to hospital will be because they have not been vaccinated'. What about VAED in the vaccinated, ladies and gentlemen professors? Have you forgotten about it? You have written about this immunological phenomenon, it has been written about and pointed out by many who work on vaccine development, it is written about by the EMA in its EPAR. <p/> The EMA states that side effects, including VAED, should be monitored and recorded. So why is VAED not monitored and recorded in Slovenia? Why does the NIJZ not have data on how many people who were vaccinated against VAE 19 subsequently contracted VAE? Why is it not possible to see what proportion of hospitalised patients who have contracted kovid-19 are vaccinated? All this would give us important information on possible vaccine-induced disease acceleration that needs to be reported further to the EMA regulator. After all, this is about the safety of our people, our patients! <p/> Why is there silence about VAED? Will the post-vaccination metalloid symptoms be attributed to the new delta variant, which is announced to become widespread in our country in August? Will the silent increase in the number of vaccinees falling ill due to VAED possibly justify closing schools or locking people in their homes next autumn and winter? <p/>What will happen to people who were vaccinated in the spring, who are vaccinated now or who will be vaccinated in the autumn? What will happen after they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses in autumn/winter? Given the known immunological phenomenon, it is to be expected that those vaccinated in autumn/winter could contract a coronavirus. Did this already happen last winter, first after the vaccination of the elderly? Will the delta variant be to blame this winter? Will it be epsilon or some other variant that is on the WHO 'watch list'? <p/>Professor Ihan, you have stated in the Delo that if there is more disease among those who have been vaccinated, an additional, third dose of vaccine will be needed. What about VAED, Professor? Was it mentioned (antibody variant) in the April 2020 article? And also the EMA in the EPAR says that increased morbidity in vaccinees could mean that it is VAED, so characteristic of all failed coronavirus vaccines to date. We suggest that we should be vigilant and make a professional and scientific evaluation of the possible occurrence of VAED in vaccinees. Dear Professors Ihan, Beović, Tomažić, Jerala and Štrukelj: with your approach and interpretations, the epidemic will not end; this autumn and winter, for example, there will be a delta strain, and in the future, perhaps some other strain? For how long? Until we inoculate 7 billion people, as we have been hearing the plans since the summer of 2020 (2:20 min)? <p/> Ladies and gentlemen, professors: is this science? Is this medicine with its principle: above all, do no harm? You are telling us that health and life are paramount. You assure us that all measures are solely for the good of the people. So let us collect data on VAED! We all want to offer people a safe vaccine. <p/> Reportedly, vaccine manufacturers have been given permission to disclose data (unblinded) and offer vaccination (crossover) to the unvaccinated in a registration study after six months. There is therefore a strong possibility that at the expected end of the Phase 3 clinical trial in May 2023, there will not be enough people left in the control group (unvaccinated) to make an objective comparison between the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in terms of side effects and therefore VAED. Will we then have an explanation in 2023 that, because of the lack of a control group, the results are only valid for a period of 6 months after the last dose of vaccine? Also, given the high possibility of the control group 'disappearing', it is all the more important that VAED is monitored and recorded now that mass vaccination of the population is taking place. <p/> How are we going to monitor and report on the development of VAED after vaccination in Slovenia, in accordance with the EMA-e guidance, if you have not informed the medical staff or the people who have been vaccinated about the possibility of VAED? You have not even given them informed consent to sign, informing them that there is a possibility that they may fall ill despite vaccination, and possibly even more seriously than those who have not been vaccinated - because this is a phenomenon that has been known about for a long time, and which was discussed by experts at the beginning of the development of coronavirus vaccines. <p/> We all know that monitoring even the smallest side-effects that could be temporally or causally related to vaccination is very important, including VAED. <p/> All the more so when we recall that the manufacturer drew its conclusions on the safety and efficacy of the product based on a mere 170 metalloid cases (0.47%) among the reported 36423 clinical study participants (EPAR, page 89, table). In fact, 0.884% (162/18325) of the unvaccinated group and 0.044% (8/18198) of the vaccinated group became ill. The difference between the incidence of the unvaccinated and vaccinated, expressed in absolute risk, was only 0.84%. 1 person among the vaccinated and 3 among the unvaccinated developed severe form of pertussis; far too small a difference to draw any meaningful conclusions. And some persons were observed for as long as 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (EPAR, page 90, Table 13). This is also why we need to improve reporting systems, follow the EMA-e guidance and inform healthcare workers, DSO caregivers and vaccinees about VAED. <p/>We are doctors. We are not interested in politics, not in pharmaceutical interests. Our record and opinion is not an opinion against, but an opinion and a vote for; for the safety of our people and for the safe medicines they should receive. The product is called a vaccine, but it is a gene therapy. The safety of our patients and our population is important; and for this we doctors are largely responsible. Caution on the one hand and scepticism on the other, and, above all, the mutual exchange of information and open communication, have always been the cornerstones of progress and improvement in the history of science and medicine, for the benefit of people and patients. And that is what we want to see in this situation. <p/> Related Posts <p/> Medicine has clearly been hijacked, subjugated and abused by politics and ""mega"" capital over the last 16 months. Under the pretext of public health, public health, public education, small and medium-sized businesses, culture, sport ... are being destroyed by disproportionate measures.

We would also like to thank Sasha Kumer, Secretary General of the SDPZ, who also supported the taxi drivers' union at the meeting and gave the SDPZ's position. We would also like to thank the SAB, the Left Party, the LMŠ and the SD for their support. <p/> Despite the efforts of the union to raise the issue of changing the law in favour of Uber, unfortunately most of the cons did not want to hear it, they are all just making excuses, saying memorised sentences and avoiding real answers. <p/> With the efforts of taxi drivers and the help of the state, the quality of taxi services has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Taxi meters have been made compulsory (annually certified and calibrated), a licence is required, a tourist examination, no criminal record, adequate financial standing - fixed assets, a roadworthiness test twice a year, special insurance for passengers, the introduction of cash registers, etc. <p/> With the current law, the State strongly regulates the taxi business and makes fraud impossible. However, by changing the law, the taxi business will be set back 30 years, so years of effort will be wiped out in a matter of months. Why? Simply because Uber has a different business model and cannot operate under our laws. <p/> The current government is silent on the fact that Uber will not pay a cent in tax on their profits. The current government is silent on the known facts of the problem of Uber drivers appearing abroad. The current government is silent on the fact that wherever Uber is present, there are major problems, read - robberies, rapes, beatings and even murders. The current government is silent on how it will protect consumers and the potential disputes and problems that will arise with the arrival of Uber, how and in what way the government will protect consumers and who consumers can turn to in order to resolve them. The current government is silent on the fact that a ride that today a consumer pays €5 for on the taximeter when Uber arrives will, according to their algorithms, also be €20 or more if demand is high at that moment. The current government is silent that the change in legislation does not do any good, not for the country, not for the taxi drivers, and least of all for the consumers. <p/> Despite the fact that we did not win the session and the change in the law was approved in the session, we will not stop, we will work for all taxi drivers and residents and their better future. We are concerned about the future and the safety of our citizens, that is why we are NOT against ""competition"", but we are against changing the law. <p/> Unlike the current government, we in the union are happy to see the cooperation and listening of local authorities. We are happy about the warm and positive reception at the MOL, we are happy that in the future in Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Mayor Mr Jankovič, we will bring the taxi business to the highest possible level, both with vehicles, drivers and prices that will be accessible to any user, regardless of the arrival of foreign platforms."

From the client's point of view, empty space seems like a waste of money: ""If I paid for it, shouldn't I use it?"" But from the designer's point of view, it plays a key role in good design. For the viewer, it is also very important, as the white space creates a frame and allows the eye to take in all the elements of the design. There is also the question of how profitable this empty space is. If you just think of the adverts for, for example, Apple. Their adverts usually consist of 2-4 elements simply arranged on a page, allowing the right message to come to the fore.

957	Case-law: Admissibility of a revision 05.10.2015 According to settled case-law, if the claimant does not state the value of the object at issue for each individual claim, but only states the total value, this is not sufficient for the admissibility of a revision. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the claims that the defendants were obliged to enter into a contract of sale with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which they would sell the property to them and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the defendants the unpaid part of the purchase price. The applicants also claimed that the defendants were obliged to deliver possession of the property to them and to pay them a monthly fee until delivery. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal. The applicants lodged an appeal against the final judgment, raising all the grounds of appeal and seeking an amendment of the judgment under appeal to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> The review was not allowed. The applicants brought three claims against the three defendants. The claims for the conclusion of a contract of sale and for the delivery of immovable property are non-monetary claims for which the right to review depends on the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Notwithstanding Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (CPL), the value of the contested part of a final judgment is to be determined by adding together the values of the individual claims or parts of those claims which are still in dispute, where the decision on the review depends on the resolution of legal issues common to all those claims or where the individual claims are so interrelated that the decision on one claim depends on the decision on another claim (Article 367(5) CPL). However, in the case of the first two claims (for the conclusion of the contract of sale and for the delivery of the immovable property), there is not only an objective cumulation, but also a subjective one. There are three defendants. <p/> Where a claim is brought against several defendants, it is incumbent on the plaintiff, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, to state the value of the object of the dispute for each defendant individually and not for all the defendants jointly. If the plaintiff fails to do so and in such a case states only one value of the subject-matter in dispute for all defendants together, this is a so-called undifferentiated value of the subject-matter in dispute. <p/> The defendants are not united co-defendants, since they are not in such a substantive community that only the same decision for all three would be possible. Since they are co-owners and can dispose of their co-ownership interest in the immovable property independently, the defendants are ordinary co-defendants within the meaning of Article 191(1)(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and the aggregation of values under Article 41(1) in conjunction with Article 367(5) of the Civil Procedure Code is therefore not applicable in such a case. <p/> Moreover, the claimants are also ordinary co-claimants, since they claim the conclusion of the contract and delivery of possession each for themselves in accordance with their share of the joint ownership. In view of the co-partnership relationship on both sides, the Supreme Court found that there were six claims, each of which could share a separate legal fate. The admissibility of the revision would therefore be judged on the value of each individual claim. <p/> However, since the applicants did not indicate the value of the subject-matter at issue for each individual claim, but only one, aggregate value (EUR 135,000) was indicated, this is an undifferentiated indication of the value of the subject-matter at issue, which, according to settled case-law, is not sufficient for the admissibility of the revision. It is not possible to determine to which of the claimants and to which of the defendants the total value of the disputed object referred to in the application relates, so that the situation is the same as if the value of the disputed object had not been mentioned at all, which means that the revision is not admissible. Since the value of the pecuniary claim also did not exceed the threshold of EUR 40 000, the review is not admissible in that respect either. In accordance with Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Review dismissed the unauthorised revision.	Legal/Regulation	Legal/Regulation

Which direction will the two companies go in the future? <p/> Last year's announcement of IBM's takeover of Red Hat raised many eyebrows and many people started to wonder with scepticism what would happen to Red Hat. The deal is now closed and it is now time to answer the questions on a practical level and not just in principle. <p/> So - IBM is looking to Red Hat to help it increase its annual turnover over the next five years, mainly, of course, from hybrid cloud. But does this mean that Red Hat's technology will leave the open source waters? No. The open source approach remains. And not only that, Paul Cormier, one of the company's CEOs, told ZDnet that ""the development journey on steroids is now beginning"". <p/> And what else will be new/old? More at the link below, just briefly here: <p/> Red Hat will maintain open source development and independence within IBM, <p/> Red Hat will be a separate entity within IBM, and organisationally will be part of the Cloud and Cognitive Software division, <p/> Red Hat employees can contribute and participate in open source projects outside Red Hat, as they do today, <p/> The Red Hat Developer programme - including the website, blog and social media channels - will remain independent, and Developer participants ""will continue to enjoy free access to Red Hat services, software downloads, ebooks, events and other content"". <p/> IBM and Red Hat will run separate partner programmes and cultivate separate partner ecosystems, <p/> It all sounds pretty mind-boggling, especially the part about keeping Red Hat independent.

Good quality safety glasses protect your eyes from mechanical and chemical damage, so you should go for nothing but the best when choosing safety glasses (similarly for hearing and head protection). Wondering where to buy the best quality safety glasses? The answer is Trgos in Lesce. We specialise in importing and selling top quality workwear, hearing protection and eye and head protection (hard hats and more). <p/> Safety glasses available in different designs <p/> Before choosing the right safety glasses, you should think carefully about the features you expect. Is it important that the goggles are equipped with solar filters? Are you looking for safety glasses with lenses that do not dew? Perhaps you need chlorofibre safety glasses? Do you wear corrective glasses and are interested in safety glasses that can be worn over traditional glasses? Do the glasses also need to have side protection? We have a range of safety glasses suitable for different circumstances, so finding the ideal glasses to protect your vision while you work won't be difficult. Of course, we can help you choose the really best safety glasses for your specific circumstances, but we're also the right place to go if you're interested in hearing protection at work. <p/> Optimum hearing and head protection <p/> In many jobs, hearing protection and head protection with the help of a safety helmet is also very important. Hearing protection can sometimes be provided with good quality earplugs, but there are also circumstances where full hearing protection requires the use of mufflers. Whatever kind of hearing protection you are interested in, you will find the ideal ear or hearing protection here. Probably even more important than hearing and eye protection are safety helmets. Among other things, we offer a safety helmet with a visor made of golden, dark glass. A visor helmet provides complete protection for the entire head. Thus, a visor helmet is an accessory that protects you from many dangers and is therefore definitely worth buying.	Promotion	Promotion
