913	"It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation . Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . Everything had gone so well till now ! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . Had the hour of adversity come ? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . Poor fellow ! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions . He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising . Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind . On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable . Passepartout cleared up with the weather . Some of the sails were unfurled , and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed . The time lost could not , however , be regained . Land was not signalled until five o ' clock on the morning of the 6th ; the steamer was due on the 5th . Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the Yokohama steamer would , of course , be missed . The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong . Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . He had confided his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal ! -- tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put Passepartout in a passion . Mr. Fogg , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama . "" At high tide to-morrow morning , "" answered the pilot . "" Ah ! "" said Mr. Fogg , without betraying any astonishment . Passepartout , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck . "" What is the steamer's name ? "" asked Mr. Fogg . "" The Carnatic . "" "" Ought she not to have gone yesterday ? "" "" Yes , sir ; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow . "" "" Thank you , "" returned Mr. Fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon . Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , "" Pilot , you are the best of good fellows ! "" The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong . At one o ' clock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore . Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . Mr. Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical

1216	"Fisherman's Friends deaths : Door company fined £ 30 , 000 A company has been fined £ 30 , 000 following the deaths of a shanty group singer and the band's promoter after a two-tonne steel door fell on them . The stage door collapsed on Fisherman's Friends vocalist Trevor Grills and Paul McMullen at Guildford's G Live venue in 2013 . Shropshire-based Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd was found guilty of a health and safety breach at Guildford Crown Court . Director David Naylor , 57 , was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence . The door , which allowed backstage access from outside , was designed and manufactured by the company . Father-of-three Mr Grills , 54 , from Port Isaac , Cornwall , and Mr McMullen , from Disley in Cheshire , were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group . Mr McMullen , 44 , died at the scene and Mr Grills in hospital three days later . Sentencing , judge Philippa Whipple , said there was no "" deliberate disregard for the law "" but the company "" fell far short of the appropriate health and safety standard "" . The court heard the door had been folded in half and was being lifted "" like a canopy "" above the men when it collapsed . Two drive chains linking the motor and gearbox to the drive shaft failed , and the chains themselves also failed , jurors were told . The court heard there had been four similar failures involving the company's doors before 2010 , including the collapse of a hangar door at Shoreham Airport in 2003 . The judge said : "" The company made some modifications , but it failed to respond more fundamentally to ensure it had taken all practicable measures . "" There was an obvious risk of death or serious injury although the likelihood was not high . "" The court heard the business barely traded in 2015 and was essentially liquidated . Paying tribute to the men and their families , the judge said : "" They died too young and I am sure they are greatly missed . "" Fisherman's Friends had chart success with a top-ten album and performed at Glastonbury ."	News	News

1549	When sitting down with your solicitor for the first time talking about your claim take into account what they are saying and make sure you fully understand what they mean , they eventually should ask you if you have any questions and it is extremely important not to say ' no ' . These are several questions that definitely need to be asked to help you fully understand your claim : What 's the deal with any passengers ? Passengers are not liable to pay out any damages as they are not personally driving the car and can not be at fault . However they can claim against people who have hit them whilst in a car even if they are just the passenger . The compensation for the passenger may be decreased due to several factors , the compensation will definitely be decreased if they are found not to be wearing a seatbelt when the accident took place , another reason as to why a passengers claim maybe reduced is the knowledge that the driver was in fact intoxicated by substance if this is known by the passenger then subsequently money will be taken off . A lot of accidents can now be assessed for free and some solicitors offer a no win no fee basis , so no matter how small an accident , if you were hurt in any way it is important to looking into car accident claims .

1636	"The Phanerozoic Eon , also known as the eon of visible life , is divided into three major eras of time largely based on fossils of different groups of life-forms found within them : the Paleozoic ( 542 million to 251 million years ago ) , Mesozoic ( 251 million to 65.5 million years ago ) , and Cenozoic ( 65 . 5 million years ago to the present ) eras . The three eras can be divided into a collection of 12 different periods . During each period , Earth's continents made steady progress toward their present configuration through such processes as continental drift , mountain building , and continental glaciation . Although the Phanerozoic Eon represents only about the last one-eighth of time since the Earth's crust formed , its importance far exceeds its relatively short duration , because the eon is characterized by the rapid evolution of life , sometimes through cataclysmic mass extinction events , and other challenges . The descendants of these early life-forms are the plants , animals , and other life that abide on Earth today . Cambrian Period : 541 million to 485.4 million years ago Adapted from C.R. Scotese , The University of Texas at Arlington The Cambrian differed greatly from modern times , but it was also quite different from the preceding Proterozoic Eon ( 2 . 5 billion to 541 million years ago ) in terms of climate , geography , and life . Average global temperatures during much of the Neoproterozoic Era ( 1 billion to 541 million years ago ) were slightly cooler ( at around 12 ° C ) than today's average global temperature ( around 14 ° C ) However , the global average temperature of Cambrian times were warmer , averaging 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) . Just prior to the beginning of the Neoproterozoic , Earth experienced a period of continental suturing that organized all of the major landmasses into the huge supercontinent of Rodinia . Rodinia was fully assembled by one billion years ago and rivaled Pangea ( a supercontinent that formed later during the Permian Period ) in size . Before the beginning of the Cambrian , Rodinia split in half , resulting in the creation of the Pacific Ocean west of what would become North America . By the middle and later parts of the Cambrian , rifting had sent the paleocontinents of Laurentia ( made up of present-day North America and Greenland ) , Baltica ( made up of present-day Western Europe and Scandinavia ) , and Siberia on their separate ways . In addition , a supercontinent called Gondwana formed , which was made up of what would become Australia , Antarctica , India , Africa , and South America . Before the Cambrian began , sea levels rose and some continents flooded . This flooding , combined with the warm Cambrian temperatures and changes in Earth's geography , led to increased rates of erosion that altered ocean chemistry . The most notable result was an increase in the oxygen content of seawater , which helped set the stage for the rise and later diversification of life – an event that has come to be known as the "" Cambrian explosion , "" in which early representatives of many of the major groups that make up modern animal life appeared . By the Early Cambrian the bulk of the biosphere was confined to the margins of the world's oceans ; no life was found on land ( except possibly cyanobacteria in moist sediment ) , relatively few open sea species existed , and no organisms inhabited the ocean depths . Life in the shallow regions of the seafloor , however , was already well diversified , and this early aquatic ecosystem included the relatively large carnivore Anomalocaris , trilobites , mollusks , sponges , and scavenger arthropods . Ordovician Period : 485.4 million to 443.4 million years ago Source : International Commission on Stratigraphy ( ICS ) The Ordovician Period was a time of significant changes in plate tectonics , climate , and in Earth's ecosystems . Rapid seafloor spreading at oceanic ridges produced some of the highest global sea levels in the Phanerozoic Eon ( which started at the beginning of the Cambrian ) . As a result , continents were flooded to an unprecedented level , with the continent that would become North America almost entirely underwater at times . These seas deposited widespread blankets of sediment that preserved treasure troves of fossil remains of marine animals . Scientists estimate that levels of carbon dioxide were several times higher than today , which would have created warm climates from the Equator to the poles ; however , extensive glaciers appeared for a brief time over much of the Southern Hemisphere at the end of the period . The Ordovician Period was also known for an intense diversification ( an increase in the number of species ) of marine animal life during an event which has been called the "" Ordovician radiation . "" This event resulted in the evolution of almost every modern phylum ( group of organisms having the same body plan ) of marine invertebrate by the end of the period , as well as the rise of fish . Ordovician seas were filled with a diverse group of invertebrates , which were dominated by brachiopods ( lamp shells ) , bryozoans ( moss animals ) , trilobites , mollusks , echinoderms ( a group of spiny-skinned marine invertebrates ) , and graptolites ( small , colonial , planktonic animals ) . On land the first plants appeared , as well as possibly the first invasion of terrestrial arthropods . The second largest mass extinction event in Earth's history took place at the end of the period , claiming roughly 85 percent of all Ordovician species . Some scientists argue that an ice age , which occurred at the end of the period , contributed to the decimation of species . Silurian Period : 443.4 million to 419.2 million years ago From E. Winson in W.S. McKerrow ( ed . ) , The Ecology of Fossils , Gerald Duckworth & Company Ltd During the Silurian , continental elevations were generally much lower than in the present day , and global sea level was much higher . Sea level rose dramatically as the extensive glaciers from the Late Ordovician ice age melted . This rising prompted changes in climatic conditions that allowed many faunal groups to recover from the extinctions of Late Ordovician times . Large expanses of several continents became flooded with shallow seas , and mound-type coral reefs were very common . Fishes were widespread . Vascular plants began to colonize coastal lowlands during the Silurian Period , whereas continental interiors remained essentially barren of life . Reef mounds ( bioherms ) on the Silurian seafloor contained brachiopods , gastropods ( class of mollusk containing present-day snails and slugs ) , crinoids ( class of echinoderm containing present-day sea lilies and feather stars ) , and trilobites . A wide variety of agnatha ( jawless ) fishes appeared , as did fishes with a primitive jaws . Different endemic groups developed in Laurentia ( known widely from sites in the Canadian Arctic , the Yukon , Pennsylvania , New York , and especially Scotland ) , Baltica ( especially Norway and Estonia ) , and Siberia ( including adjacent Mongolia ) . Devonian Period : 419.2 million to about 359 million years ago Adapted from : C.R. Scotese , The University of Texas at Arlington The Devonian Period is sometimes called the "" Age of Fishes "" because of the diverse , abundant , and , in some cases , bizarre types of these creatures that swam Devonian seas . Forests and the coiled shell-bearing marine organisms known as ammonites first appeared early in the Devonian . Late in the period the first four-legged amphibians appeared , indicating the colonization of land by vertebrates . During most of the Devonian Period , North America , Greenland , and Europe were united into a single Northern Hemisphere landmass , a minor supercontinent called Laurussia or Euramerica , but an ocean covered approximately 85 percent of the Devonian globe . There is limited evidence of ice caps , and the climate is thought to have been warm and equitable . The oceans experienced episodes of reduced dissolved oxygen levels , which likely caused the extinction of many species – some 70 to 80 percent of all animal species present – especially marine animals . These extinctions were followed by periods of species diversification , as the descendants of surviving organisms filled in abandoned habitats . Carboniferous Period : 358.9 million to about 298.9 million years ago Source : International Commission on Stratigraphy ( ICS ) The Carboniferous Period is divided into two major subdivisions – the Mississippian ( 358 . 9 to 323.2 million years ago ) and the Pennsylvanian ( 323 . 2 to 298.9 million years ago ) subperiods . The Early Carboniferous ( Mississippian ) world is characterized by Laurussia – a series of small landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere was made up of present-day North America , western Europe through the Urals , and Balto-Scandinavia – and Gondwana – an enormous landmass made up of present-day South America , Africa , Antarctica , Australia , and the Indian subcontinent in the Southern Hemisphere . During this time , the Tethys Sea separated the southern margin of Larussia completely from Gondwana . By Late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) times , however , most of Laurussia was fused to Gondwana and closed the Tethys . The Carboniferous was a time of diverse marine invertebrates . Benthic , or sea-bottom , marine communities were dominated by the crinoids , a group of stalked echinoderms ( invertebrates characterized by a hard , spiny covering or skin ) that still lives today . The calcareous ( containing calcium carbonate ) remains of these organisms are significant rock-forming materials . A related , but extinct , group of stalked echinoderms , the blastoids , were also a big part of Carboniferous marine ecosystems . Even though terrestrial insects had existed since the Devonian , they diversified during the Carboniferous Period . By the Pennsylvanian subperiod , dragonflies and mayflies had reached large sizes , with some of the earliest ancestors of modern dragonflies ( Protodonata ) having wingspans of approximately 70 cm ( 28 inches ) . Some scientists argued that higher oxygen concentrations present in the atmosphere during the Carboniferous Period ( some 30 percent compared with just 21 percent during the early 21st century ) may have played a role in enabling these insects to grow so large . In addition , fossils of more advanced insects capable of folding their wings , particularly cockroaches , are well represented in rocks of the Pennsylvanian subperiod . Other Pennsylvanian insects include the ancestral forms of grasshoppers and crickets and the first terrestrial scorpions . Carboniferous terrestrial environments were dominated by vascular land plants ranging from small , shrubby growths to trees exceeding heights of 100 feet ( 30 meters ) . The Carboniferous Period was also the time of peak amphibian development and the emergence of the reptiles . Permian Period : 298.9 million to 252.2 million years ago At the beginning of the Permian period glaciation was widespread , and latitudinal climatic belts were strongly developed . Climate warmed throughout the Permian times , and , by the end of the period , hot and dry conditions were so extensive that they caused a crisis in Permian marine and terrestrial life . This dramatic climatic shift may have been partially triggered by the assembly of smaller continents into the supercontinent of Pangea . Most of the Earth's land area was incorporated into Pangea , which was surrounded by an immense world ocean called Panthalassa . Terrestrial plants broadly diversified during the Permian Period , and insects evolved rapidly as they followed the plants into new habitats . In addition , several important reptile lineages first appeared during this period , including those that eventually gave rise to mammals in the Mesozoic Era . The largest mass extinction in Earth's history occurred during the latter part of the Permian Period . This mass extinction was so severe that only 10 percent or less of the species present during the time of maximum biodiversity in the Permian survived to the end of the period . Triassic Period : 252.2 million to 201.3 million years ago The Triassic Period marked the beginning of major changes that were to take place throughout the Mesozoic Era , particularly in the distribution of continents , the evolution of life , and the geographic distribution of living things . At the beginning of the Triassic , virtually all the major landmasses of the world were collected into the supercontinent of Pangea . Terrestrial climates were predominately warm and dry ( though seasonal monsoons occurred over large areas ) , and the Earth's crust was relatively quiescent . At the end of the Triassic , however , plate tectonic activity picked up , and a period of continental rifting began . On the margins of the continents , shallow seas , which had dwindled in area at the end of the Permian , became more extensive ; as sea levels gradually rose , the waters of continental shelves were colonized for the first time by large marine reptiles and reef-building corals of modern aspect . The Triassic followed on the heels of the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth . During the recovery of life in the Triassic Period , the relative importance of land animals grew . Reptiles increased in diversity and number , and the first dinosaurs appeared , heralding the great radiation that would characterize this group during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . Finally , the end of the Triassic saw the appearance of the first mammals – tiny , fur-bearing , shrewlike animals derived from reptiles . Another episode of mass extinction occurred at the end of the Triassic . Though this event was less devastating than its counterpart at the end of the Permian , it did result in drastic reductions of some living populations – particularly of the ammonoids , primitive mollusks that have served as important index fossils for assigning relative ages to various strata in the Triassic System of rocks . Jurassic Period : 201.3 million to 145 million years ago Adapted from : C.R. Scotese , The University of Texas at Arlington The Jurassic was a time of significant global change in continental configurations , oceanographic patterns , and biological systems . During this period the supercontinent Pangea split apart , allowing for the eventual development of what are now the central Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico . Heightened plate tectonic movement led to significant volcanic activity , mountain-building events , and attachment of islands onto continents . Shallow seaways covered many continents , and marine and marginal marine sediments were deposited , preserving a diverse set of fossils . Rock strata laid down during the Jurassic Period have yielded gold , coal , petroleum , and other natural resources . During the Early Jurassic , animals and plants living both on land and in the seas recovered from one of the largest mass extinctions in Earth history . Many groups of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms important in the modern world made their first appearance during the Jurassic . Life was especially diverse in the oceans – thriving reef ecosystems , shallow-water invertebrate communities , and large swimming predators , including reptiles and squidlike animals . On land , dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs dominated the ecosystems , and birds made their first appearance . Early mammals also were present , though they were still fairly insignificant . Insect populations were diverse , and plants were dominated by the gymnosperms , or "" naked-seed "" plants . Cretaceous Period : 145 million to 66 million years ago Courtesy of Paul C. Sereno ( 1997 ) , University of Chicago The Cretaceous is the longest period of the Phanerozoic Eon . Spanning 79 million years , it represents more time than has elapsed since the extinction of the dinosaurs , which occurred at the end of the period . The name Cretaceous is derived from creta , Latin for "" chalk , "" and was first proposed by J.B.J. Omalius d ' Halloy in 1822 . Chalk is a soft , fine-grained type of limestone composed predominantly of the armorlike plates of coccolithophores , tiny floating algae that flourished during the Late Cretaceous . The Cretaceous Period began with Earth's land assembled essentially into two continents , Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south . These were almost completely separated by the equatorial Tethys seaway , and the various segments of Laurasia and Gondwana had already started to rift apart . North America had just begun pulling away from Eurasia during the Jurassic , and South America had started to split off from Africa , from which India , Australia , and Antarctica were also separating . When the Cretaceous Period ended , most of the present-day continents were separated from each other by expanses of water such as the North and South Atlantic Ocean . At the end of the period , India was adrift in the Indian Ocean , and Australia was still connected to Antarctica . The climate was generally warmer and more humid than today , probably because of very active volcanism associated with unusually high rates of seafloor spreading . The polar regions were free of continental ice sheets , their land instead covered by forest . Dinosaurs roamed Antarctica , even with its long winter night . Dinosaurs were the dominant group of land animals , especially "" duck-billed "" dinosaurs ( hadrosaurs ) , such as Shantungosaurus , and horned forms , such as Triceratops . Giant marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs , mosasaurs , and plesiosaurs were common in the seas , and flying reptiles ( pterosaurs ) dominated the sky . Flowering plants ( angiosperms ) arose close to the beginning of the Cretaceous and became more abundant as the period progressed . The Late Cretaceous was a time of great productivity in the world's oceans , as borne out by the deposition of thick beds of chalk in Western Europe , eastern Russia , southern Scandinavia , the Gulf Coast of North America , and western Australia . The Cretaceous ended with one of the greatest mass extinctions in the history of Earth , exterminating the dinosaurs , marine and flying reptiles , and many marine invertebrates . Paleogene Period : 66 million to 23 million years ago , and Neogene Period : 23 million to 2.6 million years ago Adapted from C.R. Scotese , The University of Texas at Arlington The Paleogene is the oldest of the three stratigraphic divisions of the Cenozoic Era . Paleogene is Greek meaning "" ancient-born "" and includes the Paleocene Epoch ( 66 million to 56 million years ago ) , the Eocene Epoch ( 56 million to 33.9 million years ago ) , and the Oligocene Epoch ( 33 . 9 million to 23 million years ago ) . The term Paleogene was devised in Europe to emphasize the similarity of marine fossils found in rocks of the first three Cenozoic epochs . In contrast , the Neogene Period encompasses the interval between 23 million and 2.6 million years ago and includes the Miocene ( 23 million to 5.3 million years ago ) and the Pliocene ( 5 . 3 million to 2.6 million years ago ) epochs . The Neogene , which means "" new born , "" was designated as such to emphasize that the marine and terrestrial fossils found in the strata of this time were more closely related to each other than to those of the preceding period . Until 2008 , these two intervals were known as the Tertiary Period . Together , the Paleogene and Neogene Periods made up a time of enormous geologic , climatic , oceanographic , and biological change . They spanned the transition from a globally warm world containing relatively high sea levels and dominated by reptiles to a world of polar glaciation , sharply differentiated climate zones , and mammalian dominance . The Paleogene and Neogene were the stages of dramatic evolutionary expansion of not only mammals but also flowering plants , insects , birds , corals , deep-sea organisms , marine plankton , and mollusks ( especially clams and snails ) , among many other groups . They saw huge alterations in Earth's systems and the development of the ecological and climatic conditions that characterize the modern world . The end of the Neogene was a time in which glaciers grew in the Northern Hemisphere and primates emerged that later gave rise to modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) , chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) , and other living great apes . Quaternary Period : 2.6 million years ago to the present The Quaternary has been characterized by several periods of glaciation ( the "" ice ages "" of common lore ) , when ice sheets many kilometers thick have covered vast areas of the continents in temperate areas . During and between these glacial periods , rapid changes in climate and sea level have occurred , and environments worldwide have been altered . These variations in turn have driven rapid changes in life-forms , both flora and fauna . Beginning some 200,000 years ago , they were responsible for the rise of modern humans ."

A confiscation order is a debt owed by the defendant to the Crown . The defendant can choose to pay the order voluntarily , but if he or she fails to pay the order , compulsory enforcement action can be taken . All confiscation order payments , however enforced , go to the Treasury through the enforcing Magistrates' Court . It is intended that CPS will play an active role in the enforcement of confiscation orders by making applications to the Crown Court for the appointment of enforcement receivers and / or by requesting the listing of applications at the Magistrates' Court to activate the default sentence of imprisonment , if the defendant fails to pay the confiscation order . Top of page Guidance When is payment due ? The amount to be paid under a confiscation order must be paid on the date of the making of the confiscation order ( section 11 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ( POCA )) . If the defendant shows that he or she needs time to pay the confiscation order , the court may extend this time for payment for up to six months . If within the six months the defendant applies to the court for a further extension of this time and the court finds that there are exceptional circumstances , it can extend the time for a further six months . Before granting either an application for an extension of time or an application for a further extension of time , the Court must give the prosecutor an opportunity to make representations . Top of page What sum is due ? Interest is payable on the unpaid amount of the confiscation order , to encourage prompt payment . If the confiscation order is not paid by the due date , the amount of interest is added to the confiscation order and is treated as if it were part of the order ( section 12 POCA ) . The rate of interest is that specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 and is currently 8 % . Interest is not payable if an application to extend time to pay has been made by the defendant within twelve months of the making of the confiscation order and has not been determined by the court . Top of page Who may enforce a confiscation order ? The Director of ARA or the Magistrates' Court is responsible for the enforcement of a confiscation order . In cases where the Director of ARA is not responsible for enforcing the order , the prosecutor has an important role in enforcement by applying to the Crown Court for the appointment of an enforcement receiver to realise the defendant's assets , and / or to the Magistrates' Court for an enforcement hearing , so that the court can activate the sentence imposed in default of payment of the confiscation order . Top of page The Director of ARA Section 34 of POCA requires the court to appoint the Director as the enforcement authority for a confiscation order if : the Court made a confiscation order after being asked to do so by the Director ; the Court made a confiscation order after being asked by the Director to reconsider the case where no confiscation order was made ; the Court of Appeal , or the Crown Court at the direction of the House of Lords , made a confiscation order as the result of an appeal by the Director ; before the Court made the confiscation order , the Director applied to the Court to appoint him as the enforcement authority for the order . A protocol will be agreed with ARA as to the types of cases , where ARA may be willing to act as the enforcement authority . The guiding factor will be one of complexity . It is anticipated that cases , which involve the realisation of substantial assets abroad would fall within this category . Top of page The Magistrates' Court The Magistrates' Court has the ultimate responsibility of enforcing a confiscation order and it will enforce the order as if it were a fine . Nevertheless , the Magistrates' Court is not the preferred enforcer in cases involving the realisation of assets outside the jurisdiction , real property , or enforcing against property held in the names of third parties . Top of page Magistrates' power to obtain monies from banks and building societies POCA makes specific provision for cash held by banks and building societies , in order to ensure that effective enforcement of confiscation orders occurs quickly . A Magistrates' Court may order a bank or building society to pay the money to the Justices' Chief Executive towards satisfaction of the confiscation order if any of the following conditions occurs : money is held by a defendant in an account which he holds with a bank or building society ; or money has been seized by a constable under section 19 of PACE 1984 and is held by a police force in an account which it holds with a bank or building society ; or money has been seized by a customs officer under section 19 of PACE 1984 and is held by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in an account which they hold with a bank or building society ; and the money has been restrained by a restraint order ; and a confiscation order has been made against the defendant ; and the Director has not been appointed as the enforcement authority for the confiscation order ; and an enforcement receiver has not been appointed in relation to the money ; and the period granted by the Court for payment of the confiscation order has expired . If the bank or building society fails to comply with such an order , the Magistrates' Court may order it to pay an amount not exceeding £ 5000 and this money will be treated as payment towards the confiscation order ( see section 67 POCA ) . Top of page The Prosecutor As the Director of ARA is only likely to be appointed in complex cases , perhaps involving foreign properties , and as the Magistrates' Court is best equipped to recover sums of money from bank accounts or other straight forward cases , it will fall upon the prosecutor to enforce cases involving the realisation of the defendant's assets . Fortunately , this task may be easily achieved by the prosecutor applying to the Crown Court for the appointment of an enforcement receiver ( see below ) . The prosecutor , rather than the Magistrates' Court , should normally take primary responsibility in cases in which there is an existing restraint order and / or where the realisable assets include : Assets out of the jurisdiction ; Real property ; or Assets held in the names of third parties ( including limited companies ) . Note - This is an administrative arrangement rather than a legal requirement . Top of page The decision to appoint an enforcement receiver The prosecutor should consider making an application to the Crown Court for the appointment of an enforcement receiver wherever the realisable assets include assets out of the jurisdiction , real property or assets held by and / or in the names of third parties ( including limited companies ) . Another factor to consider is the cost of appointing an enforcement receiver . The CPS give the receiver an indemnity to make good any shortfall of the receiver's costs after the defendant's assets have been realised . Clearly , if the costs of hiring the receiver are likely to be in excess of the amount that is likely to be realised , a receiver should not be appointed . This may be a particularly pertinent issue in cases where there has been no restraint order , as some assets may have been dissipated prior to the appointment of the receiver . Although the application to court is made by the prosecutor , once appointed , the receiver is an officer of the court and will be separately represented on future hearings . See below for the procedure relating to the appointment of the enforcement receiver . Top of page The role of third parties Third parties have no right to be heard on a criminal confiscation hearing . The Crown Court will determine the defendant's interest in property held by third parties , whether this property is held jointly , is a tainted gift , or is property otherwise held in the names of third parties . The Court at the confiscation stage is only tasked with determining the amount of the defendant's free property , in order to calculate the recoverable or available amount in which to make an order for a sum of money and is not concerned with the property itself . Any determinations as to the defendant's interest at that stage can not be binding on third parties , as they are not parties to the proceedings ( see Re Norris [ 2001 ] UKHL 34 ) . Third party assets may be restrained and / or at the enforcement stage , action may be taken by a receiver to realise property , in which third parties may be claiming an interest . Third parties are entitled to have their claims determined by a court , although not as a part of the confiscation proceedings . Unlike previous legislation , POCA provides that the appropriate court will be the Crown Court . Top of page Resolution of third party interests The court may order anyone who has possession of realisable property to give it to the receiver and may order anyone who holds an interest in realisable property to pay the receiver the amount of any interest held in the property by the defendant or the recipient of a tainted gift . Once that payment is made , the interest of the defendant or the recipient of the tainted gift in the property is extinguished . Before such orders are made , the Crown Court ( Confiscation , Restraint and Receivership ) Rules 2003 ( SI 2003 No. 421 ) require that the defendant or the recipient of the gift must be given notice of the hearing and will , therefore , be able to make representations to the court . The defendant , or the recipient of a tainted gift , may apply to the court for an order that any property that can not be replaced should not be sold . Such an order made under section 69 ( 4 ) POCA may be revoked or varied . Section 62 ( 3 ) POCA provides that any person affected by the action or proposed action of a receiver may apply to the Crown Court for an order giving directions as to the exercise of the receivership powers . The court may make such order as it believes appropriate . Any person affected by an order appointing or giving powers to a receiver may also apply to the Crown Court to vary or discharge the order by virtue of section 63 ( 1 ) ( c ) POCA . Section 69 ( 3 ) POCA provides that in exercising the powers given to the court and / or to a receiver , the powers must be exercised with a view to allowing a person other than the defendant or a recipient of a tainted gift to retain or recover the value of any interest held by him ; in the case of realisable property held by a recipient of a tainted gift , the powers must be exercised with a view to realising no more than the value for the time being of the gift ; in a case where a confiscation order has not been made against the defendant , property must not be sold if the court so orders under subsection ( 4 ) . Top of page The matrimonial home A confiscation order is an order to pay a sum of money and may be enforced against any property held by the defendant , even if some of that property was legally obtained . Accordingly , the matrimonial home may be seized and confiscated , if the defendant fails to pay . Subject to the operation of section 31 of the Family Law Act 1996 , this may result in the eviction of other family members . The effect of section 69 ( 3 ) ( a ) POCA is to reverse the unreported case of Customs and Excise v A ( July 22 2002 , CA ) ; a case in which it was held that a property adjustment order could be made in family proceedings notwithstanding the provisions of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 . The court may not , however , order the realisation of any share in the matrimonial home owned by the spouse or partner , unless it can be shown that the share was a tainted gift ( see R v Buckman [ 1997 ] 1 Cr . A pp. R. ( S. ) 325 ) . Top of page Inadequacy of available amount If the defendant or enforcement receiver applies to the Crown Court to vary the order the court must calculate the available amount . If it finds that the available amount is inadequate to pay the amount outstanding under the confiscation order the court may substitute the amount that it thinks just ( section 23 POCA ) . The court must disregard any inadequacy that it believes is attributable in whole or in part to anything done by the defendant to preserve property held by the recipient of a tainted gift in order to prevent it from being used to pay the confiscation order . Top of page Discharging the confiscation order In exceptional circumstances if less than £ 1,000 remains to be paid under the confiscation order and a Justices' Chief Executive applies to the Court for the discharge of the order , the Court may consider whether the available amount is inadequate . If the Court finds the available amount to be inadequate to meet the amount remaining to be paid , and if this is due to fluctuations of currency exchange rates for foreign currency or due to any other reason specified by the Secretary of State , the Court may discharge the confiscation order . If only a small amount remains outstanding ( £ 50.00 or less ) and a Justices' Chief Executive applies to the Court for the discharge of the order , by virtue of section 25 POCA , the Court may discharge the confiscation order . Top of page Enforcement abroad Realisable property is often held abroad . If a confiscation order has not yet been made , but any one of the five conditions for the granting of a restraint order have been satisfied and the prosecutor or the Director believes that realisable property is situated outside the United Kingdom , the prosecutor or the Director may send a request for assistance to another country via the Secretary of State to prohibit any person from dealing with realisable property and / or to sell realisable property and apply the proceeds in accordance with the law of that country ( see section 74 POCA ) . If the property is sold by the requested country , the money raised from that sale remains in the requested country , but the remaining balance of the amount ordered to be confiscated will be reduced by the amount raised by the sale . Top of page Procedure MAS have prepared a process map of the steps involved at the enforcement stage under the previous legislation . Enforcement . x ls The Crown Court will send the Notice of the Confiscation Order , Confiscation Certificate and Schedule ( s ) of Assets to the relevant prosecutor and the defence solicitors within seven days of the confiscation order being made . The prosecutor should then contact the Justices' Chief Executive for the Magistrates' Court within fourteen days of receipt of Orders and Schedule ( s ) from the Crown Court to inform him / her whether CPS intends to take the primary enforcement responsibility , or conversely whether there is an existing restraint order and that The CPS intends to take no enforcement action . The reasons for this should be detailed in a letter . The Justices Chief Executive for the Magistrates' Courts will contact the prosecutor in cases that he / she believes that the prosecutor should take primary responsibility , if the prosecutor has not already made contact . Top of page Cases with the prosecutor holding lead responsibility Determine whether an appeal has been lodged Contact should be made with the Court of Appeal to confirm whether or not an appeal has been lodged . If an appeal has been lodged , then the enforcement process will be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal . Top of page Determine whether any monies have been paid Before taking the action outlined below , a telephone call should be made to the Magistrates' Court to ascertain whether the defendant has voluntarily paid any of the sum due under the confiscation order . Top of page Send letter to the defendant Within fourteen days of primary responsibility being established , the prosecutor should send a letter to the defendant or defendant's representatives indicating the preferred enforcement process ( voluntary payment or application for receiver ) and enclosing any relevant documents for signature ( e . g . authorities for accounts , policies , motor vehicles , jewellery etc ) . The letter will inform the defendant that failure to satisfy the Confiscation Order by the due date together with a refusal to consent to the preferred enforcement process may lead to the imposition of the default sentence . The debt will not be expunged after the default sentence is imposed . It can not be remitted and will increase due to the accrual of interest at the relevant rate . Enforcement action to realise assets will continue even after the default sentence is imposed . Top of page Determine defendant's earliest release date The prosecutor should obtain confirmation of changes in the defendant's earliest release date and current location by faxing the Prisoner Release Service on 0121-6263474 . Where the defendant's earliest release date post-dates the expiry of time to pay , the prosecutor should ensure that any enforcement action is completed before the defendant's earliest date of release , and preferably before the expiry of time to pay , so that the magistrates' court can issue a warrant of commitment in relation to any unpaid amount while the defendant is in prison . Top of page List an enforcement hearing in the Magistrates' Court At the request of the prosecutor , the Magistrates' Court should list an enforcement hearing to see why the default sentence should not be imposed . The prosecutor should supply the Court with copies of the relevant correspondence to and from the defendant showing its efforts to pursue funds . Once a default sentence has been imposed , it can not be remitted and must be served in full , or until such time as the Confiscation order is satisfied , whichever is earliest . The incentive to the defendant is the fact that wilful refusal to co-operate is likely to lead to the default sentence being imposed and being served in full with the assets then be realised anyway . If there is no penalty for delaying the enforcement process defendants will continue to do so . At the request of the prosecutor , the Magistrates' Court should issue a distress warrant or obtain a garnishee order as appropriate . The prosecutor should supply the Court with copies of the relevant correspondence to and from the defendant showing its efforts to pursue the particular assets and any other information or documentary evidence which the Magistrates' Court might reasonably require in order to obtain a garnishee order . Enforcement hearings at the Magistrates' Court should not normally be adjourned for more than two weeks to allow for the defendant to sign relevant documentation or four weeks to permit the defendant to arrange for the transfer to the Court's bailiffs of chattel assets not already in the Crown's possession . NB . It can be more expedient and cost-effective for the court rather than a receiver to realise certain chattels or cash . Top of page Appoint Enforcement Receiver There are three conditions that must exist before the court appoints an enforcement receiver : The court has made a confiscation order ; The confiscation order has not been satisfied ; and The confiscation order is not subject to appeal . Once these conditions are met , on the application of the prosecutor , the Crown Court may appoint a Receiver in respect of realisable property . Top of page Choice of receiver A panel of receivers will be appointed to act on behalf of The CPS on a range of confiscation related matters across the 42 Areas . Areas will take receivers from a national panel on a case-by-case basis ; geography does not impact on the selection and use of receivers . Receivers will be appointed to the panel after a rigorous tendering exercise and be experienced in this work and fully acquainted with CPS requirements . The project team , on behalf of the Service , will undertake the tendering and the setting up of the panel . The receiver's letters of appointment will agree the fees they charge and the terms and conditions under which they will work as set out in the Framework Agreement . Top of page Application to court The Crown Court may determine the application without a hearing . The Rules state that unless the application to appoint the receiver is made ex parte , the application and witness statement must be lodged with the Crown Court and served on - the defendant ; the recipients of any tainted gifts ; and any other person whom the applicant knows to have an interest in any property to which the application relates , at least seven days before the date fixed by the court for hearing the application , unless the Crown Court specifies a shorter period . Top of page Content of witness statement The witness statement should give the grounds for the application including : an overview of the case and the circumstances giving rise to the need for the appointment of an enforcement receiver ; copy correspondence with the defendant inviting payment of the confiscation order ; full details of the proposed receiver and exhibit the letter of agreement setting out the basis for the receivers remuneration and operation and a consent letter from the receiver that he or she is willing to act in the case and abide by the terms of both the order and letter of agreement ; and to the best of the witness's ability , full details of the realisable property in respect of which the applicant is seeking the order and specify the person holding that realisable property . A draft receivership order must accompany the witness statement . Top of page Hearsay evidence Hearsay evidence is admissible in restraint and receivership applications , however , Rule 39 of the Crown Court ( Confiscation , Restraint and Receivership ) Rules 2003 ( SI 2003 No. 421 ) provides that section 2 ( 1 ) of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 does not apply to these proceedings . There is no duty to serve notice identifying the hearsay statements or of an intention to rely upon hearsay . Top of page Receiver's powers The receiver gets his authority to act from the court . This is set out in the order appointing him ( section 51 POCA ) . It is extremely important that the order appointing a enforcement receiver is drafted so as to give the receiver the powers that he needs to operate to manage the assets . An ex parte application to appoint an enforcement receiver the Court can not give the receiver power to manage the assets as in order to grant the receiver this power an opportunity to be heard must be given to all parties likely to be affected by the enforcement receiver order . On an ex parte order the receiver may be given the Power to take possession of property ; Power to start , carry on or defend legal proceedings in respect of the property ; Power to enter premises in England and Wales : To search for or inspect anything authorised by the Court ; To make or obtain a copy or photograph or other record as authorised by the Court ; To remove any property as authorised in the receivership order . After an inter partes hearing he may be given the powers set out above and also the Power to realise so much of the property as is necessary to meet the receivers remuneration and expenses ; and Power to realise so much of the property as is necessary to meet the receivers remuneration and expenses . Top of page Address any third party claims Please refer to the heading "" The role of third parties "" above . Top of page Appeals Any decision as to whether a prosecution appeal should be lodged , should be taken at level E , or by the head of the relevant trials unit . Prosecution appeals in respect of enforcement receivership include : Section 65 ( 1 ) to the Court of Appeal in respect of the refusal of the Crown Court to appoint and / or give powers to an enforcement receiver ; Section 65 ( 2 ) ( a ) to the Court of Appeal in respect of an order made by the Crown Court to appoint and / or to give powers to an enforcement receiver ; Section 65 ( 3 ) to the Court of Appeal where on a further application by the prosecutor , the Crown Court refuses to make an order ; Section 65 ( 4 ) to the Court of Appeal where on a further application the Crown Court has made an order ; and Section 66 to the House of Lords in respect of a decision of the Court of Appeal . In addition , the defendant and / or any person affected by the appointment or powers given to a enforcement receiver ; by the grant of powers to the receiver ; by the refusal or the giving of directions ; or by a refusal to discharge or vary the order , may appeal with leave to the Court of Appeal . Any party appearing in an appeal before the Court of Appeal may appeal with leave to the House of Lords . The appeal procedure may be found in a combination of POCA , the Criminal Appeal ( Confiscation , Restraint and Receivership ) Rules 2003 and in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ( Appeals under Part 2 ) Order 2003 ( SI 2003 No. 82 ) . Notice of Appeal should be served within fourteen days , although application can be made for an appeal out of time . Top of page Chase up enforcement receiver Regular contact should be maintained with the enforcement receiver and reports obtained of the amounts recovered and of the remaining balance . This information should be entered on the Excel spreadsheet and submitted to Headquarters on a quarterly basis . Top of page Cases where the Magistrates' Court holds lead responsibility Quarterly updates as to the value of assets realised should be obtained from the relevant Magistrate's Court . The details should be entered in the Excel spreadsheet and forwarded to Headquarters every quarter whilst the order is outstanding . If the Magistrates' Court appears to be making little progress , the prosecutor should consider asking the court to list a hearing to activate the default sentence of imprisonment . Alternatively , further consideration should be given to the appointment of an enforcement receiver , if appropriate .

450	Gentleman Jim , the greatest Blue of all He was one of the great names in football during the game's golden age after World War Two when crowds flocked back to soccer in their millions . Born in Alton 1925 , Dickinson joined Pompey from Alton Youth Club . After three years in the Royal Navy , he made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers at Fratton Park in 1946 . He established the number six shirt as his own and helped steer Pompey to successive league championships . And a total of 48 appearances for England made him Pompey's most capped player of all time . He played 764 league games for Pompey - a record for one player at a single club which was not broken until Swindon's John Trollope went six better in 1980 . Dickinson was a gentleman both on and off the pitch . He was never booked or sent off in 800 Pompey and England matches . Dickinson was a Pompey stalwart for almost 20 years . Awarded the MBE in 1964 , he played his last match for the Blues a year later , helping Pompey to a 1-1 end-of-season draw at Northampton that secured safety from relegation .

650	Well I was born in New York in 1954 , but grew up in Los Angeles . I now live in Santa Barbara , California . As you may have guessed , my real name is n't Christopher Pike . I am very guarded about my real name , as I prefer to keep my identity a secret . My pen name was taken from Star Trek as it was the name of the first captain of the Starship Enterprise and I am a huge fan of any kind of science fiction . Apart from science fiction I love reading books by Stephen King , Tolkien and Ray Bradbury -- Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favourite books , along with Lord of the Rings . My love of books started pretty early on . At school I was very shy and as a result I would often be found absorbed in a book . I see my writing as a way of prolonging my youth ! Before writing my career took off I had various jobs including a house painter , a computer programmer and a factory worker . I left university early to begin my career and starting off writing science fiction , which I loved -- but no one would publish it . I never really set out to write books for teenagers , it just seemed to happen that way . Being a teenager is a very intense time as you 've got so many things going on in your life and I think you feel everything so much more : anger , love , jealousy and loyalty . I have written books for adults but I prefer writing books for children . After hundreds of rejection letters my first books were finally published in 1984 . The first two were Slumber Party and Weekend . I ca n't tell you how excited I was to finally see my books in print and on the bookshelves of shops . I have to confess I still go into bookshops and arrange the displays of my books . Sometimes I will see a kid looking at my books and I will tell them I know Christopher Pike . I do n't think they would believe me if I said I was Christopher Pike .	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

Hamas officials say military commander Izz el-Deen al-Sheikh Khalil was killed Sunday morning while starting his car . Hamas immediately blamed Israel for the attack , and officials in the Gaza Strip threatened to carry out reprisals against Israeli targets abroad . But a Hamas official in Lebanon says no such decision has been made . In Damascus , the Syrian news agency called the attack an assassination , and said Israel bears full responsibility for its consequences . Israel has not commented . But early this month , Israeli authorities promised to strike Hamas leaders abroad . The Israeli threat came one day after Hamas-linked suicide bombers killed 16 people on two buses in southern Israel . Story supplied by :	News	News
1084	"Smarter Survey Results and Impact : Abandon the Asker-Puker Model ! Today's post comes from a source of deep pain . Analysis Ninjas are valued less than I would prefer for them to be . The post is also sourced from a recent edition of my newsletter , The Marketing – Analytics Intersect . I send it once a week , and it contains my insights and recommendations on those two topics . Like this blog , the newsletter is geared towards being instantly actionable ( rather than just theory-smart , which is pretty cool too ) . Do sign up if you want to deliver a small electric shock of simulation to your brain each week . TMAI # 41 covered a graph that resulted from a survey done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . I received a ton of responses for it , and great discussion ensued . It prompted me to write this post , essentially an expanded version of TMAI # 41 . I 've added new insights , recommendations , and two bonus lessons on how to do surveys better and a direct challenge to your company's current analytics strategy . If your heart is weak , you can stop reading now . I promise , I wo n't mind one bit . I heart you . If you are open to being challenged ... then here are the short-stories inside this post ... Some of you know that I created the phrases Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas to emphasize the difference between those that puke data and those that puke insights with actions attached to them . Here is my slide the first time I presented the concept in a keynote ... Cute , right ? : ) While companies , medium and large , often need both roles , I 've massively pushed for every company to want more Analysis Ninjas and for analysts to have careers where they can rapidly undertake metamorphosis from Reporting Squirrels to Analysis Ninjas ( after all the difference in salary is tens of thousands of dollars ) . With that as context , you can imagine how heart-broken I was when Jane shared the following visual from a study done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . It contains the answers to the question which analytics skills are most in demand ... Checkout the y-axis ... what do you see as the common pattern across them all ? Just data puking . One row after another of data puking skills . Ranked . Almost nothing that quite captures the value of Analysis Ninjas ! N. O. T. H. I. N. G. I did a random Google search and got this list of analytical skills : + Understanding relationships between numbers + Interpreting mathematical information + Visual perception of information + Ability to organize information + Pattern recognition and understanding trends + Argumentation and logical thinking + Ability to create insightful data visualizations + Hypothesis development and design of experimentation + Strategic thinking skills And , that is just a random list ! None of these are in demand ? Look at the list in the graph , what kind of purple squirrel with ant legs and an elephant's nose that nobody needs is Lynchpin describing ? This did not happen at Econsultancy , but the data did cause introspection at my end . And , my first question was the one that is also top of mind of all readers of Occam's Razor ... Is the world so dark that the only "" analytical "" skills that are valued are directly tied to data puking and you should immediately shut down your Analysis Ninja efforts ? Let me share three thoughts for your consideration , then some guidance on how to do surveys right , and end with a call to arms for all of you and the "" data people "" you choose to work with . Three thoughts that explain the Econsultancy / Lynchpin graph . 1 . The survey design is at fault . The otherwise well-respected Econsultancy and Lynchpin dropped the ball massively in creating the list of answers for the respondents to choose from . I have to admit , I believe this is a major flaw ( and not just for this question in the entire report ) . What is disappointing is that they have done this for nine years in a row ! It poses these questions ... How is it that in nine years no one at these organizations realized they were simply asking people to rank data puking answers ? Did the survey list the skills Econsultancy and Lynchpin hire for and value in their own analysts ? The graph illustrates data for three years ... Was the fact that almost nothing changed in three years in terms of priority not trigger a rethink of the options provided for this question ? Anyone reading the report at the two companies creating it should have thrown a red flag up and said hey guys , the respondents keep rating the answers the same , maybe we are not asking the right question or providing the best choices for our respondents to pick . More on how to avoid this flaw in your surveys , of any kind , below . 2 . The survey is targeted to the wrong folks . They might be the wrong folks to accurately judge what analytical skills and how to appreciate the value of each skill as they rank them . That could explain the results ( not the answer choices though ) . Econsultancy / Lynchpin provides this description in the report : "" There were 960 respondents to our research request , which took the form of a global online survey fielded in May and June 2016 . Respondents included both in-house digital professionals and analysts ( 56 % ) and supply-side respondents , including agencies , consultants and vendors ( 44 % ) . "" The survey was 76 % from the UK and EU . Respondents were solicited from each company's database as well as Social Media . Here is the distribution provided in the report : On paper it looks like the departments are to be what you would expect . It is difficult to ascribe any blame to the folks who got the survey . There is a chance that there is a UK and EU nuance here , but I do n't think so . 3 . It is our fault . My first instinct in these cases is to look into the mirror . Perhaps we have not succeeded as much as we should when it comes to show casing the value of true data analysis . Perhaps all the people involved in all digital analytics jobs / initiatives , inside and outside companies , are primarily data pukers , and none of them have skills to teach companies that there is such a thing as data analysis that is better . Then , you and I , and especially our friends in UK and EU , need to work harder to prove to companies that CDPs ( customized data pukes , my name for reporting ) do not add much value , the rain of data does not drive much action . You and I need to truly move to the IABI model were we send very little data , and what little we send out is sent with copious amounts of Insights from the data , what Actions leaders need to take , and the computation of the Business Impact . The more we deliver IABI , by using our copious analytical skills , the more the leaders will start to recognize what real analytical skills are and be able to separate between Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Bottom-line ... I would like to blame the competency at Econsultancy and Lynchpin , especially because I believe that truly , but I must take some responsibility on behalf of the Analysis Ninjas of the world . Perhaps we suck more than we would like to admit . I mean that sincerely . Bonus # 1 : Lessons from Econsultancy / Lynchpin Survey Strategy . There are a small clump of lessons from my practice in collecting qualitative feedback that came to fore in thinking about this particular survey . Let me share those with you , they cover challenges that surely the E + L team faced as they put this initiative together . If your survey has questions that cease to be relevant , should you ask them again for the sale of consistency as you have done this survey for nine years ? There is a huge amount of pressure for repeated surveys to keep the questions the same because Survey Data Providers love to show time trends – month over month , year over year . It might seem silly that you would keep asking a question when you know it is not relevant , but there is pressure . This is even worse when it comes to answer choices . Survey Creators love having stability and being able to show how things have changed , and they keep irrelevant / awful / dead answers around . If you are in this position ... You will be brave , you will be a warrior , you will be the lone against-the-tide-swimmer , and you will slay non-value-added stuff ruthlessly . You will burn for from the ashes shall rise glory . If you are the Big Boss of such an initiative , here is a simple incentive to create , especially for digital-anything surveys : Give your team a standard goal that 30 % of the survey questions for any survey repeated each year have to be eliminated and 10 % new ones added . Your permission will 1 . force your employees to think hard about what to keep and what to kill ( imagine that , thinking ! ) 2 . create a great and fun culture in your analytical ( or reporting : ( ) team and 3 . push them to know of the latest and greatest and include that in the survey . If I feel I have a collection of terrible choices , do you have a strategy for how I can identify that ? This does not work for all questions of course , but here is one of my favourite choice in cases where the questions relate to organizations , people skills , and other such elements . Take this as an example ... How do you know that this is a profoundly sub-optimal collection of choices to provide ? For anyone with even the remotest amount of relevant experience , subject matter expertise , it is easy to see these are crazy choices – essentially implying purple squirrels exist . But , how would you know ? Simple . Start writing down how many different roles are represented in the list . That is just what I did ... It turns out there are at least five roles in a normal company that would possess these skills . So . Is this a good collection of skills to list ? Without that relevant information ? If you still go ahead and ask this question , what are you patterning your audience to look for / understand ? Oh , and I am still not over that in looking for what analysis skills are missing in the company , no actual analytical skills are listed above ! Ok , maybe statistical modeling smells like an analytical skill . But , that 's as close as it gets . I share this simple strategy , identifying the number of different roles this represents , to help you illuminate you might have a sub-optimal collection of choices . There are many other strategies like this one for other question . Look for them ! If your survey respondents are not the ideal audience for a question , what 's your job when crafting the survey ? J. K. I. Just kill it . If you do n't want to kill it ... Personally interview a random sample of 50 people personally ( for a 1,000 people survey ) . Take 10 mins each . Ask primitive basic questions about their job , their actual real work ( not job title ) , and their approximate knowledge . If these 50 pass the sniff test , send the survey . Else , know that your survey stinks . JKI . I know that I am putting an onerous burden on the survey company , taking to 50 people even for 10 mins comes at a cost . It does . I am empathetic to it . Consider it the cost of not putting smelly stuff out into the world . If your survey respondents wo n't be able to answer a question perfectly , what is a great strategy for crafting questions ? Oh , oh , oh , I love this problem . It happens all the time . You as the survey creator do n't know what you are taking about , the audience does not quite know what they are talking about , but there is something you both want to know / say . Here 's the solution : Do n't do drop down answers or radio button answers ! The first couple times you do this , ask open ended questions . What analytical skills do you think you need in your company ? Let them type out in their own words what they want . Then find a relatively smart person with subject matter expertise , give them a good salary and a case of Red Bull , and ask them to categorize . It will be eye opening . The results will improve your understanding and now you 'll have a stronger assessment of what you are playing with , and the audience will not feel boxed in by your choices , instead tell you how they see the answers . ( Maybe , just maybe be , they 'll give you my list of analytical skills above ! ) Then run the survey for a couple years with the choices from above . In year four , go back to the open text strategy . Get new ideas . Get smarter . Rinse . Repeat . I would like to think I know all the answers in the world . Hubris . I use the strategy above to become knowledgeable about the facts on the ground and then use those facts ( on occasion complemented by one or two of my choices ) to run the survey . This rule is great for all kinds of surveys , always start with open-text . It is harder . But that is what being a brave warrior of knowledge is all about ! If your survey results cause your senior executives , or random folks on the web , to question them , what is the best response ? The instinct to close in an be defensive , to even counter-attack , is strong . As I 'm sure your mom's taught you : Resist . Truly listen . Understand the higher order bit . Evolve . Then let your smarter walk do the talking . Simple . Awfully hard to do . Still . Simple . Bonus # 2 : The Askers-Pukers Business Model . The biggest thing a report like Econsultancy / Lynchpin's suffers from is that this group of individuals , perhaps even both these companies , see their role in this initiative as Askers-Pukers . It is defined as : Let us go ask a 960 people we can find amongst our customers and on social media a series of questions , convert that into tables and graphs , and sell it to the world . Ask questions . Puke data . That is all there is in the report . Download the sample report if you do n't have a paid Econsultancy subscription . If you do n't want to use your email address , use this wonderful service : www.throwawaymail.com Even if you set aside the surveying methodology , the questions framing , the answer choices and all else , there is negative value from anything you get from Askers-Pukers , because the totality of the interpretation of the data is writing in text what the graphs / tables already show or extremely generic text . Negative value also because you are giving money for the report that is value-deficient , and you are investing time in reading it to try and figure out something valuable . You lose twice . Instead one would hope that Econsultancy , Lynchpin , the team you interact with from Google , your internal analytics team , any human you interact who has data sees their role as IABI providers ( Insights – Actions – Business Impact ) . This is the process IABI providers follow : Ask questions . Analyze it for why the trends in the data exist ( Insights ) . Identify what a company can / should do based on the why ( Actions ) . Then , have the courage , and the analytical chops , to predict how much the impact will be on the company's business if they do what was recommended . Insights . Actions . Business Impact . Perhaps the fatal flaw in my analysis above , my hope above , is that I expected Econsultancy and Lynchpin to be really good at business strategy , industry knowledge , on the ground understanding of patterns with their massive collection of clients . Hence , knowing what actually works . I expected them to be Analysts . Instead , they perhaps limit their skills inside the respective company to be Askers-Pukers . Both companies are doing extremely well financially , hence I do appreciate that Askers-Pukers model does work . But for you , and for me , and for anyone else you are paying a single cent for when it comes to data – either data reported from a survey , data reported from your digital analytics tool , data reported from other companies you work with like Facebook or Google or GE – demand IABI . Why . What . How Much . If they do n't have that , you are talking to the wrong people . Press the escape button , do n't press the submit order button . [ Is n't it ironic . Econsultancy and Lynchpin did exactly what their survey has shown for nine years is not working for companies in the UK : Reporting . The outcome for both of them is exactly the same as the outcome for the companies : Nothing valuable . This is explicitly demonstrated by their full report . ] Bottom-line . I hope you see that this one survey is not the point . E + L are not the point . What their work in this specific example ( and you should check other examples if you pay either company money ) illuminates is a common problem that is stifling our efforts in the analytics business . This applies to E + L but it applies even more to your internal analytics team , it applies extremely to the consultants you hire , it applies to anyone you are giving a single cent to when it comes to data . Do n't hire Askers-Pukers . Do n't repeat things for years without constantly stress-testing for reality . Do n't make compromises when you do surveys or mine Adobe for data . Do n't create pretty charts without seeing , really looking with your eyes , what is on the chart and thinking about what it really represents . Applied to your own job inside any company , using Google Analytics or Adobe or iPerceptions or Compete or any other tool ... do n't be an Asker-Puker yourself . Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . Carpe Diem ! As always , it is your turn now . Is your company hiring Reporting Squirrels or Analysis Ninjas ? Why ? Is the work you are doing at your company / agency / consulting entity / survey data provider , truly Analysis Ninja work ? If not , why is it that it remains an Asker-Puker role ? Are there skills you 've developed in your career to shift to the person whose business is why , what , how much ? Lastly , when you do surveys , of the type above or others , are there favourite strategies you deploy to get a stronger signal rather than just strong noise ? Please share your life lessons from the front lines , critique , praise , fun-facts and valuable guidance for me and other readers via comments . Thank you . Merci . Arigato . PS : I hope this post illuminates the valuable content The Marketing – Analytics Intersect shares each week , sign up here . Comments Just this second your newsletter ended up in my inbox and I had to comment on it . Askers-pukers model is really one of the greatest things I 've read recently . I was just in discussion how I hate the skyscraper content method that led to all those "" 10 things you need to .. "" , "" 15 things you need to .. "" , "" 20 things .... "" you know .. and then this came in . Because I hate these "" Empirically looking nonsense reports "" just as much . The best thing is the hidden irony between dealing with Analytic Skills whilst showing not even a hint of it themselves . Asker puked model is interesting .. first time ever heard of it . Kidding . While the name is new , we are surrounded by Analysts and Agencies who practice this model . As they realize that revenue is not in this model for them or their clients hopefully they will take your advice to morph into IABI providers . Avinash – I read this , then read it again . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . Thank you for not only pointing out some of the weaknesses but also suggesting some positive things to improve matters . These are the real learnings for me . Keep em coming . We have to remember that every generation is being exposed to exponentially more data and the tools to assist in understanding lag . More important we do n't teach this kind of critical thinking to nearly enough people . We are still very early in a huge journey and much like DTP was in the 1980s you can use good tools and produce bad work . It takes time to develop the appreciation of how to make a difference with all this new data . Peter : I concur with you about the speed and quantity of change that is happening . It is a bit crazy . I hope this is taken by vendors , consultants , and internal Analysis Ninjas as a call to arms to invest regularly in self-development . It is so very easy in this industry to become stale . It use to take 20 years , it takes less than 2 now . This is 100 % true . But I was wondering : is it possible that the very structure of businesses cause the phenomenon of data puking ? I mean , assuming that most people are actively seeking promotions , the only way for them to prove their points and to elevate in the hierarchy is to generate reports validating their hypotheses and proving that they were right in the first place . I would suggest that such a bias does not lead to greater insights , but to data pukes , as you described so well . Benoit : Yes , the way modern orgs function they do incentivize lots of data puking . There is a mistaken belief that just access to data is enough to make smarter decisions . No , what you are describing as requirement for promotions is analysis , and analysis is good . Sadly , though most of the time people just get loads of data , due to lack of skills or training they are unable to convert that data into analysis which results in fewer promotions . I continue to be amazed at your ability to identify structural gaps in thinking from just one slide . One element that might be unique to you is that you get outraged when you see bad things , while most people rarely are passionate enough to give it a second glance . That is a lesson I 'll take with me from your post . Continue to point out these issues and push the industry forward . You wrote a lot to make a simple point . The survey was extremely poorly done with little thought to the audience and topic being measured . Tracking surveys makes sense when the kpi 's being measured are in fact consistent ( e.g. , brand awareness ) . The Researchers failed to recognize the skills of an ' analyst ' are not consistent over time or universal across industries and geography . But the point that people need to think crtically about what analysts do or should do within their organization is well taken . On survey strategies , there have been many a good book written on the subject of ( marketing ) research surveys that hardly need a rehash here . Avinash , thanks for the article . I think business is evolving . I think organizations are at the beginning of the journey on how to use the data they emit . I appreciate the inspiration . Thanks for putting your thoughts and feedback into the public domain – I could definitely feel my ears privately burning on the edge of the Marketing – Analytics Intersect last week ! We do put our Lynchpin name to this survey – by way of sponsorship rather than overall authorship I should emphasise – which makes us absolutely open to challenge by association . For the avoidance of doubt ( and rumour of unloved / unwanted weird squirrel / elephant / ant hybrids occupying Lynchpin towers ) I definitely agree that companies should seek out analysts with fundamental traits around numeracy , pattern recognition , communication , commercial awareness , hypothesis development , strategic thinking and so on . In blunt terms , I think the idea of your world view being substantially different to that presented in the survey report and / or the industry reality is perhaps overstated . You cite IABA as the model to aspire to ( "" Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . "" ) . I 'm certainly not disagreeing with that aspiration , but I 'd simply call IABA as you describe it "" good reporting "" . OK , really good reporting , fantastically tailored to the audience in terms of granularity and context and so on . But still , ultimately , the end product is : a report . So I can agree that bad reports = data puking and good reports = insight puking . Maybe less puking would be good overall . But I 'm not sure the reporting squirrel ( "" loser "" ? ) / analytics ninja ( "" winner "" ? ) differentiation is always a helpful reference point from an organisational perspective or a career development plan . We had an interesting panel discussion when the survey was first published ( with people that run internal analytics teams for large companies on the panel , not a bunch of consultants ) , and a lot of the discussion focused around how information is communicated around the organisation and carefully managing the interactions with stakeholders involved to drive success . I appreciate stakeholder management is a fairly corporate / bullshit term , but it 's far from "" data puking "" and increasingly what I hear VP's ( or UK equivalent ) seeking in their analytics teams . I like your "" sniff test "" analogy . I promise you those phrases in the offensive graphs would not be in the survey if we were n't hearing them consistently from people that hold budgets describing what they think they need from their analytics functions . You rightly classify them into multiple roles . We were deliberately looking to show the breadth of expectation set upon "" analytics teams "" and "" analyst roles "" by businesses ( please fix the TMS , please present to the board , please predict our sales for next year , please tell us something useful / interesting about our customers , please help us understand what our objectives are ) rather than suggesting a one person frankenstein monster exists . That said , 3 years ago statistical modelling was the least recognised skill-gap . Now it is the most recognised . I think that 's perhaps still relevant as a trend for budding squirrels on this exciting intersection to understand . There is a lot more in your comment and you have absolutely carried me with you with other things you mention . I am deeply grateful for the food for thought you 've provided . I 'll humbly push back on the idea that IABI is reporting . It is not . Reporting it producing a report or a chart – a clever one , a pretty one , a necessary one ( in most modern corporations , there is no escape from reporting ) . My definition of insights , and the thing that my students are learning at Market Motive and the thing that my large team at my employer uses , is why the thing that you see in the chart / table happened . A mix of deep dive analysis and business analysis . My definition of actions are the things that a client should do . A mix of business strategy and competitive analysis . The output is words in English ( or Urdu or Hebrew or Mandarin ) . My definition of business impact is how much a brand or performance KPI will move if aforementioned action is accomplished . The output is one number , mentioned next to each line of English / Urdu . 75 % of the above is not reporting , neither will it come from your Google Analytics account , your Micro-Strategy BI tool account etc. etc. It comes from a human's ability to dig and understand business strategy and relationships with Sr. Leaders . I think of that as output of analysis : IABI . No reporting I have ever seen has ever had the three elements above . At it 's very best , as you also saw in the Econsultancy report , "" really good reporting "" repeats in text what the report ( CDP ) shows . I hope I can carry you with me in the difference between reporting and analysis . Hi Avinash , I am really happy that you wrote a post about this issue . You are a true crusader . we owe you a lot . One confession to make – I get all your new posts through email . Basically , I do n't read the whole post at that time . I come back later when I have some quite time . For my visit to not considered as bounced , I just click on any link before leaving the site : ) . I know 1 visit with bounce is n't going to change anything but I just do n't want to disappoint you . I really feel bad and week for doing this . But I also think that It is my love and respect to you and all the hard work you put into Occam's Razor that I ca n't possibly disappoint you . And one more thing , waiting very patiently for your next book "" Web analytics 3.0 "" . Bhola : You are kind , but you should not worry about Bounce Rate for this blog . I use the strategy I recommend everyone follow ... I only measure Bounce Rate for New Visitors . For Returning , I know that most will read the latest post , and that is ok ! I do love it when they share their experience via comments , it helps everyone . So , thank you . In fact you should not be worried about bounce rate for new visitors too . Your articles are so thought-provoking , and also lengthy , that often users would take time to read and digest it . Maybe you should just look at conversion of new visitors into returning , and ensure that the "" tl ; dr "" audience is less . This reflects what I see in the marketplace . Businesses want outcomes but hire staff based on outputs . Econsultancy's list looks like an employment posting , just a long list of outputs . As long as the squirrels are managed by people that know the outcomes they 're after , is there a problem ? Greg : This is a real problem , as in it is real and it is a problem ! Part of the responsibility falls on the current leadership at companies ( in pretty much any country ) that do not truly value digital , and in turn have lax management of it relying on their gut or sub-optimal metrics . This sounds lame , it is 2016 after all . But , it is sadly true . Now you know where those job descriptions come from . Part of the responsibility , as I mentioned in # 3 in this post , falls on us , the data people . We spend so much time gathering data , conflate sexier javascript tags with accomplishment , and only have time left over to data puke . We have to change this , else the job descriptions wo n't change . We found that when trying to identify issues or areas of concerns , we wrote queries to identify the Top 25 Negative Noun Tokens in Sentences and include the related sentences after Natural Language Processing . We then grouped those sentences for tagging in an interactive tree ( tree of sentences ) . We were able to identify the top issues affecting consumers , very quickly ; because of the refined sample size ( Top 25 Tokens ) . We would repeat this effort with each week of new data ... slowly becoming the knowledge experts in the source domain . As the unique issues started to dry up we instituted a dynamic filtering system where every keyword in a sentence became a filter . We could shuffle the results with each click , spinning the results . We also implemented the ability to combine those keywords and flip them for even more complex dynamic filters . And then we also started an automatic favourite keyword identification system so that on subsequent weeks of results , I knew which keywords / favs were able to pull back the targeted results we were after . So for those looking to find the top negative issues , this may be a plan of attack in the identification of issues , something you could include in your own system or check out text-analyzer.com to see this in action . Hope this helps someone when the uniqueness in the results seems to dry up . Very thought-provoking ! The reporting vs. analysis issue clearly stands out as THE challenge at the company I work at , in terms of data use . The current trends of "" big data "" and "" lean analytics "" make this old issue very poignant . I wonder about your push for metamorphosing squirrels into ninjas . Is that a natural progression ? Is it the only progression ? The best progression ? You note the importance of posing the right questions the right way with the right people in survey development . Asking open-ended questions to develop the right survey response selections is just one example that highlights the importance of developing good tactical approaches when developing data . You nicely tie in the importance of strategic analysis – the ' why ' question in IABI , which provides fodder for hypothesis development in Lean Analytics . This is a call for thinking about analytics as an expression of human behavior , motivation , and thinking . Changing human behavior is the implicit outcome of all the data analysis , and I like how you draw these connections . I 'm a user experience researcher with a background in experimental psychology . I ca n't help but wonder if a reverse transition , from understanding human behavior into data analytics , could also work , and perhaps provide an even easier metamorphosis . If we place Analysis Ninja at the top of the value pyramid , then it will require a person who has one foot firmly planted in both data and human behavior . Michael : There are a lot of wonderful elements to your comment , thank you for sharing your thoughts . Let me touch on a couple . There is a difference between small and big companies . Small companies need someone as close to an Analysis Ninja as possible , and it would be great if the person can also operate machinery and do marketing . Small companies ca n't afford a lot . : ) Reporting Squirrels at small companies are actively harmful , not only can they drive little change , an investment in them might have an expensive opportunity cost . In big companies , you will , for the next five years or so , need Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Part of the need for Reporting Squirrels is being driven by the fact that big companies simply can not do without the silly charade of data being puked left , right and center . Part of it is that there are some orgs where super-tactical decisions can be made by people in the division , and they just need CDPs more efficiently delivered . More companies are realizing they need Analysis Ninajs because efficient , real-time CDPs are simply not working . From Reporting Squirrel to an Analysis Ninja is not a natural progression . It happens 20 % of the time , but analytical skills are so different than what reporting jobs mandate . It is important to note that Reporting Squirrel is a well paid job , and for many they like the comfort of what the job demands are . Hence , it is a fabulous job if it fits your personality profile , skills and professional goals . To your note on users ... I believe , most especially for digital , we have access to so much quant and qual human behavior data , skills in User Experience Research ( UCD , HCI etc. ) would be immensely valuable to an Analysis Ninja . A lot of market-researchers do not have much appreciation for customer behavior methods , and they end up becoming askers-pukers . A smart marketer at times may not even need too much data , but just some intelligent customer behavior analysis methods and hypotheses to come up insights that will win the game for her ."

1605	"( INDIANAPOLIS – APRIL 16 , 2010 ) – Ash continues to cause disruption and travel chaos through many major European cities following the volcanic activity in Iceland . Additionally , the European air navigation agency stated that the air traffic delays will continue well into Saturday . iTravelInsured ® , Inc. ( iTI ® ) , a travel insurance provider and program manager , has been assisting several of its customers troubled and affected by the delays . "" We have received many calls from concerned customers that are stuck as a result of this massive volcanic cloud of ash , "" said Bill Dismore , Executive Vice President of iTI . "" The volcano is a Natural Disaster and under an iTI program , if there is a complete cessation of services by a travel supplier ( this includes an airline ) as a result of a Natural Disaster , then coverage is provided for trip cancellation \ interruption . Travel delay also provides a daily benefit for each 24 hour period the trip is delayed due to bad weather ( for which the volcano also would qualify ) . "" The World Health Organization stated that Europeans should remain indoors if ash from the volcano starts raining down . According to the agency , there could be ( although not certain ) potential health risks should this happen – inhaled particles could create a heightened danger from those suffering from respiratory diseases . Dismore further added , "" A volcanic eruption is a pretty rare event , but you just do n't know what can happen when you are traveling . By offering programs that safeguard their clients' travels , and provide them access to top-tier services and a 24 hour clinical staff experienced in medical management , travel agents can easily help their clients plan for an unexpected illness or injury , and provide peace of mind .

619	Hi , I 've been bisexual for ... at least since I was 11 , although I did n't realise at the time . As time went by I started to realise what I really was . At first I was scared but then I came to realise that it did n't really single me out or make me that much different from everyone else . I came out in 2005 , a day after my birthday ( so my mum could n't shout at me : P ) and at first she could n't look me in the eye but then got used to the idea and now she is fine with it . My closest two friends know as well , one of whom is bi himself , and they are both fine with it too . I 've not made it public because I go to a chav school and will get verbally abused lol . When I go to college I probably will though .	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
938	"The man found himself surrounded by total darkness , as if one moment he saw light , blinked , and it was gone . "" Am I blind ! "" he cried . He rubbed his eyes . He could not feel anything . He tried rubbing them again . Nothing . "" Is anyone there ? "" he shouted . He repeated himself , though this time he noticed that he could not hear his own voice . He could not even feel the vibrations in his throat or his lips moving . He only knew that he had willed the words only moments before . However , between then and now an eternity existed between his thoughts and their execution . His lips began to quiver , or , rather , the thought of his lips quivering sprang from the wellsprings of imagination . "" Am I deaf ? "" "" Why ca n't I feel vibrations in my throat ? "" "" Am I drugged ? "" "" Am I in a coma ? "" "" Am I dead ? "" "" Is this hell ? "" He slowly stretched out one hand , palm facing out . He waved it and did the same with the other . He began making large circles with his arms as he swept round his perimeter . He felt nothing . He stomped down , hoping to feel earth , wooden planks , carpet , cement , water , anything , so that he could get some bearing as to where he was . He felt nothing . At the same time , he noticed that he could not feel his limbs or movements therewith . "" Am I paralyzed ? "" He cried out in utter silence all the while the words banged around inside the confines of his mind , becoming louder and louder as words clawed over one another , vying for existence . "" Am I suspended in the air ? "" He cupped his hands and clapped at his shoulders . He could not feel anything . He could not even feel his shoulders or the tightening of his hands or finger movement . Only the memory of the thought of moving his limbs existed . He even began doubting whether his memory was of a thought or of an action . "" If I remember doing it , I must have done it , right ? "" he thought . "" Or did I only think about doing it ? Oh God , why ca n't I tell the difference ? "" "" Am I crazy ? What if the memory itself is an illusion ? Perhaps , there was no action and no idea of the action . The memory is a total fabrication . Reality could reset every moment without my knowing it . There ca n't be time then . I ca n't have a past ! How can I exist outside of time ! "" He pondered an eternity . "" If I do n't have eyes , ears , a body , whose voice is this talking ? Are these my words or is someone or something feeding me these ? Who or what is observing my thoughts ? Is there anyone there ? Oh God , is there anyone there ? Can anyone see me ? Can you hear me ? Is anyone there ... "" Panic set in again for the infinite time . He began flailing his arms and legs about , as if he were treading water in the middle of the ocean and had but only one last surge of energy before collapsing and sinking again into the abyss ."

1218	"Landslide ' buried woman as she slept ' in Looe A neighbour of a woman who died when a landslide engulfed her home , has told an inquest he had to clamber over a torrent of mud and water to escape . Susan Norman , 68 , died in March 2013 when the landslide , during torrential rain , poured into her flat in Looe , Cornwall , burying her in her bed . A post-mortem report read to the jury at Truro Magistrates' Court said Mrs Norman died immediately . The inquest is expected to last until 24 November . More on the landslide inquest and other news from Cornwall Mrs Norman lived in the ground-floor flat of a house split into three apartments . It was built into the hillside with a retaining wall behind the property . The jury also heard building work had taken place to the rear of the property before the incident . Dwayne Bown , who was asleep in one of the first floor flats , said he initially thought a tree behind the house had fallen down before the house jolted and the ground dropped in front of him . "" I then saw mud and water coming down into the landing as I was trying to get out ; the entrance was blocked completely and I had to climb over dirt and water and mud to get out , "" he said . In the weeks before the landslide , the court heard a bulge had formed in the wall behind the house . Rowan Beckingham , who lived in the other first-floor flat , said in the days prior to the landslide the landlady had told him she was commissioning repairs to the wall to the rear of the property . He said he had subsequently witnessed builders "" digging a hole in the cliff behind the house and pumping concrete into it "" ."	News	News
1304	"The DLR successfuly deployed a 20m2 sail structure in December of 1999 , a ground-based demonstrator that consisted of four booms made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic . In August of 2000 , DLR proposed a dedicated mission to explore near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) using a solar sail-driven spacecraft called ENEAS . The mission concept was to rendezvous with an object called 1996FG3 with a payload ( not counting the sail assembly ) of 75kg . Such proposals run into financial difficulties familiar to anyone who recalls NASA's early solar sail work for a Halley's Comet mission that never flew . Tight budgets have kept ambitious sail missions on the ground both within ESA and NASA , but concepts continue to multiply . A new paper by Bernd Dachwald and Wolfgang Seboldt at DLR proposes a mission called ENEAS-SR , a 70m2 sail designed to return a sample from NEA 1996FG3 within ten years of launch , carrying a 300 kg payload including lander and sample return capsule . Why , other than to shake out a new technology , should we go to a near-Earth asteroid ? In addition to pure science , NEAs are significant because they are probably fragments of main belt asteroids , and therefore representative of them . The larger class that contains them is the group called NEOs , those asteroids and comets with orbits that intersect or pass near the Earth's orbit . We need , say Dachwald and Seboldt , to know much more about them . From the paper : It is today widely accepted that NEO impacts have caused at least one mass extinction ( 65 million years ago at the Cretaceous / Tertiary boundary ) , and they are suspected to have caused several global catastrophes before . Even NEOs that do not intersect the orbit of Earth may evolve into Earth-crossers , because their orbits are chaotic , having a relatively short dynamical lifetime of about 107 years . One day , it will become necessary to prevent a specific object from impacting the Earth by nudging it out of its orbit . To be able to do this , the bulk properties of NEOs ( material strengths , composition , structure , moments of inertia , etc. ) should be determined as soon as possible . Solar sails seem ideal for this purpose . Once at NEA 1996FG3 , the sail-driven craft can take advantage of its sail in novel ways . Even close in to such a small object , the solar radiation pressure on the sail would exceed the asteroid's gravitational pull ; the spacecraft would therefore be placed into a hovering position in the hemisphere opposite the Sun ( the sail can be turned to vary the photon pressure upon it , making this possible ) . Although ultimately unstable , these hovering positions could be maintained for extended periods of time , long enough for the release of the lander and its Earth return capsule . Dachwald and Seboldt go on to envision an even more sophisticated triple NEA rendezvous mission with a 75kg payload and speculate on the properties of sails up to 140m2 in size . Missions like these make outstanding sense – they take us to objects like NEOs with highly inclined orbits , the kind of target difficult to reach with conventional spacecraft , and they allow us to develop space experience with lightweight structures for future propulsion systems . The paper is "" Multiple near-Earth asteroid rendezvous and sample return using first generation solar sailcraft , "" in Acta Astronautica 57 ( 2005 ) , pp. 865-875 . If we find et we can transmit the technology for beamed power propulsion to them , and then both civilizations can build the the interstellar equivelent of the train and the rail road on rails of light . tim"	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

This includes woodland . There is an access code that helps define access rights for users and land managers , all explained in detail on the outdoor access web site . However although people have a right of responsible access to all woodland areas in Scotland this does not mean that there will be an obvious entrance , paths or other access facilities available nor that the woodland condition and environment will make people feel welcome . For this reason the Woodland Trust Scotland and Forestry Commission Scotland have formed an agreed definition of accessible woodland for the Scottish context .

80	"Welcome to the Goal . com 50 ! In this special series , Goal . com editors worldwide vote for the top 50 players of 2010-11 . We count down to the announcement of the winner on August 22 with profiles of each and every player who made it into the top 50 ... Do n't Miss Goal . com 50 : Xavi ( 3 ) Goal . com 50 : Andres Iniesta ( 4 ) Goal . com 50 : Radamel Falcao ( 5 ) Goal . com 50 : Nemanja Vidic ( 6 ) On Wednesday night , Lionel Messi produced one of the finest individual performances seen on a football field in recent memory . Two fantastic goals and one quite wonderful assist swung a captivating Clasico against Real Madrid in Barcelona's favour . And yet , after the game , nobody was talking about the Argentine forward . There were other talking points , of course . There was Marcelo's foul on Cesc Fabregas , Jose Mourinho poking Barca assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye , David Villa's slap on Mesut Ozil and a whole host of other ill-tempered incidents , not to mention an epic encounter between two superb sides . Nevertheless , Messi's masterclass had been the difference between a magnificent Madrid and a Barca team struggling to keep the pace with their biggest rivals . Having netted a vital goal in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu , Leo won the return almost single-handedly . It was a performance worthy of acclaim and accolades aplenty , of extreme eulogy . Quite simply , though , there is now little left to say about Messi's magic and marvel . As Pep Guardiola has oft opined : "" We are running out of words to describe Leo . "" Indeed , decisive displays have become the norm when it comes to this exceptional young man ; peerless performances are not only hoped for by Barcelona players and their fans , but expected . "" There are no words to describe Messi . You have to see it - it is something you can not describe because you have to see it to believe it . "" - Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola The Camp Nou crowds have become accustomed to special stars . Diego Maradona , Johan Cruyff , Ronaldo , Rivaldo and Romario have all graced the turf at Barca's famous old stadium . But none have done so quite as brilliantly – or consistently – as Messi . The new season has barely begun and Leo already has three goals in two games , having only just returned from his holidays – and a disappointing Copa America campaign with Argentina – ahead of the Supercopa's first leg in Madrid . Last term , he hit 53 in just 55 games , racking up an incredible 24 assists along the way . MOMENT OF THE SEASON CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL L1 REAL MADRID 0-2 BARCELONA Just as he did in last week's Spanish Supercopa , Messi proved the difference between Barca and Madrid as he decided this tie with a brilliant brace at the Bernabeu , including a stunning second which saw him beat no less than four Real players on a trademark slalom run towards goal and angled finish past Iker Casillas . Messi missed out as Barca began the 2010-11 campaign with a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the Supercopa in Seville , having been away on international duty earlier in the week . Back for the Camp Nou clash , however , the Argentine blew away the Andalusians with a brilliant hat-trick to ensure Barca started the season as they have become accostumed of late – by winning trophies . Leo then took just three minutes to make his mark in La Liga , netting his side 's first of the campaign in a 3-0 win at Racing Santander . Be it Supercopa , Liga , Copa del Rey or Champions League , Messi made his mark . A brilliant brace against Panathinaikos was accompanied by two assists and the Argentine came within a whisker of his hat-trick , rattling the woodwork on two occasions . A treble did come in a 5-0 thrashing of Betis in the Copa del Rey , though , while another arrived in the historic 8-0 humiliation of Almeria . Those were part of the forward's most prolific scoring run as he netted in nine consecutive games . He was unable to make it a perfect 10 in his side's next fixture , but will hardly have cared as the Catalans trounced Real Madrid 5-0 . In that match , Messi demonstrated to the watching world just how much of a complete player he has become . There were no goals , nor mazy runs , but two glorious assists for Villa and a breathtaking display of pressure and passing to inflict upon Mourinho his worst ever result as coach . The goals continued to fly in after that , with two more at Osasuna and another brace against Real Sociedad , capping a sensational 2010 as he beat off team-mates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to the Fifa Ballon d ' Or. But he would be even more decisive in 2011 . When Barca were in need of inspiration , there was Messi to provide it . Two goals , including a sensational strike to open the scoring , saw the Catalan club overcome a 2-1 first-leg deficit in the last 16 of the Champions League against Arsenal , while a hat-trick against Atletico Madrid saw the Catalans achieve a 16th successive victory , breaking a record held by Alfredo Di Stefano's brilliant Real side of the 1960s . He also bagged the only goal of the game in a vital league win at Valencia and surpassed his previous mark of 47 goals – which he had tied with Ronaldo the season before – with another strike in the Champions League quarter-final against Shakhtar Donetsk . The best , however , was yet to come . After the disappointment of losing the final of the Copa del Rey to Madrid , Messi soon erased the pain with both goals – including a stunning second – as Guardiola's side erased memories of that defeat with a 2-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu , which sealed their passage - following a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou in the second leg - to the European showpiece against Manchester United at Wembley . "" While Ronaldo remains selfish at times , Leo's decision-making is impeccable ; he knows when to shoot , when to pass and even when to return , conserving his energies for quick , intuitive bursts and sprints . The results are often devastasting . "" For the second time in three years , Barca and United squared up in the final . And Messi , who had converted with a superb header in a 2-0 win in 2009 , beat Edwin Van der Sar this time with a thunderous left-footed drive which gave the Dutch keeper no time to react on its way in from outside the box . It turned out to be the game-winning goal and was a fitting end to a fairytale season for Barca's talisman . His 53 strikes saw him tied with Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of the campaign , but while both players were lauded for their sensational scoring form , Messi's were more often decisive . The Argentine's assist total also shows he provided more than the Portuguese . While Ronaldo remains selfish at times , Leo's decision-making is impeccable ; he knows when to shoot , when to pass and even when to run , conserving his energies for quick , intuitive bursts and sprints . The results are often devastating : Lionel Andres Messi is the best player in the world's best team , still the finest footballer on the planet and our overwhelming choice as Goal . com's prime performer from the last 12 months . With few adjectives left to describe his talents , perhaps the title of the Tina Turner track that blasts out of the tannoys before Barca's matches at Camp Nou is all that is required . Goal . com 50's worthy winner , Lionel Messi : Simply The Best ."	News	News

1562	"Prospecting for Life Insurance Clients in the 21st Century Internet Leads vs Direct Fifty years ago the world was "" larger , "" the pace of daily life slower , and the competition for insurance within any single community much less intense than it is today . Today it is almost impossible to knock on a door , unexpected , and find a receptive audience . The previous generation of insurance agents was able to prepare an audience with the use of mass market mail campaigns followed up by phone calls and then a visit . sign up for internet insurance leads "" Mass marketing , however , has been intensely overplayed ; many people – too busy to read the many brochures , catalogs , and solicitations that arrive in their mail boxes – simply sort the "" junk "" from the bills and then pile the junk mail off to the side where it accumulates until finally it is tossed in the trash . Only a tiny percentage of mass market mail is read . In fact , one of the managers at a local recycling center reports that tons of "" garbage "" sorted at the facility is junk mail – much of which has never even been opened ! Many insurance companies try to "" incentify "" people into responding to a mailer by promising something free if they return the postage paid card . Often the "" freebie "" is a booklet promising information – such as a buyers guide for life insurance , a booklet explaining Medicare and so forth . Believing that they will just get a free booklet in the mail , individuals write their names on such cards and drop them in the mailbox . In spite of the fact that the "" small print "" explains that the card is a solicitation for some product , and that an agent will call , individuals are often irritated when an agent calls and asks to "" deliver "" the requested information . This strategy is old and outdated . Furthermore , those who sent in the card thinking they would get something for free are often not financially qualified to purchase anything . Is there still a place for mail campaigns ? Absolutely . However , mail campaigns are more likely to be effective when the recipients are "" targeted , "" not just by age and generic interest , but when they are targeted specifically by the agent whose name they are likely to recognize on the envelope . For example , if you have been the guest speaker for a group of retirees at a local church or civic club , a follow up mailer might be opened , and if the individual recalls that your service might benefit him , he might be receptive to an appointment when you call . Do n't wait by the phone , however – he usually wo n't call you first . Another positive use of a mail campaign is to your book of existing clients . These folks have already trusted you with their money . They will recognize your name and , if you send them something in a personal envelope – rather than a pre-addressed company one – they will definitely open it . Furthermore , since insurance agents are often "" recycled "" faster than fast-food restaurant employees , your people will appreciate knowing that you are still around . You should send a card , a "" personal "" letter or a newsletter created by you at least once a quarter . If you can do it monthly , that 's even better . You may think that since the client already has your information , it 's unlikely that you will gain any new business , but you could not be more mistaken . Experienced agents know that the larger policies – such as annuities and large life insurance or long term care policies – are often purchased by clients who already know you . Furthermore , "" stuff "" happens . A family member dies who did n't have insurance . Health insurance policies held by employers get cancelled . People retire and have to roll their money out of the company . A simple reminder that you are still available along with a convenient list of products you have will bring your name to the forefront when a life changing event takes place . For obtaining new clients , however , "" cold call "" mail campaigns are a huge waste of your money . Today's insurance agents must face the fact that the world and the business has been dramatically changed by technology . It 's a fact that the world is less friendly , people less patient with lengthy presentations and more likely to switch from one company to another in search of the best deal . You ca n't succeed with mail campaigns , cold calls , and door knocking . You also ca n't fight the impact of technology . The only way to cope is to make the technology work for you . Participation in an internet lead generation program is regarded by many agents and brokers as the most effective way to locate new , and interested prospects . Life changing events – a death in the family , a marriage , or a birth of new baby motivate people to search for a product . They want quotes and comparisons quickly , preferably without having to talk to anyone , even though most will work with an agent once they have made a company or product selection . Like insurance companies , lead generation companies are not all created equal . A good lead generation company will : deliver real time leads within minutes of receiving them deliver leads that have been generated from their own sites – not recycled or purchased from "" dump "" sites provide filters so you receive leads only from prospects you would be able to serve Purchasing leads via the internet is only the first step in a successful use of technology . Agents and brokers also need their own websites where they can describe their services , provide information on changes in the insurance industry , and perhaps even maintain a blog or guestbook where clients can communicate with each other and with their agents . When we have done a job a certain way for a long time , it is difficult to change . However , the bottom line in the insurance industry is that agents must meet clients where the clients are , and today , that is "" online . """	Instruction	Instruction

Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol ( # ) * S1M-2404 # Iain Smith : Strategic Planning in Fife-That the Parliament notes the strong opposition from Fife Council , residents and community councils in Fife to the proposals contained in the Scottish Executive's consultation document Review of Strategic Planning which would split Fife for strategic planning purposes between the cities of Dundee and Edinburgh ; further notes that Fife Council is the only local authority area proposed to be split for strategic planning purposes ; recognises that Fife Council shares boundaries with other major public sector agencies such as Scottish Enterprise Fife , NHS Fife and Fife Tourist board which , together with its unique geography , make Fife ideally suited for strategic planing as a single unit , and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its proposals in the light of the consultation and retain Fife as a single strategic planning area .

1537	"When it comes to choosing a solar panel , electricians may base their decision on nominal efficiency factors or the price per Watt peak . These are of course two important criteria – but , from a long-term perspective , simply not enough . After all , solar installations must last for 25 years . And they will , provided they are installed correctly and are of good quality . But how do you actually recognise good quality in a solar panel ? For Conergy Australia general manager David McCallum , such panels must fulfil three criteria : they must be high-yield , solid and safe . Efficiency delivers high-yield The solar cells themselves are responsible for the yield factor . Innovative cell designs can deliver efficiencies of 16 % to 23 % , depending on material and processing effort . The market is currently dominated by cells with two metallic collector contacts on the upper side – ' busbars ' . Some manufacturers print three busbars instead of two onto their solar panels to allow for more efficient dissipation of the generated power . David says there are definite benefits in improved power distribution . "" Three busbars help to reduce contact resistance between the cells . The result is increased and more consistent module efficiency . "" He also believes that combined with suitable cell connectors , the use of three busbars provides more reliability in terms of power generation . David and his colleagues also favour bypass diodes when it comes to module manufacturing . "" They function like a protection switch for the cells . If , for example , foliage should shade individual cells , the bypass diodes will channel away power , thus protecting the shaded cells , "" he explains . "" Once sunlight is no longer impeded , the bypass diodes switch back to their original mode , and the module will once again work at full capacity . "" High-quality components provide stability Even the highest yield is of little use if the module does n't last for its projected 25-year lifespan . The production process must lead the way into the right direction . Premium quality components , like specialist solar glass and a robust frame , provide the necessary protection for the fragile cells . But even for solar glass , the choice is endless : smooth , unstructured , micro-structured , heavily structured or even specially coated glass is on offer . Each and every glass type is designed to conduct as much sunlight as possible into the solar module . "" Heavily structured glass types tend to attract contaminants , which over time will lead to a decrease in the module's capacity , "" David explains . "" The module frame stabilises the solar module , and protects both the glass and the cells . The most robust frames are those made from anodised aluminium . They are much more scratch-resistant than coated frames . "" David also warns about possible hazards due to hollow enclosures . "" Frames should not have any hollow enclosures , as these could collect water , which can then turn to ice in the winter in Australia's cooler climates . As a result , the frame could buckle or even burst . "" In summer , contaminants like pollen or dust will find no adhesion , which means that moss growth can be avoided . Contaminants of that type can be particularly critical , as they will permanently shade cells , which will result in a significant loss in module capacity – and in consequence in output of the entire solar installation . The safety aspect is one of the most important criteria to bear in mind when shopping around for solar modules . David therefore advises electricians to pay particularly close attention to the junction box . Faulty construction or poor workmanship can , under certain circumstances , create a fire hazard for the entire solar plant . "" I generally advise against clamp , plug or screw connections . These could easily come undone or corrode if installed improperly . The resulting arc could cause the junction box to catch fire . "" Instead , he recommends molded junction boxes made from non-flammable plastic with soldered connections . These are moisture-protected and vacuum-sealed , providing maximum safety . Solar module manufacturers offer many safety options : warranties , certifications and positive capacity tolerances . The actual scope of services provided is determined individually by each manufacturer . A warranty period of five years for solar modules should be the absolute minimum offered . "" If the solar modules will be deployed in regions with severe weather conditions , electricians should look for additional certifications , like ammonia resistance , or for special certifications regarding corrosion-resistance if the solar modules will be installed in coastal regions .

1386	"Here 's a quick & dirty of the ' trouble ' currently plaguing Paula Deen . A former employee of Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers filed a lawsuit against them , citing both sexual and racial discrimination . At the forefront of the allegations were Deen's own racist remarks and her usage of the "" n-word . "" During her deposition , Deen admitted that she had used the word before on several occasions . She insisted that neither she nor her family were racist or stereotyped or discriminated against any race or gender . But the racially-charged language she readily used ( and admitted to ) suggested something entirely different . During her deposition she even admitted to planning an old fashioned southern event , complete with a black-only staff of servants . She stated that she decided against the party because of the obvious backlash and public relations problems that would have obviously resulted from it . Once all this information became public , people began to come out of the woodwork to condemn Deen , her show , and her apparently racist position . She immediately released a video apology that appeared rushed , forced , half-hearted , and disingenuous . She later released a second apology which brought a similar amount of ire . Most opponents claimed that Deen did n't mean what she was saying when she apologized and that she was forced into it to try and save face . But unfortunately for Paula Deen , her apologies most definitely did not save face . Funny thing – in show business today , most people do n't take too kindly to racism . In the wake of this sensation , the Food Network decided against renewing Deen's contract ( which expired yesterday ) . And many of her other publishers and networks have followed suit . As mentioned already , Deen's publisher has dropped her for the upcoming release of her cookbook . As an ABC News report describes , her networks and agencies dropping her include the following : Smithfield Pork : An international distributor of all sorts of pork products Wal-Mart : Wal-Mart has decided against ordering any new Paula Deen based products in the wake of this news . Target : Target stores will also be phasing out all Paula Deen merchandise from their retail outlets and online stores . Home Depot : Home Depot also announced that they were cutting ties with Deen and no longer carrying her cookware and other merchandise . Novo Nordisk : The manufacturer of Type 2 Diabetes drugs , Novo Nordisk had Deen as a spokeswoman when she revealed she was suffering with the disease . She 'll suspend operations as a spokeswoman to focus her efforts on her current debacle . Caesars Entertainment : This company had used Deen's name in a variety of restaurants in several places on the east side of the country . They plan to re-brand the restaurants and phase out Deen's name altogether . QVC : QVC is suspending sales of Deen-related merchandise , although they claim the severing of sales is only temporary . J.C. Penney : Based on all the bad press , J.C. Penney will be phasing out all Deen merchandise from their stores . Sears and Kmart : Both stores also decided to abandon the Paula Deen ship due to all the negative press . Walgreens : All Deen-branded food products will be slowly phased out and no longer reordered for this pharmacy chain . With a list this expansive , can you say witch hunt ? Poor Paula is lucky she was n't cast out of the country and placed into exile for her misdeeds . But the truth here is pretty apparent : no company wants to keep themselves linked to something when it stinks . And the current situation with Paula Deen definitely stinks . A Look on the Other Side Let 's take a moment to play devil's advocate and argue in defense of Deen . Think about her background and her upbringing . She was born in the 1940s in the south . She came from a fairly lucrative family background of rich , white southern blood . It 's no surprise that language like this was common for her in her upbringing . In her deposition , you ca n't fault Paula Deen for being completely open and honest about her misstep . She was willing to admit that yes , she has used the racial slur before . She admitted that she had probably used it several times , too . That sort of honesty is uncommon for someone in a position like Deen's . At least you can commend her for that . But you ca n't commend her for allowing that racism and that type of language to continue long after her southern youth . The suit alleging her discrimination came long after she had come into celebrity prominence . If she was indeed non-discriminatory toward any race or gender , then why was this sort of conduct continuing to occur ? There 's no explanation that could justify the use of racist language for any reason . Unfortunately for her , Deen is paying dearly for her mistakes . Her entire empire is crumbling before her ( at an extremely rapid rate , too ) . She 's losing traction in all the areas that have made her a fortune and a celebrity . And all of this is because of actions she has taken – and has continued to take – even though she asserts she was n't racist and did n't discriminate . As unfortunately as the situation is for her , there 's no one Deen can blame but herself ."	News	News
1647	"Great Famine , also called Irish Potato Famine , Great Irish Famine , or Famine of 1845 – 49 , famine that occurred in Ireland in 1845 – 49 when the potato crop failed in successive years . The crop failures were caused by late blight , a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots , or tubers , of the potato plant . The causative agent of late blight is the water mold Phytophthora infestans . The Irish famine was the worst to occur in Europe in the 19th century . Famine ( 1997 ) , commemorating the Great Famine , sculpture by Rowan ... In the early 19th century , Ireland's tenant farmers as a class , especially in the west of Ireland , struggled both to provide for themselves and to supply the British market with cereal crops . Many farmers had long existed at virtually the subsistence level , given the small size of their allotments and the various hardships that the land presented for farming in some regions . The potato , which had become a staple crop in Ireland by the 18th century , was appealing in that it was a hardy , nutritious , and calorie-dense crop and relatively easy to grow in the Irish soil . By the early 1840s almost half the Irish population – but primarily the rural poor – had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet . The rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities . A heavy reliance on just one or two high-yielding types of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease , and thus the Irish became vulnerable to famine . In 1845 a strain of Phytophthora arrived accidentally from North America , and that same year Ireland had unusually cool moist weather , in which the blight thrived . Much of that year's potato crop rotted in the fields . That partial crop failure was followed by more-devastating failures in 1846 – 49 , as each year's potato crop was almost completely ruined by the blight . Starving Irish people raiding a government potato store ; wood engraving from the ... The British government's efforts to relieve the famine were inadequate . Although Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel continued to allow the export of grain from Ireland to Great Britain , he did what he could to provide relief in 1845 and early 1846 . He authorized the import of corn ( maize ) from the United States , which helped avert some starvation . Under the Liberal ( Whig ) cabinet of Lord John Russell , which assumed power in June 1846 , the emphasis shifted to reliance on Irish resources and the free market , which made disaster inevitable . An overview of the Great Famine in Ireland . Much of the financial burden of providing for the starving Irish peasantry was thrown upon the Irish landowners themselves ( through local poor relief ) and British absentee landowners . Because the peasantry was unable to pay its rents , however , the landlords soon ran out of funds with which to support them , and the result was that hundreds of thousands of Irish tenant farmers and labourers were evicted during the years of the crisis . Under the terms of the harsh 1834 British Poor Law , enacted in 1838 in Ireland , the "" able-bodied "" indigent were sent to workhouses rather than being given famine relief per se . British assistance was limited to loans , helping to fund soup kitchens , and providing employment on road building and other public works . The Irish disliked the imported cornmeal , and reliance on it led to nutritional deficiencies . Despite those shortcomings , by August 1847 as many as three million people were receiving rations at soup kitchens . All in all , the British government spent about £ 8 million on relief , and some private relief funds were raised as well . The impoverished Irish peasantry , lacking the money to purchase the foods their farms produced , continued throughout the famine to export grain , meat , and other high-quality foods to Britain . The government's grudging and ineffective measures to relieve the famine's distress intensified the resentment of British rule among the Irish people . Similarly damaging was the attitude among many British intellectuals that the crisis was a predictable and not-unwelcome corrective to high birth rates in the preceding decades and perceived flaws , in their opinion , in the Irish national character . The famine proved to be a watershed in the demographic history of Ireland . As a direct consequence of the famine , Ireland's population of almost 8.4 million in 1844 had fallen to 6.6 million by 1851 . The number of agricultural labourers and smallholders in the western and southwestern counties underwent an especially drastic decline . A further aftereffect of the famine was thus the clearing of many smallholders from the land and the concentration of landownership in fewer hands . Thereafter , more land than before was used for grazing sheep and cattle , providing animal foods for export to Britain . Victims of the Irish Potato Famine arriving in Liverpool , Eng . ; illustration in the ... About one million people died from starvation or from typhus and other famine-related diseases . The number of Irish who emigrated during the famine may have reached two million . Ireland's population continued to decline in the following decades because of overseas emigration and lower birth rates . By the time Ireland achieved independence in 1921 , its population was barely half of what it had been in the early 1840s . Victims of Ireland's Great Famine ( 1845 – 49 ) immigrating to North America by ship ; wood ... Britannica Web sites The worst famine to occur in Europe in the 19th century was the Irish Potato Famine , which resulted in the deaths of about one million people . The famine is also called the Great Potato Famine or the Great Irish Famine . The potato was the staple food of Ireland at the time , with most of the population relying on it for much of their diet . Poor people who lived in rural areas tended to eat potatoes almost exclusively . From 1845 to 1849 a plant disease caused the potato crops in Ireland to fail , year after year . Without potatoes to eat , the people went hungry ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

1245	"Finding Your Next Superstar Although your admissions staff is likely complete at this point in the cycle , it 's never too early to start the search for new talent . How to spot the next superstar to bring in well-qualified students who will be retained and wo n't require heavy discounting to enroll ? One who will stay more than a year or two , wo n't experience premature burnout and has the potential to be promoted ? While your own student ambassadors and tour guides are an obvious starting point , beware of filling your permanent openings exclusively from their ranks . As a young alumnus , your current student guides will likely have only one institutional perspective , and that , from a student point of view . Can they adjust that focus to include the viewpoints of families and referral sources , as well ? One obvious danger of going directly from the classroom to an entry-level admissions office at the same college or university is that your new staffer will not know his or her "" subject "" well . As a student , his or her "" subject "" was English , or education , or business . Now , as an alumnus and novice admissions counselor , the subject to master is "" your institution . "" Can your new staffer transcend his or her personal student experiences to take a broader , objective view ? Finally , your new hire must be as proficient in knowing your competition as he or she is in your institution . They must not only be able to present a compelling "" 30-second elevator message "" about your own campus , but also need to know equally well the competitive advantages of competing colleges and universities . That 's why it is often advantageous to hire a graduate of an aspirational school . So , a word to the wise is , look beyond your own campus for new hires . The ideal candidate is someone who has mastered the "" s-w-o-t "" formula ( strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , threats ) of both your campus and that of at least one competing institution . This person might be an alumnus of your school who has gone on to graduate at a peer institution , or vice - versa . A third choice might be someone who , as a consultant or vendor , has worked with a number of similar colleges and universities , including your own . When looking for your next "" superstar , "" beware of candidates who say they want to enter the admissions profession because they "" love people . "" Obviously , you would not hire a candidate lacking in interpersonal skills . The challenge is that while a viable , long-term member of your team must enjoy working with a wide range of people , he or she must also possess many other equally important attributes , among them high energy , ability to manage details , a thick skin , perseverance in the face of frequent rejection and a strong work ethic . If your new hire offers the potential for promotion within your office , this individual will need to become conversant with market research , demographics and yes , with student financial aid formulas . That leads us to another peril of hiring young graduates who think of endless admissions travel as "" fun "" and "" exciting . "" As the novelty of the road inevitably begins to wear off , it 's vital to make sure that the candidate's expectations about the job are a good fit with the reality of the counselor's position . The former cheerleader and fraternity president may be great with people , but what about the myriad details that go with the position , the arranging of appointments , the prospect research , the follow-up , the transcript review ? Look for experience with task-oriented projects as well as those involving primarily social interaction . Because turnover is costly and detrimental to team building in your shop , how can you identify those who will stay beyond a year or two ? The reality is that the bright , promising young hires you seek are the same talented young graduates who will have many other options . But you can minimize turnover by giving them a reality check about the job , being honest and thorough in your job description and interview process . While there 's no magical formula , check the candidate's resume for continuity and commitment to one or more organizations during their college years . If the candidate played soccer and acted in the drama club all four years , that 's a better recommendation than one who lists a dozen short-term activities . Ask direct questions of references : Is this a candidate likely to stay more than a year or two ? Is he or she qualified for promotion ? How does he / she handle setbacks and details ? The admissions world is replete with successful directors , deans and vice presidents for enrollment who started as entry-level counselors . Likewise , it is full of former admissions staffers who , after an initial burst of enthusiasm , could not sustain any demonstrable success . By incorporating these suggestions into your hiring plan , you can maximize your chances of finding the former and minimize the odds of recruiting the latter . 2 Comments"	Instruction	Instruction
1187	Dear Ms. Blacksmith , Did you know that in Genovia : · Only 33 % of kids get to see the inside of a high school classroom ? · 56 % of kids will die from starvation or easily-curable diseases before they see adulthood ? · 98 % of the population is illiterate ?

1670	"Wipeout Pulse ( stylised as wipEout pulse ) is a futuristic racing video game developed by SCE Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable . It was first released in December 2007 in Australia and Europe , and in February 2008 in North America . A PlayStation 2 port was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009 . The game is the seventh instalment of the Wipeout series and serves as a sequel to Wipeout Pure . It takes place in 2198 and revolves around players competing in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league . The game was developed by Sony Studio Liverpool . Production was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans regarding Wipeout Pure , and improving on aspects where the development team thought they had failed in with the predecessor . The game features sixteen licensed music tracks from techno artists , including Kraftwerk . Wipeout Pulse received positive reviews upon release . Critics praised the graphics and presentation , although some criticised the repetitiveness and hard difficulty . From left to right clockwise , the interface displays the number of laps , the teams of competing players , speedometer , shield strength , current playing song , and lap time . Wipeout Pulse is a racing game set in 2198 , one year after the events of Wipeout Pure . As with its predecessor , the game revolves around players competing in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league . Players pilot anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations ( collectively refereed to as "" teams "" in-game ) . There are ten teams in Wipeout Pulse , with one ship available for each – although the player will have the ability to upgrade and change the appearance of their ships . Each ship has different characteristics ; depending on the team chosen , its ship will vary in terms of handling , speed , acceleration and shield strength . Every ship is equipped with an energy shield which will protect the player from damage sustained from weapons fire or colliding with walls , although energy is taken away if this happens . If the shield completely runs out , the ship will explode and the player will be eliminated from the race . In addition , the player's ship is equipped with air brakes which can be used for manoeuvring through difficult corners at high speed . The game features a number of weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence . Defensive weapons range from shields – which make the player's ship invulnerable to damage for a short period – to land mines and stationary bombs . Offensive weaponry vary from machine guns , missiles , plasma bolts , and a "" quake "" – which comes in the form of a devastating earthquake that will damage all opponents . The campaign mode features sixteen grids divided into cells , each containing a separate event which will vary from ordinary races to tournaments . Once the player finishes the event in a single cell , they will earn "" completion points "" needed to progress to the next grid . Clearing a cell will unlock additional cells adjoining it . Returning game modes from Wipeout Pure includes single races , tournaments , time trials , and the "" Zone "" mode , which involves the player's ship automatically accelerating to extreme speeds . A returning game mode from Wipeout 3 is "" Elimination "" , which revolves around a group of competitors attempting to destroy each other the quickest in a set amount of time . Wipeout Pulse was developed by Sony Studio Liverpool ( formerly known as Psygnosis ) . Colin Berry , the lead designer of the game , stated in an interview that the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure , and was willing to use parts of the feedback to "" help shape some elements of Pulse "" . According to Berry , some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult ; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence ( AI ) too advanced , whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted "" something more challenging to keep them coming back "" . The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition , which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure . In addition , the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time , in the event that they "" got stuck "" . Reflecting on this , Berry said : "" We want the people who buy it , to see all the game , we do not want to lock them out "" . During development , the team decided early on to focus on creating new content rather than bringing back old race tracks which were featured in previous Wipeout games . Berry , however , acknowledged that classic tracks "" went down well "" and sought out the possibility of introducing them through future downloadable content ( DLC ) . Berry stated that by the end of Wipeout Pure , Sony Studio Liverpool had designed almost 100 tracks as potentials to include in subsequent games , although the team were only satisfied with 32 of them . The remainder of the tracks were either disregarded or amalgamated into other games . Berry reflected that the tracks using the same 3D computer graphics software as its predecessor meant that certain repetition appeared and caused the team to "" dry up on ideas "" . The developers recognised that track design was an important aspect to the game , and also accepted the difficulty in designing a track that is both memorable and enjoyable . Berry felt concerned that the team were starting to repeat design features , and thus decided to create new variables to the track design : as a result of this , the team conceptualised the "" mag strip "" – a section of a track which would feature artificial gravity so that a player could safely circumnavigate loops , steep slopes , and upside down sections . After the release of Wipeout Pure on the PlayStation Portable , rumours circulated that a port was in development for the PlayStation 2 . In January 2009 , Sony issued a statement saying : "" There are over 9.5 million PS2s in the UK and we will continue to support this large userbase with software on an ongoing basis "" . The PlayStation 2 version was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009 , featuring enhanced graphics and all of the DLC . The game also features sixteen licensed music tracks in addition to customisable soundtracks from techno artists , including Kraftwerk , DJ Fresh , and Skream . The game received positive reviews upon release . It holds an average score of 82 per cent at Metacritic , based on an aggregate of 40 reviews . Critics unanimously praised the game's visuals and presentation . Jeff Haynes of IGN stated that the game was "" Wipeout at its purest "" , praising the visual presentation of the courses , cities , and other environments . Gabe Graziani of GameSpy thought the graphics were beautiful and also commended the design of the tracks . Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone stated that Wipeout Pulse was a "" very visually pleasing game with some solid visual effects "" , and also praised the detailed tracks and ships . A reviewer from Game Revolution considered the game's level of detail to the tracks and smooth framerate to be "" staggering "" on a handheld . The reviewer also praised the "" meticulously constructed "" backdrops and "" incredibly styled "" presentation . Guy Cocker of GameSpot said that the visuals were "" superb "" , though he thought that many aspects were similar to its predecessor , Wipeout Pure . A reviewer from Edge described the visuals as "" even smoother , brighter , and sharper than Pure's "" . The various aspects of gameplay were mostly praised , although some reviewers criticised the game's repetitiveness and difficulty . Tom Bradwell from Eurogamer praised the new "" Elimination "" mode , stating that it was initially "" alarming "" and frustrating , but admitted that it "" grows to be rather good "" . Cocker enjoyed the new tracks , the difficulty levels , and the promise of downloadable content , although he noted that it had not been made available in the United States at the time of his review . Game Revolution's reviewer surmised that Wipeout Pulse was a more refined version of Wipeout Pure , stating that despite all of the solid and reliable gameplay , the game did not revolutionise the series . Regarding general gameplay , Zacarias opined that Wipeout Pulse "" does n't deliver "" despite the variety in the game modes and "" racetrack front "" . Haynes similarly gave a negative opinion on the gameplay , stating that the repetition of tracks and balance of weapons for the AI was disappointing . Graziani criticised the game's difficulty , saying that it was "" extremely challenging to the point of being impenetrable for the uninitiated "" . Edge ' s reviewer described the game as simply another instalment of Wipeout ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
772	Title of Research Survival strategies of bone and cartilage cells Summary of Research Skeletal cells use specialised mechanisms to survive disease , overuse , drug side-effects and ageing hormonal systems . Skeletal health and repair depends on replenishment of ageing cells from precursor stem cells , efficient function of mature cells and adequate life span . Current treatments such as corticosteroids , HRT , bisphosphonates , statins and intermittent PTH affect skeletal cells to different degrees at all of these levels . While much is known about the molecular players that control survival and death in the immune system , brain and in cancer cells , the skeleton remains under studied . This prevents improvements in drug design and hampers development of new therapeutic technologies such as tissue engineering and use of bone marrow stem cells . Promotion of survival of healthy bone cartilage is essential for retaining mobility in an ageing population . This study seeks to provide fundamental understanding of the strategies used by skeletal cells to survive , so that we can harness this knowledge to produce more effective drugs .

257	"Mark Wright is an accomplished writer "" currently scraping out a living as a freelance "" contributing to various magazines , writing for Big Finish's range of Doctor Who audio dramas and turning out the odd book along the way ( he 's currently planning to write a guide to the Indiana Jones adventures ) . OTT caught up with Mark as he battled with deadlines to complete his latest book , 1001 DVDs You Should Own , to ask him about his recent publication 24 : Season 2 : The Unofficial Guide , published by Contender Books . OTT : So , how come you did n't write the 24 book for Contender last year ? MARK WRIGHT : I first came to work for Contender when I was commissioned to write the production notes and booklet for the first box set of The Professionals on DVD . Lee Binding , who commissioned me for that work , recommended me to the company's book division when they were keen to do a guide to the first season of 24 . I was asked to write the book , but unfortunately in the time scale they wanted the finished manuscript , I was working on a Doctor Who script whilst still holding down a 9 - 5 job at What DVD , so it just was n ' t possible . This was a real shame , as books was a direction I really wanted to go in . Jim Sangster is a mate , and as he had written some highly successful episode guides himself , I happily recommended him . As it was , I was commissioned to write a guide to CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , so I got to do my book after all ( although that never saw the light of day for reasons I sha n ' t bore you with - but I 've got a fully typeset manuscript sitting on my desk ) . OTT : What was the brief this time around ? Were you looking to follow up on what Jim had done , or take a different direction for the second book ? MARK WRIGHT : When it came to season two , naturally Jim was the first choice to handle it , but he had just got a commission for the official Spooks book , so the project was handed to me . I had just gone freelance , so was incredibly keen . I wanted to keep intact a lot of what Jim had done with the first volume , but take some of the elements into a more humorous direction . The strength of the first book is the mini-essays that discuss a related theme from the episode in detail , and Jim is so good at doing those and basically , I 'm not , so I decided to lose that aspect and expand the categories of the guide . So we get analysis of Jack's character , and Kim's dumbness , and I went for sections like "" Fashion Police "" , that kind of thing . I also wanted some sort of episode review and rating system ( which also satisfies the legal angle of unofficial publishing of this nature ) , so hence the "" Debrief "" and "" Pulse Rate "" sections . OTT : What were the actual mechanics of writing the book ? MARK WRIGHT : I was commissioned to wrote the book in October , and had a delivery date of late May to tie in with the transmission of the final episode in the US . So , of course , I did n't start writing until April ! It was easy to write the up front sections as that was all to hand , researchable material like actor profiles and synopsis of the first season . I also had interviews with Dennis Haysbert and Leslie Hope from the publicity rounds for the first season DVD , so that really strengthened the front section . The most difficult thing to write was the actual synopsis of the episodes . The plots are so involved with 24 that you really have to include everything and that can take a couple of hours . It 's very dry writing , and you always wonder if you should be spicing it up with comments and off the cuff lines , but that would probably get in the way . Those are the sections that make the writing process arduous . The fun bits are the categories where you can actually be creative and put your own voice into the writing . I did drag my heels a little bit , so I think I 'd watched the first 10 episodes by the time I started writing . But that was a good idea as the general feel of the season was established by then , all the conventions and characters were in place , so I could work with running jokes by that point . I wrote the main block of the episode guide section at my parents ' in Yorkshire over Easter . I was house-sitting so I had the place to myself and just got my head down . At that stage I was doing around three episodes a day , which is about nine hours work . I ca n ' t really say how long the book took to write as I dragged my heels so much . Writers can probably get work done in half the time it actually takes them , but we wait until the last possible second before having to do it . There are far too many cups of tea , trips to the shop for a bun , computer-games to play and episodes of Doctors to watch before getting on with any work . OTT : Presumably you came to 24 series two with some preconceptions . What had you thought of the first series ? Were you a hardcore fan ? And what were your hopes for series two ? MARK WRIGHT : Like most people , I thought that season one was highly disjointed , however entertaining . That 's even more apparent when you watch the season back to back on DVD , which was my first experience of 24 . I actually interviewed Leslie Hope when I 'd seen just the first episode ! I would n ' t say I was a hardcore fan at this point . I thought the real-time aspect got in the way of good storytelling , especially when you watch in the UK and it blatantly is n't in real-time . But the performances were compelling all round , and TV is rarely this entertaining , which will always be 24 ' s virtue . The gimmick is secondary . OTT : How did you think series two compared to the first ? This time around the whole 24 episodes were plotted in advance - do you think that made a difference ? MARK WRIGHT : I thought it was much more polished and confident . There was an air of pushing the envelope a bit , of a team who 'd had chance to play and beat out the main points . At first I thought it was a mistake to detonate the bomb when they did , and was n ' t sure if they could pull the narrative back from such a high point of adrenaline . But then I realized that the final act was much more contemplative , having the courage to examine the ramifications of that event . OTT : What 's your take on the slightly gratuitous torture sequences this time around , and the continuing plot device of people being locked in rooms ? MARK WRIGHT : Anyone who has heard my Doctor Who plays will know that I 'm never averse to a bit of torture , but perhaps things were taken a little far . It 's a debate that could go on and on . There are bad people in the world who do bad things , and good people in the world who have to do bad things to bad people to get information . I think it 's well within Jack's character to act in the way he did towards Ali and Marie , and to have our central character die at the hands of torturers made for one of the best cliffhangers in that real adventure serial style . We know Jack will survive , but it 's damn exciting ! I do think that the torture and murder of Paul Koplin in front of Kate Warner was a bit much though , especially when the poor bloke had his old man chopped off . Now that was just cruel . As for the constant turnaround of people being locked in rooms , I think it 's good fun actually . It 's a convention of the series in the same way that running up and down corridors is part of Doctor Who and red shirts dying is part of Star Trek . I do think Palmer should have phoned out for pizza and watched a movie when he was locked up - that was a lovely widescreen TV he had in that room . OTT : Likewise , how do you view Kim's storylines ? An annoying distraction from the main plot , or a welcome second layer ? MARK WRIGHT : I 'm in two minds about this one . On the one hand , the constant need to have Kim in danger was a bit silly . But then there are moments when she absolutely breaks your heart . Her reaction to Jack's apparent sacrifice with the bomb was beautifully played by Elisha Cuthbert . I loved the plotline with Kevin Dillon as the loony survivalist , but I think all of Kim's adventures were justified in that one moment when she guns down Gary Matheson . Jack must force his daughter to become a killer , and it 's a wonderful character moment that really pays off . OTT : What do you think have been this year's stand-out moments ? Do they compare to the highpoints from series one ? MARK WRIGHT : George Mason was a joy throughout . I cried when he went down with the bomb . That was the best episode by far . The return of Nina Myers was handled well and I was a big fan of the team-up between Jack and Yusuf Auda . It was like a different show , and I suspect that might form something of a blueprint for season three . The cliffhanger ending felt too tacked on to be truly successful , but still fun , although you have to be a real fan to realize the connection back to season one . I had to look twice . I do n't think season one had that many standout moments , aside from Terri's death . I think the team wanted more "" events "" this time round , almost playing to the crowd a little too much , but I reckon they pulled it off . OTT : Earlier this year you guested on BBC3's 24 "" fanzine "" , Pure 24 . How was the experience of doing live TV ? Do the studio audience collectively watch the episode together as the show suggests ? And what 's your take on this kind of programme ? MARK WRIGHT : Pure 24 was a blast . I was very surprised to be on there , but it was great fun . At the end of the day , I 'm a hack , and then I 'm being flown to Manchester to do some telly . Very bizarre . I 've done TV and radio before from my days working on What DVD magazine so the live aspect was n ' t too daunting , and I love the atmosphere of a TV studio . The Pure 24 team are lovely , and everybody has a laugh . It was great being on that first show with Lennie James as I 'd seen him in so many things , and he gave me a couple of suggestions for the book , like the drinking game . All in all it was a great experience and one that I 'd love to do again . As far as I know the audience watch the episode together , but the couch guests are across the road discussing the episode with Zara the Assistant Producer . I think shows like this are good if the fan base is there , and 24 seems to have that kind of fan who do want to discuss the episode over the watercooler on Monday morning . Pure 24 sort of preempts that , and I tend to think if the BBC feel there 's an audience for shows like this , then why not ? It 's been successful enough to warrant a third series next year . OTT : How important do you think the real time format is to 24 ' s success ? MARK WRIGHT : I think it might become a hindrance for season three and get in the way of telling a good story . It was fine for the first two as it was almost believable , but I 'm not sure about it for season three . It was a great hook for the audience to begin with , but now we know the characters so well , do we really need it ? Having said that , take away the real-time aspect , and I guess you lose what makes the show so unique . OTT : Where next for the series ? Is there anything left for it to do ? MARK WRIGHT : I think we 'll get a more personal story for season three . You ca n ' t really get any bigger than a nuclear bomb going off , there 's nowhere else to go , unless you want to do 24 hours of an alien invasion ( now that might work ! ) I think we 'll see things much more from Jack's perspective , see him happier and back at work , maybe in the field . I would n ' t like to say if any of the hanging plot strands from season two will be picked up , but from what I 've been hearing it will take place a couple of years later during Palmer's campaign for re-election ( so it seems he survives ) . And as for Kim being gay ? I think that might be too many people listening to internet gossip ! WITH THANKS TO MARK WRIGHT"	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
917	"I have found that holy place of rest Still changeless .  – Mrs. Hemans – When Mr. Thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded by his baffled passion . He was as dizzy as if Margaret , instead of looking , and speaking , and moving like a tender graceful woman , had been a sturdy fish-wife , and given him a sound blow with her fists . He had positive bodily pain – a violent headache , and a throbbing intermittent pulse . He could not bear the noise , the garish light , the continued rumble and movement of the street . He called himself a fool for suffering so ; and yet he could not , at the moment , recollect the cause of his suffering , and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had produced . It would have been a relief to him , if he could have sat down and cried on a door-step by a little child , who was raging and storming , through his passionate tears , at some injury he had received . He said to himself , that he hated Margaret , but a wild , sharp sensation of love cleft his dull , thunderous feeling like lightning , even as he shaped the words expressive of hatred . His greatest comfort was in hugging his torment ; and in feeling , as he had indeed said to her , that though she might despise him , contemn him , treat him with her proud sovereign indifference , he did not change one whit . She could not make him change . He loved her , and would love her ; and defy her , and this miserable bodily pain . He stood still for a moment , to make this resolution firm and clear . There was an omnibus passing – going into the country ; the conductor thought he was wishing for a place , and stopped near the pavement . It was too much trouble to apologise and explain ; so he mounted upon it , and was borne away – past long rows of houses – then past detached villas with trim gardens , till they came to real country hedge-rows , and , by-and-by , to a small country town . Then every body got down ; and so did Mr. Thornton , and because they walked away he did so too . He went into the fields , walking briskly , because the sharp motion relieved his mind . He could remember all about it now ; the pitiful figure he must have cut ; the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in the world ; and had met with exactly the consequences which , in these wise moods , he had always fore-told were certain to follow , if he ever did make such a fool of himself . Was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes , that soft , half-open , sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder only yesterday ? He could not even shake off the recollection that she had been there ; that her arms had been round him , once – if never again . He only caught glimpses of her ; he did not understand her altogether . At one time she was so brave , and at another so timid ; now so tender , and then so haughty and regal-proud . And then he thought over every time he had ever seen her once again , by way of finally forgetting her . He saw her in every dress , in every mood , and did not know which became her best . Even this morning , how magnificent she had looked – her eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that , because she had shared his danger yesterday , she had cared for him the least ! If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning , as he assured himself at least twenty times he was , he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon . All that he gained in return for his sixpenny omnibus ride , was a more vivid conviction that there never was , never could be , any one like Margaret ; that she did not love him and never would ; but that she – no ! nor the whole world – should never hinder him from loving her . And so he returned to the little market-place , and remounted the omnibus to return to Milton . It was late in the afternoon when he was set down , near his warehouse . The accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of thought . He knew how much he had to do – more than his usual work , owing to the commotion of the day before . He had to see his brother magistrates ; he had to complete the arrangements , only half made in the morning , for the comfort and safety of his newly imported Irish hands ; he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the discontented work-people of Milton . Last of all , he had to go home and encounter his mother . Mrs. Thornton had sat in the dining-room all day , every moment expecting the news of her son's acceptance by Miss Hale . She had braced herself up many and many a time , at some sudden noise in the house ; had caught up the half-dropped work , and begun to ply her needle diligently , though through dimmed spectacles , and with an unsteady hand ! and many times had the door opened , and some indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand . Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray frost-bound expression , and the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency , so unusual to their sternness . She wrenched herself away from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought about to herself by her son's marriage ; she forced her thoughts into the accustomed household grooves . The newly-married couple-to-be would need fresh household stocks of linen ; and Mrs. Thornton had clothes-basket upon clothes-basket , full of table-cloths and napkins , brought in , and began to reckon up the store . There was some confusion between what was hers , and consequently marked G H T ( for George and Hannah Thornton ) , and what was her son's – bought with his money , marked with his initials . Some of those marked G H T were Dutch damask of the old kind , exquisitely fine ; none were like them now . Mrs. Thornton stood looking at them long – they had been her pride when she was first married . Then she knit her brows , and pinched and compressed her lips tight , and carefully unpicked the G H. She went so far as to search for the Turkey-red marking-thread to put in the new initials ; but it was all used – and she had no heart to send for any more just yet . So she looked fixedly at vacancy ; a series of visions passing before her , in all of which her son was the principal , the sole object – her son , her pride , her property . Still he did not come . Doubtless he was with Miss Hale . The new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his heart . A terrible pain – a pang of vain jealousy – shot through her : she hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental ; but it forced her to sit down . In a moment , she was up again as straight as ever – a grim smile upon her face for the first time that day , ready for the door opening , and the rejoicing triumphant one , who should never know the sore regret his mother felt at his marriage . In all this , there was little thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual . She was to be John's wife . To take Mrs. Thornton's place as mistress of the house , was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the supreme glory ; all household plenty and comfort , all purple and fine linen , honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , would all come as naturally as jewels on a king's robe , and be as little thought of for their separate value . To be chosen by John , would separate a kitchen-wench from the rest of the world . And Miss Hale was not so bad . If she had been a Milton lass , Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked her . She was pungent , and had taste , and spirit , and flavour in her . True , she was sadly prejudiced , and veryignorant ; but that was to be expected from her southern breeding . A strange sort of mortified comparison of Fanny with her , went on in Mrs. Thornton's mind ; and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter ; abused her roundly ; and then , as if by way of penance , she took up Henry's Commentaries , and tried to fix her attention on it , instead of pursuing the employment she took pride and pleasure in , and continuing her inspection of the table-linen . His step at last ! She heard him , even while she thought she was finishing a sentence ; while her eye did pass over it , and her memory could mechanically have repeated it word for word , she heard him come in at the hall-door . Her quickened sense could interpret every sound of motion : now he was at the hat-stand – now at the very room-door . Why did he pause ? Let her know the worst . Yet her head was down over the book ; she did not look up . He came close to the table , and stood still there , waiting till she should have finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her . By an effort she looked up . "" Well , John ? "" He knew what that little speech meant . But he had steeled himself . He longed to reply with a jest ; the bitterness of his heart could have uttered one , but his mother deserved better of him . He came round behind her , so that she could not see his looks , and , bending back her gray , stony face , he kissed it , murmuring : "" No one loves me – no one cares for me , but you , mother . "" He turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantel-piece , tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes . She stood up – she tottered . For the first time in her life , the strong woman tottered . She put her hands on his shoulders ; she was a tall woman . She looked into his face ; she made him look at her . "" Mother's love is given by God , John . It holds fast for ever and ever . A girl's love is like a puff of smoke – it changes with every wind . And she would not have you , my own lad , would not she ? "" She set her teeth ; she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth . He shook his head . "" I am not fit for her , mother ; I knew I was not . "" She ground out words between her closed teeth . He could not hear what she said ; but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curse – if not as coarsely worded , as fell in intent as ever was uttered . And yet her heart leapt up light , to know he was her own again . "" Mother ! "" said he , hurriedly , "" I can not hear a word against her . Spare me – spare me ! I am very weak in my sore heart ; – I love her yet ; I love her more than ever . "" "" And I hate her , "" said Mrs. Thornton , in a low fierce voice . "" I tried not to hate her , when she stood between you and me , because – I said to myself – she will make him happy ; and I would give my heart's blood to do that . But now , I hate her for your misery's sake . Yes , John , it 's no use hiding up your aching heart from me . I am the mother that bore you , and your sorrow is my agony ; and if you do n't hate her , I do . "" "" Then , mother , you make me love her more . She is unjustly treated by you , and I must make the balance even . But why do we talk of love or hatred ? She does not care for me , and that is enough – too much . Let us never name the subject again . It is the only thing you can do for me in the matter . Let us never name her . "" "" With all my heart . I only wish that she , and all belonging to her , were swept back to the place they came from . "" He stood still , gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer . Her dry dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him ; but she seemed just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke . "" Warrants are out against three men for conspiracy , mother . The riot yesterday helped to knock up the strike . "" And Margaret's name was no more mentioned between Mrs. Thornton and her son . They fell back into their usual mode of talk – about facts , not opinions , far less feelings . Their voices and tones were calm and cold a stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations ."

1638	Anselm Bourke Mgr Anselm Bourke , born Nicholas Bourke , ( Dublin , 10 September 1835 – West Perth , 2 June 1924 ) was a Roman Catholic priest of Irish origins . He was prominent in Catholic education for several decades , and also founded the West Perth ( now Northbridge ) parish of the Church in 1901 . He made his profession as a Benedictine monk in 1858 , but got dispensation from his monastic vows from the Vatican in 1871 ; therefore , he can not be called a Benedictine . He was still studying to become a priest of the Benedictine order when he arrived in Western Australia on 24 May 1855 aboard the Lady Amhurst with the Spanish Benedictine Father José María Benito Serra OSB - also known as Joseph Serra in Western Australia - , and several other clergymen , mostly Spaniards , but also Irish and French . He made his religious profession on 26 July 1858 , and completed his education and was ordained in 1859 . In 1860 , Bourke was appointed to teach at the Roman Catholic boys' schools at Fremantle and Perth , where he became known as an able scholar and teacher . In 1864 , he was appointed the first parish priest of York – prior to this , the parish had been administered by priests from Toodyay and New Norcia . He lived in simple quarters at the rear of the church and conducted Mass every Sunday . During his time in York , he employed ten ticket of leave men , including three as teachers . Returning to Perth in 1870 , he became the chaplain of Fremantle Prison , and taught at various schools . He got dispensation from his monastic vows on 30 April 4 , 1871 , but his name would still be the one he used in his profession , for which he was known in the Colony , not his birth one . The troublesome years of Bourke , his erratic behaviour and apparent mental problems , his difficult disengagement from the Benedictines and from New Norcia , as well as his temporary exile from Western Australia , ignored by most scholars until now , are mentioned by Dr. Teresa De Castro . In 1885 , he became the first resident priest of the Vasse region at Busselton . In 1889 , on returning to Perth , he became Vicar General for Western Australia serving under Bishop Matthew Gibney , and served voluntarily as New Norcia's agent in Perth , and canvassed the Government for a Roman Catholic representative on the Education Board . He also became active in the debate over state aid to private schools , which had existed since 1871 and had become central to the public debate leading to the June 1894 elections in Western Australia . With the help of three Catholic members of the Legislative Assembly , he founded the Education Defence League to lobby for the continuation of state aid . The normally mild-mannered priest caused some sensation at a public meeting prior to the election by suggesting violence would result if state aid were lifted . The battle was ultimately lost – the MPs who had supported him lost their seats at the election , and in late 1895 the Government passed a bill bringing the funding arrangement to an end . In August 1894 , he resigned as Vicar General , desiring to retire to New Norcia , but changed his mind thereafter , deciding that the number of Catholics arriving in Western Australia due to the gold rush and the cause of maintaining the private schools justified his continued presence . He became Chairman of the Education Board , a position which he held for a number of years . He was also a patron and benefactor of the Sisters of Mercy and financed St Mary's in Leederville and St Brigid's in West Perth , apparently from his own funds . He became a Monsignor in 1898 and the inaugural parish priest for West Perth in 1901 , residing in the Presbytery of St Brigid's in Fitzgerald Street for the rest of his life . He also became involved with the foundation of the University of Western Australia . The Archives of New Norcia keeps an important group of letters addressed from Bourke to the superiors of the monastery , especially to Bishop Rosendo Salvado OSB . Those offer a real portray of Bourke's personality , personal troubles , opinions and interests on relevant matters for his time . This information is completed by the many references to Bourke found in other letters kept in New Norcia Archives , especially in the correspondence between Bishop Martin Griver and Bishop Rosendo Salvado .

Fowler , c Daniel Diermeierd a ) University of Michigan ; b ) Northwestern University ; c ) University of California , San Diego ; d ) University of Chicago Abstract : Social influence is typically studied after a product is released . Yet , audience expectations and discussions begin before a product's release . This observation suggests a need to understand adoption processes over a product's life cycle . To explore pre - and postrelease social influence processes , this article uses survey data from Americans exposed to word of mouth for 309 Hollywood movies released over two and a half years . The data suggest pre - and postrelease social influences operate differently . Prerelease social influence displays a critical transition point with relation to adoption : before a critical value , any level of social influence is negligibly related to adoption , but after the critical value , the relationship between social influence and adoption is large and substantive . In contrast , postrelease social influence exhibits a positive linear relationship with adoption . Prerelease social influence is argued to require more exposures than postrelease social influence because of differences in the diagnosticity and accessibility of the information . To complement the survey data , computational models are used to test alternative hypotheses . Evidence from the computational models supports the proposed model of social influence .

These conversations occur in various venues , from water cooler chatter to social media , but as much as 90 percent remains face-to-face ( Keller and Fay 2012 ) . These conversations allow for social influence to occur . In fact , one survey found that word-of-mouth ( WOM ) influences 70 percent of all buying decisions ( Balter 2008 ) . A single face-to-face conversation can even exert more impact on product judgments than public relations or marketing efforts ( Herr , Kardes , and Kim 1991 ) . These dynamics have led to growing efforts to understand social influence and its effect on corporate and consumer behavior ( Aral and Walker 2011 ; Centola 2011 ; Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 ; Dubois , Rucker , and Tormala 2011 ; Salganik , Dodds , and Watts 2006 ) . Past research has traditionally emphasized "" post-release "" social influence – communications among consumers and stakeholders that follow their experience with an innovation or product ( Banerjee et al. 2013 ; Foutz and Jank 2010 ; Walgrave and Wouters 2014 ) . For example , early social influence research found that consumers were more likely to adopt a product when they heard about it from a current adopter ( Coleman , Katz , and Menzel 1966 ) . Subsequent research substantiated these effects with a range of explanations , including networks and social proofs ( Goldenberg et al. 2009 ; Mahajan , Muller , and Bass 1990 ; Salganik et al. 2006 ) . Yet , not all social influence is experience based . Social influence occurs throughout D AILY 915 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters a product's life cycle , including before it is released . For example , social influence can set expectations for actual experiences and subsequent adoption processes ( Banerjee et al. 2013 ; Gopinath , Chintagunta , and Venkataraman 2013 ) . In this regard , prerelease social influence may be critical to postrelease adoption because it can shape expectations , subsequent postrelease conversations , and the size of the early adopter group – key factors predictive of the adoption rate and ultimate market share ( Aral and Walker 2012 ; Salganik et al. 2006 ) . To expand our knowledge of the adoption life cycle , we investigate the relationship between prerelease social influence and adoption patterns . Specifically , we examine a nationwide random sample of Americans exposed to a major form of social influence – direct WOM exchanges with friends and network contacts . We draw on information processing work in psychology to suggest that prerelease WOM might be less accessible and diagnostic than postrelease WOM and that these differences change how WOM influences adoption behavior before and after a product is released . Specifically , based on proposed differences in the diagnosticity and accessibility of information ( Feldman and Lynch 1988 ; Lynch 2006 ) , we predict the relationship between WOM and subsequent adoption differs as a function of whether the WOM occurs during the pre - or postrelease of a product . We present two tests of our hypotheses . First , we test our hypotheses econometrically . These models estimate statistical relationships , functional forms , and effect sizes using proprietary company data on the prerelease WOM , postrelease WOM , and adoption of 309 Hollywood movies released over a two-and-a-half-year period from 1999 – 2001 . Second , we use agent-based models to test whether dynamic person-level and network-level interactions , as outlined by our explanatory framework , account for the adoption rates and functional form patterns of adoption observed in the data . In addition , we evaluate how robust our findings are to alternative specifications . In this way , we seek evidence of the factors associated with pre - and postrelease adoption in equilibrium and the dynamic micro organizational processes that can produce the observed macro equilibrium . Theory Our theoretical predictions draw on information processing and network theories of diffusion . Information processing theory suggests that people are more inclined to act on information when it is accessible and diagnostic ( Feldman and Lynch 1988 ; Lynch 2006 ) . Accessibility refers to whether information is available in a person's mind , whereas diagnosticity refers to whether accessible information is viewed as sufficient to help a person reach a decision consistent with his or her goals ( Lynch 2006 ) . For example , a person deciding whether to purchase a car may have encountered many facts about the car . Not all facts are likely to be equally accessible when she is on the showroom floor . The handling of the car may be salient because of commercial ads , whereas crash test ratings may be less salient . In this example , the accessibility of the handling suggests it will be more likely to influence a person's decision . However , the fact that the handling of the car is salient is not necessarily sufficient for the person to act on this information . She has to decide if the information is diagnostic for the decision at hand . If the handling of sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 916 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters the car is viewed as sufficiently diagnostic , then she may proceed with a purchase ; if this feature is not diagnostic , then she may search her memory for additional information until she is satisfied with the diagnosticity of the accessible information ( Lynch 2006 ) . Several factors can affect the accessibility and the diagnosticity of information ( Feldman and Lynch 1988 ) . For instance , the accessibility of information can be affected by how vivid information is . Vivid information , as compared to pallid information , is more likely to draw initial attention and provoke elaboration that can increase the memory for ( and accessibility of ) that information ( Herr et al. 1991 ; Kisielius and Sternthal 1986 ) . Thus , vividly presented information is more likely to be available to serve as an input to a subsequent adoption decision . Diagnosticity of information can be affected by direct or indirect experience with a product . Direct experience with a product is often more relevant and informative than indirect experience , and thus more diagnostic . For example , individuals were more likely to act on their opinions of food when they tasted it ( direct experience ) versus read about it ( indirect experience ) ( Wu and Shaffer 1987 ) . Indirect experience typically requires greater reinforcement to achieve a similar level of diagnosticity as direct experience . However , while the degree of exposures or number of inputs required may be different , both direct and indirect experiences may eventually surpass the required level of diagnosticity to make an adoption decision ( Lynch 2006 ; Lynch , Marmorstein , and Weigold 1988 ; Wyer and Srull 1986 ) . We propose that social influence in the form of WOM may differ in accessibility and diagnosticity during different stages of a product's life cycle . By definition , prerelease WOM lacks firsthand , trial-based information . Prerelease WOM is based on speculation of what experience with an innovation or product might produce . This dynamic suggests that prerelease WOM lacks the vivid descriptions and testimonial reactions of an innovation or product that come with actual use , reducing the accessibility of prerelease WOM . By definition , the inherently speculative nature of prerelease WOM would seem to render it less diagnostic than postrelease WOM based on product use . Thus , we propose that prerelease WOM is often less diagnostic and less accessible than postrelease WOM . For example , within the movie context , prerelease WOM is likely to possess less vivid descriptions of specific scenes , storylines , and personal reactions to the overall quality of the movie than the same descriptions drawn from movie attendance . Although , on average , prerelease WOM is likely to be less accessible and diagnostic than postrelease WOM , multiple exposures to information can raise its accessibility ( Petrocelli , Tormala , and Rucker 2007 ) . In addition , multiple exposures can also increase a message's diagnosticity . Specifically , even when the validity of a message is unverified , receiving it from multiple individuals can increase belief in the message , an effect observed in experiments ( Salganik et al. 2006 ) , legal decision making ( Waters and Hans 2009 ) , and attitudes in friendship networks ( Fowler and Christakis 2008 ) . As an anecdotal example , National Public Radio's tech news reported that Apple Inc. was releasing a new personal computing product to compete with the Kindle and the Nook , two electronic readers . Even without firsthand information about the product , the station had multiple reports from different sources which appeared sufficient for the station to report the name of Apple's sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 917 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters to-be-released reader as the iSlate . 1 Thus , apparent social agreement may increase the diagnosticity of what was indirect and speculative information , while , at the same time , repeated exposure raises accessibility ( Rosnow and Fine 1976 ; see also Dubois et al. 2011 ) . The implication is that prerelease WOM will require exposure from multiple sources to be as effective as postrelease WOM . Complex contagion theory ( Centola and Macy 2007 ) complements the accessibility and diagnosticity framework ( Feldman and Lynch 1988 ; Lynch 2006 ) . Centola and Macy ( 2007 ) argue that for adoption behaviors that are "" costly , risky , or controversial , the willingness to participate may require independent affirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources "" ( p. 703 ) . Because no one has adopted an innovation or product prior to release , prerelease WOM is likely to be riskier to act on than postrelease WOM , which contains first-hand information from individuals who have already adopted the new product . Thus , prerelease WOM can be likened to a more complex contagion than postrelease . In this sense , our work connects complex contagion theory and the diagnosticity framework through explaining and specifying an empirical test of how the level of exposure to pre - and postrelease WOM may be related to adoption . Exposure to information is dependent upon on the network of connections among individuals ( Aral and Walker 2011 ; 2012 ; Centola and Macy 2007 ; Dodds and Watts 2004 ) . In social networks , most people have a few friends and a few people have many friends ( Rivera , Soderstrom , and Uzzi 2010 ) . If few people are spreading WOM , chances are it is not coming from the unusual individuals with many contacts but from the individuals with few contacts . As a consequence , WOM is likely to be circulating among contacts in a relatively small number of separate friendship circles of strong ties ( Centola and Macy 2007 ; Valente 2012 ) . However , as the number of people spreading WOM increases , chances rise that the smaller number of highly connected people will be among those spreading WOM ( Onnela and Reed-Tsochas 2010 ) . And , when highly connected people spread WOM , they can spread it to their many weak ties throughout the network , who then circulate it among their contacts in their local friendship circles ( Valente 2012 ) . Put simply , after a critical mass is achieved , the small number of people with many contacts will spread the messages to many separate friendship circles , which produces multiple exposures and thus enhances social influence . For example , Paluck , Shepherd , and Aronow ( 2016 ) found that highly connected students spreading antibullying messages have significantly greater influence in decreasing bullying in middle schools compared to less-connected students sharing the same messages . The preceding discussion suggests that below a critical value of persons spreading WOM , a relatively small number of persons are likely to experience multiple exposures to WOM , but above the critical value , many persons are likely to experience multiple exposures to WOM ( Centola and Macy 2007 ; Dodds and Watts 2004 ; Granovetter 1978 ) . We believe this observation , in conjunction with the notions of accessibility and diagnosticity , suggests that the relationship between adoption and pre - and postrelease WOM differ in several predictable ways . First , the relationship between prerelease WOM and adoption can have two distinct regimes , one before reaching and one after reaching a critical mass of persons spreading WOM in the network . In the first regime , any amount of prerelease WOM before the critical sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 918 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters value is likely to result in negligible increases in adoption in the population . This outcome arises because only a minority of people in the population are hearing WOM from multiple sources ; as such , the majority of the population does not hear WOM at a rate that is likely to meet their accessibility and diagnosticity threshold for adoption . However , after the critical value , the relationship between WOM and adoption is likely to result in significant adoption in the population at all levels of WOM because many people in the population are likely to experience multiple exposures that should facilitate reaching their accessibility and diagnosticity thresholds for adoption . Second , based on the constructs of accessibility and diagnosticity , such a dual regime is less likely for postrelease WOM . Specifically , as postrelease information should be of greater accessibility and diagnosticity , even one exposure to postrelease WOM could be sufficient to surpass an individual's diagnosticity threshold . Because multiple exposures are not needed , this suggests a linear relationship between the amount of WOM and adoption . No critical value exists ; rather , each exposure is likely to prompt an adoption . Thus , comparing the effects of WOM on adoption for the same innovation or product in pre - and postrelease , we expect a critical value dynamic only for prerelease WOM . Formally , we present the three following hypotheses : H1 : A critical value exists that must be met for prerelease WOM to influence innovation adoption . Below this critical value , any level of prerelease WOM has relatively little impact on the level of initial adoption . After WOM is above the critical value , any level of prerelease WOM has a positive effect on adoption . H2 : Small changes around the critical value of prerelease WOM are associated with large differences in adoption . H3 : The effect of postrelease WOM on adoption is independent of a critical value . Postrelease WOM is proportional to adoption at all levels of WOM . Methods Data The movie industry provides a broad basis for theory development and testing ( Cattani et al. 2008 ; Hsu 2006 ; Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ; Zuckerman et al. 2003 ) . Our data includes 309 Hollywood movies released over a two-and-ahalf-year period between March 1999 and August 2001 . Our tests are based on unique , nonpublic data obtained from a professional survey firm for film production companies and shared with us for research purposes . For each movie , WOM is longitudinally measured in pre - and postrelease phases of adoption life cycle . The survey data records information on respondents' movie-going behavior , movie preferences , and whether they heard WOM about forthcoming and released movies from their family or friends . Respondents were a national random sample chosen through the random digit dialing of over 180,000 respondents . About 300 persons sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 919 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters were contacted each day , Monday through Thursday , from March 1999 to August 2001 , excluding holidays . The survey had a repeated-survey design ; the same items were asked of different respondents on each survey . A professional telephone interviewer led respondents through the survey . First , respondents were asked to indicate all the movies they knew were playing or forthcoming in the cinema . Second , for all the movies the respondents indicated , the respondents were asked whether friends or family were talking about the movie . Third , respondents were asked questions about their movie-going behavior , such as their favorite genre . Because the data is sold to end users who demand reliability , the data is checked for random sampling across demographic and movie-going groups , and respondents are read pick lists that contain fictitious movie titles to gauge respondents' true recall . We merged our survey data with archival data on movie , studio , star , director , and box office characteristics from the Internet Movie Database ( IMDb ) , and Metacritic.com ( Hsu 2006 ; Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ; Zuckerman et al. 2003 ) . Measures Our dependent variable is movie adoption . Movie adoption was measured as ( 1 ) opening weekend box office and ( 2 ) second weekend box office . Data are from the IMDb and are measured in dollars . Our criterion variables are pre - and postrelease WOM . Prerelease WOM was operationalized as the percentage of respondents who reported that their friends were talking about a particular movie during the Monday – Thursday prior to its release on opening box office weekend . Postrelease WOM was operationalized as the percentage of respondents who reported that their friends were talking about a particular movie during the Monday – Thursday after opening box office weekend but before the second weekend box office . We note that postrelease WOM is likely to still consist of WOM from those who have not directly seen the movie . However , given we are predicting different functional forms , this limitation appears to make our tests more conservative . To infer the level of pre - or postrelease WOM around the average person in the population , we exploited the random sample's ability to estimate a population mean . Because each respondent was randomly sampled , we aggregated the percentage of respondents reporting they heard WOM into a percentage-level variable for that survey and movie . For example , if 20 percent of the sample of people surveyed on a particular day said they had heard WOM about a specific movie , we operationalized the level of WOM for that movie on that day at 20 percent . We controlled for a number of factors known to influence movie consumption ( Basuroy , Chatterjee , and Ravid 2003 ; Eliashberg and Shugan 1997 ; Liu 2006 ; Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ) . Screens . The number of screens a movie is shown on affects the number of tickets that can be sold . This variable also serves as a proxy for advertising because advertising budgets are designed to fill the available seats ( Elberse and Eliashberg sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 920 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters 2003 ; Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ) . We measured this variable as the count of the number of screens on which the movie played as reported in IMDb . Critics' reviews . Critics affect film attendance ( Eliashberg and Shugan 1997 ; Zuckerman et al. 2003 ) . Critics' reviews were operationalized by Metacritic.com as a weighted average of all the scores assigned by individual critics to each movie . The scores ranged from 0 to 100 , with higher scores representing better reviews . Well-known critics ( e.g. , Roger Ebert ) and influential publications were more highly weighted than local reviews ( see Metacritic.com for methodological details ) . Percent avid . Avid moviegoers more frequently consume movies and by definition have lower thresholds for attending any movie . To control for avidity , we coded a respondent who saw at least one movie a month as an avid ( De Vany 2004 ) . The proportion of avids was aggregated from the survey responses in the same way as WOM to form a measure of percent avid . Holiday release . Films released during holidays experience greater overall demand for movie tickets and advertising . We coded a movie's release date as reported on IMDb for whether or not it was released during a peak movie-going weekend ( 1 = yes ; 0 otherwise ) . Movie budget . We measured movie budget as the total production costs in dollars , which subsumes the costs of the movie including salaries , studio time , props , and advertising ( Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ) . Although a line item breakdown of a movie's budget would be ideal to control for the exact level of advertising expenditures , advertising expenditures for movies are not publicly available ( Elberse and Eliashberg 2003 ) . Nevertheless , previous work has shown that a movie's production costs provides a reasonable and widely-used proxy measure for advertising expenses ( Elberse and Eliashberg 2003 ; Gopinath et al. 2013 ; Joshi and Mao 2012 ; Lui 2006 ) . In addition , we use number of screens and holiday release as further proxy measures ( Sorenson and Waguespack 2006 ) as reported from IMDb . Star power . The name recognition of the actors ( i.e. , a bankable star ) can affect a movie's box office . We use the methodology of Basuroy et al. ( 2003 ) to assess star power by how many top fifteen – grossing films in the previous five years starred one of the top three billed actors in a film . If one star had been in a single top-grossing film , another star had been in three top-grossing films , and the third star had been in no top-grossing films , Star Power equaled 4 . Alternative operationalizations , such as assigning star power points for top ten or top twenty – grossing films , produced similar results . Genre . We controlled for the type of movie with an indicator variable using the standard categories of Action / Adventure , Comedies , Dramas , Horror , Sci-Fi , and Family . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 921 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters Rating . We controlled for the movie's rating with an indicator variable using the standard categories of G , PG , PG-13 , or R. Lagged number of prior adopters . Prior work operationalized social influence in terms of the number of prior adopters ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 ) . The number of prior adopters for the second weekend box office was defined as opening weekend box office . By definition , there is no count of prior adopters for prerelease . Descriptive statistics and correlations can be found in the online supplement , appendix 1 . Statistical Model We used ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression and a spline methodology to test for changes in the relationship between WOM and box office at different levels of WOM . Prerelease WOM was measured the week prior to opening weekend box office , and postrelease WOM was measured between opening weekend box office and second weekend box office . The spline method has three steps . ( 1 ) Because theory does not specify a critical value or position of a critical value , we adopted a conservative method , which segmented WOM's observed range into equidistant length splines at 5 percentile increments ( Long and Freese 2001 ) . ( 2 ) For each cut-point , we determined whether the estimated slope before and after the cut-point were statistically different from each other by computing the difference between the slope before the cut point ( i.e. , slope 1 ) and the slope after the cut point . Statistically significant different slopes ( i.e. , slope difference ) indicate that a critical value is present at which the strength of the relationship between WOM and adoption changes . ( 3 ) To determine which critical value , if any , provides the best fit relative to other critical values or a null relationship of a simple linear model , we used the Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) statistic ( Kuha 2004 ) . Robust standard errors were used to control for nonhomogeneity in the residuals . Variance inflation factor ( VIF ) statistics had values < 3 . 0 , for which values of 10.0 or more indicate multicollinearity . Results Table 1 presents 8 regressions ( models 1 – 8 ) of opening weekend box office on prerelease WOM levels and control variables . Model 1 is the control variable – only model . Model 2 is the control variable model plus prerelease WOM without a spline segmentation . Our first finding indicates that WOM is positively and significantly related to the level of initial adoption . Highlighting the explanatory power of prerelease WOM on opening box office weekend , model 2 shows that prerelease WOM is positive and significant , and the R-squared is 28 percentage points ( 0 . 72 – 0 . 44 ) greater than the baseline model ( model 1 ) . Our second finding indicates that prerelease WOM is associated with a critical value around which the relationship between prerelease WOM and adoption changes . Prerelease WOM had a smaller effect on adoption until a critical value was reached , after which point increases in the level of WOM were associated with sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 922 October 2016 | Volume 3 sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 923 0.72 − 16 . 386 † ( 6 . 864 ) − 45 . 213 † ( 11 . 430 ) 0.44 1.559 * ( 0 . 791 ) 9.322 † ( 2 . 636 ) 0.127 † ( 0 . 024 ) − 12 . 427 * ( 5 . 255 ) 0.286 ( 1 . 427 ) 0.171 ( 0 . 447 ) − − 6.138 † ( 1 . 273 ) 22.70 † ( 3 . 324 ) 0.187 † ( 0 . 037 ) − 13 . 128 ( 8 . 449 ) 0.856 ( 1 . 651 ) 0.616 ( 0 . 483 ) − − 94.940 † ( 6 . 962 ) 39.159 * ( 17 . 060 ) 78.423 † ( 18 . 994 ) 2.750 † ( 1 . 012 ) 8.317 † ( 2 . 600 ) 0.131 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 13 . 440 † ( 5 . 145 ) 0.171 ( 1 . 362 ) 0.080 ( 0 . 436 ) − − − 3 . 521 † ( 1 . 023 ) − 17 . 594 * ( 8 . 245 ) 23.8 0.75 Model 3 35th percentile 39.186 † ( 14 . 621 ) 81.093 † ( 17 . 058 ) 2.820 † ( 1 . 031 ) 8.459 † ( 2 . 609 ) 0.134 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 13 . 554 † ( 5 . 151 ) 0.127 ( 1 . 350 ) 0.123 ( 0 . 436 ) − − − 3 . 271 † ( 0 . 976 ) − 18 . 514 * ( 8 . 285 ) 27.5 0.75 26.726 * ( 13 . 411 ) 94.729 † ( 16 . 180 ) 2.827 † ( 1 . 053 ) 8.496 † ( 2 . 617 ) 0.135 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 13 . 569 † ( 5 . 168 ) 0.193 ( 1 . 361 ) 0.113 ( 0 . 436 ) − − − 1 . 818 * ( 1 . 046 ) − 17 . 481 * ( 8 . 478 ) 26.7 0.75 34.888 † ( 11 . 135 ) 94.073 † ( 14 . 817 ) 2.846 † ( 1 . 028 ) 8.512 † ( 2 . 616 ) 0.142 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 14 . 118 † ( 5 . 226 ) 0.334 ( 1 . 358 ) 0.105 ( 0 . 432 ) − − − 2 . 382 * ( 1 . 182 ) − 18 . 365 * ( 8 . 188 ) 31.4 0.76 37.346 † ( 8 . 937 ) 98.588 † ( 15 . 633 ) 2.946 † ( 1 . 066 ) 8.850 † ( 2 . 616 ) 0.144 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 13 . 838 † ( 5 . 202 ) 0.535 ( 1 . 373 ) 0.138 ( 0 . 429 ) − − − 0 . 761 ( 1 . 464 ) − 19 . 962 * ( 8 . 518 ) 34.8 0.76 Threshold Piece-wise Linear Models Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 40th 45th 55th 65th percentile percentile percentile percentile 37.310 † ( 8 . 772 ) 99.322 † ( 16 . 495 ) 2.945 † ( 1 . 065 ) 8.809 † ( 2 . 596 ) 0.144 † ( 0 . 023 ) − 13 . 949 † ( 5 . 155 ) 0.530 ( 1 . 369 ) 0.145 ( 0 . 433 ) − − − 0 . 133 ( 1 . 594 ) − 19 . 878 * ( 8 . 515 ) 34.8 0.76 Model 8 70th percentile Note : 309 observations ; robust standard errors in parentheses ; VIF statistics showed there was no multicollinearity bias in the specification ( VIF between 3.2 and 5.5 across all models ) .

Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters significant increases in the level of adoption . Models 3 – 8 represent these findings as a series of splines . Each model creates a spline for a different percentile of WOM over the observed range of WOM , which was between its 35th and 70th percentile . ( Note the percentiles do NOT correspond to the simple percentage of people hearing WOM . In prerelease , for example , the 35th and 65th percentiles correspond to 10 percent and 21 percent of the persons hearing WOM , respectively . ) Consistent with hypothesis 1 , models 3 – 8 indicate that a spline model statistically significantly fits the data better than does a linear model . The spline coefficients for prerelease WOM : slope 1 and prerelease WOM : slope difference are jointly and statistically significant for spline models 7 and 8 . On average , the effect of prerelease WOM on consumption is almost four times stronger once it exceeds the critical value ( [ WOM : slope difference + WOM : slope 1 ] ÷ WOM : slope 1 ) . The BIC statistic of piecewise model was 34 ( Table 1 , model 7 ) , which provides "" strong "" evidence that the piecewise model is a better fit than the baseline linear model ( Long and Freese 2001 ) . The BIC statistic indicates that the best fit is the 65th percentile ; beyond the 65th percentile , there are no additional increases in fit . Our third finding is that after the critical value is reached , the association between prerelease WOM and adoption intensifies , as shown by the statistically significant value of prerelease WOM : slope difference . Small changes in the level of prerelease information around the critical value can tip the system from one regime to the other . The large value of prerelease WOM : slope difference substantiates the change in slope that occurs after the critical point . Numerically , model 7 suggests that after the critical value , each one-unit increase in prerelease WOM ( units are in 1 percent point increments from 1 – 100 ) results in a gain of $ 1 . 3 million at the box office . Before the critical value , each one-unit increase in WOM only results in gains of $ 0 . 3 million . Figure 1a plots these relationships . On the x axis is the level of prerelease WOM and on the y axis is the opening box office weekend . Each scatter point on the plot represents a different movie . The plot also indicates that the critical value for this set of movies was approximately at the level of 21 percent WOM in the system . Before this point , each increase in WOM has a small , positive effect on the growth of adopters , but after that critical value , each increase in the percentage of persons spreading WOM is associated with a greater increase in the number of adopters . Our fourth finding is that distinctive WOM dynamics occur for prerelease and postrelease for the same set of products . The relationship between postrelease WOM and adoption does not display a critical value ; rather , the relationship between postrelease WOM and adoption is similar at all levels of WOM . Table 2 shows the effects of regressing second weekend box office on our control variables , as well as opening box office and prerelease WOM . The table of effects indicates that a simple linear model ( Table 2 , model 2 ) provides as good a fit to the data as any spline specification ( Table 2 , models 3 – 8 ) . All models in Table 2 indicate a positive and significant association between postrelease WOM and second weekend box office . Moreover , the BIC statistic comparing the linear model with the spline models consistently produced a negative BIC statistic , a strong indication that there is no critical value of WOM in postrelease , supporting hypothesis 3 .

Timing Matters as shown in Figure 1a . The plots indicate that the relationship between postrelease WOM and second weekend box office is linear , consistent with hypothesis 3 . Computational Findings Our empirical tests regressed adoption rates on various levels of pre - and postrelease WOM across different movies and controlled for time-varying covariates . However , a limitation of the empirical data is that it does not allow us to measure a person's infectiousness nor the network structure directly because our person-level observations are randomly sampled nationally , which benefits statistical generalization but does not furnish a direct measure of the friendship network . To address these limitations , we used the above theory to specify agent-based simulations that complement the empirical analyses . The simulations provide a confirmatory analysis of the mechanisms underlying the empirical data and offer tests for the fit and plausibility of alternative mechanisms . If our proposed micro-framework regarding accessibility and diagnosticity holds , we should find that : ( 1 ) the observed functional forms are related to different levels of exposure to WOM in prerelease and postrelease stages of adoption , ( 2 ) a critical value exists for prerelease WOM but not postrelease WOM , and ( 3 ) the observed critical value and the estimated critical value from the simulation are in agreement . The simulations use a social network structure approximated from an actual , typical social network based on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( Add Health ) . These data have been used extensively for the same purpose we use it here ( Fowler and Christakis 2008 ) . 2 Consistent with our empirical analysis , the computational model does not analyze the adoption curve of one product over time but rather the average adoption of multiple movies exhibiting common exposure , informational , and network characteristics . Our simulation model has three steps . First , we "" seed "" the network with a certain number of persons who can spread WOM . In the prerelease model , the seed levels were assigned by drawing one observation bi from a distribution b of "" WOM "" ( the subscript i denotes the ith movie to adopt ) , which was taken from the survey data for prerelease WOM . In the postrelease model , a person who has seen the movie in the prerelease WOM model ( i.e. , an adopter ) can spread WOM . Second , we assign each person who can spread WOM a probability of spreading it to one of their contacts in their network . In prerelease , a person can spread WOM to a contact with probability ti , a uniform random distribution between 0.01 and 0.05 . This means the expected number of contacts a person spreads WOM to is ti times the number of contacts he or she has . In postrelease , each person who has seen the movie can spread WOM with probability ri .

Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters movie but who has heard WOM from at least one contact postrelease goes to the movie . In all WOM models , we assume that a fraction of the population goes to the movie because of idiosyncratic factors that are constant in pre - and postrelease ( Gopinath , et al. 2013 ; Valente 2012 ) using an error term ei drawn from a log normal distribution ( to avoid negative values ) with mean = 0.0025 and variance = 0.00004 . In each model , we add up all of the people who have gone to a movie to calculate the total adoption . To estimate the level of adoption from box office sales , we assume a potential movie audience of 300 million people and a ticket cost of $ 6 each , the average of 1999 – 2001 ticket prices in the United States ( see online supplement , appendix 2 , for further details and code ) . Robustness Checks We included tests of alternative mechanisms from the literature ( e.g. , Centola and Macy , 2007 ; Goldenberg et al. 2001 ) . Alternative A. In prerelease , the adoption decision rule changes from the hypothesized relationship to hearing WOM from one or more contacts . This model reflects more standard adoption rules in which pre - and postrelease WOM both act as simple contagions with higher levels of accessibility and diagnosticity . Alternative B. In postrelease , the adoption decision rule changes from the hypothesized relationship to hearing WOM from two or more contacts . This model reflects a more complex contagion with a higher threshold for accessibility and diagnosticity prior to adoption in both pre - and postrelease stages . Alternative C. In pre - and postrelease , the adoption decision rules change from the hypothesized relationships to hearing WOM from three or more , four or more , five or more , or a random number of contacts , or from 10 percent , 25 percent , 50 percent , 75 percent , and 100 percent of their contacts . These models test for differences in adoption thresholds . Alternative D. In the hypothesized models , the number of contacts ( i.e. , degree ) of individuals in the network varies per the empirical distributions of degree found in the Add Health data ( range 1 to 10 connections ) . Here , we change the size of individual networks so degree is fixed for all individuals in the network at two , four , six , or eight connections and follows the hypothesized decision rules . Results Figure 1 displays scatter plots of the visual agreement between the observed and simulation data for prerelease ( left panel ; Figure 1a , 1c ) and postrelease ( right panel ; Figure 1b , 1d ) , respectively . Consistent with our framework and regression analyses , the simulations' results closely mirror the same functional relationship found in the empirical data . The simulations estimated a weak relationship between the sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 928 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters level of prerelease WOM and adoption between the values of ∼ 5 percent to ∼ 21 percent WOM . After a critical level of prerelease WOM , the simulation shows that each increase in prerelease WOM is associated with large increases in adoption . The pattern of weak and then strong effects before and after the critical value , as well as the critical value itself , correspond closely to the empirical results . By contrast , postrelease WOM does not display the same effects . Postrelease WOM is proportionally associated with adoption , both empirically and in the simulation . These results offer confirmatory support to the findings of the empirical analysis . Alternative models A – D further support our hypothesized model . Across all models , formal tests indicated that the hypothesized model fit the observed data the best . Simulation results are displayed in Figures 2 and 3 . Figure 2 shows that the hypothesized threshold of two persons in prerelease ( Figure 2a ) and one person in postrelease ( Figure 2b ) fits the data better than other specifications . For example , alternative model A for prerelease overestimated opening box office adoption by more than 200 percent . Figure 3 shows that the critical network threshold is robust to changes in the size of a person's network . The best fit is for 4 degrees for prerelease ( Figure 3a ) , which corresponds to the average size of a person's network in the Add Health network data ; postrelease results ( Figure 3b ) are less conclusive but generally consistent with our hypothesized model . Formal tests bore out these results . We took the mean and the variance of the empirical data at 10 percent intervals of WOM and compared those observed values with the values generated by each alternative model specification . Specifically , we evaluated the fit of all models using the χ2 test , which measures the sum of squared errors between the model and observed values for each of the bins , both for the means and the variances . We fitted the data to a Landau distribution , which accounts for the long tail of box-office returns that skew toward lower levels in each bin ( Landau 1944 ) . Table 3 displays the results of these robustness checks . The hypothesized model fits the prerelease data with a χ2 of p = 96 percent and postrelease of p = 88 percent . The model that uses a constant degree of 4 also agrees well with prerelease data χ2 of p = 94 percent but poorly in postrelease of p = 23 percent . These alternative models further support a prerelease individual threshold for adoption of hearing WOM from two or more contacts . The next best fit for a postrelease alternative model was alternative C ( random distribution of individual thresholds with mean threshold of 1 ) with p = 55 percent , which suggests that in postrelease there may be more variation in individual thresholds , with some individuals still wanting to hear from two or more individuals before adopting , but this does not represent the adoption behavior as well as our hypothesized model . These findings indicate that the mechanisms outlined in our framework offer a plausible explanation for how micro behaviors of spreading and hearing preand postrelease social influence within networks can generate the observed macro patterns of adoption .

Timing Matters October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters compared pre - and postrelease WOM to their social influence . In this article , we tackled this issue using large-scale , real-world empirical data on movie adoption accompanied by an agent-based model . Our results demonstrate that life cycle stage matters : pre - versus postrelease WOM follow distinctive patterns of potential theoretical and practical importance . Theoretically , we introduce the notion of a functional form difference between pre - and postrelease WOM and adoption . For prerelease WOM , until a critical value of WOM is reached , only a small , positive relationship between social influence and adoption is present . However , after this critical value of WOM is reached , every increase in WOM correlates with a significant and large increase in adoption . In contrast , for postrelease WOM , the relationship between WOM and adoption follows a single linear functional form . These patterns were supported by time-series data and agent-based models . Together , these findings suggest the importance of distinguishing and studying preversus postrelease WOM with respect to social influence and adoption . We draw upon an accessibility – diagnosticity framework to explain these functional forms and adoption patterns . The framework focuses on how differences in information and the transfer of information in a network are associated with socially induced adoption . We reasoned that prerelease WOM is based on speculation , hearsay , and other secondhand information that does not appear to significantly affect adoption until sufficient repeated exposure increases the accessibility and diagnosticity of the information . This level of exposure is obtained when potential adopters have the information echoed throughout their network by multiple contacts , which occurs when a sufficient number of highly connected persons in a social network relay prerelease WOM across otherwise disconnected social network clusters . By contrast , because postrelease WOM is more likely to be based on firsthand and direct experience , a single exposure can be sufficient to provide the required accessibility and diagnosticity to prompt adoption . We suggest prerelease WOM acts as a more complex contagion than postrelease WOM because of differences in accessibility and diagnosticity across a product's life cycle . Our work complements and extends that of Centola and Macy ( 2007 ) . Using simulations , Centola and Macy found that complex contagions saturate a network more slowly over time than simple contagions . We extend this work by looking at a snapshot of adoption levels for many different products ( movies ) at one time ( either pre - or postrelease ) . We find a critical point for the influence of a complex contagion ( prerelease WOM ) on adoption but a linear relationship for a simple contagion ( postrelease WOM ) . Further , our empirical analysis suggests that a contagion as "" simple "" as WOM can change across a product's life cycle stages as it moves from complex to simple . Future research should explore how the role of weak ties may change over time for product adoption as the complexity of contagion changes . We also advanced theory by emphasizing the importance of studying interactions between individual and network thresholds . Prior models have investigated the implications of different individual thresholds on adoption ( Dodds and Watts 2004 ; Granovetter 1978 ) . By contrast , we emphasized the predictive value of a global network – level threshold . Unless this global network reaches a certain threshold of prerelease social influence , negligible changes exist in adoption behavior by consumers . Furthermore , we found a key link : a global network threshold occurred sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 934 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al. Timing Matters when individual thresholds for adoption were responsive to exposures or greater WOM . Future research might turn to examine how individual-level thresholds influence this global threshold . The importance of prerelease social influence has a number of potential implications for management research . Consumer trends highlight continued growth in social influence as processes for generating and sharing information about products continue to expand via interpersonal and social media ( Aral and Walker 2011 ) . The present work suggests that managers should move beyond questions of how social influence spreads and seek to understand how influence patterns differ based on the life cycle of an innovation or product : pre - versus postrelease stages . Indeed , were managers to rely only on relationships or observations of postrelease social influence , they may be poorly equipped to make decisions that involve prerelease marketing efforts . Improvement in practice may further occur if future research investigates a broader range of products to identify how critical values vary across product categories and how sensitive the critical value is to change in the level of prerelease social influence before and after the critical value . On a related point , our research suggests the possibility of different interventions as a function of pre - versus postrelease of a product . Prior to a product's release , marketers might focus on encouraging communications among a smaller number of diverse consumers to increase the chance that multiple sources of influence are enacted in the network to foster initial levels of adoption . However , in postrelease , marketers might focus more heavily on getting people to hear about one person's experience with the product , as that one experience may be enough to foster adoption . In addition , during the prerelease phase , failure to have the required level of social influence may also indicate that release should be postponed until prerelease social influence reaches the desired value . Our study uses survey data on face-to-face WOM , which remains a central form of consumer behavior ( Bond et al. 2012 ; Keller and Fay 2012 ) . However , the data are older and censor most of the smallest-budget movies released during that timeframe . Therefore , generalization to current conditions should be done with caution . This limitation recognized , a benefit of the timing for the survey is that it is before the advent of social media sites and therefore likely captured interpersonal WOM . Currently , Facebook and other social media channels complement traditional faceto-face WOM ( Aral and Walker 2011 ; De Bruyn and Lilien 2008 ) . This introduces a new question with respect to how social influence , as measured by WOM , may have changed over time as people hear about products via face-to-face and social media WOM . We suspect that the accessibility , diagnosticity , and complexity of WOM often varies for a phone call compared to a FaceBook post , for example . Future research should explore how the different channels of pre - versus postrelease social influence affect each other as well as consumption behavior . In all cases , a broader and more complete understanding of social influence is acquired by understanding how it operates in different stages of an innovation's life cycle . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 935 October 2016 | Volume 3 Soderstrom et al.

637	You can do anything when you hit 18 I was downcast after Doncaster , but my longest run so far -- in a respectable time -- has put a spring in my step ( and an ache in the rest of me ) . In this mood , I could run all the way to London and still get round the marathon course . I 'm pleased to say that this week things have improved . I managed to run 18 miles on Saturday and that was quite comfortable . It 's cheered me up to know that the Doncaster half-marathon last week was such a disaster because I was ill , not because I was unfit . That one long run has given my confidence a boost and I 'm convinced I 'll now survive London . It was n't particularly fast -- three hours 21 minutes to be exact -- but at least I know I can do it . Doncaster put some doubt in my mind but I 've bounced back -- in fact it 's spurred me on . I 'm looking forward to the next few weeks of training and I 'm hoping to speed up a bit . I do n't think I 'll be challenging Paula Radcliffe but hopefully I might break five hours . That 's my goal and now I 'm back to my usual cheery self I 'm determined to do it .

1418	"Pam Musk Media Fellows Pam Musk Aligning the Strategic and Conservation Goals of New York's Audubon Centers Hilary Clinton said , "" Fail to plan , plan to fail . "" Pam Musk took her advice to heart ! She 'll employ this philosophy to transform Audubon Centers throughout New York State into the most effective hubs for conservation they can be within their communities . Musk is the Director of Centers and Education for Audubon New York , where she is responsible for both the quality of the education programs and the operations of the State's six Audubon Centers . She has seen firsthand how environmental education provides the stepping-stones needed for individuals to pursue conservation careers . She also understands that educators must meet people where they are comfortable and help them build on their comfort , knowledge , and interest in the environment . Audubon Centers are uniquely positioned to inspire individuals to get involved in the environment , as they offer physical places that attract community members . Since each Audubon Center in New York is at a different point in its development , Musk believes a concerted planning effort is critical to ensure they are effective venues for achieving strategic and conservation goals . For her TogetherGreen Conservation Fellowship , Musk designed software to plan and implement conservation , education and advocacy goals at Audubon Centers in New York . The planning now forms the basis for all work done at the Centers , whether it be conducting education programs for young children or reducing the threats to conservation targets at that site , making the Center a conservation hub within its community . She convened the partners of the Montezuma Audubon Center to complete a conservation plan for the site and started to take the lessons learned from this pilot process to the State's five other Centers and set each on a path to completing conservation plans . Musk hopes that conservation planning and coordination will provide the stepping-stones to build the capacity of the Centers . This will allow each Center to more fully serve its community and in turn allow Audubon New York to achieve its mission of conserving and restoring the state's ecosystems . Featured Current Fellow To Jeremy Solin , one of the most enduring challenges in solving environmental problems is developing a vibrant sense in people's minds of what their unique , local environment really is : what it produces , what its assets are , and what caretaking has to happen to ensure its continuation .

809	Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplants Bone marrow is a soft substance in our bones . It is the job of the bone marrow to make our blood . We have three types of blood cells . Red blood cells , white blood cells and platelet blood cells . It is the job of red blood cells to carry oxygen in the body , the white blood cells to protect our bodies from infection and the platelet blood cells to make our blood clot so that when we wound ourselves , the wound heals and we do not lose lots of blood . When these blood cells are at the earliest stage of development , they are called stem cells . A stem cell or bone marrow transplant provides healthy bone marrow to a patient to allow much higher doses of chemotherapy and improve the chances of curing the disease . When the cells are taken from the bone marrow we talk about bone marrow transplant and when cells are taken from the blood we talk about stem cell transplant . One type of transplant is using stem cells or bone marrow from a donor ( called allogeneic transplant ) . Another way is by using the patient's own stem cells or bone marrow . This is sometimes called an autologous transplant or an autograft , but strictly speaking it is not actually a transplant as this method does not use stem cells from someone else . It is therefore often rather called high dose treatment and stem cell support . When very high doses of chemotherapy are given , the treatment destroys the cells in the bone marrow . The doctors can take stem cells or bone marrow from the patient before they get the chemotherapy and then store the cells while the treatment is going on . This way , healthy cells from the patient are being protected while the strong treatment is destroying the cells that are left in the bone marrow . When the treatment is over , the healthy stem cells or bone marrow are given back to the patient and help them fight infection and cope with the strong treatment . With a proper transplant , the patient need another person ( a donor ) to give them healthy stem cells or bone marrow .	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

The more active you are , the more energy you need from food . The energy food gives you is measured in calories . Hector says : "" If we eat more food than we need to make energy , the extra food turns to fat and this is stored in our bodies . "" Children are much smaller than adults but they are usually very active and still growing . They usually need between 1000 and 2000 calories every day . Adult women need between 2000 and 4000 calories every day and men need between 3000 and 5000 calories , depending on how active they are . Adult bodies are larger than children's so adults need to eat more to produce energy . Older people generally tend to use less energy than other adults .

1433	"Billboard rules of the road We 've pulled out all the stops to advertise the launch of our very own Ascend's Golden Guide . One of the ways we 've decided to advertise the publication and website is through four strategically placed billboards located next to highways throughout the Kansas City metro . Creating a successful billboard is actually more challenging than long-form content . Despite the large space , you have to get your message across instantaneously . Drivers often have fewer than 10 seconds to view . Here are six fundamental rules : Writing for billboards – or bus signs , meeting banners and other large signs meant to be seen from far away – is all about the short and sweet hook . Twitter's 140-character limit is a good introduction to writing concise content , but actually , the most eye-catching billboards are ones that feature seven words or less . It should be catchy and have an immediate effect on the reader . The best billboards hit a nerve with readers . Signs that elicit an emotional response are more memorable . Try the humorous approach , pull on their heartstrings or intrigue or surprise your readers . "" Good advertising is storytelling , "" according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America ( OAAA ) . "" Dramatic tension or suspense influences viewer interest [ that ] can be expressed on three different cognitive levels : rational , emotional and cultural . "" Rely on imagery over words , if possible . For our billboard campaign , we chose to use a picture of the Ascend's Golden Guide cover for recognition , as the publication is now available in magazine racks at various locations , such as libraries , CVS pharmacies , doctor's offices and more , across the city . Think outside the billboard . Check with your billboard vendor to see if you can take your message or graphic past the frame . "" Extensions or other 3-D embellishments and environmental applications will enhance an overall design by producing greater impact , "" according to the OAAA . Fonts must be easy to read from variable distances . Make the text large and legible , paying close attention to the spacing between letters . For our billboard , which we wanted drivers to be able to read from the highway , we used Myriad , a sans-serif font ."	Instruction	Promotion
937	"When his bed sheets began to hint at something more beneath them , Bruce Bailey blamed his wayward mind . It had played nothing but dirty tricks for months now – since the day Sheila died – yes , since then . So , when he entered his bedroom that Tuesday to catch a nap before his late shift at the factory , he frowned , rubbed his jaw and thought : I made the bed , did n't I ? I always make the bed . He slept fitfully . Nothing strange in that : just another legacy from Sheila's death . As much as he disliked the thought Bruce was growing used to the nightmarish quality of his days ; of the long drawn out shadows that breathed and lurched drunkenly around his room . The light fixture had begun to resemble a blind milky eye , as if age itself worked upon it . Sometimes he wished it would simply blow . It offered little comfort anyway ; its glow had grown sickly . Bruce imagined jaundiced skin clinging to it , tainting the light as it passed through . It was these thoughts that occupied the greater part of Bruce's mind , and when they were n't there , Sheila's face would take up residence , wounded , half pleading waiting to come in from the cold . Unable to sleep , he staggered out of bed , stood for a moment trying to recollect what he was supposed to do next . He 'd slept in his work clothes again , something Mr Shueman had remarked upon the day before . His sympathy had long died along with his patience towards Bruce's shattered attention . "" Ca n't work on a fac-to-ry floor Bruce , if you 're playing with the fairies . "" He 'd said in his neat and concise way . For the second time that day ( did n't I make it before ? ) Bruce re-made the bed . In the bathroom he washed his face , ignoring his reflection . On impulse he pulled off his white shirt and dragged on a blue one , it was unwashed but wearable . He returned to the bedroom and stopped . The sheets were dishevelled , pulled in places into curves and valleys . Sheila had been dead four months , not long enough for him to forget how a woman looked beneath bed covers . Bruce knew he was n't mistaken ; there was someone in his bed . She lay curled on her side , her hands beneath her head and her feet drawn up . "" It 's my fucking head , "" Bruce muttered , working his fists . "" My goddamned head ! "" The sheets moved . A sigh shivered into the room , strong enough to upset the fabric stifling the woman's mouth . Bruce stumbled back , shock sending jolts of ice into his gut . This was by far the most lucid of his wild imaginings . So much so that he believed he could smell her . An acrid stench of something charred , it grew thick and cloying . Over-cooked meat . Bad meat , Bruce thought , against his better judgement stepping closer . His mind had grown unhealthy , ( that 's it and that 's all it is , right ? ) He could n't blame it , the way he 'd been living . The house was a mess ; dirty clothes strewn everywhere , litter overflowing the bin . His thoughts had adapted to their surroundings ; to his depression . Why else , did n't he simply remove the unsightly bulb and replace it with a new one ( should turn the Goddamned thing off ! ) , open the curtains instead of putting up with sullied shadow ? Because he did n't want to , Bruce wanted to nurture the only thing he had left , Sheila – no - Sheila's dead . He found himself standing by the bed . The bed he 'd slept in for four months now wishing human warmth beside him . A pillow was a poor companion . His weary eyes took in the sheets , the slender figure beneath them . Definitely there . He could even see the rise and fall of her breath . Her breath . Sheila ... Toying with the corner of the sheet Bruce said , "" Come out . "" The figure turned , called from sleep , her blind face searching , "" Bruce ? "" She said , and her voice cracked like a bad connection . "" Bruce ? "" Unable to bear it Bruce screamed and tore away the sheet . The fabric whispered – only friction makes a sound like that – against her skin , her hands reached for her face , fingers splayed against her cheeks . "" Sheila - "" his voice failed him , his legs buckled , Bruce found himself kneeling before the parody of his wife . Her hands fled to her chest , her stomach , they squeezed and prodded , as if unable to believe she was intact . Almost . She had no hair . Her eyes no longer blue but yellow and shrivelled , her collarbone and chest was littered with fragments of metal . Because of the crash , she 'd always thought small cars were safer , so wrong . A small guy will always come off worst against a giant , and her mini resembled an accordion after the accident . Could n't get free , could n't escape the flames . Burnt away her hair , her face . "" You 're dead ! "" Bruce gasped , oily sweat pock-marking his face and neck . Her yellow eyes pinned him ; lips tried to smile . "" Huh huh , "" Sheila said , shaking her head . An odd , contemplative look shadowed her naked face , "" I 've come to keep our bed warm , "" she whispered in that strange long distance way , crawling ( like a broken puppet ) toward the foot of the bed where Bruce knelt frozen , "" You 've been missing me , Bruce , have n't you ?

48	"CHAPTER XXXIII When Mr. St. John went , it was beginning to snow ; the whirling storm continued all night . The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls ; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable . I had closed my shutter , laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it , trimmed my fire , and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest , I lit a candle , took down "" Marmion , "" and beginning -- "" Day set on Norham's castled steep , And Tweed's fair river broad and deep , And Cheviot's mountains lone ; The massive towers , the donjon keep , The flanking walls that round them sweep , In yellow lustre shone "" -- I soon forgot storm in music . I heard a noise : the wind , I thought , shook the door . No ; it was St. John Rivers , who , lifting the latch , came in out of the frozen hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier . I was almost in consternation , so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night . "" Any ill news ? "" I demanded . "" Has anything happened ? "" "" No. How very easily alarmed you are ! "" he answered , removing his cloak and hanging it up against the door , towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged . He stamped the snow from his boots . "" I shall sully the purity of your floor , "" said he , "" but you must excuse me for once . "" Then he approached the fire . "" I have had hard work to get here , I assure you , "" he observed , as he warmed his hands over the flame . "" One drift took me up to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . "" "" But why are you come ? "" I could not forbear saying . "" Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor ; but since you ask it , I answer simply to have a little talk with you ; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms . Besides , since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told , and who is impatient to hear the sequel . "" He sat down . I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday , and really I began to fear his wits were touched . If he were insane , however , his was a very cool and collected insanity : I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now , as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale , where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved . I waited , expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend ; but his hand was now at his chin , his finger on his lip : he was thinking . It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face . A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart : I was moved to say -- "" I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you : it is too bad that you should be quite alone ; and you are recklessly rash about your own health . "" "" Not at all , "" said he : "" I care for myself when necessary . I am well now . What do you see amiss in me ? "" This was said with a careless , abstracted indifference , which showed that my solicitude was , at least in his opinion , wholly superfluous . I was silenced . He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip , and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate ; thinking it urgent to say something , I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door , which was behind him . "" No , no ! "" he responded shortly and somewhat testily . "" Well , "" I reflected , "" if you wo n ' t talk , you may be still ; I 'll let you alone now , and return to my book . "" So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "" Marmion . "" He soon stirred ; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements ; he only took out a morocco pocket-book , thence produced a letter , which he read in silence , folded it , put it back , relapsed into meditation . It was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me ; nor could I , in impatience , consent to be dumb ; he might rebuff me if he liked , but talk I would . "" Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately ? "" "" Not since the letter I showed you a week ago . "" "" There has not been any change made about your own arrangements ? You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected ? "" "" I fear not , indeed : such chance is too good to befall me . "" Baffled so far , I changed my ground . I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars . "" Mary Garrett's mother is better , and Mary came back to the school this morning , and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow . "" "" Indeed ! "" "" Mr. Oliver pays for two . "" "" Does he ? "" "" He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas . "" "" I know . "" "" Was it your suggestion ? "" "" No. "" "" Whose , then ? "" "" His daughter 's , I think . "" "" It is like her : she is so good-natured . "" "" Yes . "" Again came the blank of a pause : the clock struck eight strokes . It aroused him ; he uncrossed his legs , sat erect , turned to me . "" Leave your book a moment , and come a little nearer the fire , "" he said . Wondering , and of my wonder finding no end , I complied . "" Half-an-hour ago , "" he pursued , "" I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale : on reflection , I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part , and converting you into a listener . Before commencing , it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears ; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips . For the rest , whether trite or novel , it is short . "" Twenty years ago , a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter ; she fell in love with him , and married him , against the advice of all her friends , who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding . Before two years passed , the rash pair were both dead , and laid quietly side by side under one slab . ( I have seen their grave ; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim , soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in --- shire . ) They left a daughter , which , at its very birth , Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night . Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations ; it was reared by an aunt-in - law , called ( I come to names now ) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead . You start--did you hear a noise ? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom : it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered , and barns are generally haunted by rats . -- To proceed . Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years : whether it was happy or not with her , I can not say , never having been told ; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than Lowood School , where you so long resided yourself . It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours--she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! "" I interrupted . "" I can guess your feelings , "" he said , "" but restrain them for a while : I have nearly finished ; hear me to the end . Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing , but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl , and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive , though a lunatic . What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture ; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary , it was discovered she was gone--no one could tell when , where , or how . She had left Thornfield Hall in the night ; every research after her course had been vain : the country had been scoured far and wide ; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her . Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency : advertisements have been put in all the papers ; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs , a solicitor , communicating the details I have just imparted . Is it not an odd tale ? "" "" Just tell me this , "" said I , "" and since you know so much , you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester ? How and where is he ? What is he doing ? Is he well ? "" "" I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester : the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to . You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event which requires her appearance . "" "" Did no one go to Thornfield Hall , then ? Did no one see Mr. Rochester ? "" "" I suppose not . "" "" But they wrote to him ? "" "" Of course . "" "" And what did he say ? Who has his letters ? "" "" Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester , but from a lady : it is signed ' Alice Fairfax . ' "" I felt cold and dismayed : my worst fears then were probably true : he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent . And what opiate for his severe sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there ? I dared not answer the question . Oh , my poor master--once almost my husband--whom I had often called "" my dear Edward ! "" "" He must have been a bad man , "" observed Mr. Rivers . "" You do n't know him--do n't pronounce an opinion upon him , "" I said , with warmth . "" Very well , "" he answered quietly : "" and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him : I have my tale to finish . Since you wo n ' t ask the governess's name , I must tell it of my own accord . Stay ! I have it here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down , fairly committed to black and white . "" And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced , opened , sought through ; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper , hastily torn off : I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine , and lake , and vermillion , the ravished margin of the portrait-cover . He got up , held it close to my eyes : and I read , traced in Indian ink , in my own handwriting , the words "" JANE EYRE "" -- the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction . "" Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre : "" he said , "" the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre : I knew a Jane Elliott . -- I confess I had my suspicions , but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty . You own the name and renounce the _alias_ ? "" "" Yes--yes ; but where is Mr. Briggs ? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do . "" "" Briggs is in London . I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester ; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested . Meantime , you forget essential points in pursuing trifles : you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you . "" "" Well , what did he want ? "" "" Merely to tell you that your uncle , Mr. Eyre of Madeira , is dead ; that he has left you all his property , and that you are now rich--merely that--nothing more . "" "" I ! -- rich ? "" "" Yes , you , rich--quite an heiress . "" Silence succeeded . "" You must prove your identity of course , "" resumed St. John presently : "" a step which will offer no difficulties ; you can then enter on immediate possession . Your fortune is vested in the English funds ; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents . "" Here was a new card turned up ! It is a fine thing , reader , to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing ; but not a matter one can comprehend , or consequently enjoy , all at once . And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving : _this_ is solid , an affair of the actual world , nothing ideal about it : all its associations are solid and sober , and its manifestations are the same . One does not jump , and spring , and shout hurrah ! at hearing one has got a fortune ; one begins to consider responsibilities , and to ponder business ; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares , and we contain ourselves , and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow . Besides , the words Legacy , Bequest , go side by side with the words , Death , Funeral . My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative ; ever since being made aware of his existence , I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him : now , I never should . And then this money came only to me : not to me and a rejoicing family , but to my isolated self . It was a grand boon doubtless ; and independence would be glorious--yes , I felt that--that thought swelled my heart . "" You unbend your forehead at last , "" said Mr. Rivers . "" I thought Medusa had looked at you , and that you were turning to stone . Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth ? "" "" How much am I worth ? "" "" Oh , a trifle ! Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds , I think they say--but what is that ? "" "" Twenty thousand pounds ? "" Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand . This news actually took my breath for a moment : Mr. St. John , whom I had never heard laugh before , laughed now . "" Well , "" said he , "" if you had committed a murder , and I had told you your crime was discovered , you could scarcely look more aghast . "" "" It is a large sum--do n't you think there is a mistake ? "" "" No mistake at all . "" "" Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand ! "" "" It is written in letters , not figures , -- twenty thousand . "" I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred . Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on . "" If it were not such a very wild night , "" he said , "" I would send Hannah down to keep you company : you look too desperately miserable to be left alone . But Hannah , poor woman ! could not stride the drifts so well as I : her legs are not quite so long : so I must e ' en leave you to your sorrows . Good-night . "" He was lifting the latch : a sudden thought occurred to me . "" Stop one minute ! "" I cried . "" Well ? "" "" It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me ; or how he knew you , or could fancy that you , living in such an out-of-the-way place , had the power to aid in my discovery . "" "" Oh ! I am a clergyman , "" he said ; "" and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters . "" Again the latch rattled . "" No ; that does not satisfy me ! "" I exclaimed : and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which , instead of allaying , piqued my curiosity more than ever . "" It is a very strange piece of business , "" I added ; "" I must know more about it . "" "" Another time . "" "" No ; to-night ! -- to-night ! "" and as he turned from the door , I placed myself between it and him . He looked rather embarrassed . "" You certainly shall not go till you have told me all , "" I said . "" I would rather not just now . "" "" You shall ! -- you must ! "" "" I would rather Diana or Mary informed you . "" Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax : gratified it must be , and that without delay ; and I told him so . "" But I apprised you that I was a hard man , "" said he , "" difficult to persuade . "" "" And I am a hard woman , -- impossible to put off . "" "" And then , "" he pursued , "" I am cold : no fervour infects me . "" "" Whereas I am hot , and fire dissolves ice . The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same token , it has streamed on to my floor , and made it like a trampled street . As you hope ever to be forgiven , Mr. Rivers , the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen , tell me what I wish to know . "" "" Well , then , "" he said , "" I yield ; if not to your earnestness , to your perseverance : as stone is worn by continual dropping . Besides , you must know some day , -- as well now as later . Your name is Jane Eyre ? "" "" Of course : that was all settled before . "" "" You are not , perhaps , aware that I am your namesake ? -- that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers ? "" "" No , indeed ! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me ; but I never asked for what name it stood . But what then ? Surely -- "" I stopped : I could not trust myself to entertain , much less to express , the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself , -- that , in a second , stood out a strong , solid probability . Circumstances knit themselves , fitted themselves , shot into order : the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight , -- every ring was perfect , the connection complete . I knew , by instinct , how the matter stood , before St. John had said another word ; but I can not expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception , so I must repeat his explanation . "" My mother's name was Eyre ; she had two brothers ; one a clergyman , who married Miss Jane Reed , of Gateshead ; the other , John Eyre , Esq. , merchant , late of Funchal , Madeira . Mr. Briggs , being Mr. Eyre's solicitor , wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death , and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter , overlooking us , in consequence of a quarrel , never forgiven , between him and my father . He wrote again a few weeks since , to intimate that the heiress was lost , and asking if we knew anything of her . A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out . You know the rest . "" Again he was going , but I set my back against the door . "" Do let me speak , "" I said ; "" let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect . "" I paused--he stood before me , hat in hand , looking composed enough . I resumed -- "" Your mother was my father's sister ? "" "" Yes . "" "" My aunt , consequently ? "" He bowed . "" My uncle John was your uncle John ? You , Diana , and Mary are his sister's children , as I am his brother's child ? "" "" Undeniably . "" "" You three , then , are my cousins ; half our blood on each side flows from the same source ? "" "" We are cousins ; yes . "" I surveyed him . It seemed I had found a brother : one I could be proud of , -- one I could love ; and two sisters , whose qualities were such , that , when I knew them but as mere strangers , they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration . The two girls , on whom , kneeling down on the wet ground , and looking through the low , latticed window of Moor House kitchen , I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair , were my near kinswomen ; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation . Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch ! This was wealth indeed ! -- wealth to the heart ! -- a mine of pure , genial affections . This was a blessing , bright , vivid , and exhilarating ; -- not like the ponderous gift of gold : rich and welcome enough in its way , but sobering from its weight . I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded , my veins thrilled . "" Oh , I am glad ! -- I am glad ! "" I exclaimed . St. John smiled . "" Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles ? "" he asked . "" You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune ; and now , for a matter of no moment , you are excited . "" "" What can you mean ? It may be of no moment to you ; you have sisters and do n't care for a cousin ; but I had nobody ; and now three relations , -- or two , if you do n't choose to be counted , -- are born into my world full-grown . I say again , I am glad ! "" I walked fast through the room : I stopped , half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive , comprehend , settle them : -- thoughts of what might , could , would , and should be , and that ere long . I looked at the blank wall : it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars , -- every one lit me to a purpose or delight . Those who had saved my life , whom , till this hour , I had loved barrenly , I could now benefit . They were under a yoke , -- I could free them : they were scattered , -- I could reunite them : the independence , the affluence which was mine , might be theirs too . Were we not four ? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each , justice--enough and to spare : justice would be done , -- mutual happiness secured . Now the wealth did not weigh on me : now it was not a mere bequest of coin , -- it was a legacy of life , hope , enjoyment . How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm , I can not tell ; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me , and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it . He also advised me to be composed ; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction , shook off his hand , and began to walk about again . "" Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow , "" I said , "" and tell them to come home directly . Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds , so with five thousand they will do very well . "" "" Tell me where I can get you a glass of water , "" said St. John ; "" you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings . "" "" Nonsense ! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you ? Will it keep you in England , induce you to marry Miss Oliver , and settle down like an ordinary mortal ? "" "" You wander : your head becomes confused . I have been too abrupt in communicating the news ; it has excited you beyond your strength . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! you quite put me out of patience : I am rational enough ; it is you who misunderstand , or rather who affect to misunderstand . "" "" Perhaps , if you explained yourself a little more fully , I should comprehend better . "" "" Explain ! What is there to explain ? You can not fail to see that twenty thousand pounds , the sum in question , divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle , will give five thousand to each ? What I want is , that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them . "" "" To you , you mean . "" "" I have intimated my view of the case : I am incapable of taking any other . I am not brutally selfish , blindly unjust , or fiendishly ungrateful . Besides , I am resolved I will have a home and connections . I like Moor House , and I will live at Moor House ; I like Diana and Mary , and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary . It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds ; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand ; which , moreover , could never be mine in justice , though it might in law . I abandon to you , then , what is absolutely superfluous to me . Let there be no opposition , and no discussion about it ; let us agree amongst each other , and decide the point at once . "" "" This is acting on first impulses ; you must take days to consider such a matter , ere your word can be regarded as valid . "" "" Oh ! if all you doubt is my sincerity , I am easy : you see the justice of the case ? "" "" I _do_ see a certain justice ; but it is contrary to all custom . Besides , the entire fortune is your right : my uncle gained it by his own efforts ; he was free to leave it to whom he would : he left it to you . After all , justice permits you to keep it : you may , with a clear conscience , consider it absolutely your own . "" "" With me , "" said I , "" it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience : I must indulge my feelings ; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so . Were you to argue , object , and annoy me for a year , I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse--that of repaying , in part , a mighty obligation , and winning to myself lifelong friends . "" "" You think so now , "" rejoined St. John , "" because you do not know what it is to possess , nor consequently to enjoy wealth : you can not form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you ; of the place it would enable you to take in society ; of the prospects it would open to you : you can not -- "" "" And you , "" I interrupted , "" can not at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love . I never had a home , I never had brothers or sisters ; I must and will have them now : you are not reluctant to admit me and own me , are you ? "" "" Jane , I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights . "" "" Brother ? Yes ; at the distance of a thousand leagues ! Sisters ? Yes ; slaving amongst strangers ! I , wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit ! You , penniless ! Famous equality and fraternisation ! Close union ! Intimate attachment ! "" "" But , Jane , your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate : you may marry . "" "" Nonsense , again ! Marry ! I do n't want to marry , and never shall marry . "" "" That is saying too much : such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour . "" "" It is not saying too much : I know what I feel , and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage . No one would take me for love ; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation . And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising , alien , different from me ; I want my kindred : those with whom I have full fellow - feeling . Say again you will be my brother : when you uttered the words I was satisfied , happy ; repeat them , if you can , repeat them sincerely . "" "" I think I can . I know I have always loved my own sisters ; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded , -- respect for their worth and admiration of their talents . You too have principle and mind : your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's ; your presence is always agreeable to me ; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace . I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you , as my third and youngest sister . "" "" Thank you : that contents me for to-night . Now you had better go ; for if you stay longer , you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple . "" "" And the school , Miss Eyre ? It must now be shut up , I suppose ? "" "" No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute . "" He smiled approbation : we shook hands , and he took leave . I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had , and arguments I used , to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished . My task was a very hard one ; but , as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention ; and must , besides , have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration . The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer : both coincided in my opinion : I carried my point . The instruments of transfer were drawn out : St. John , Diana , Mary , and I , each became possessed of a competency ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical
1314	"This may vary from vendor to vendor , but NSS has n't tested the capabilities of these devices to "" learn "" the networks they 're installed in without manual intervention . The recommendation has always been to install them in a passive monitoring mode , watch what they alert on , and then have custom exclusions written for unique applications . NGFWs do not natively include the ability to ' self-learn ' the behavior of custom apps . It requires manual intervention to identify the unknown application traffic in order for the NGFW to properly identify and manage the application . What impact will the trend of social media webpages like Facebook moving towards https have on the ability to block "" specific "" traffic or traffic patterns ? You will need SSL interception capabilities on your NGFW . The most common problem in this type of implementation is to manage the whitelist / blacklist sites . For regulatory reasons corporations do not want to intercept SSL connections to employee benefits / payroll / personal banking sites . Many organizations now require secure file transfers ( SFTP or FTPS ) ... how can a next-gen firewall inspect that traffic if the data is encrypted ? Absolutely . One reason why you do n't hear much from most NGFW vendors about IPv6 is that they have not built in the dual-stack support and feature & performance parity necessary to provide the same level protection for IPv6 as they deliver for IPv4 traffic . In other words , they hope you do n't have a requirement to support IPv6 because they ca n't support it today . Why this is an issue is threefold : You likely have IPv6 traffic in your network whether you know it or not . Many devices and OS have supported native IPv6 enabled , and can send and receive IPv6 traffic by default . Dual stack support does n't mean feature parity , and most vendors only support IPv6 in software . Supporting IPv6 is just the first significant step – vendors have to invest the R & D resources to ensure that their products can deliver the same features / functions in both protocols , and also invest in the custom processors to deliver hardware-based acceleration of the IPv6 data to avoid becoming a security bottleneck . How quickly , realistically , can an organization expect to apply the Next-Gen Firewall capabilities to a legacy ruleset ? IPS is probably the easiest . Application control might be also quickly implemented if the organization has proper logging and analysis done on the legacy ruleset . Perhaps the NNGFW ( next-next-generation firewall ) ? In all seriousness , the NGFW will evolve , and the term will at some point be replaced . Vendors have to keep adding new features to keep pace with the changing networking environment . One area that we at Fortinet have launched is client reputation , which provides a set of behaviors that the FortiGate device uses to calculate a reputation score . The value of this is that a change in behavior by a device ( whether sudden or over an extended period of time ) will trigger an alert , providing a real-time method to identify the bad actors in your network at any time , as well as identity potentially compromised systems . Two trends we are certainly seeing are : 1 ) More consolidation – firewalls will get better at consolidating network security functions , not just IPS , but also URL filtering and advanced malware detection , and are likely to add more capabilities . 2 ) Virtual ( Hypervisor-based ) Firewalls – while adoption is limited currently , firewalls that can inspect VM to VM traffic will become more prevalent , as organizations will virtualize their environment to the point where workloads that differ in their security requirements are executed on the same physical machine . I think NGFW is still not mature , Data Loss Prevention is just scratching the surface of NGFW . IPv6 will bring some more challenges in firewall space . Content examination within protocols , digital marking for DLP , authentication function for bidirectional connection to support mobile devices are probably some areas of interest . Thanks to our panelists for responding to these questions . For more commentary on where the firewall is headed , check out our "" Evolution of the Firewall "" blog ."	Instruction	Instruction

138	"Potential of wind power projects under the Clean Development Mechanism in India Results : CDM Potential of Wind Power Projects in India Considerable variation has been observed in the reported values of the PLF of the wind power plants in the CDM Project Design Documents ( Table 5 ) . Therefore , in this study to estimate the CDM potential of wind power projects in India the PLF of the wind power plants have been taken as 25 % . There are five regional grids within the country – the Northern , Western , Southern , Eastern and North-Eastern . Therefore , the CO2 emissions mitigation potential through wind power projects in India is estimated on the basis of the regional grids , whose emission factors have been calculated by the Central Electricity Authority ( CEA ) of the Government of India in 2006 . Table 6 presents the estimated values of CDM potential through wind power projects in India on the basis of the regional baselines . We now do a sensitivity analysis with regards to additionality determination . The case of lax additionality assumes that all wind power projects submitted are registered . The median case assumes that the rejection rate remains at the current level ( 2 out of 18 projects , i . e . 11 % ) . The case of stringent additionality assumes that 50 % of the projects are registered . In the lax additionality case , gross annual CER potential of wind power in India reaches 86 million . Similarly , based on the technical potential of wind power projects in India the CDM potential has been estimated as 25 million tonne . Among all the states in India , Gujarat has the largest CO2 emissions mitigation potential through wind power ( 19 million tonne ) followed by Andhra Pradesh ( 15 . 6 million tonne ) , Madhya Pradesh ( 10 . 8 million tonne ) , Karnataka ( 12.5 million tonne ) , Rajasthan ( 8 . 9 million tonne ) , and so on ( Table 6 ) . The annual electricity generation by wind power projects based on the gross and technical potential is also given in Table 6 . With 25 % PLF of wind power projects the annual gross electricity generation potential has been estimated at 99 TWh whereas the annual technical electricity generation potential has been estimated at 28 TWh . Table 7 presents the projected values of the cumulative capacity of wind power and likely CER generation using the logistic model described in the Methods section while Figure 5 shows the development over time . It may be noted that with the current trend of dissemination of wind power projects in the country , around 22 GW capacity could be installed up to the end of first crediting period in the SS scenario whereas in the OS scenario 36 GW capacity could be installed . Up to the the year 2020 , more than 44 GW capacity of the wind power projects are expected to be installed that would generate 87 million CERs . Discussion : How the CDM could be applied to the Diffusion of Wind Power Projects ? The CDM was slow to take off as after the Marrakech Accords of 2001 it took another three years to define the bulk of the rules . The CDM Executive Board ( EB ) which is the body defining the CDM rules surprised many observers by taking a rigorous stance on critical issues such as baseline and additionality determination ( see below ) . Once the key rules were in place , a "" gold rush "" happened in 2005 and 2006 . Over 1500 projects were submitted with an estimated CER volume of about 1.5 billion . However , the volume share of renewable energy projects has been less than expected due to the high attractiveness of projects reducing industrial gases and methane from waste . Out of the 1478 CDM projects submitted to the EB , 456 projects had been registered by the EB till 20th December , 2006 [ 32,33 ] . 183 CDM projects related to wind energy of which 47 have been registered , 9 requested registration and 127 were at the validation stage [ 33 ] . Figure 6 presents the status of the wind power projects from India . Out of the 89 projects submitted to the UNFCCC , 18 projects had been registered and two projects had submitted the request for registration . 67 projects were at the validation stage whereas 2 projects had been rejected by the EB . The quantification of GHG benefits of a CDM project is done by means of a "" baseline "" . A baseline describes the ( theoretical ) emissions that would have occurred in case the CDM project was not implemented . The amounts of CERs that can be earned by the project are then calculated as the difference of baseline emissions and project emissions . The CO2 emissions mitigation benefits associated with a wind power project depend upon the amount of electricity saved . To estimate the CDM potential of wind power project in the country , the approved consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources ACM0002 ( Version 06 ) has been used . For the small scale CDM ( SSC ) projects , the small scale methodology AMS - I. D. "" Grid connected renewable electricity generation "" in its version of 23rd December 2006 [ 34 ] can be used which explicitly mentions wind power for electricity generation . In India , most of the wind power projects are grid connected and substitute grid electricity . Therefore , for such systems , the baseline is the kWh produced by the renewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient ( measured in g CO2eq . / kWh ) calculated in a transparent and conservative manner . This coefficient is 800 g CO2eq . / kWh for a grid where all generators use exclusively fuel oil and / or diesel fuel , whereas it is the weighted average of the so-called operating margin ( emission factor of all thermal power plants serving the grid ) and build margin ( emission factor of the most recently built plants that provide 20 % of the grid's electricity ) . For wind power , the weight of the operating margin is 0.75 while the build margin is weighted at 0.25 . Alternatively , project developers can use the weighted average emissions of the current generation mix but this will always be less than the emission factor derived previously and thus unattractive . For intermittent and non-dispatchable generation types such as wind and solar photovoltaic , ACM0002 allows to weigh the operating margin ( OM ) and build margin ( BM ) at 75 % and 25 % , respectively , however , in this study we have used combines margin by using equal weights for OM and BM as given in CEA document [ 35 ] . To maintain the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol , CERs are given only for "" additional "" activities that would otherwise not be expected to occur [ 36 ] . Therefore , any CDM project requires careful analysis of additionality . This has probably been the most contentious point in the development of the CDM and also resulted in great confusion amongst project developers [ 37,38 ] . The Kyoto Protocol stops short of requiring project proponents to show strict financial additionality – that the CDM revenue makes an uneconomic project economic – and left scope for the CDM EB to refine the demonstration of additionality . The EB subsequently took a fairly strict interpretation of additionality and developed an additionality tool which formally is voluntary but which has become de facto mandatory as it was incorporated in most baseline methodologies . The additionality tool requires an investment analysis and / or a barrier analysis to determine whether the CDM project is the most attractive realistic alternative . This means that the project can be profitable and additional as long as developers can show that another project type was even more profitable . It is estimated that wind power in many countries is already competitive with fossil fuel and nuclear power if social / environmental costs are considered [ 28 ] . However , in India , in terms of costs per kWh in grid-connected areas , costs of wind power are higher than electricity provided by a coal plant projects thus be additional at any rate . The unit cost of electricity generation is 0.05 € / kWh for coal and 0.06 € / kWh for fuel oil based system whereas in case of wind , the unit cost of electricity generation is 0.07 € / kWh in the best locations . The problem with this reasoning is that if wind projects are used to displace expensive grid electricity for industrial consumers ( priced at 0.09 € / kWh [ 39 ] ) , they are invariably the most attractive alternative unless they are built in locations with low wind speed . The situation for wind projects that supply to the grid at the state-guaranteed feed-in tariff is less clear ; the attractiveness depends on the level of the tariff . As the investment test will not be passed by most wind projects ( or only if they omit the tax incentives , as has been done by a project that achieved registration ) , project developers will use the barrier test . The barrier of higher capital cost compared to fossil fuel power plants is not really credible due to the abundance of capital for wind power in India and thus is mentioned only rarely . More credible barriers are low capacity utilization factor , and possible reduction in feed-in tariffs . The former depends on the siting of the project . The latter is very important as shown by the policy of Rajasthan ( see Table 3 ) and other states . In 2001 , Tamil Nadu Electricity Board ( TNEB ) changed its policy and froze the power purchase tariff for wind energy at Rs 2.70 per kWh with no escalation till 2006 and had informed that this power purchase tariff would be reviewed at 2006 and a new tariff would be fixed then . This was a major barrier for establishing new wind farms as other renewable energy plants continued to get a higher tariff . For instance , the power purchase tariff for electricity from an industrial waste / municipal waste based generation was Rs 3.49 for the year 2005 as against Rs 2.70 for wind energy . This policy encourages investors to invest in other renewable energy plants . Reduction in power purchase tariff was a major investment barrier . Moreover , feed-in-tariffs may be replaced by the Availability Based Tariff ( ABT ) in which the generators with firm delivery of power against commitment will start getting more prices for the generated power , whereas wind power producers can not guarantee supply of electricity and will be thus receive lower rates . For the projects that substitute grid electricity at industrial tariffs , there is the risk that the wind power benefit will melt down as liberalization permits industrial electricity consumers to choose the supplier in a competitive environment . Some projects have also highlighted the technological risks associated with new types of wind turbines . Lack of familiarity and experience with such new technologies can lead to perceptions of greater technical risk than for conventional energy sources . Doing the investment test – case study A 125 MW wind project in Karnataka calculated an IRR of 7.3 % . At that rate , the project would clearly be unattractive for an investor . However , the picture changes if one analyzes the project more closely . If one uses industry averages for the investment cost ( Rs 5 crore per MW ) , the IRR is 11 % . If one includes the accelerated depreciation of 80 % in the first year and the 10 year income tax holiday , the IRR reaches 22 % ( personal communication by Mr. Sanjeev Chadha ) . It would be difficult to find serious alternatives that are more attractive . Nevertheless , the project was registered by the EB . Table 5 presents the additionality arguments of Indian wind power projects . 14 projects out of 20 have carried out investment and barrier analysis for the justification of additionality whereas 6 projects carried out the barrier analysis only . An assessment of the PDD's indicates that the investment analysis is not convincing in most of the cases . Two wind projects from India were rejected due to lack of additionality . The rejection was mainly due to the following statement in the annual report of the company that had invested in the projects : "" The project is extremely beneficial on a standalone basis and has a payback period of three years with an internal rate of return in excess of 28 per cent . In addition to hedging Bajaj Auto's power costs , this investment also provides sales tax incentives and an income tax shield "" [ 40 ] ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
1454	Military Provisioning Guardian 6 Recommendations . 1 : Increasing long-term federal investment in high-technology industries , particularly those involving advanced research and manufacturing capabilities . The distinguishing attribute of the U.S. defense industrial base is technological innovation . As foreign nations continue manufac ¬ turing an ever-larger share of America's defense supplies , the United States increases its risk of diminishing its capacity to design and commercialize emerging defense technologies . To help ensure that our armed forces dominate the future battlefield , Congress should provide funding for American manufacturers to develop and implement advanced process technologies . 2 : Properly applying and enforcing existing laws and regulations to support the U.S. defense industrial base . Domestic source preferences already enacted into law , such as those that apply to the steel and titanium industries under the Specialty Metals Clause , must be retained to ensure that important defense capabilities remain secure and available for the U.S. armed forces . 3 : Developing domestic sources of key natural resources required by our armed forces . Right now the United States relies far too heavily on foreign nations for certain key metals and other raw materials needed to manufacture weapons systems and other military supplies . For example , most rare earth elements , which are essential components of many modern military technologies , currently must be purchased from China . The U.S. government and industry must stockpile these vital raw materials , strengthen efforts to resume mining and transformation of the materials in the United States , improve recycling to make more efficient use of current supplies , and identify alternate materials . 4 : Developing plans to strengthen our defense industrial base in the U.S. National Military Strategy , National Security Strategy , and the Quadrennial Defense Review process . This would make creating and sustaining a healthier defense industrial base a higher national priority , with a focus on increasing support for the most important and vulnerable industrial sectors . 8 : Crafting legislation to support a broadly representative defense industrial base strategy . Congress and the Administration must collaborate on economic and fiscal policies that budget for enduring national security capabilities and sustain the industrial base necessary to support them . 9 : Modernizing and securing defense supply chains through networked operations . These operations should be built on the excellent work that the DOD and industry are already doing to map and secure defense supply chains . The operations would provide ongoing communications between prime contractors and the supply chains they depend on . Closer communications , patterned on the networked operations of U.S. military forces around the world , would help managers identify and solve recurring problems with military supplies . 10 : Identifying potential defense supply chain chokepoints and planning to prevent disruptions . This recommendation would require determining the scope of foreign control over critical military supply chains and finding ways of restoring U.S. control . Subscribe Now !

Thus was I engaged when young Rupert Hentzau , who feared neither man nor devil , and rode through the demesne – where every tree might hide a marksman , for all he knew – as though it had been the park at Strelsau , cantered up to where I lay , bowing with burlesque deference , and craving private speech with me in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau . I made all withdraw , and then he said , seating himself by me : "" The King is in love , it seems ? "" "" Not with life , my lord , "" said I , smiling . "" It is well , "" he rejoined . "" Come , we are alone , Rassendyll – "" I rose to a sitting posture . "" What 's the matter ? "" he asked . "" I was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse , my lord . If you do not know how to address the King , my brother must find another messenger . "" "" Why keep up the farce ? "" he asked , negligently dusting his boot with his glove . "" Because it is not finished yet ; and meanwhile I 'll choose my own name . "" "" Oh , so be it ! Yet I spoke in love for you ; for indeed you are a man after my own heart . "" "" Saving my poor honesty , "" said I , "" maybe I am . But that I keep faith with men , and honour with women , maybe I am , my lord . "" He darted a glance at me – a glance of anger . "" Is your mother dead ? "" said I. "" Ay , she 's dead . "" "" She may thank God , "" said I , and I heard him curse me softly . "" Well , what 's the message ? "" I continued . I had touched him on the raw , for all the world knew he had broken his mother's heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house ; and his airy manner was gone for the moment . "" The duke offers you more than I would , "" he growled . "" A halter for you , sire , was my suggestion . But he offers you safe-conduct across the frontier and a million crowns . "" "" I prefer your offer , my lord , if I am bound to one . "" "" You refuse ? "" "" Of course . "" "" I told Michael you would ; "" and the villain , his temper restored , gave me the sunniest of smiles . "" The fact is , between ourselves , "" he continued , "" Michael does n't understand a gentleman . "" I began to laugh . "" And you ? "" I asked . "" I do , "" he said . "" Well , well , the halter be it . "" "" I 'm sorry you wo n't live to see it , "" I observed . "" Has his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on me ? "" "" I would you were a few years older , though . "" "" Oh , God gives years , but the devil gives increase , "" laughed he . "" I can hold my own . "" "" How is your prisoner ? "" I asked . "" The K – ? "" "" Your prisoner . "" "" I forgot your wishes , sire . Well , he is alive . "" He rose to his feet ; I imitated him . Then , with a smile , he said : "" And the pretty princess ? Faith , I 'll wager the next Elphberg will be red enough , for all that Black Michael will be called his father . "" I sprang a step towards him , clenching my hand . He did not move an inch , and his lip curled in insolent amusement . "" Go , while your skin's whole ! "" I muttered . He had repaid me with interest my hit about his mother . Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life . My friends were some thirty yards away . Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse , and dismissed the fellow with a crown . The horse stood near . I stood still , suspecting nothing . Rupert made as though to mount ; then he suddenly turned to me : his left hand resting in his belt , his right outstretched : "" Shake hands , "" he said . I bowed , and did as he had foreseen – I put my hands behind me . Quicker than thought , his left hand darted out at me , and a small dagger flashed in the air ; he struck me in the left shoulder – had I not swerved , it had been my heart . With a cry , I staggered back . Without touching the stirrup , he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow , pursued by cries and revolver shots – the last as useless as the first – and I sank into my chair , bleeding profusely , as I watched the devil's brat disappear down the long avenue . My friends surrounded me , and then I fainted . I suppose that I was put to bed , and there lay , unconscious , or half conscious , for many hours ; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind , and found Fritz beside me . I was weak and weary , but he bade me be of good cheer , saying that my wound would soon heal , and that meanwhile all had gone well , for Johann , the keeper , had fallen into the snare we had laid for him , and was even now in the house . "" And the queer thing is , "" pursued Fritz , "" that I fancy he 's not altogether sorry to find himself here . He seems to think that when Black Michael has brought off his coup , witnesses of how it was effected – saving , of course , the Six themselves – will not be at a premium . "" This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build hopes on his assistance . I ordered him to be brought in at once . Sapt conducted him , and set him in a chair by my bedside . He was sullen , and afraid ; but , to say truth , after young Rupert's exploit , we also had our fears , and , if he got as far as possible from Sapt's formidable six-shooter , Sapt kept him as far as he could from me . Moreover , when he came in his hands were bound , but that I would not suffer . I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow – all of which were honourably observed and paid , so that he lives now in prosperity ( though where I may not mention ) ; and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked , and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done . But he had persuaded all of his loyalty ; and though not in their secret counsels , was yet , by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle , able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices . And here , in brief , is his story : Below the level of the ground in the Castle , approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge , were situated two small rooms , cut out of the rock itself . The outer of the two had no windows , but was always lighted with candles ; the inner had one square window , which gave upon the moat . In the outer room there lay always , day and night , three of the Six ; and the instructions of Duke Michael were , that on any attack being made on the outer room , the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves . But , so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced , then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard ( for one of these two was always there ) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could , and himself pass into the inner room , and , without more ado , kill the King who lay there , well-treated indeed , but without weapons , and with his arms confined in fine steel chains , which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side . Thus , before the outer door were stormed , the King would be dead . And his body ? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself . "" Nay , sir , "" said Johann , "" his Highness has thought of that . While the two hold the outer room , the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window ( they turn on a hinge ) . The window now gives no light , for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware ; and this pipe , which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man , passes into the moat , coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water , so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe . The King being dead , his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body , and , dragging it to the window , raises it by a pulley ( for , lest the weight should prove too great , Detchard has provided one ) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe . He inserts the feet in the pipe , and pushes the body down . Silently , without splash or sound , it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat , which is twenty feet deep thereabouts . This done , the murderer cries loudly , "" All 's well ! "" and himself slides down the pipe ; and the others , if they can and the attack is not too hot , run to the inner room and , seeking a moment's delay , bar the door , and in their turn slide down . And though the King rises not from the bottom , they rise and swim round to the other side , where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes , to haul them out , and horses . And here , if things go ill , the duke will join them and seek safety by riding ; but if all goes well , they will return to the Castle , and have their enemies in a trap . That , sir , is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need . But it is not to be used till the last ; for , as we all know , he is not minded to kill the King unless he can , before or soon after , kill you also , sir . Now , sir , I have spoken the truth , as God is my witness , and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael ; for if , after he knows what I have done , I fall into his hands , I shall pray for one thing out of all the world – a speedy death , and that I shall not obtain from him ! "" The fellow's story was rudely told , but our questions supplemented his narrative . What he had told us applied to an armed attack ; but if suspicions were aroused , and there came overwhelming force – such , for instance , as I , the King , could bring – the idea of resistance would be abandoned ; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe . And – here comes an ingenious touch – one of the Six would take his place in the cell , and , on the entrance of the searchers , loudly demand release and redress ; and Michael , being summoned , would confess to hasty action , but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour of a lady in the Castle ( this was Antoinette de Mauban ) and he had confined him there , as he conceived he , as Lord of Zenda , had right to do . But he was now , on receiving his apology , content to let him go , and so end the gossip which , to his Highness's annoyance , had arisen concerning a prisoner in Zenda , and had given his visitors the trouble of this enquiry . The visitors , baffled , would retire , and Michael could , at his leisure , dispose of the body of the King . Sapt , Fritz , and I in my bed , looked round on one another in horror and bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan . Whether I went in peace or in war , openly at the head of a corps , or secretly by a stealthy assault , the King would be dead before I could come near him . If Michael were stronger and overcame my party , there would be an end . But if I were stronger , I should have no way to punish him , no means of proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also . On the other hand , I should be left as King ( ah ! for a moment my pulse quickened ) and it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and me . He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible . At the worst , he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path – with but one man between him and the throne , and that man an impostor ; at best , there would be none left to stand against him . I had begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting to his friends ; but now I acknowledged that the brains , if not the arms , of the conspiracy were his . "" Does the King know this ? "" I asked . "" I and my brother , "" answered Johann , "" put up the pipe , under the orders of my Lord of Hentzau . He was on guard that day , and the King asked my lord what it meant . "" Faith , "" he answered , with his airy laugh , "" it 's a new improvement on the ladder of Jacob , whereby , as you have read , sire , men pass from the earth to heaven . We thought it not meet that your Majesty should go , in case , sire , you must go , by the common route . So we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar can not stare at you or incommode your passage . That , sire , is the meaning of that pipe . "" And he laughed and bowed , and prayed the King's leave to replenish the King's glass – for the King was at supper . And the King , though he is a brave man , as are all of his House , grew red and then white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him . Ah , sir "" ( and the fellow shuddered ) , "" it is not easy to sleep quiet in the Castle of Zenda , for all of them would as soon cut a man's throat as play a game at cards ; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for a pastime than any other – ay , sooner than he would ruin a woman , though that he loves also . "" The man ceased , and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully guarded ; and , turning to him , I added : "" If anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda , you may answer "" Yes . "" But if any asks who the prisoner is , do not answer . For all my promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as to the prisoner of Zenda . I 'll kill you like a dog if the thing be so much as breathed within the house ! "" Then , when he was gone , I looked at Sapt . "" It 's a hard nut ! "" said I. "" So hard , "" said he , shaking his grizzled head , "" that as I think , this time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania ! "" and he broke out into curses on Michael's cunning . I lay back on my pillows . "" There seems to me , "" I observed , "" to be two ways by which the King can come out of Zenda alive . One is by treachery in the duke's followers . "" "" You can leave that out , "" said Sapt . "" I hope not , "" I rejoined , "" because the other I was about to mention is – by a miracle from heaven ! """	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical

1429	A How-To Guide for Purchasing Salvage Vehicles in Colorado Salvage yards are locations where vehicles that are worn out because of usage , cars that are no longer usable on the road , or vehicles that have been marked salvage by the state are kept . In addition , salvage yards in Colorado and other states are a destination for cars which have been seized by the state , an insurance company , or a financier . These institutions may repossess a vehicle from its owner because the owner defaulted on tax payments . Salvage yards may also house cars which have been recovered from crime scenes or have been found stolen . It may be difficult for the institutions that have seized the cars to maintain and store these vehicles because storing cars is an expensive endeavor . Said institutions may find it easier to sell off these cars to salvage yards in Colorado and other states to save costs . Therefore , salvage yards also house relatively new cars , which are brought to the site by these companies to be sold to new buyers for a cheaper price . The problem with newer salvage cars may be that their bumper is broken or their tail lights are smashed because of dangerous driving or from mishandling . There are numerous salvage yards in Colorado , and each of these yards also hosts their own website . If a potential buyer needs to locate salvage yards in Colorado , one simply needs to consult the yellow pages or go online and search for the salvage yard closest to one's vicinity . If one is interested in buying a car from a salvage yard in Colorado , one should follow a few steps . Firstly , one needs to register online by carefully choosing a salvage yard website and become a member of that online community . Secondly , after registration , which can be done online for a minimum fee , one will see a number of cars in the listing on the website . Each car listing will include numerous photographs taken from various angles of a specific car , and all other relevant information about the salvage car is provided to the user in a friendly way , if the site is well made . Thirdly , one needs to select which car he or she is interested in before one proceeds to place a bid for the car . Before one bids on the car of choice , one must ensure communication with the dealer by personally speaking with them at the salvage yard to determine exactly what is wrong with the specific car . If one is in the vicinity of the salvage yard , it is advisable to visit the yard firsthand along with an expert mechanic to find out what the car is missing . After this examination , the car can be purchased , and then the search for the missing spare part begins . The user can post a buying requirement at any of the salvage yards in Colorado via a website where the user is registered . This parts request sends information to all the warehouses in contact with the car dealer , and it is a much easier method for the user to locate the part , which can then be purchased for a reasonable price .

316	Rats That Bite There is an argument that suggests that any rat that bites should be humanely destroyed , as a biting rat is not acceptable as a pet . While I agree with that in part , there are also a whole host of reasons why this does not have to be the ' unwritten law ' of rat keeping . Pet rats are generally kept in cages - they can not bite anyone outside their cage , only someone who infringes on their territory by putting their fingers through the bars , or their hand through the door . Being a biter does not necessarily make the rat dangerous ( as long as you follow basic rules , like NOT sticking your fingers through the bars ) , neither does it mean that the rat in question ca n ' t have a long and fulfilled life ( it may be perfectly happy with cage mates ) . As an owner , you have to decide whether you are willing to accept the constraints of a biting rat and whether you are willing to put in the time and effort to correct this character flaw . You also have to consider , especially if there are children involved , whether it is realistic to even attempt to do this - it may be wiser to pass the rat over to someone else who is less interested in having the rat as a cuddly pet . It is very rare for pet rats to aggressively bite , but they can and will bite for a whole host of other reasons . Understanding the reason ( s ) can help an owner overcome the problem , or at least allow themselves not to be hurt when dealing with a particular rat , as well as allowing the rat to lead as normal a life as possible . The primary cause of any bite is fear . A well-socialised regularly handled rat is highly unlikely to bite compared to a solitary un-handled rat . Unfortunately , unless you buy your rats from reputable breeders , you will have no way of telling how socialised your new friends are until you try to pick them up - they may be used to the person in the pet shop , picking them up for short periods or shooing them out of the way while their cages are cleaned , but that does not mean they can cope with , or understand , the loving attentiveness of a new owner . As an owner you must be patient and understanding , giving your new friends time to settle into their new environment and introducing yourself to them slowly and carefully . Start off by just resting your hand in their cage , so they can get used to your smell , or try putting an old t-shirt that you 've recently worn in their cage . You will be able to tell , quite easily , which of your new rats are nervous and which are quite happy to see you : nervous rats will cower , run away , move in a jerky manner and make every attempt to avoid your hand at all costs ! This is when you need to be extra patient because the one thing that will get a rat to investigate you is curiosity . By talking calmly to the rats and not making any sudden movements , even the shyest of kittens will try and sneak a sniff , a lick or even a ' is it edible ? ' nip ( which wo n ' t hurt you at all ! ) . Trust building exercises , like letting rats lick yummy stuff from your fingers , help to teach the rat to associate hands with nice things and also that fingers are not for biting , only for licking . When venturing to pick up your baby rats , NEVER EVER pick them up by the tail - either use a scooping motion supporting the tummy , or place your first 2 fingers either side of their neck , just above the shoulders , with your thumb and remaining fingers supporting their tummy . You obviously ca n ' t do this with bigger rats , unless you have big hands ! Once you 've scooped them up you must support their feet : rats feel very vunerable when left dangling in mid-air ! When you first get your baby rats out of their cage , do n't go too far with them - stay close to the cage so that they can still smell it and , if they panic , you can easily put them back . You must handle your baby rats daily , for at least 20 minutes - there is a theory that a baby rat can not stay frightened for more than 20 minutes so , by handling them for at least this length of time in any one go , they will realise that there 's nothing to be frightened of . However , some rats are far more nervous than others , and can show obvious distress at being handled after only a very short time . Stress is very bad for rats so I would suggest that nervous rats should have their handling time gradually increased - a little amount of handling but several times a day . If they are particularly nervous you will need to make sure they do n't associate your visits with just being handled : on one visit to the cage handle them , on the next give them a treat , on the next just have your hand in etc. If you do have nervous babies , it may be worth considering not giving them a covered bed or bolt-hole in their cage : this may seem a bit harsh but most pet shops do not provide cover and , for the first few weeks at least , it will be easier for you to handle the rats if you do n't have to chase them round the cage or fish them out of a hidey-hole ! Gradual but continual ( and that 's the key ! ) trust building will socialise your rats in no time and , though it wo n ' t guarantee a shoulder or lap rat ( that depends on the personality of the rat ) , it will almost certainly guarantee that your baby rats wo n ' t grow up to be biters ! Older rats that bite are more of a problem and the reasons behind their biting can be more complex and harder to figure out . If you ' adopt ' an adult biter , you have no way of telling whether it has been handled regularly , whether it has been mistreated or whether it is insecure and unsocialised . Trust training can also work with adult rats , though will probably take longer and require a lot more persistence on your part . Thick gardening gloves can be worn to minimise the risk of damage to fingers , or some people use a thick towel to scoop or catch the rat in , should it be necessary to handle it . You have to decide whether this will stress the rat out and undo all your hard work of trust training , or whether you should ignore the handling aspect of socialising your rat until it feels safe in your company and is used to you lightly touching or brushing it with your fingers . There is no need to feel rushed in your socialisation and trust training of your new rat - each rat is different and each will take their own time to ' come round ' to your way of thinking ! Being naturally sociable animals , it is very rare for a rat to just be aggressive and unhandleable with no hope of character redemption , but any rat that exhibits outward unprovoked aggression should NEVER be bred from . Responsible breeders breed as much for character as they do for colouring and they socialise their rats almost from birth , getting them used to being handled from an early age - a good reason to consider buying your rats from breeders rather than pet shops , which can sometimes breed and sell rodents for reptile food ( ' feeders ' ) and are consequently uninterested in the character and health of the animals they produce .

1342	"News The Latest from Databerry Oracle Releases New Java Patch September 6th , 2012 by Geoey Cook Earlier last week , Oracle released a patch for their Java web programming code aimed to resolve certain flaws hackers were exploiting . If you 've been keeping up with news surrounding Oracle , you may be aware that a number of hacker attacks have been made through their Java programming language . This raised concerns of several digital security firms worldwide . In an effort to prevent further attacks , Oracle has released a Java patch to fix the flaw being exploited by hackers . To learn more about this recent patch and whether or not it worked , keep reading . Did The Patch Work ? Apparently , researchers are saying the patch did in fact fix two errors that were being exploited by hackers to cause malicious attacks . With that said , the Java 7 patch also opened up several other vulnerabilities . I guess you could compare Oracle's recent patch to a "" double-edged sword "" in the sense that it fixed one problem but opened up another . Because Oracle was able to release the Java 7 patch so quickly , analysts say they had patch ready for months . So , if Oracle had the patch ready , why did n't they release it ? Well , patches need to be ran through a quality assurance team to ensure they work and do n't break other parts of the system , and it 's likely that Oracle was doing this for their Java 7 patch . It 's unclear as to when Oracle will release another patch aimed at fixing the current vulnerabilities opened up by their most recent Java 7 patch . However , security analysts are saying it needs to be soon , as hackers could potentially utilize those for yet another series of attacks . In any case , be aware of phishing emails when you 're checking your inbox ."	News	News

900	"What was this ?  cried Keola , who came to himself the first , because he was the younger . "" The pang of it was like death . "" "" It matters not , "" panted Kalamake . "" It is now done . "" "" And , in the name of God , where are we ? "" cried Keola . "" That is not the question , "" replied the sorcerer . "" Being here , we have matter in our hands , and that we must attend to . Go , while I recover my breath , into the borders of the wood , and bring me the leaves of such and such a herb , and such and such a tree , which you will find to grow there plentifully - three handfuls of each . And be speedy . We must be home again before the steamer comes ; it would seem strange if we had disappeared . "" And he sat on the sand and panted . Keola went up the beach , which was of shining sand and coral , strewn with singular shells ; and he thought in his heart - "" How do I not know this beach ? I will come here again and gather shells . "" In front of him was a line of palms against the sky ; not like the palms of the Eight Islands , but tall and fresh and beautiful , and hanging out withered fans like gold among the green , and he thought in his heart - "" It is strange I should not have found this grove . I will come here again , when it is warm , to sleep . "" And he thought , "" How warm it has grown suddenly ! "" For it was winter in Hawaii , and the day had been chill . And he thought also , "" Where are the grey mountains ? And where is the high cliff with the hanging forest and the wheeling birds ? "" And the more he considered , the less he might conceive in what quarter of the islands he was fallen . In the border of the grove , where it met the beach , the herb was growing , but the tree further back . Now , as Keola went toward the tree , he was aware of a young woman who had nothing on her body but a belt of leaves . "" Well ! "" thought Keola , "" they are not very particular about their dress in this part of the country . "" And he paused , supposing she would observe him and escape ; and seeing that she still looked before her , stood and hummed aloud . Up she leaped at the sound . Her face was ashen ; she looked this way and that , and her mouth gaped with the terror of her soul . But it was a strange thing that her eyes did not rest upon Keola . "" Good day , "" said he . "" You need not be so frightened ; I will not eat you . "" And he had scarce opened his mouth before the young woman fled into the bush . "" These are strange manners , "" thought Keola . And , not thinking what he did , ran after her . As she ran , the girl kept crying in some speech that was not practised in Hawaii , yet some of the words were the same , and he knew she kept calling and warning others . And presently he saw more people running - men , women and children , one with another , all running and crying like people at a fire . And with that he began to grow afraid himself , and returned to Kalamake bringing the leaves . Him he told what he had seen . "" You must pay no heed , "" said Kalamake . "" All this is like a dream and shadows . All will disappear and be forgotten . "" "" It seemed none saw me , "" said Keola . "" And none did , "" replied the sorcerer . "" We walk here in the broad sun invisible by reason of these charms . Yet they hear us ; and therefore it is well to speak softly , as I do . "" With that he made a circle round the mat with stones , and in the midst he set the leaves . "" It will be your part , "" said he , "" to keep the leaves alight , and feed the fire slowly . While they blaze ( which is but for a little moment ) I must do my errand ; and before the ashes blacken , the same power that brought us carries us away . Be ready now with the match ; and do you call me in good time lest the flames burn out and I be left . "" As soon as the leaves caught , the sorcerer leaped like a deer out of the circle , and began to race along the beach like a hound that has been bathing . As he ran , he kept stooping to snatch shells ; and it seemed to Keola that they glittered as he took them . The leaves blazed with a clear flame that consumed them swiftly ; and presently Keola had but a handful left , and the sorcerer was far off , running and stopping ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical

51	"CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice . ' Who are YOU ? ' said the Caterpillar . This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . Alice replied , rather shyly , ' I--I hardly know , sir , just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then . ' ' What do you mean by that ? ' said the Caterpillar sternly . ' Explain yourself ! ' ' I ca n ' t explain MYSELF , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . ' ' I do n't see , ' said the Caterpillar . ' I 'm afraid I ca n ' t put it more clearly , ' Alice replied very politely , ' for I ca n ' t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . ' ' It is n't , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , perhaps you have n ' t found it so yet , ' said Alice ; ' but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day , you know--and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n ' t you ? ' ' Not a bit , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , perhaps your feelings may be different , ' said Alice ; ' all I know is , it would feel very queer to ME . ' ' You ! ' said the Caterpillar contemptuously . ' Who are YOU ? ' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation . Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who YOU are , first . ' ' Why ? ' said the Caterpillar . Here was another puzzling question ; and as Alice could not think of any good reason , and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind , she turned away . ' Come back ! ' the Caterpillar called after her . ' I 've something important to say ! ' This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again . ' Keep your temper , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Is that all ? ' said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could . ' No , ' said the Caterpillar . Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . For some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , ' So you think you 're changed , do you ? ' ' I 'm afraid I am , sir , ' said Alice ; ' I ca n ' t remember things as I used--and I do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! ' ' Ca n ' t remember WHAT things ? ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , I 've tried to say "" HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE , "" but it all came different ! ' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice . ' Repeat , "" YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , "" ' said the Caterpillar . Alice folded her hands , and began : -- ' You are old , Father William , ' the young man said , ' And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head -- Do you think , at your age , it is right ? ' ' In my youth , ' Father William replied to his son , ' I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door -- Pray , what is the reason of that ? ' ' In my youth , ' said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , ' I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box -- Allow me to sell you a couple ? ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak -- Pray how did you manage to do it ? ' ' In my youth , ' said his father , ' I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life . ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ? ' ' I have answered three questions , and that is enough , ' Said his father ; ' do n't give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I 'll kick you down stairs ! ' ' That is not said right , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Not QUITE right , I 'm afraid , ' said Alice , timidly ; ' some of the words have got altered . ' ' It is wrong from beginning to end , ' said the Caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes . The Caterpillar was the first to speak . ' What size do you want to be ? ' it asked . ' Oh , I 'm not particular as to size , ' Alice hastily replied ; ' only one does n ' t like changing so often , you know . ' ' I DO N'T know , ' said the Caterpillar . Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper . ' Are you content now ? ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , I should like to be a LITTLE larger , sir , if you would n ' t mind , ' said Alice : ' three inches is such a wretched height to be . ' ' It is a very good height indeed ! ' said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) . ' But I 'm not used to it ! ' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone . And she thought of herself , ' I wish the creatures would n ' t be so easily offended ! ' ' You 'll get used to it in time , ' said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again . This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again . In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself . Then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , ' One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . ' ' One side of WHAT ? The other side of WHAT ? ' thought Alice to herself . ' Of the mushroom , ' said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight . Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question . However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand . ' And now which is which ? ' she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot ! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ' Come , my head 's free at last ! ' said Alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . ' What CAN all that green stuff be ? ' said Alice . ' And where HAVE my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I ca n ' t see you ? ' She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves . As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings . ' Serpent ! ' screamed the Pigeon . ' I 'm NOT a serpent ! ' said Alice indignantly . ' Let me alone ! ' ' Serpent , I say again ! ' repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ' I 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! ' ' I have n ' t the least idea what you 're talking about , ' said Alice . ' I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ' the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; ' but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! ' Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished . ' As if it was n ' t trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the Pigeon ; ' but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day ! Why , I have n ' t had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! ' ' I 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning . ' And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ' continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , ' and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! ' ' But I 'm NOT a serpent , I tell you ! ' said Alice . ' I 'm a--I 'm a -- ' ' Well ! WHAT are you ? ' said the Pigeon . ' I can see you 're trying to invent something ! ' ' I--I 'm a little girl , ' said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . ' A likely story indeed ! ' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . ' I 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that ! No , no ! You 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! ' ' I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly , ' said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; ' but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . ' ' I do n't believe it , ' said the Pigeon ; ' but if they do , why then they 're a kind of serpent , that 's all I can say . ' This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , ' You 're looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? ' ' It matters a good deal to ME , ' said Alice hastily ; ' but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I should n ' t want YOURS : I do n't like them raw . ' ' Well , be off , then ! ' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest . Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height . It was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual . ' Come , there 's half my plan done now ! How puzzling all these changes are ! I 'm never sure what I 'm going to be , from one minute to another ! However , I 've got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done , I wonder ? ' As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high . ' Whoever lives there , ' thought Alice , ' it 'll never do to come upon them THIS size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! ' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical
1088	"1 Application-level Fault-Tolerance Protocols arXiv : 1611 . 02273v1 [ cs . SE ] 5 Nov 2016 Vincenzo De Florio University of Antwerp , Middelheimlaan 1 , 2020 Antwerp , Belgium Preface 1 INTRODUCTION The central topic of this book is application-level fault-tolerance , that is the methods , architectures , and tools that allow to express a fault-tolerant system in the application software of our computers . Application-level fault-tolerance is a sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on the problems of expressing the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers . This book shows that application-level fault-tolerance is a key ingredient to craft truly dependable computer systems – other approaches , such as hardware fault-tolerance , operating system fault-tolerance , or fault-tolerant middleware , are also important ingredients to achieve resiliency , but they are not enough . Failing to address the application layer means leaving a backdoor open to problems such as design faults , interaction faults , or malicious attacks , whose consequences on the quality of service could be as unfortunate as , e.g. , a physical fault affecting the system platform . In other words , in most cases it is simply not possible to achieve complete coverage against a given set of faults or erroneous conditions without embedding fault-tolerance provisions also in the application layer . In what follows the provisions for application-level fault-tolerance are called application-level fault-tolerance protocols . As a lecturer in this area , I wrote this book as my ideal textbook for a possible course on resilient computing and for my doctoral students in software dependability at the University of Antwerp . Despite this , the main goal of this book is not – only – education . The main mission of this book is first of all spreading the awareness of the necessity of application-level fault-tolerance . Another critical goal is highlighting the role of several important concepts that are often neglected or misunderstood : The fault and the system models , i.e. , the assumptions on top of which our computer services are designed and constructed . Last but not the least of our goals , this book aims to provide a clear view to the state-of-the-art of application-level fault-tolerance , also highlighting in the process a number of lessons learned through hands-on experiences gathered in more than 10 years of work in the area of resilient computing . It is our belief that any person who wants to include dependability among the design goals of their intended software services should have a clear understanding of concepts such as dependability , system models , failure semantics , and fault models and of their influence on their final product's quality of experience . Such information is often scattered among research papers while it is presented here in a unitary Application-level fault-tolerance is defined in what follows as the sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on how to express the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers . Traditionally research in this sub-class was initiated by Brian Randell with his now classical article on which system structure to give our programs in order to be tolerant to faults ( Randell , 1975 ) . The key problem expressed in that paper was that of a cost-effective solution to embed fault-tolerance in the application software . Recovery blocks ( treated in Chapter 4 ) was the proposed solution . Randell was also the first to state the insufficiency of fault-tolerance solutions based exclusively on hardware designs and the need of appropriate structuring techniques such that the incorporation of a set of fault-tolerance provisions in the application software could be performed in a simple , coherent , and well structured way . A first proposal for the embedding recovery blocks in a programming language was proposed shortly afterwards ( Shrivastava , 1978 ) . Leaving the safe path of hardware fault-tolerance brought about new problems and challenges : Hardware redundancy guarantees random component failures , while software replication does not guarantee statistical independence of failures . In other words , a single cause may produce many ( undesirable ) effects . This means that "" in software the redundancy required is not simple replication of programs but redundancy of design "" ( Randell , 1975 ) . An answer to this problem and another important milestone was the conception of N - version programming by Algirdas Aviz ̆ ienis ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , which combines hardware and information redundancy in the attempt to reduce the chance of correlated failures in the software components . At the same time , the very meaning of computing and programming was evolving , again bringing new possibilities but also opening up new problems and challenges : The spread of distributed systems meant also the end of the purely synchronous model for computing and communication ( see for instance ( Jalote , 1994 ) and ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) and Chapter 2 ) ; object orientation made it possible to easily reuse third-party software components , but turned our applications into a chain of links of unknown strength and trustworthiness ( Green , 1997 ) . The logics for assembling the links together is in our applications , hence it is clear that the logics to prevent the break of those links to lead to disaster must also involve the application layer ( Saltzer , Reed , & Clark , 1984 ) . Luckily from the object model there began to stem several variants , such as composition filters , distributed objects , or fragmented objects , that would provide the programmer with powerful tools for fault-tolerance programming in the application layer ( see Chapter 6 for a few examples ) . Other approaches are also being devised , e.g. aspect-oriented programming – though their potential as fault-tolerance language is yet to be confirmed ( see Chapter 8 for a brief introduction ) . Still other approaches are also discussed in this book . A special accent is given to those approaches where the author had first-hand experience with . In one case – the Ariel recovery language – the reader is provided with enough details to even understand how the approach has been crafted . We are now at the verge of yet another change , with ubiquitous computing , service orientation and the novel Web technology promising to serve us as even more powerful solutions to accompany us in the transition towards the Information Society of tomorrow . Such topics would require a book on their own and have not been treated here . Still the problems of application-level fault-tolerance are with us , while to date no ultimate and general-purpose solution has been found out . This book is about this possibly unique case in computer science and engineering of a problem yet unsolved though being formulated more than 30 years ago . Table 1 : A short introduction to application-level fault-tolerance framework and from the viewpoint of the application-level dependable software engineer . Another aspect that makes this book unique from all others in the field is the fact that concepts are described with examples that , in some cases , reach a deep level of detail . This is not the case in all chapters , as it reflects the spectrum of working experiences that the author had during more than a decade of research in this area . Any such spectrum is inherently not uniformly distributed . As a consequence some chapters provide the reader with in-depth knowledge , down to the level of source code examples , while others just introduce the reader into the subject , explain the main concepts , and place the topic in the wider context of methods treated in this book . To increase readability , we isolated some of the most technical texts into quoted sections typed in blue . Furthermore , this book has a privileged viewpoint , which is the one of real-time , concurrent , and embedded system design . This book does not focuses in particular on the design of fault-tolerance provisions for service-oriented applications , such as web services , and does not cover fault-tolerance in the middleware layer . In what follows the background top-level information and the structure of this book are introduced . 2 BACKGROUND AND STRUCTURE No man conceived tool in human history has ever permeated so many aspects of human life as the computer has been doing for the last 60 years . An outstanding aspect of this success story is certainly given by an overwhelming increase in computer performance . Another one , also very evident , is the continuous decrease of costs of computer devices – A 1000 $ PC today provides its user with more performance , memory , and disk space of a million dollar mainframe of the Sixties . Clearly performance and costs are "" foreground figures "" – society at large is well aware of their evolution and of the societal consequences of the corresponding spread of computers . On the other hand this process is also characterized by "" background figures "" , that is , properties that are often overlooked despite their great relevance . Among such properties it is worth mentioning the growth in complexity and the crucial character of the roles nowadays assigned to computers : Human society more and more expects and relies on good quality of complex services supplied by computers . More and more these services become vital , in the sense that lack of timely delivery ever more often can have immediate consequences on capitals , the environment , and even human lives . Strangely though it may appear , the common man is well aware that computers get ever more powerful and less expensive , but does n't seem to be aware or even care about computers being safe and up to their ever more challenging tasks . The turn of the century brought about this problem for the first time – the Millennium Bug , also known as Y2K , reached the masses with striking force , as a tsunami of sudden awareness that "" yes , computers are powerful , but even computers can fail . "" Y2K ultimately did not show up , and the dreaded scenarios of a society simultaneously stripped by its computer services ended up in a few minor accidents . c 2008 Marvel Characters , Figure 1 : Perception of dependability in the Sixties ( TM & Inc. All Rights Reserved . ) But society had had a glimpse to some of the problems that are central to this book : Why do we trust computer services ? Are there modeling , design , development practices , conceptual tools , and concrete methods , to convince me that when I take a computer service , that service will be reliable , safe , secure , available ? In other words , is there a science of computer dependability , such that reliance of computer systems can be measured , hence quantitatively justified ? And , is there an engineering of computer dependability , such that trustworthy computer services can be effectively achieved ? Dependability – the discipline that studies those problems – is introduced in Chapter 1 . This book in particular focuses on fault-tolerance , which is described in Chapter 1 as one of the "" means "" for dependability : Fault-tolerance is one of the four classes of methods and techniques enabling one to provide the ability to deliver a service on which reliance can be placed , and to reach confidence in this ability ( together with fault prevention , fault removal , and fault forecasting ) . Its core objective is "" preserving the delivery of expected services despite the presence of fault-caused errors within the system itself "" ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . The exact meaning of faults and errors is also given in the cited chapter , together with an introduction to fault-tolerance mainly derived from the works of Jean-Claude Laprie ( Laprie , 1992 , 1995 , 1998 , 1985 ) . What is important to remark here is that fault-tolerance acts after faults have manifested themselves in the system : Its main assumption is that faults are inevitable , but they must be tolerated , which is fundamentally different from other approaches where , e.g. , faults are sought to be avoided in the first place . Why focusing on fault-tolerance , why is it so important ? For the same reason referred above as a background figure in the history of the relationship between human society and computers : The growth in complexity . Systems get more and more complex , and there are no effective methods that can provide us with a zero-fault guarantee . The bulk of the research of computer scientists and engineers concentrated on methods to pack conveniently ever more complexity in computer systems . Software in particular has become a point of accumulation of complexity , and the main focus so far has been on how to express and compose complex software modules so as to tackle ever new challenging problems rather than dealing with the inevitable faults introduced by that complexity . Layered design is a classical method to deal with complexity . Software , software fault-tolerance , and application-level software fault-tolerance , are the topics of Chapter 2 . It is explained what does it mean that a program is fault-tolerant and what are the properties expected from a fault-tolerant program . The main objective of Chapter 2 is introducing two sets of design assumptions that shape the way people structure their fault-tolerant software – the system and the fault models . Often misunderstood or underestimated , those models describe • what is expected from the execution environment in order to let our software system function correctly , • and what are the faults that our system is going to consider . Note that a fault-tolerant program shall ( try to ) tolerate only those faults stated in the fault model , and will be as defenseless against all other faults as any non fault-tolerant program . Together with the system specification , the fault and system models represent the foundation on top of which our computer services are built . Not surprisingly enough , weak foundations often result in fragile constructions . To provide evidence to this , the chapter introduces three well-known accidents – the Ariane 5 flight 501 and Mariner-1 disasters and the Therac-25 accidents ( Leveson , 1995 ) . In each case it has been stressed out what went wrong , what were the biggest mistakes , and how a careful understanding of fault models and system models would have helped highlighting the path to avoid catastrophic failures that cost considerable amounts of money and even the lives of innocent people . After this , the chapter focuses on the core topic of this book , application-level software fault-tolerance . Main questions addressed here are : How to express and achieve fault-tolerance in the mission layer ? And , why is application-level software fault-tolerance so important ? The main reason for this is that a computer service is the result of the concurrent execution of several "" virtual "" and physical machines ( see Fig. 2 ) . Some of these machines run a predefined , special-purpose service , meant to serve – unmodified – many different applications . The hardware , the operating system , the network layers , the middleware , a programming language's run-time executive , and so forth , are common names of those machines . A key message in this book is that tolerating the faults in one machine does not protect from faults originating in another one . This includes the application layer . Now , while the machines "" below "" the application provide architectural ( special-purpose ) complexity , the mission layer contributes to computer services with general-purpose complexity , Figure 2 : Computer Services are the result of layered designs . The higher you go , the more specialized is the layer . which is intrinsically less reliable . This and other reasons justifying the need for application-level software fault-tolerance are given in that chapter . The main references here are ( Randell , 1975 ; Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ) . Chapter 2 also introduces what the author considers to be the three main properties of application-level software fault-tolerance : Separation of design concerns , adaptability , and syntactical adequacy ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008b ) . In this context the key questions are : Given a certain fault-tolerance provision , is it able to guarantee an adequate separation of the functional and non-functional design concerns ? Does it tolerate a fixed , predefined set of faulty scenarios , or does it dynamically change that set ? And , is it flexible enough as to host a large number of different strategies , or is it a "" hardwired "" solution tackling a limited set of strategies ? Finally , this chapter defines a few fundamental fault-tolerance services , namely watchdog timers , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing-and-rollback . After having described the context and the "" rules of the game "" , this book discusses the state of the art in application-level fault-tolerance protocols . First , in Chapter 3 , the focus is on so-called single-version and multiple-version software fault-tolerance ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . • Single-version protocols are methods that use a non-distributed , single task provision , running side by side with the functional software , often available in the form of a library and a run-time executive . • Multiple-version protocols are methods that use actively a form of redundancy , as explained in what follows . In particular the chapter discusses recovery blocks and N-version programming . Chapter 3 also features several in-depth case studies deriving from the author's research experiences in the field of resilient computing . In particular the EFTOS fault-tolerance library ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) is introduced as an example of application-level single-version software fault-tolerance approach . In that general framework , the EFTOS tools for exception handling , distributed voting , watchdog timers , fault-tolerant communication , atomic transactions , and data stabilization , are discussed . The reader is also given a detailed description of RAFTNET ( Raftnet , n.d. ) , a fault-tolerance library for data parallel applications . A second large class of application-level fault-tolerance protocols is the focus of Chapter 4 , namely the one that works "" around "" the programming language , that is to say either embedded in the compiler or via language transformations driven by translators . In that chapter it is also discussed the design of a translator supporting language-independent extensions called reflective and refractive variables and linguistic support for adaptively redundant data structures . • Reflective and refractive variables ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007a ) are syntactical structures to express adaptive feedback loops in the application layer . This is useful to resilient computing because a feedback loop can attach error recovery strategies to error detection events . • Redundant variables ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008a ) are a tool that allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of redundancy is not fixed once and for all at design time , but rather it changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . The chapter shows that by a simple translation approach it is possible to provide sophisticated features such as adaptive fault-tolerance to programs written in any programming language . In Chapter 5 te reader gets in touch with methods that work at the level of the language itself : Custom fault-tolerance programming languages . In this approach fault-tolerance is not embedded in the program , nor around the programming language , but provided through the syntactical structures and the run-time executives of fault-tolerance programming languages . Also in this case application-level complexity is enucleated from the source code and shifted to the architecture , where it is much easier and cost-effective to tame . Three classes of approaches are treated – object-oriented languages , functional languages , and hybrid languages . In the latter class special emphasys is given to Oz ( Müller , Müller , & Van Roy , 1995 ) , a multi-paradigm programming language that achieves both transparent distribution and translucent failure handling . A separate chapter is devoted to a large case study in fault-tolerant languages : The so-called recovery language approach ( De Florio , 2000 ; De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2001 ) . In Chapter 6 the concept of recovery language is first introduced in general terms and then proposed through an implementation : the Ariel recovery language and a supporting architecture . That architecture is an evolution of the EFTOS system described in Chapter 3 , and targets distributed applications with non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language such as C , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a predefined set of processing nodes . Ariel and its run-time system provide the user with a fault-tolerance linguistic structure that appears to the user as a sort of second application-level especially conceived and devoted to address the error recovery concerns . This separation is very useful at design time , as it allows to bound design complexity . In Ariel this separation holds also at run-time , because even the executable code for error recovery is separated from the functional code . This means that , in principle , the error recovery code could change dynamically so as to match a different set of internal and environmental conditions . This can be used to avoid "" hardwiring "" a fault model into the application – an important property especially when , e.g. , the service is embedded in a mobile terminal ( De Florio & Blondia , 2005 ) . Chapter 7 discusses fault-tolerance protocols based on aspect-oriented programming ( Kiczales et al. , 1997 ) , a relatively novel structuring technique with the ambition to become the reference solution for system development , the way object-orientation did starting with the Eighties . We must remark how aspects and their currently available implementations have not yet reached a maturity comparable with that of the other techniques discussed in this book . For instance , the chapter remarks how no aspect-oriented fault-tolerance language has been proposed to date and , at least in same cases , the adequacy of aspects as a syntactical structure to host fault-tolerance provisions has been questioned . On the other hand , aspects allow regarding the source code as a flexible web of syntactic fragments that the designer can rearrange with great ease , deriving modified source codes matching particular goals , e.g. performance and , hopefully in the near future , dependability . The chapter explains how aspects allow to separate design concerns , which bounds complexity and enhances maintainability , and presents three programming languages : AspectJ ( Kiczales , 2000 ) , AspectC ++ ( Spinczyk , Lohmann , & Urban , 2005 ) and GluonJ ( GluonJ , n.d. ) . The following chapter , Chapter 8 , deals with failure detection protocols in the application layer . First the concept of failure detection ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) , a fundamental building block to develop fault-tolerant distributed systems , is introduced . Then the relationship between failure detection and system models is highlighted – the key assumptions on which our dependable services are built , which were introduced in Chapter 2 . Then it is introduced a tool for the expression of this class of protocols ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007b ) , based on a library of objects called time-outs ( V. De Florio , 2006 ) . Finally a case study is described in detail : The failure detection protocol employed by the so-called EFTOS DIR net ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) , a distributed "" backbone "" for fault-tolerance management which was introduced in Chapter 3 and that later evolved into the so-called Backbone discussed in Chapter 6 . Hybrid approaches are the focus of Chapter 9 , that is , fault-tolerance protocols that blend two or more methods among those reported in previous chapters . In more detail RεLinda is introduced – a system coupling the recovery language approach of Chapter 6 and generative communication , one of the models introduced in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Deconinck , 2001 ) . After this the recovery language-empowered extensions of two single-version mechanisms previously introduced in Chapter 3 are described , namely a distributed voting mechanism and a watchdog timer ( De Florio , Donatelli , & Dondossola , 2002 ) . The main lessons learned in this case are that the recovery language approach allows to fast-prototype complex strategies by composing a set of building blocks together and by building system-wide , recovery-time coordination strategies with the Ariel language . This allows set up sophisticated fault-tolerance systems while keeping the management of their complexity outside of the user application . Other useful properties achieved in this way are transparency of replication and transparency of location . Chapter 10 provides three examples of approaches used to assess the dependability of application-level provisions . In the first case reliability analysis is used to quantify the benefits of coupling an approach such as recovery languages to a distributed voting mechanism ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Then a tool is used to systematically inject faults onto the adaptively redundant data structure discussed in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008a ) . Monitoring and fault-injection are the topic of the third case , where a hypermedia application to watch and control a dependable service is introduced ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Chapter 11 concludes the book by summarizing the main lessons learned . It also offers a view to the internals of the application-level fault-tolerance provision described in Chapter 6 – the Ariel recovery language . 3 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS Application software development is not an easy task ; writing truly dependable fault-tolerant applications is even more difficult , not only in itself for the additional complexity required by fault-tolerance but often also because of the lack of awareness which is necessary in order to master the complexity of this tricky task . The first and foremost contribution of this book is increasing the awareness of the role and significance of application-level fault-tolerance . This has been reached by highlighting important concepts that are often neglected or misunderstood , as well as introducing the available tools and approaches that can be used to craft high-quality dependable services by working also in the application layer . Secondly , this book summarizes the most widely known approaches to application-level software fault-tolerance . A base of properties in which those approaches can be compared and assessed is defined . Finally , this book features a collection of several research experiences the author had in the field of resilient computing through his participation to several research projects funded by the European Community . This large first-hand experience is reflected into the deep level of detail that is reached in some cases . We hope that the above contributions will prove useful to the readers and intrigue them into entering the interesting arena of resilient computing research and development . Also , too many times the lack of awareness and know-how in resilient computing has brought the designers to supposedly robust systems whose failures had in some cases dreadful consequences on capitals , the environment , and even human lives – as a joke we call them sometimes "" endangeneers "" . We hope that this book may contribute to the spread of that awareness and know-how that should always be part of the education of dependable software engineers . This important requirement is witnessed by several organizations such as the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems Reliability , Safety and Security , technical committee 7 ) , whose mission is "" To promote the economical and efficient realization of programmable industrial systems through education , information exchange , and the elaboration of standards and guidelines "" ( EWICS , n.d. ) , and the ReSIST network of excellence ( ReSIST , n.d. ) , which is developing a resilient computing curriculum recommended to all people involved in teaching dependability-related subjects .

Concepts such as reliability , safety , or security , have been used inconsistently by different communities of researchers : The real-time system community , the secure computing 1 community , and so forth , each had its own "" lingo "" and was referring to concepts such faults , errors and failures without the required formal foundation . This changed in the early Nineties , when Jean-Claude Laprie finally introduced a tentative model for dependable computing . To date , the Laprie model of dependability is the most widespread and accepted formal definition for the terms that play a key role in this book . As a consequence , the rest of this chapter introduces that model . 2 DEPENDABILITY , RESILIENT COMPUTING , AND FAULT-TOLERANCE As just mentioned the central topic of this chapter is dependability , defined in ( Laprie , 1985 ) as the trustworthiness of a computer system such that reliance can justifiably be placed on the service it delivers . In this context , service means the manifestations of a set of external events perceived by the user as the behavior of the system ( Aviz ̆ ienis , Laprie , & Randell , 2004 ) user means another system , e.g. , a human being , or a physical device , or a computer application , interacting with the former one . The concept of dependability as described herein was first introduced by Jean-Claude Laprie ( Laprie , 1985 ) as a contribution to an effort by IFIP Working Group 10.4 ( Dependability and Fault-Tolerance ) aiming at the establishment of a standard framework and terminology for discussing reliable and fault-tolerant systems . The cited paper and other works by Laprie are the main sources for this chapter – in particular ( Laprie , 1992 ) , later revised as ( Laprie , 1995 ) and ( Laprie , 1998 ) . A more recent work in this framework is ( Aviz ̆ ienis , Laprie , Randell , & Landwehr , 2004 ) . Professor Laprie is continuously revising his model , also with the contributions of various teams of researchers in Europe and abroad – let me just cite here the EWICS TC7 ( European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems Reliability , Safety and Security , technical committee 7 ) , whose mission is "" To promote the economical and efficient realization of programmable industrial systems through education , information exchange , and the elaboration of standards and guidelines "" ( EWICS , n.d. ) , and the ReSIST network of excellence ( ReSIST , n.d. ) , boasting a 50-million items resilience knowledge base ( Anderson , Andrews , & Fitzgerald , 2007 ) , which developed a resilient computing curriculum recommended to all involved in teaching dependability-related subjects . Laprie's is the most famous and accepted definition of dependability , but it is certainly not the only one . Not surprisingly , due to the societal relevance of such a topic , dependability has also slightly different definitions ( Motet & Geffroy , 2003 ) . According to Sommervilla ( Sommervilla , 2006 ) , for instance , dependability is "" The extent to which a critical system is trusted by its users "" . This is clearly a definition that focuses more on how the user perceives the system than on how the system actually is trustworthy . It reflects the extent of the user's confidence that the system will operate as users expect and in particular without failures . In other words , dependability is considered by Sommervilla and others as a measure of the quality of experience of a given user and a given service . From this descends that the objective of dependability engineers is not to make services failure-proof , but to let its users believe so ! Paraphrasing Patterson and Hennessy ( Patterson & Hennessy , 1996 ) , if a particular hazard does not occur very frequently , it may not be worth the cost to avoid it . This means that residual faults are not only inevitable , but sometimes even expected . It 's the notion of "" dependability economics "" : Because of the very high costs of dependability achievement , in some cases it may be more cost effective to accept untrustworthy systems and pay for failure costs . This is especially relevant when time-to-market is critical to a product's commercial success . Reaching the market sooner with a sub-optimal product may bring more revenues than doing so with a perfectly reliable product surrounded by early bird competitors that have already captured the interest and trust of the public . In what follows the book shall stick to Laprie's model of dependability . Following such model , a precise and complete characterization of dependability is given 1 . by enumerating its basic properties or attributes , 2 . by explaining which phenomena constitute potential impairments to it , and 3 . by reviewing the scientific disciplines and the techniques that can be adopted as means for improving dependability . Attributes , impairments , and means can be globally represented into one picture as a tree , traditionally called the dependability tree ( Laprie , 1995 ) ( see Fig. 1 ) . 2.1 The Attributes of Dependability As just mentioned , dependability is a general concept that embraces a number of different properties ( Walkerdine , Melville , & Sommerville , 2002 ) . These properties correspond to different viewpoints from which the user perceives the quality of the offered service – in other words , for different users there will be in general different key properties corresponding to a positive assessment of the service : • Availability is the name of the property that addresses the readiness for usage . • Reliability is the property that measures the continuity of service delivery . Figure 1 : The dependability tree • The property expressing the reliance on the non-occurrence of events with catastrophic consequences on the environment is known as safety . • The property that measures the reliance on the non-occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information has been called confidentiality . • The property that measures the reliance on the non-occurrence of improper alterations of information has been called integrity . • The property that expresses the ability to undergo repairs and upgrades has been called maintainability . These properties qualify dependability , and therefore are known as its attributes ( Laprie , 1995 ) . Certain combinations of these attributes received a special name – security ( Jonsson , 1998 ; Bodeaum , 1992 ) , for instance , is defined as the conjoint requirement for integrity , availability , and confidentiality . This section defines a number of important measures of a system's quality of service , including some of the attributes presented in Sect . 2.1 that are most relevant in what follows . 2.1.1 Reliability When we take a plane , or even just a lift , the key property we expect from the computer system behind the service is that it proceed without flaws for the entire duration of the service . Any disruption of the service in the middle of the run would be disastrous . Reliability is the property that measures the continuity of service delivery . In other words , one expects – and hopes ! – that airborne systems be reliable throughout their flights ! More formally , reliability is defined as the conditional probability that the system will perform correctly throughout interval [ t0 , t ] , given that the system was performing correctly at time t0 ( Johnson , 1989 ) . Time t0 is usually omitted and taken as the current time . The general notation for reliability is therefore R ( t ) . The negative counterpart of reliability , unreliability , is defined as Q ( t ) = 1 − R ( t ) , and represents the conditional probability that the system will perform incorrectly during the interval [ t0 , t ] , given that the system was performing correctly at time t0 . Unreliability is also known as the probability of failure . 2.1.2 Mean Time To Failure , Mean Time To Repair , and Mean Time Between Failures If a system is known to fail , it makes sense to ask how long the system can be expected to run without problems . Such figure is called Mean Time to Failure ( MTTF ) . MTTF is defined as the expected time that a system will operate before the occurrence of its first failure . Another important property is Mean Time to Repair ( MTTR ) . MTTR is defined as the average time required for repairing a system . It is often specified by means of a repair rate μ , namely the average number of repairs that occur per time unit . Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) is the average time between any two consecutive failures of a system . This is slightly different from MTTF which regards on a system 's very first failure . The following relation holds : MTBF = MTTF + MTTR . As it is usually true that MTTR is a small fraction of MTTF , it is usually allowed to assume that MTBF ≈ MTTF . 2.1.3 Availability When we need to perform a banking transaction , or when we press the brake pedal while driving our car , or when we take an elevator and press the key corresponding to the floor we need to reach , the key property we expect from the system is that it serve us – it allow us to complete our transaction , or to slow down our car , or simply that the elevator works . What really matters is not how long the system worked so far , but that it works the moment we need it . This property is called availability . Availability is defined as a function of time representing the probability that a service is operating correctly and is available to perform its functions at the instant of time t ( Johnson , 1989 ) . It is usually represented as function A ( t ) . Availability represents a property at a given point in time , whereas reliability concerns time intervals . These two properties are not to be mistaken with each other – a system might exhibit a good degree of availability and yet be rather unreliable , e.g. , when inoperability is pointwise or rather short . Availability can be approximated as the total time that a system has been capable of supplying its intended service divided by the elapsed time that system has been in operation , i.e. , the percentage of time that the system is available to perform its expected functions . The steady-state availability can be proven ( Johnson , 1989 ) to be MTTF · Ass = MTTF + MTTR 2.1.4 Safety Safety is the attribute of dependability that measures a system's ability to operate , normally or not , without damaging that system's environment ( Sommervilla , 2006 ) . So though it might seem a little strange at first , safety does not take into account the correctness of the system . In other words , while e.g. reliability is a functional attribute , this is not the case for safety . With reliability , quality is related to conformance to the functional specifications . With safety , quality is non-functional . A crashed system would exhibit minimal reliability and maximal safety . As remarked by Sommervilla , because of the increasing number of software-based control systems , software safety is being recognized as an important aspect of overall system safety . Systems where the issue of safety is particularly important , to the point that failures may lead to loss of lives or severe environmental damages are called life-critical or mission-critical systems ( Storey , 1996 ) . An example architecture for safety-critical systems is Cardamon ( Corsaro , 2005 ) . 2.1.5 Maintainability Maintainability is a function of time representing the probability that a failed system will be repaired in a time less than or equal to t . Maintainability can be estimated as M ( t ) = 1 − exp − μt , μ being the repair rate , assumed to be constant ( see Sect . 2.1.2 ) . 2.2 Impairments to Dependability Hardware and software systems must conform to certain specifications , i.e. , agreed upon descriptions of the expected system response corresponding to any initial system state and input , as well as the time interval within which the response should occur . This includes a description of the functional behavior of the system – basically , what the system is supposed to do , or in other words , a description of its service – and possibly a description of other , non-functional requirements . Some of these requirements may concern the dependability of the service . In real life , any system is subject to internal or external events that can affect in different ways the quality of its service . These events have been partitioned into three classes by their cause-effect relationship : depending on this , an impairment can be classified as a fault , an error , or a failure . When the delivered service of a system deviates from its specification , the user of the system experiences a failure . Such failure is due to a deviation from the correct state of the system , known as an error . That deviation is due to a given cause , for instance related to the physical state of the system , or to bad system design . This cause is called a fault . A failure of a system could give rise to an event that is perceived as a fault by the user of that system , bringing to a concatenation of cause-and-effects events known as the "" fundamental chain "" ( Laprie , 1985 ) : ... fault ⇒ error ⇒ failure ⇒ fault ⇒ error ⇒ failure ⇒ ... ( symbol "" ⇒ "" can be read as "" brings to "" ) . Attributes defined in Sect . 2.1 can be negatively affected by faults , errors , and failures . For this reason , failures , errors , and faults have been collectively termed as the "" impairments "" of dependability . They are characterized in the following three paragraphs . 2.2.1 Failures Failures System failures occur when the system does not behave as agreed in the system specifications or when the system specification did not properly describe its function . This can happen in many different ways ( Cristian , 1991 ) : omission failures occur when an agreed reply to a well defined request is missing . The request appears to be ignored ; timing failures occur when the service is supplied , though outside the real-time interval agreed upon in the specifications . This may occur when the service is supplied too soon ( early timing failure ) , or too late ( late timing failure , also known as performance failure ) ; response failures happen either when the system supplies an incorrect output ( in which case the failure is said to be a value failure ) , or when the system executes an incorrect state transition ( state transition failure ) ; crash failure is when a system continuously exhibits omission failures until that system is restarted . In particular , a pause-crash failure occurs when the system restarts in the state it had right before its crash , while a halting-crash occurs when the system simply never restarts . When a restarted system re-initialises itself wiping out the state it had before its crash , that system is said to have experienced an amnesia crash . It may also be possible that some part of a system's state is re-initialized while the rest is restored to its value before the occurrence of the crash – this is called a partial-amnesia crash . Defining the above failure classes allows extending a system's specification – that is , the set of its failure-free behaviors – with failure semantics , i.e. , with the failure behavior that system is likely to exhibit upon failures . This is important when programming strategies for recovery after failure ( Cristian , 1991 ) . For instance , if the service supplied by a communication system may delay transmitted messages but never lose or corrupt them , then that system is said to have performance failure semantics . If that system can delay and also lose them , then it is said to have omission / performance failure semantics . In general , if the failure semantics of a system s allows it to exhibit a behavior in the union of two failure classes F and G , then s is said to have F / G failure semantics . In other words , the "" slash "" symbol can be read as the union operator among sets . For any given s it is possible to count the possible failure behaviors in a failure class . Let us call b this function from the set of failure classes to integers . Then , given failure classes F and G , b ( F / G ) = b ( F UG ) = b ( F ) + b ( G ) . Failure semantics can be partially ordered by means of function b : Given any two failure semantics F and G , then F is said to exhibit a weaker ( less restrictive ) failure semantics than G : F < G ≡ b ( F ) > b ( G ) . In particular , it is true that F / G < F. Therefore , the union of all possible failure classes represents the weakest failure semantics possible . If system s exhibits such semantics , s is said to have arbitrary failure semantics , i.e. , s can exhibit any failure behavior , without any restriction . By its definition , arbitrary failure semantics is also weaker than arbitrary value failure semantics . This latter is also known as Byzantine failure semantics ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) . In the case of stateless systems , pause-crash and halting-crash behaviors are subsets of omission failure behaviors ( Cristian , 1991 ) , so omission failure semantics is in this case weaker than pause-crash and halting-crash failure semantics . As clearly stated in ( Cristian , 1991 ) , it is the responsibility of a system designer to ensure that it properly implements a specified failure semantics . For instance , in order to implement a processing service with crash failure semantics , one can use duplication with comparison : Two physically independent processors executing in parallel the same sequence of instructions and comparing their results after the execution of each instruction . As soon as a disagreement occurs , the system is shut down ( Powell , 1997 ) . Another possibility is to use self-checking capabilities . Anyway , given any failure semantics F , it is up to the system designer to decide how to implement it , also depending on the designer's other requirements , e.g. , those concerning Figure 2 : Failure classes . costs and expected performance . In general , the weaker the failure semantics , the more expensive and complex it is its implementation . Moreover , a weak failure semantics imply higher costs in terms of redundancy exhaustion ( see Sect . 3 ) and , often , higher performance penalties . For this reason , the designer may leave the ultimate choice to the user – for instance , the designer of the Motorola C compiler for the PowerPC allows the user to choose between two different modes of compilation – the fastest mode does not guarantee that the state of the system pipeline be restored on return from interrupts ( Sun , 1996 ) . This translates into behaviors belonging to the partial-amnesia crash semantics . The other mode guarantees the non-occurrence of these behaviors at the price of a lower performance for the service supplied by that system – programs compiled with this mode run slower . Failures can also be characterized according to the classification in Fig. 2 ( Laprie , 1995 ) , corresponding to the different viewpoints of • failure domain ( i.e. , whether the failure manifests itself in the time or value domain ) , • failure perception ( i.e. , whether any two users perceive the failure in the same way , in which case the failure is said to be consistent , or differently , in which the failure is said to be inconsistent ) , • and consequences on the environment . In particular a failure is said to be benign when consequences are of the same order as the benefits provided by normal system operation , while it is said catastrophic when consequences are incommensurably more relevant than the benefits of normal operation ( Laprie , 1995 ) . Systems that provide a given failure semantics are often said to exhibit a "" failure mode "" . For instance , systems having arbitrary failure semantics ( in both time and value domains ) are called fail-uncontrolled systems , while those only affected by benign failures are said to be fail-safe systems ; likewise , systems with halt-failure semantics are referred to as fail-halt systems . These terms are also used to express the behavior a system should have when dealing with multiple failures – for instance , a "" fail-op , fail-op , fail-safe "" system is one such that is able to withstand two failures and then behaves as a fail-safe system ( Rushby , 1994 ) ( fail-op stands for "" after failure , the system goes back to operational state "" ) . Finally , it is worth mentioning the fail-time-bounded failure mode , introduced in ( Cuyvers , 1995 ) , which assumes that all errors are detected within a pre-defined , bounded period after the fault has occurred . 2.2.2 Errors An error is the manifestation of a fault ( Johnson , 1989 ) in terms of a deviation from accuracy or correctness of the system state . An error can be either latent , i.e. , when its presence in the system has not been yet perceived , or detected , otherwise . Error latency is the length of time between the occurrence of an error and the appearance of the corresponding failure or its detection . 2.2.3 Faults A fault ( I. Lee & Iyer , 1993 ) is a defect , or an imperfection , or a lack in a system's hardware or software component . It is generically defined as the adjudged or hypothesised cause of an error . Faults can have their origin within the system boundaries ( internal faults ) or outside , i.e. , in the environment ( external faults ) . In particular , an internal fault is said to be active when it produces an error , and dormant ( or latent ) when it does not . A dormant fault becomes an active fault when it is activated by the computation process or the environment . Fault latency is defined as either the length of time between the occurrence of a fault and the appearance of the corresponding error , or the length of time between the occurrence of a fault and its removal . Faults can be classified according to five viewpoints ( Laprie , 1992 , 1995 , 1998 ) – phenomenological cause , nature , phase of creation or occurrence , situation with respect to system boundaries , persistence . Not all combinations can give rise to a fault class – this process only defines 17 fault classes , summarized in Fig. 3 . These classes have been further partitioned into three "" groups "" , known as combined fault classes . The combined fault classes that are more relevant in the rest of the book are now briefly characterized : Physical faults : • Permanent , internal , physical faults . This class concerns those faults that have their origin within hardware components and are continuously active . A typical example is given by the fault corresponding to a worn out component . • Temporary , internal , physical faults ( also known as intermittent faults ) ( Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 1997 ) . These are typically internal , physical defects that become active depending on a particular pointwise condition . • Permanent , external , physical faults . These are faults induced on the system by the physical environment . Figure 3 : Laprie's fault classification scheme . • Temporary , external , physical faults ( also known as transient faults ) ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . These are faults induced by environmental phenomena , e.g. , EMI . Design faults : • Intentional , though not malicious , permanent / temporary design faults . These are basically trade-offs introduced at design time . A typical example is insufficient dimensioning ( underestimations of the size of a given field in a communication protocol1 , and so forth ) . • Accidental , permanent , design faults ( also called systematic faults , or Bohrbugs ) : flawed algorithms that systematically turn into the same errors in the presence of the same input conditions and initial states – for instance , an unchecked divisor that can result in a division-by-zero error . • Accidental , temporary design faults ( known as Heisenbugs , for "" bugs of Heisenberg "" , after their elusive character ) : while systematic faults have an evident , deterministic behavior , these bugs depend on subtle combinations of the system state and environment . Interaction faults : • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , accidental faults . These include operator faults , in which an operator does not correctly perform his or her role in system operation . • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , non-malicious faults : "" neglect , interaction , or incorrect use problems "" ( Sibley , 1998 ) . Examples include poorly chosen passwords and bad system parameter setting . • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , malicious faults . This class includes the so-called malicious replication faults , i.e. , faults that occur when replicated information in a system becomes inconsistent , either because replicates that are supposed to provide identical results no longer do so , or because the aggregate of the data from the various replicates is no longer consistent with system specifications . 2.3 Means for Dependability Developing a dependable service , i.e. , a service on which reliance can be placed justifiably , calls for the combined utilisation of a set of methods and techniques globally referred to as the "" means for dependability "" ( Laprie , 1998 ) : fault prevention aims at preventing the occurrence or introduction of faults . Techniques in this category include , e.g. , quality assurance and design methodologies ; fault-tolerance groups methods and techniques to set up services capable of fulfilling their function in spite of faults ; fault removal aims at reducing the number , incidence , and consequences of faults . Fault removal is composed of three steps : verification , diagnosis and correction . Verification checks whether the system adheres to certain properties – the verification conditions – during the design , development , production or operation phase ; if it does not , the fault ( s ) preventing these conditions to be fulfilled must be diagnosed , and the necessary corrections ( corrective maintenance ) must be made ; fault forecasting investigates how to estimate the present number , the future incidence and the consequences of faults . Fault forecasting is conducted by evaluating the system behavior with respect to fault occurrence or activation . Qualitatively , it aims at identifying , classifying and ordering failure modes or at identifying event combinations leading to undesired effects . Quantitatively , it aims at evaluating ( in terms of probabilities ) some of the attributes of dependability . Of the above mentioned methods , fault-tolerance represents the core tool for the techniques and tools presented in this book . Because of this , it is discussed in more detail in Sect . 2.3.1 . 2.3.1 Fault-Tolerance Fault-tolerance methods come into play the moment a fault enters the system boundaries . Its core objective is "" preserving the delivery of expected services despite the presence of fault-caused errors within the system itself "" ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . Fault-tolerance has its roots in hardware systems , where the assumption of random component failures is substantiated by the physical characteristics of the adopted devices ( Rushby , 1994 ) . According to ( Anderson & Lee , 1981 ) , fault-tolerance can be decomposed into two sub-techniques – error processing and fault treatment . Error processing aims at removing errors from the computational state ( if possible , before failure occurrence ) . It can be based on the following primitives ( Laprie , 1995 ) : Error detection , which focuses on detecting the presence in the system of latent errors before they are activated . This can be done , e.g. , by means of built-in self-tests or by comparison with redundant computations ( Rushby , 1994 ) . Error diagnosis i.e. , assessing the damages caused by the detected errors or by errors propagated before detection . Error recovery consists of methods to replace an erroneous state with an error-free state . This replacement takes one of the following forms : 1 . Compensation , which means reverting the erroneous state into an error-free one exploiting information redundancy available in the erroneous state , predisposed , e.g. , through the adoption of error correcting codes ( Johnson , 1989 ) . 2 . Forward recovery , which finds a new state from which the system can operate ( frequently in degraded mode ) . This method only allows recovering from errors of which the damage can be anticipated 2 – therefore , this method is system dependent ( P. Lee & Anderson , 1990 ) . The main tool for forward error recovery , according to ( Cristian , 1995 ) , is exception handling . 3 . Backward recovery , which substitutes an erroneous state by an error-free state prior to the error occurrence . As a consequence , the method requires that , at different points in time ( known as recovery points ) , the current state of the system be saved in some stable storage means . If a system state saved in a recovery point is error-free , it can be used to restore the system to that state , thus wiping out the effects of transient faults . For the same reason , this technique allows also to recover from errors of which the damage can not or has not been anticipated . The need for backward error recovery tools and techniques stems from their ability to prevent the occurrence of failures originated by transient faults , which are many times more frequent than permanent faults ( Rushby , 1994 ) . The main tools for backward error recovery are based on checkpoint-and-rollback ( Deconinck , 1996 ) and recovery blocks ( Randell , 1975 ) ( see Chapter 3 ) . According to ( Rushby , 1994 ) , an alternative technique with respect to error recovery is fault masking , classically achieved by modular redundancy ( Johnson , 1989 ) : a redundant set of components perform independently on the same input value . Results are voted upon . The basic assumption of this method is again that of random component failures – in other words , to be effective , modular redundancy requires statistical independence , because correlated failures translate in contemporary exhaustion of the available redundancy . Unfortunately a number of experiments ( Eckhardt et al. , 1991 ) and theoretical studies ( Eckhardt & Lee , 1985 ) have shown that often this assumption is incorrect , to the point that even independent faults are able to produce correlated failures . In this context , the concept of design diversity ( or N - version programming ) came up ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . It is discussed in Chapter 3 . Fault treatment aims at preventing faults from being re-activated . It can be based on the following primitives ( Laprie , 1995 ) : Fault diagnosis i.e. , identifying the cause ( s ) of the error ( s ) , in location and nature , i.e. determining the fault classes to which the faults belong . This is different from error diagnosis ; besides , different faults can lead to the same error . Fault passivation i.e. , preventing the re-activation of the fault . This step is not necessary if the error recovery step removes the fault , or if the likelihood of re-activation of the fault is low enough . Reconfiguration updates the structure of the system so that non-failed components fulfill the system function , possibly at a degraded level , even though some other components have failed . 3 FAULT-TOLERANCE , REDUNDANCY , AND COMPLEXITY A well-known result by Shannon ( Shannon , Winer , & Sloane , 1993 ) tells us that , from any unreliable channel , it is possible to set up a more reliable channel by increasing the degree of information redundancy . This means that it is possible to trade off reliability and redundancy of a channel . The author of this book observes that the same can be said for a fault-tolerant system , because fault-tolerance is in general the result of some strategy effectively exploiting some form of redundancy – time , information , and / or hardware redundancy ( Johnson , 1989 ) . This redundancy has a cost penalty attached , though . Addressing a weak failure semantics , able to span many failure behaviors , effectively translates in higher reliability – nevertheless , 1 . it requires large amounts of extra resources , and therefore implies a high cost penalty , and 2 . it consumes large amounts of extra resources , which translates into the rapid exhaustion of the extra resources . For instance , a well-known result by Lamport et al. ( Lamport et al. , 1982 ) sets the minimum level of redundancy required for tolerating Byzantine failures to a value that is greater than the one required for tolerating , e.g. , value failures . Using the simplest of the algorithms described in the cited paper , a 4-modular-redundant ( 4-MR ) system can only withstand any single Byzantine failure , while the same system may exploit its redundancy to withstand up to three crash faults – though no other kind of fault ( Powell , 1997 ) . In other words : After the occurrence of a crash fault , a 4-MR system with strict Byzantine failure semantics has exhausted its redundancy and is no more dependable than a non-redundant system supplying the same service , while the crash failure semantics system is able to survive to the occurrence of that and two other crash faults . On the other hand , the latter system , subject to just one Byzantine fault , would fail regardless its redundancy . Therefore , for any given level of redundancy , trading complexity of failure mode against number and type of faults tolerated may be considered as an important capability for an effective fault-tolerant structure . Dynamic adaptability to different environmental conditions3 may provide a satisfactory answer to this need , especially when the additional complexity does not burden ( and jeopardize ) the application . Ideally , such complexity should be part of a custom architecture and not of the application . On the contrary , the embedding in the application of complex failure semantics , covering many failure modes , implicitly promotes complexity , as it may require the implementation of many recovery mechanisms . This complexity is detrimental to the dependability of the system , as it is in itself a significant source of design faults . Furthermore , the isolation of that complexity outside the user application may allow cost-effective verification , validation and testing . These processes may be unfeasible at application level . The author of this book conjectures that a satisfactory solution to the design problem of the management of the fault-tolerance code ( presented in Chapter 2 ) may translate in an optimal management of the failure semantics ( with respect to the involved penalties ) . The fault-tolerance linguistic structure proposed in Chapter 6 allows solving the above problems by means of its adaptability . 4 CONCLUSION This chapter has introduced the reader to Laprie's model of dependability describing its attributes , impairments , and means . The central topic of this book , fault-tolerance , has also been briefly discussed . The complex relation between the management of fault-tolerance , of redundancy , and of complexity , has been pointed out . In particular , a link has been conjectured between attribute adaptability and the dynamic ability to trade off the complexity of failure mode against number and type of faults being tolerated .

Currently , an IP address consists of four sections separated by periods . Each section contains an 8-bit value , for a total of 32 bits per address . Normally this would allow for more than 4 billion possible IP addresses – a rather acceptable value . Unfortunately , due to a lavish method for assigning IP address space , IP addresses are rapidly running out . A new protocol , IPv6 ( Hinden & Deering , 1995 ) , is going to fix this problem through larger data fields ( 128-bit addresses ) and a more flexible allocation algorithm . 2 In general , program specifications are not complete : there exist input states for which the behavior of the corresponding program P has been left unspecified . No forward recovery technique can be applied to deal with errors resulting from executing P on these input states . On the contrary , if a given specification is complete , that is , if each input state is covered in the set G of all the standard and exceptional specifications for P , and if P is totally correct , i.e. fully consistent with what prescribed in G , then P is said to be robust ( Cristian , 1995 ) . In this case forward recovery can be used as an effective tool for error recovery . 3 The following quote by J. Horning ( Horning , 1998 ) captures very well how relevant may be the role of the environment with respect to achieving the required quality of service : "" What is the most often overlooked risk in software engineering ?

The main objective of this chapter is introducing two sets of design assumptions that shape the way our fault-tolerant software is structured – the system and the fault models . Often misunderstood or underestimated , those models describe • what is expected from the execution environment in order to let our software system function correctly , • and what are the faults that our system is going to consider . Note that a fault-tolerant program shall ( try to ) tolerate only those faults stated in the fault model , and will be as defenseless against all other faults as any non fault-tolerant program . Together with the system specification , the fault and system models represent the foundation on top of which our computer services are built . It is not surprising that weak foundations often result in falling constructions . What is really surprising is that in so many cases little or no attention had been given to those important factors in fault-tolerant software engineering . To give an idea of this , three well-known accidents are described – the Ariane 5 flight 501 and Mariner-1 disasters and the Therac-25 accidents . In each case it is stressed what went wrong , what were the biggest mistakes , and how a careful understanding of fault models and system models would have helped highlighting the path to avoid catastrophic failures that cost considerable amounts of money and even the lives of innocent people . The other important objective of this chapter is introducing the core subject of this book : Software fault-tolerance situated at the level of the application layer . First of all , it is explained why targeting ( also ) the application layer is not an open option but a mandatory design choice for effective fault-tolerant software engineering . Secondly , given the peculiarities of the application layer , three properties to measure the quality of the methods to achieve fault-tolerant application software are introduced : 1 . Separation of design concerns , that is , how good the method is in keeping the functional aspects and the fault-tolerance aspects separated from each other . 2 . Syntactical adequacy , namely how versatile the employed method is in including the wider spectrum of fault-tolerance strategies . 3 . Adaptability : How good the employed fault-tolerance method is in dealing with the inevitable changes characterizing the system and its run-time environment , including the dynamics of faults that manifest themselves at service time . Finally , this chapter also defines a few fundamental fault-tolerance services , namely watchdog timers , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing-and-rollback . 2 WHAT IS A FAULT-TOLERANT PROGRAM ? So what makes a program fault-tolerant ? In order to answer this key question , let us further detail what a service is : In the following a service is considered as a set of manifestations of external events that , if compliant to what agreed upon in a formal specification , can be considered by a watcher as being "" correct "" . This said , a program can be defined as a physical entity , stored for instance as voltage values in a set of memory cells , which is supposed to drive the production of a service . One of the main goals of software engineering is being able to set up of a robust link ( in mathematical terms , a emphhomomorphism / ) between a service's high-level specification and a low-level computer design ( the program ) . More formally , for some functions f and g it is true that Service = f ( program ) , program = g ( specification ) . A first ( obvious ) conclusion is the hard link between the service and its specification : Service = g · f ( specification ) . Building robust versions of f and g is well known as being a difficult , non trivial job . Now let us concentrate on the range of g ( the software set ) . For any two systems a and b , if a relies on b to provide its service , then the expression "" a depends on b "" will be used . We shall represent this through the following notation : a ⇒ b . This relation is called the "" dependence "" among the two systems . Clearly it is true that , for instance , Service ⇒ program , program ⇒ CPU , and CPU ⇒ memory . Trying to develop an exhaustive list of dependent systems may be a long-lasting exercise , and most likely it would end up with an incomplete categorization . Figure 1 provides an arbitrary incomplete expansion of the dependence relation . As evident from that picture , dependences call for Dependability , i.e. , the fundamental property to achieve Dependable services which has been characterized in Chapter 1 . A dependable service is then one that persists even when , for instance , its corresponding program experiences faults – to some agreed upon extent . When designing a fault-tolerant program , two important steps are : Figure 1 : An expansion of the dependence relation . 1 . Defining the System model , which declares the characteristics we expect from the run-time environment – the main system features our program will depend upon at run-time . 2 . Defining the Fault model , which enumerates the erroneous cases that one considers and aims to tolerate . Summarizing , the main three variables that the designer of a fault-tolerant service needs to take into account in order to preserve its functions are : The specification , the system model , and the fault model : Fault-tolerant Service ⇒ ( specification , system model , fault model ) . In the following two sections the system and fault models are characterized . 2.1 Dependable Services : The System Model System Model The system model characterizes the properties of the system components our program depends upon . It could be represented as a tree like the one in Fig. 1 whose leaves are computation , communication and clock sub-systems . These leaves are annotated with statements representing some expected properties of the corresponding sub-systems . 2.1.1 Synchronous System Model . A well-known system model is the synchronous model : In such a system the service depends on "" perfect "" ( ideal ) computation , communication and clock sub-systems . In particular , that model dictates that it is possible to know precisely how long will it take for any task to be fully executed by the available CPUs and for any message to be sent and eventually received through the available communication networks . Moreover , the hardware clocks available on different nodes are perfect – no drift is possible . The main benefit of such a model is that it facilitates considerably the task of the designer and the developer : The system is assumed to be perfectly stable , which means that no disruptions are deemed as likely to occur . This paves the way to the adoption of simple software structures , such as connection-oriented communication : Any two tasks willing to communicate with each other first establish a connection and then synchronously exchange messages through it . This structure is very simple and much more effective than , e.g. , datagram-based communication – where messages are sent asynchronously , and each of them must be routed separately to destination . Clearly opting for the synchronous system model is an optimistic approach , though not always a very realistic one . Writing a program with these assumptions means basically shifting problems to deployment time . This is because whatever violation of the system assumptions becomes a fault . Possible events , such as a late message arrival or a missed deadline , violate the model assumptions and can lead to a failure . Even momentary disruptions e.g. a node becoming unavailable for a small fraction of a second and then back on-line are not compatible with the synchronous system assumption – for instance , they break all the connections between the tasks on that node and those residing elsewhere in the system . This single event becomes a fault that triggers potentially many errors . Tolerating that single fault requires a non trivial error treatment , e.g. re-establishing all the broken connections through some distributed protocol . Of course in some cases it can be possible to build up a system that strictly obeys the synchronous system model . But such a system would require custom , non-standard hardware / software components : For instance , synchronous Ethernet could be used for communication instead of the inherently non-deterministic CSMA / CD Ethernet . These choices clearly have the consequence to strengthen the dependence between service and target platform . Embedded systems are exactly this – a combination of custom hardware and software assembled so as to produce a well defined , special purpose service . In some other cases – for instance , hard real-time systems – the synchronous system model is the only option , as the service specification dictates strict deterministic execution for all processing and communication tasks . 2.1.2 Asynchronous System Model . At the other extreme in the spectrum of possible system models is the asynchronous system model . Its main assumptions are : • No bounds on the relative speed of process execution . • No bounds on message transmission delays . • No hardware clocks are available or otherwise there are no bounds to clock drift . As can be clearly understood this model is quite simple , does not impose special constraint on the hardware platform and ( in a sense ) is more close to reality : It recognizes that non-determinism and asynchrony are common and does not try to deny or fight this matter of fact . This matches many common life execution environments such as the Internet . Unfortunately as Einstein would say this system model is too simple : It was proven that given these assumptions one can not come up with effective solutions to services such as time-based coordination and failure detection ( Fischer , Lynch , & Paterson , 1985 ) . 2.1.3 Partially Synchronous System Model . Given the disadvantages of these two main system models , designers have been trying to devise new models combining the best of both aspects . Partial synchrony models belong to this category . Such models consider that for some systems and some environments there are long period of times where the system is obeying the synchronous hypotheses and physical time bounds are respected . Such periods are followed by brief periods where delays are experienced on processing and communication tasks . One such model is the so-called timed asynchronous system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , which is characterized by the following assumptions : Timed asynchronous system model • All tasks communicate through the network via a datagram service with omission / performance failure semantics ( see Chapter 1 ) . • All services are timed : specifications prescribe not only the outputs and state transitions that should occur in response to inputs , but also the time intervals within which a client task can expect these outputs and transitions to occur . • All tasks ( including those related to the OS and the network ) have crash / performance failure semantics ( again , see Chapter 1 ) . • All tasks have access to a local hardware clock . If more than one node is present , clocks on different nodes have a bounded drift rate . • A "" time-out "" service is available at application-level : Tasks can schedule the execution of events so that they occur at a given future point in time , as measured by their local clock1 . In particular , this model allows a straightforward modeling of system partitioning : As a result of sufficiently many omission or performance communication failures , correct nodes may be temporarily disconnected from the rest of the system during so-called periods of instability ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) . Moreover it is assumed that , at reset , tasks or nodes restart from a well-defined , initial state – partial-amnesia crashes ( defined in Chapter 1 ) are not considered . As clearly explained in the cited paper , the above hypotheses match well current distributed systems based on networked workstations – as such , they represent an effective model on which to build our fault-tolerant services . 2.2 Dependable Services : The Fault Model Another important step when designing a fault-tolerant system is the choice of which erroneous conditions one wants to tackle so as to prevent them to lead to system failures . This set of conditions that our fault-tolerant system is to tolerate is the fault model , F. What is F exactly ? It is a set of events that • may hinder the service distribution , and that • are considered as likely to occur , and that • one aims to tolerate ( that is , prevent them from turning into failures ) . Clearly F is a very important property for any fault-tolerant program , because even the most sophisticated fault-tolerant program p will be defenseless when any other condition than the ones in its fault model takes place . To highlight this fact , programs shall be referred to as functions of F , e.g. one shall write p ( F ) . A special case is given by non fault-tolerant programs , that is , programs with an empty fault model . In this case one shall write p ( ∅ ) . The same applies for the service produced by program p ( F ) . In what follows such a service will be referred to as an F - dependable service . In other words an F - dependable service is one that persists despite the occurrence of faults as described in its fault model F. An important property of F is that , in turn , it is a function of an environment E where the service ( or better , its corresponding program ) is operating . Clearly an F - dependable service may tolerate faults in E ' and may not do so for those in E '' : An airborne service may well experience different events than , e.g. , one meant in an electrical energy primary substation2 ( Unipede , 1995 ) . Obviously the choice of F is an important aspect towards a successful development of a dependable service . Imagine for instance what may happen if our fault model F matches the wrong environment , or if the target environment changes its characteristics ( e.g. a rising of temperature due to a firing ) . One may argue that all the above cases are exceptional , and that most of the time they do not take place . This was maybe the case in the past , when services were stable . Our services now run in a very fluid environment , where the occurrence of changes is the rule , not the exception . As a consequence , software engineering for fault-tolerant systems should allow to consider the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . The author is convinced that any current fault-tolerance provision should adopt such structure for its fault model . Failing to do so leaves the designer with two choices : 1 . Overshooting , i.e. , over-dimensioning the fault-tolerance provisions with respect to the actual threats being experienced , or 2 . undershooting , namely underestimating the threat in view of an economy of resources . Note how those two risks turn into a crucial dilemma to the designer : Wrong choices here can lead to either unpractical , too costly designs , or to cheap but vulnerable provisions : Fault-tolerant codes that are not dependable enough to face successfully the threats actually experienced . In Chapter 4 it is introduced and discussed an example of fault-tolerant software whose fault model dynamically changes tracking the environment . Next section focuses on a few cases where static fault models and wrong system models led to catastrophic consequences . 3 3.1 ( IN ) FAMOUS ACCIDENTS Faulty Fault Models : The Ariane 5 Flight 501 On June 4 , 1996 , the maiden flight of the unmanned Ariane 5 rocket ended in a failure just forty seconds after its lift-off from Kourou , French Guiana . At an altitude of about 3700 meters , the launcher veered off its flight path , broke up and exploded . The rocket was on its first voyage , and it took the European Space Agency ( ESA ) more than a decade of intense development costing $ 7 billion . Designed as a successor to the successful Ariane 4 series , the Ariane 5 was designed to be capable of hurling a cargo of several tons – four identical scientific satellites that were designed to establish precisely how the Earth's magnetic field interacts with solar winds – into orbit each launch , and was intended to give Europe a leading edge in the commercial space business . After the failure , the ESA set up an independent Inquiry Board to identify the causes of the failure . It was their task to determine the causes of the launch failure , investigate whether the qualification tests and acceptance tests were appropriate in relation to the problem encountered and recommend corrective actions . The recommendations of the Board concern mainly around software engineering practices like testing , reviewing and the construction of specifications and requirements . The case of the Ariane 5 is particularly meaningful to what discussed so far , because it provides us with an example of a fault-tolerant design that did not consider the right fault model . This was the ultimate cause of its failure . In the following we discuss what happened and which have been the main mistakes with respect to the discussion so far . The Flight Control System of the Ariane 5 was of a standard design . The attitude of the launcher and its movements in space were measured by an Inertial Reference System ( SRI ) . The SRI had its own internal computer , in which angles and velocities were calculated on the basis of information from a strap-down inertial platform , with laser gyros and accelerometers . The data from the SRI were transmitted through the data-bus to an On-Board Computer ( OBC ) , which executed the flight program and controlled the nozzles of the solid boosters and the so-called Vulcain cryogenic engine , via servovalves and hydraulic actuators . As already mentioned , this system was fault-tolerant : In order to improve its reliability two SRI's were operating in parallel , with identical hardware and software . For the time being the consequences of this particular design choice will not be considered – Chapter 3 will go back to this issue . One SRI was active and one was in hot stand-by – as soon as the OBC detected that the active SRI had failed it immediately switched to the other one , provided that this unit was functioning properly . Likewise the system was equipped with two OBC's , and a number of other units in the Flight Control System were also duplicated . The software used in the Ariane 5 SRI was mostly reused from that of the Ariane 4 SRI . The launcher started to disintegrate about 39 seconds after take-off because of high aerodynamic loads due to an angle of attack of more than 20 degrees that led to separation of the boosters from the main stage , in turn triggering the self-destruct system of the launcher . This angle of attack was caused by full nozzle deflections of the solid boosters and the so-called Vulcain main engine . These nozzle deflections were commanded by the OBC software on the basis of data transmitted by the active Inertial Reference System ( SRI 2 ) . Part of these data at that time did not contain proper flight data , but showed a diagnostic bit pattern of the computer of the SRI 2 , which was interpreted as flight data . The reason why the active SRI 2 did not send correct attitude data was that the unit had declared a failure due to a software exception . The OBC could not switch to the backup SRI 1 because that unit had already ceased to function during the previous data cycle ( 72 millisecond period ) for the same reason as SRI 2 . The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value . The floating point number which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer . This resulted in an Operand Error . The data conversion instructions ( in Ada code ) were not protected from causing an Operand Error , although other conversions of comparable variables in the same place in the code were protected . No reference to justification of this decision was found directly in the source code . Given the large amount of documentation associated with any industrial application , the assumption , although agreed , was essentially obscured , though not deliberately , from any external review . The reason for the three remaining variables , including BH , the one denoting horizontal bias , being unprotected was that further reasoning indicated that they were either physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety , a reasoning which in the case of the variable BH turned out to be faulty . The main reason behind the failure was a software reuse error in the Inertial Reference System ( ISR ) . Specifically , the conversion from horizontal velocity of the rocket ( represented as a 64-bit floating-point number ) with respect to the platform to a 16-bit signed integer resulted in an overflow , as the number was larger than the largest integer storable in a 16-bit unsigned integer , resulting in an overflow exception being thrown . This failure caused complete loss of guidance and attitude information approximately 37 seconds after the start of the main engine ignition sequence . Ariane 5 had been deprived of its basic faculties : Its perception of where it was in the sky and which direction it had to proceed . This loss of information was due to specification and design errors in the ISR , upon which depends the Flight Control Computer ( FCC ) . This software was originally developed and successfully used in the Ariane 4 but was not altered to support the new flight trajectory and increase in horizontal acceleration resulting from the new Vulcain engines . Because of this , the ISR memory banks were quickly overloaded with information that could not be processed and fed to the onboard computers fast enough . The FCC could thus no longer ensure the correct guidance and control and from that instant the launcher was lost . Several are the reasons behind the Ariane 5 failure – in what follows the focus shall go on the one more pertaining to this chapter : Several faults resulting in Operand Errors were included in the Ariane 4 fault model , F. Treating these faults introduced some run-time overhead . To minimize this overhead , some of these faults were not included in the fault model , reduced to a smaller F ' . One of the faults in F but not in F ' triggered the chain of events that ultimately led to the Ariane failure . 3.2 Faulty Specifications : The Mariner 1 . The Mariner Program , a series of ten spacecrafts , was started by NASA on July 22 , 1962 with the launch of Mariner 1 and ended on November 3 , 1973 , with the launch of Mariner 10 . Other spacecraft , based on these , were continued with different names , like Voyager and Viking . Mariner 1 , a 202.8 kg unmanned spacecraft , was sent to Venus for a flyby with several scientific instruments on board , such as a microwave radiometer , an infrared radiometer and a cosmic dust detector . These should investigate Venus and its orbits . The Mariner was made by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) and to be used by NASA . The total costs for this spacecraft were close to $ 14 million . For getting into space , the Mariner 1 was attached to an Atlas-Agena rocket . Such type of rocket had been already used for launching missiles . It used different antennas to be controllable by a ground control unit , but it had its own on-board control system in case of a failing communication . The launch was rescheduled to July 20 , 1962 . That day at Cape Canaveral launch platform the first countdown started , after which a fey delays occurred because of problems in the range safety command system . The countdown was stopped and restarted once before being canceled because of a blown fuse in the range safety circuits . At 23 : 08 local time on July 21 , the countdown began again . Another three holds gave the technicians time to fix minor issues such as power fluctuations in the radio guidance system . At 09 : 21 : 23 UTC , the countdown ended and the spaceship started its launch . Let us call this time as time X. A few minutes later , the range safety officer noticed that the spacecraft was going out of course , and at X + 4 minutes , it was clear that manual correction was necessary . However , the spacecraft did not react as hoped and went more and more off course . A strict deadline at this stage was Figure 2 : The Mariner 1 time X + 300 , corresponding to the separation of the Atlas / Agena rocket . After this time destroying the Mariner1 would not be possible anymore . To prevent serious damage , the range safety officer decided to enforce destroyment at X + 293 seconds . The Mariner 1 radio transponder kept sending signals until X + 357 seconds . The investigation on what went wrong includes many factors . A brief overview is given in what follows . It is sometimes stated that a misspelling in a Fortran program was responsible for the crash of the Mariner 1 . However , this is not true – such bug existed in another system in the Mercury project , which was fixed before being able to do any harm . In fact , the faulty software was used in several missions , but corrected before the resulting inaccurate data resulted in a flight failure . The bug was caused by two main factors : Fortran , which ignores spaces , and a design fault – a small typo , a period instead of a comma , resulting in a line like "" DO 5 K = 1 , 3 "" ( an iterative loop ) being interpreted as "" DO5K = 1.3 "" ( an assignment ) . The actual cause of the crash started with a hardware malfunction of the Atlas antennas . The beacon for measuring the rate of the spacecraft failed to pass signals for four periods ranging from 1.5 to 61 seconds . During the absence of correct data , a smoothed function should guide the spacecraft into the right direction . However , the smooth function had not been implemented , resulting in fast changes in the course direction . To counteract these drastic changes , the course was changed over and over again , with the vehicle going more and more off its intended course . For each flight , a Range Safety Officer made sure that , should the spacecraft go out of a safety zone , it would be destructed before being able to do any harm to people or the environment . After the Range Safety Officer saw that the flight was uncontrollable before being out of reach he ordered to let the Mariner 1 explode , to prevent further damage . This happened only 7 seconds before the separation of the Mariner 1 and the Atlas-Agena rocket , which held the explosives . Why the smooth function had not been implemented ? The error had occurred when an equation was being transcribed by hand in the specification for the guidance program . The writer missed the superscript bar in r ̇ n ( the n-th smoothed value of the time derivative of a radius ) . Without the smoothing function indicated by the bar , the program treated normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious , causing spurious corrections that sent the rocket off course . Because of that the Range Safety Officer had to shut it down . As the method would be used only in case of communication failure , and such failure had not been injected during testing experiments , the simulation did not verify the consequences of the hardware failure and did neither notice the slight but catastrophic difference between the expected and the real function values . It is possible to conclude that the Mariner 1 is a classic example of the consequences of a faulty or misinterpreted specification : As mentioned before , Service = f ( program ) , program = g ( specification ) , and a flawed specification fatally translates in a failed service . 3.3 Faulty Models : The Therac-25 Accidents The Therac-25 accidents have been recognized as "" the most serious computer-related accidents to date "" ( Leveson , 1995 ) . Herein they are briefly discussed to give an idea of the consequences of faulty system and fault models . The Therac-25 was a linac , that is , a medical linear accelerator that uses accelerated electrons to create high-energy beams able to destroy tumors with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue . It was the latest member of a successful family of linacs , including e.g. the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 , built by Atomic Energy Commission Limited ( AECL ) , a Canadian company . Compared to its ancestors , the Therac-25 had a revolutionary design : it was smaller , cheaper and more powerful . In the past AECL had built several successful medical linear accelerators , including the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 . Compared to its ancestors , the Therac-25 had three advantages : It was more compact , cheaper and had more features . The compactness was due to the so-called "" double-pass "" concept used for the Therac-25 . This double-pass design of the accelerator meant that the accelerator itself was much more compact , rendering the total size of the machine much smaller . This was achieved by folding the mechanism that accelerates the electrons ( a little like it is for the French horn among wind instruments ) . The cheaper cost of the Therac-25 came from several factors – it was a dual-mode linacs , that is , it was able to produce both electron and photon beams , which required normally two machines ; also , the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 both had hardware interlocks to ensure safe operation . With the development of the Therac-25 however , AECL decided that such interlocks were an unnecessary burden for the customer , raising the costs without bringing extra benefits . Most of the extra complexity of the Therac-25 , including safety issues , was managed in software . This is a key difference between the new model and its ancestors – in the latter , software played a very limited role and "" merely added convenience to the existing hardware , which was capable of standing alone "" ( Leveson , 1995 ) . Such software was custom built but reused routines of the original Therac-6 and Therac-20 code . The Therac-25 software was developed over a period of several years by a single programmer using the PDP 11 assembly language . Even the system software was not standard but custom built . One could argue that when used to compose a life-critical service such as this , software should come with guarantees about its quality and its fault-tolerant features ; unfortunately this was not the case at the time3 . Not only no fault model or system model document had been produced – the safety analysis carried out by AECL was a fault tree where only hardware faults had been considered ! AECL apparently considered their software as error-free . It is interesting to note the assumptions AECL drew on software , as they could be considered as the three main mistakes in fault-tolerant software development : 1 . Programming errors have been significantly reduced by extensive testing on a simulator . Any residual software error is not included in the analysis . 2 . Program software does not wear out or degrade . 3 . Possible faults belong to the following two classes : Hardware physical faults and transient physical faults induced by alpha particles and electromagnetic noise . The Therac-25 software was very complex . It consisted of four major components : Stored data , a scheduler , a set of critical and non-critical tasks , and interrupt services . It used the interrupt-driven software model , and inter-process communication among concurrent tasks was managed through shared memory access . Analysis revealed that no proper synchronization was put into place to secure accesses to shared memory . This introduced race conditions that would cause some of the later accidents . One of the tasks of the software was to monitor the machine status . In particular the treatment unit had an interlock system designed to remove power in case of a hardware malfunction . The software monitored this interlock system and , when faults got detected , either prevented a treatment from being started or , if the treatment was in progress , it suspended or put in hold the treatment . The software had been developed relying on the availability of said interlock system – in other words , it had to be part of the system model document . Changing the system and reusing the software led to disaster . Indeed hardware interlocks had been the only reason that prevented deadly overdoses to be delivered while using the old members of the Therac family of devices . A proof of this was found later with the Therac-20 . At the University of Chicago , students could exercise radiation therapy with the Therac-20 . In the beginning of each academic year , there were a lot of defected machines . Most of the time , the main problem was blown fuses . After about three weeks , these failures would typically go away . After carefully studying this behavior , it was concluded that due to the random faulty configurations entered by students who did not know the machine , overdose charges took place . Fortunately fuses were in place to prevent any overdose damage . Would these fuses also have been in place in the Therac-25 , many of the accidents could have been avoided4 . 4 SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE Research in fault-tolerance concentrated for many years on hardware fault-tolerance , i.e. , on devising a number of effective and ingenious hardware structures to cope with faults ( Johnson , 1989 ) . For some time this approach was considered as the only one needed in order to reach the requirements of availability and data integrity demanded by nowadays complex computer services . Probably the first researcher who realized that this was far from being true was B. Randell who in 1975 ( Randell , 1975 ) questioned hardware fault-tolerance as the only approach to employ – in the cited paper he states : "" Hardware component failures are only one source of unreliability in computing systems , decreasing in significance as component reliability improves , while software faults have become increasingly prevalent with the steadily increasing size and complexity of software systems . "" Indeed most of the complexity supplied by modern computing services lies in their software rather than in the hardware layer ( Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ; Huang & Kintala , 1995 ; Wiener , 1993 ; Randell , 1975 ) . This state of things could only be reached by exploiting a powerful conceptual tool for managing complexity in a flexible and effective way , i.e. , devising hierarchies of sophisticated abstract machines ( Tanenbaum , 1990 ) . This translates in implementing software with high-level computer languages lying on top of other software strata – middleware , the device drivers layers , the basic services kernel , the operating system , the run-time support of the involved programming languages , and so forth . Partitioning the complexity into stacks of software layers allowed the implementor to focus exclusively on the high-level aspects of their problems , and hence it allowed managing a larger and larger degree of complexity . But though made transparent , still this complexity is part of the overall system being developed . A number of complex algorithms are concurrently executed by the hardware , resulting in the simultaneous progress of many system states – under the hypothesis that no involved abstract machine , nor the actual hardware , be affected by faults . Unfortunately , as in real life faults do occur , the corresponding deviations are likely to jeopardize the system's function , also propagating from one layer to the other , unless appropriate means are taken to avoid in the first place , or to remove , or to tolerate these faults . In particular , faults may also occur in the application layer , that is , in the abstract machine on top of the software hierarchy5 . These faults , possibly having their origin at design time , or during operation , or while interacting with the environment , are not different in the extent of their consequences from those faults originating , e.g. , in the hardware or the operating system . An efficacious argument to bring evidence to the above statement is the case of the so-called "" millennium bug "" , i.e. , the most popular class of design faults that ever emerged in the history of computing technologies , also known as "" the year 2000 problem "" , or as "" Y2K "" . The source of this problem is simple : Most of the software still in use today was developed using a standard where dates are coded in a 6-digit format . According to this standard , two digits were considered as enough to represent the year . Unfortunately this translates into the impossibility to distinguish , e.g. , year 2000 from year 1900 , which by the en of last century was recognized as the possible cause of an unpredictably large number of failures when calculating time elapsed between two calendar dates , as for instance year 1900 was not a leap year while year 2000 is . Choosing the above mentioned standard to represent dates resulted in a hidden , almost forgotten design fault , never considered nor tested by application programmers . As society got closer and closer to the year 2000 , the possible presence of this design fault in our software became a nightmare that seemed to jeopardize all those crucial functions of our society today appointed to programs manipulating calendar dates , such us utilities , transportation , health care , communication , public administration , and so forth . Luckily the expected many and possibly crucial system failures due to this one application-level fault ( Hansen , LaSala , Keene , & Coppola , 1999 ) were not so many and not that crucial , though probably for the first time the whole society became aware of the extent of the relevance of dependability in software . These facts and the above reasoning suggest that , the higher the level of abstraction , the higher the complexity of the algorithms into play and the consequent error proneness of the involved ( real or abstract ) machines . As a conclusion , full tolerance of faults and the complete fulfillment of the dependability design goals of a complex software application call for the adoption of protocols to avoid , remove , or tolerate faults working at all levels , including the application layer . 5 SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE IN THE APPLICATION LAYER The need of software fault-tolerance provisions located in the application layer is supported by studies that showed that the majority of failures experienced by nowadays computer systems are due to software faults , including those located in the application layer ( Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ; Laprie , 1998 ) ; for instance , NRC reported that 81 % of the total number of outages of US switching systems in 1992 were due to software faults ( NRC , 1993 ) . Moreover , nowadays application software systems are increasingly networked and distributed . Such systems , e.g. , client-server applications , are often characterized by a loosely coupled architecture whose global structure is in general more prone to failures6 . Due to the complex and temporal nature of interleaving of messages and computations in distributed software systems , no amount of verification , validation and testing can eliminate all faults in an application and give complete confidence in the availability and data consistency of applications of this kind ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) . Under these assumptions , the only alternative ( and effective ) means for increasing software reliability is that of incorporating in the application software provisions of software fault-tolerance ( Randell , 1975 ) . Another argument that justifies the addition of software fault-tolerance means in the application layer is given by the widespread adoption of object orientation , components and service orientation . Structuring one's software into a web of objects , components and services is a wonderful conceptual tool which allows to quickly compose a service out of reusable components . This has wonderful relapses on many aspects including development and maintenance times and costs , but has also a little drawback : it promotes the composition of software systems from third-party objects the sources of which are unknown to the application developers . In other words , the object , component and service abstractions fostered the capability to deal with higher and higher levels of complexity in software and at the same time eased and therefore encouraged software reuse . As just mentioned , this has very positive impacts though it translates the application in a sort of collection of reused , pre-existing components or objects made by third parties . The reliability of these software entities and hence their impact on the overall reliability of the user application is often unknown , to the point that Grey refers as an "" art "" to the ability to create reliable applications using off-the-shelf software components ( Green , 1997 ) . The case of the Ariane 501 flight and that of the Therac-25 linear accelerator ( see Chapter 2 ) are well-known examples that show how improper reuse of software may produce severe consequences ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . But probably the most convincing reasoning for not excluding the application layer from a fault-tolerance strategy is the so-called "" end-to-end argument "" – a system design principle introduced in ( Saltzer , Reed , & Clark , 1984 ) . Such principle states that , rather often , functions such as reliable file transfer , can be completely and correctly implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the underlying system ( for instance , the communication network ) . This does not mean that everything should be done at the application level – fault-tolerance strategies in the underlying hardware and operating system can have a strong impact on the system's performance . However , an extraordinarily reliable communication system that guarantees that no packet is mistreated ( lost , duplicated , or corrupted , or delivered to the wrong addressee ) does not reduce the burden of the application programmer to ensure reliability : For instance , for reliable file transfer , the application programs that perform the transfer must still supply a file-transfer-specific , end-to-end reliability guarantee . The main message of this chapter can be summarized as follows : Pure hardware-based or operating system-based solutions to fault-tolerance , though often characterized by a higher degree of transparency , are not fully capable of providing complete end-to-end tolerance to faults in the user application . Relying solely on the hardware , the middleware , or the operating system is a mistake : • It develops only partially satisfying solutions . • It requires a large amount of extra resources and costs . • And often it is characterized by poor service portability ( Saltzer et al. , 1984 ; Siewiorek & Swarz , 1992 ) . 6 STRATEGIES , PROBLEMS , AND KEY PROPERTIES The above conclusions justify the strong need for application-level fault-tolerance . As a consequence of this need , several approaches to application-level fault-tolerance have been devised during the last three decades ( see chapters 5 – 8 for an extensive survey ) . Such a long research period hints at the complexity of the design problems underlying Application-level fault-tolerance engineering , which include : 1 . How to incorporate fault-tolerance in the application layer of a computer program . 2 . Which fault-tolerance provisions to support . 3 . How to manage the fault-tolerance code . Problem 1 is also known as the problem of the system structure to software fault-tolerance , which was first proposed by B. Randell in 1975 ( Randell , 1975 ) . It states the need of appropriate structuring techniques such that the incorporation of a set of fault-tolerance provisions in the application software might be performed in a simple , coherent , and well structured way . Indeed , poor solutions to this problem result in a huge degree of code intrusion : in such cases , the application code that addresses the functional requirements and the application code that addresses the fault-tolerance requirements are mixed up into one large and complex application software . • This greatly complicates the task of the developer and demands expertise in both the application and the fault-tolerance domains . Negative repercussions on the development times and costs are to be expected . • The maintenance of the resulting code , both for the functional part and for the fault-tolerance provisions , is more complex , costly , and error prone . • Furthermore , the overall complexity of the software product is increased – which , as mentioned in Chapter 1 , is in itself a source of faults . One can conclude that , with respect to the first problem , an ideal system structure should guarantee an adequate Separation between the functional and the fault-tolerance Concerns ( in what follows this property will be referred to as "" sc "" ) . Moreover , the design choice of which fault-tolerance provisions to support can be conditioned by the adequacy of the syntactical structure at "" hosting "" the various provisions . The well-known quotation by B. L. Whorf efficaciously captures this concept : "" Language shapes the way we think , and determines what we can think about "" : Indeed , as explained in Chapter 1 , a non-optimal answer to Problem 2 may • require a high degree of redundancy , and • rapidly consume large amounts of the available redundancy , which at the same time would increase the costs and reduce the reliability . One can conclude that , devising a syntactical structure offering straightforward support to a large set of fault-tolerance provisions , can be an important aspect of an ideal system structure for application-level fault-tolerance . In the following this property will be called Syntactical Adequacy ( or more briefly "" sa "" ) . Finally , one can observe that another important aspect of any application-level fault-tolerance architecture is the way the fault-tolerance code is managed , at compile time as well as at execution time . If one wants to realize F - dependable systems where the fault model F can change over time , as mentioned in Chapter 2 , then our architecture must allow the fault-tolerance code to be changed as well so as to track the changing fault model . A possible way to do so is for instance to have an architectural component to monitor the observed faults and check whether the current fault model is still valid or not . When this is not the case , the component should extend the fault model and change the fault-tolerance code accordingly , either loading some pre-existing code or synthesizing a new one matching the current threat . In both cases , the architecture must allow disabling the old code and enabling the new one . Adaptability ( or a for brevity ) is defined herein as the ability of an application-level fault-tolerant architecture such that it allows on-line ( dynamic ) or at least off-line management of the fault-tolerance provisions and of their parameters . This would allow letting the fault-tolerance code adapt itself to the current environment or at least allow service portability . Clearly an important requirement for any such solution is that it does not overly increase the complexity of the resulting application – which would be detrimental to dependability . The three properties sc , sa and a will be referred to in what follows as the structural attributes of application-level fault-tolerance . 7 SOME WIDELY USED SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE PROVISIONS In this section the key ideas behind some widely used software fault-tolerance building blocks will be introduced : the watchdog timer , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing and rollback . Such building blocks will be studied in depth in the rest of the book . 7.1 Watchdog Timers Clov : Wait ! Yes Yes ! I have it ! I set the alarm . Hamm : This is perhaps not one of my bright days , but frankly Clov : You whistle me . I do n't come . The alarm rings . I 'm gone . It does n't ring . I 'm dead . [ Pause . ] Hamm : Is it working ? [ Pause . Impatiently . ] The alarm , is it working ? Clov : Why would ' nt it be working ? Hamm : Because it 's worked too much . Clov : But it 's hardly worked at all . Hamm : [ Angrily . ] Then because it 's worked too little ! ( Samuel Beckett , Endgame . ) Watchdogs are versatile and effective tools in detecting processing errors . The idea is very simple : Let us suppose there is a process p that needs to perform cyclically a critical operation and then releases the locks that keep in a waiting state several concurrent processes . Clearly the pending processes are dependant on p : A single fault affecting p and preventing it to continue would result in blocking indefinitely all the pending processes . Obviously it is very important to make sure that a fault stopping p be timely detected . ( Such first service would then lead to proper error recovery steps , e.g. releasing the locks ) . A watchdog timer is an additional process w that monitors the execution of p by requiring the latter to send w periodically a "" sign of life "" – clearing a shared memory flag or sending a heartbeat message to w . By checking whether the flag has been cleared or the heartbeat has arrived , process w can assess that p , at least in the last period , had been at least able to timely send the sign of life . In more formal terms , using the vocabulary of Chapter 2 , one could say that watchdog timers protect p against crash / performance failures . If w does not receive the expected sign of life , then it is said to "" fire . "" Despite its simplicity , the watchdog calls for important choices at design and configuration time . In particular , • How often should p send the sign of life implies a trade off of performance and failure detection latency . Moreover , quite often the dependency chain between p and w is not simple : For instance , p may rely on a communication system C to deliver a heartbeat message , which complicates the matter at hand considerably ( p ⇒ C , so is it C or p that failed when w fired ? ) Of course also dependency chains such as these are an arbitrary simplification , and C could be more precisely identified as a long cascade of dependent sub-services , whose emergent behavior is that of a communication system , each component of which could be the actual source of a problem ultimately resulting in the firing of w . • How often should w check for the arrival of a sign of life from p implies the adherence to a system model , explicitly defined or otherwise . A synchronous system model corresponds to a hard real-time system assumptions , which would allow for a very "" tight "" watchdog cycle . The farther one goes from that assumption ( the more asynchronous the system model , so to say ) , the larger the chance to introduce unexpected latencies in the execution of both p and w . A consequence of this is that , if one wants to reduce the probability that w erroneously declares p as faulty , then he shall need to compensate for late processing and late messages by widening the watchdog cycle . Of course this implies a larger failure detection latency . Bringing this to the limit , in a fully asynchronous system , the compensation time grows without bound , at the cost of not being able to accomplish any sensible task anymore ! This result was proven in the famous article ( Fischer et al. , 1985 ) , which I usually refer to as "" the FLoP paper "" ( a little kidding with the names of its authors ) . Scientists have found a way to deal with this ostensible conundrum , and the idea is based on using a web of "" extended watchdogs "" – so called failure detectors ( see Chapter 8 . ) • What to do if the watchdog timer fails . Everything has a coverage , and this includes watchdogs , so it is unwise assuming that a watchdog can not fail . Furthermore , the failure can be as simple to deal with as a crash , or as tricky as a Byzantine ( arbitrary ) failure . Failures could be for instance the result of either – a design fault in the algorithm of the watchdog , or – a physical fault , e.g. causing the processing node of the watchdog to get disconnected from the network , or – an attack , e.g. a man-in-the-middle attack or an identity spoofing attack ( Harshini , Sridhar , & Sridhar , 2004 ) . Watchdog timers are often used in software fault-tolerance designs . The problem this book focuses on , as mentioned already , is how to express watchdog timers and their configuration . And again , an important factor in measuring the effectiveness of the available solutions is for us how such solutions perform with respect to the three structural properties of application-level software fault-tolerance , and to sc in particular . The less code intrusion an approach requires , the higher our assessment . This book presents two examples : The EFTOS watchdog timer ( a library and run-time executive requiring full code intrusion , see Chapter 3 ) and the Ariel watchdog timer ( an evolution of the EFTOS watchdog timer that makes use of the Ariel language to enucleate the configuration statements from the source code – thus reducing code intrusion ; see Chapter 6 and Appendix "" The Ariel Internals . "" ) 7.2 Exceptions and Exception Handlers An exception is an event that is triggered at run time due to the interaction with the environment and results in a ( temporary or permanent ) suspension of the current application so to manage the event . Let us consider the following C fragment : void main ( void ) { int a , b , c ; a = function1 ( ) ; b = function2 ( ) ; c = a / b ; / * danger here * / } Clearly instruction a / b is unprotected against a division-by-zero exception : When b is zero the division is undefined and – unless the division instruction is faulty – the CPU does not know how to deal with it . Other examples of exceptions are : • An overflow or underflow condition . • A not-a-number ( NaN ) floating point constant . • Misalignments . • A breakpoint is encountered . • Access to protected or non existing memory areas . • Power failures . • A sub-system failure , e.g. a disk crash while accessing a file . As the CPU has no clue about how to recover from the condition , either the program stops or it tries to deal with it with some code supplied by the programmer precisely for that , that is , to catch the exception and deal with it . The following version of the above code fragment does prevent the exception to occur : void main ( void ) { int a , b , c ; a = function1 ( ) ; b = function2 ( ) ; if ( b ! = 0 ) c = a / b ; / * no more danger here * / else { fprintf ( stderr , "" An exception has been avoided : division-by-zero \ n "" ) ; } } As can be seen from the above mentioned examples , not all the exceptions can be avoided . Hence it is very important that a programming language hosts some mechanisms that allow the user to catch exceptions and properly deal with them . One such language is Java . Java is particularly interesting for not only it allows , but mandates ( with some exception , if you excuse me for the pun ) that the programmer supplies proper code to deal with all the exceptions that can be raised by the sub-services the application depends upon ( Pelliccione , Guelfi , & Muccini , 2007 ) . For example , if one tries to compile an instruction such as this : ImageFile input = new OpenImageFile ( "" edges . png "" ) ; whose purpose is to open an image file and associate its descriptor with a local variable , the Java compiler would report an error complaining the lack of proper instructions to deal with the case that the OpenImageFile method fails due to a java . io . FileNotFoundException . In more detail , the Java compiler would emit a message like "" unreported exception i ; must be caught or declared to be thrown s "" , where i is the exception and s is the lacking statement , and report an unrecoverable error . The only way to compile successfully the above Java fragment is through the following syntax : try { ImageFile input = new OpenImageFile ( "" edges . png "" ) ; } catch ( FileNotFoundException exception ) { System . out . println ( "" Exception : Could n't open file edges . png "" ) ; exception . printStackTrace ( ) ; } whose semantics is : First try to execute the statements in the try block ; if everything goes well , skip the catch statement and go on ; otherwise if the catch block refers the raised exception , execute it . In this case the handling of the exception is a simple printed message and a dump of the program execution stack though method printStackTrace , which reports on where in the control flow graph the execution took place and how it propagated through the system and application modules . Note how a Try-Catch block is a nice syntactical construct to build mechanisms such as Recovery Blocks ( discussed in Chapter 3 ) – that is , the Syntactical Adequacy ( sa ) of Java to host mechanisms such as Recovery Blocks is very high . The general syntax for exception handling in Java is try { ... Instructions possibly raising exceptions ... } catch ( ExceptionType1 exception1 ) { ... Instructions to deal with exception Exception1 ... } catch ( ExceptionType2 exception2 ) { ... Instructions to deal with exception Exception2 ... } ... finally { ... Instructions to be executed in any case at the end of the try block ... } An example follows : try { x = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( argv [ 0 ] )) ; // this instruction // throws FileNotFoundException String s = x . readLine ( ) ; while ( s ! = null ) { System . out . println ( s ) ; // this one throws IOException s = x . readLine ( ) ; // this one throws IOException } } catch ( FileNotFoundException e1 ) { System . out . println ( "" I ca n't open a file . "" ) ; e1 . printStackTrace ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e2 ) { System . out . println ( "" I ca n't read from a file "" ) ; ioe . printStackTrace ( ) ; } finally { x . close ( ) ; // this one throws IOException // and NullPointerException } Java defines a large number of exceptions , divided into two classes : Checked and unchecked exceptions . Checked exceptions are basically recoverable exceptions , which include e.g. those due to input / output failures or network failures . Checked exceptions mandatorily call for a corresponding try ... catch block . Unchecked exceptions are unrecoverable conditions corresponding to the exhaustion of the system assets ( e.g. an out of memory error or a segment violation ) . Java also offers a mechanism to propagate an exception from an invoked module to the invoking one – this is known as "" throwing "" an exception . Java and other systems offer so-called Automated Exception Handling or Error Interception tools , which continuously monitor the execution of programs recording debugging information about exceptions and other conditions . Such tools allow tracking the cause of exceptions taking place in Java programs that run in production , testing or development environments . An example of an exception handling mechanism is given in Chapter 3 . 7.3 Checkpointing and Rollback Checkpointing and Rollback ( CR ) is a widely used fault-tolerance mechanism . The idea is simple : Someone ( the user , or the system , or the programmer ) takes a periodic snapshot of the system state and , if the system fails afterwards , the snapshot is reloaded so as to restore the system to a working and ( hopefully ) correct situation . The fault model of most of the available CR tools is transient ( design and physical ) faults , i.e. , faults that might not show up again when the system re-executes . Checkpointing is also a basic building blocks for more complex fault-tolerance mechanisms , such as Recovery Blocks ( described in Chapter 3 ) , where after rollback a new software version is tried out , or task migration ( supported by language Ariel , see Chapter 6 ) , where the snapshot is loaded on a different processing node of the system . Clearly in the latter case the fault model may be somewhat extended so as to consider permanent faults having their origin in the originating machine ( for instance in its local run-time executives , or compilers , or shared libraries , and so forth ) . CR is also a key requirement to achieve atomic actions ( see Sect . 7.4 ) . CR packages can be divided into three categories : • application-level libraries , such as psncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) , • user commands , e.g. Dynamite ( Iskra et al. , 2000 ) or ckpt ( Zandy , n.d. ) , • operating system mechanisms and patches , e.g. psncC / R ( Meyer , 2003 ) . Another classification is given by the logics for initiating checkpointing , which can be : • Time-based ( "" every t time units do checkpointing "" ) . This is supported e.g. by ckpt and libckpt ( Plank , Beck , Kingsley , & Li , 1995 ) . The latter in particular supports incremental checkpointing ( only the data that changed from last checkpointing needs to be stored . ) • Event based ( e.g. , when the user generates a signal , e.g. with UNIX command "" kill "" ) . An example of this is psncLibCkpt . A special case is ( Shankar , 2005 ) , where the signal can actually terminate the process and create a dump file that can be "" revived "" afterwards ) . • Algorithmic ( that is , when the algorithm enters a given phase , e.g. , the top of a loop ; obviously application-level libraries allow this ) . Also in the case of checkpointing there are several important design and configuration issues : In particular , • How often should the checkpointing occur ? Suppose one has executed a series of checkpointings , c1 , c2 , ... cn , and after the last one and before the next one the system experiences a failure . The normal practice in CR is to reload cn and retry . Are we sure that the corresponding fault occurred between cn − 1 and cn ? In other words , are we sure that the period of checkpointing is large enough to compensate for fault latency and error latency ( see Chapter 1 for their definitions ) ? • Are we sure that the checkpointed state includes the whole of the system state ? The state of the system may include e.g. descriptors of open TCP connections , the state of low-level system variables , the contents of files distributed throughout the network , and so forth . Failing to restore the whole system state may well result in a system failure . • Are we sure the the checkpointed state resides in a safe part of the system ? Are we sure that we will be able to access it , unmodified , when rollback is needed ? In other words , are we making use of a reliable stable storage for checkpointed states ? Recall that everything has a coverage , and this includes stable storage ; so how stable is our stable storage ? See further on for a section on stable storage . CR has been specialized in several different contexts , such as distributed systems , parallel computers , clusters and grid systems ( Schneider , Kohmann , & Bugge , n.d. ) Our focus is on how to express checkpointing and rollback , so mainly in CR libraries and their configuration . As usual the less code intrusion an approach requires , the better its sc . Chapter 3 briefly discusses two CR libraries , PsncLibCkpt and Libckpt . 7.4 Transactions An important building block to fault-tolerance is transactions . A transaction bundles an arbitrary number of instructions of a common programming language together and makes them "" atomic "" , that is indivisible : It is not possible to execute one such bundle partially , it either executes completely or not at all . More formally a transaction must obey the so-called ACID properties : Atomicity : In a transaction involving two or more blocks of instructions , either all of the blocks are committed or none are . Consistency : A transaction either brings the system into a new valid processing state , or , if any failure occurs , returns it to exact state the system was before the transaction was started . Isolation : Running , not yet completed transactions must remain isolated from any other transaction . Durability : Data produced by completed transactions is saved in a stable storage that can survive a system failure or a system restart . A common protocol to guarantee the ACID properties is so-called two-phase commit , described e.g. in ( Moss , 1985 ) . Two important services required by transactions are stable storage and checkpointing and rollback . As mentioned in ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) , transactions act like a sort of firewall for failures and may be considered as effective building blocks for the design of dependable distributed services . Another important feature of transactions is that they mask concurrency , which makes transaction-based systems eligible for being executed on a parallel machine . As it is always the case in fault-tolerant computing , the hypotheses behind transaction processing are characterized by their coverage , that is , a probability of being effectively achieved . A so-called transaction monitor is a sort of Watchdog controlling and checking the execution of transactions . Transactions are common in database management systems , where operations such as database updating must be either fully completed or not at all in order to avoid inconsistencies possibly leading to financial disasters . This explains why transactions are supported by SQL , the Structured Query Language that is the standard database user and programming interface . Transactions require considerable run-time support . One system supporting transactions is OPTIMA ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) , a highly configurable , object-oriented framework that offers support for open multithreaded transactions and guarantees the ACID properties for transactional objects . Written in Java , it provides its users with a procedural interface that allows an application programmer to start , join , commit , and abort transactions . Argus and Arjuna ( discussed in Chapter 5 ) are examples of transactional languages . The C programming language does not provide any support for transactions in its standard library ; for this reason , a custom tool was developed for that within the EFTOS project . Such tool is described in Chapter 3 . 8 CONCLUSION Together with system specifications , two important ingredients to craft correct fault-tolerant systems are the system model and the fault model . After describing those models , it has been shown how relevant their choice can be on the dependability of important services . Configurable communication protocols and services are collections of modules that can be combined into different configurations . This allows designing system that can be customized with respect to the requirements of the system and fault models . This allows to put those models in the foreground and to fine-tune the system towards the application requirements ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) . As a side effect of this , one would obtain a system characterized by less overhead and higher performance . This chapter also reviewed a few famous accidents . What is surprising is that , quite often , the reports summarizing the "" things that went wrong "" all lead to the same conclusions , which have been nicely summarized in ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) : "" In a system with relaxed control over allowable capabilities , a damaged capability can result in the execution of undesirable actions and unexpected interference between components . "" The various approaches to application-level fault-tolerance surveyed in this book provide different system structures to solve the above mentioned problems . Three "" structural attributes "" are used in the next chapters in order to provide a qualitative assessment of those approaches with respect to various application requirements . The structural attributes constitute , in a sense , a base with which to perform this assessment . One of the outcomes of this assessment is that regrettably none of the approaches surveyed in this book is capable to provide the best combination of values of the three structural attributes in every application domain . For specific domains , such as object-oriented distributed applications , satisfactory solutions have been devised at least for sc and sa , while only partial solutions exist , for instance , when dealing with the class of distributed or parallel applications not based on the object model . The above matter of facts has been efficaciously captured by Lyu , who calls this situation "" the software bottleneck "" of system development ( Lyu , 1998b ) : in other words , there is evidence of an urgent need for systematic approaches to assure software reliability within a system ( Lyu , 1998b ) while effectively addressing the above problems . In the cited paper , Lyu remarks how "" developing the required techniques for software reliability engineering is a major challenge to computer engineers , software engineers and engineers of related disciplines "" . This chapter concludes our preliminary discussion on dependability , fault-tolerance and the general properties of application-level provisions for fault-tolerance . From next chapter onward various families of methods for the inclusion of fault-tolerance in our programs will be discussed . References Cristian , F. , & Fetzer , C. ( 1999 , June ) .

"" 4 A full report about the Therac-25 accidents is out of the scope of this book ; the reader may refer e.g. to ( Leveson , 1995 ) for that . 5 In what follows , the application layer is to be intended as the programming and execution context in which a complete , self-contained program that performs a specific function directly for the user is expressed or is running . 6 As Leslie Lamport efficaciously synthesised in his quotation , "" a distributed system is one in which I can not get something done because a machine I 've never heard of is down "" . 2 See page FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLE-VERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES This chapter discusses two large classes of fault-tolerance protocols : • Single-version protocols , that is , methods that use a non-distributed , single task provision , running side by side with the functional software , often available in the form of a library and a run-time executive . • Multiple-version protocols , which are methods that use actively a form of redundancy , as explained in what follows . In particular recovery blocks and N-version programming will be discussed . The two families have been grouped together in this chapter because of the several similarities they share . The chapter also introduces two important structures for software fault-tolerance , namely exception handling and transactions , and proposes several examples of single-version and multiple version tools . 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLE-VERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE A key requirement for the development of fault-tolerant systems is the availability of replicated resources , in hardware or software . A fundamental method employed to attain fault-tolerance is multiple computation , i.e. , N - fold ( N > 1 ) replications in three domains : Time That is , repetition of computations . Space I. e . , the adoption of multiple hardware channels ( also called "" lanes "" ) . Information That is , the adoption of multiple versions of software . Following Aviz ̆ ienis ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , it is possible to characterize at least some of the approaches towards fault-tolerance by means of a notation resembling the one used to classify queuing systems models ( Kleinrock , 1975 ) : nT / mH / pS , the meaning of which is "" n executions , on m hardware channels , of p programs "" . The non-fault-tolerant system , or 1T / 1H / 1S , is called simplex in the cited paper . 2.1 Single-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Libraries of Tools Single-version software fault-tolerance ( SV ) is basically the embedding into the user application of a simplex system of error detection or recovery features , e.g. , atomic actions ( Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) , checkpoint-and-rollback ( Deconinck , 1996 ) , or exception handling ( Cristian , 1995 ) . The adoption of SV in the application layer requires the designer to concentrate in one physical location , namely , the source code of the application , both the specification of what to do in order to carry on some user computation and the strategy such that faults are tolerated when they occur . As a result , the size of the problem addressed is increased . A fortiori , this translates into increasing the size of the user application . This induces loss of transparency , maintainability , and portability while increasing development times and costs . A partial solution to this loss in portability and these higher costs is given by the development of libraries and frameworks created under strict software engineering processes . In the following , three examples of this approach are presented – the EFTOS library and the SwIFT system . Special emphasis is reserved in particular to the first system , for which the author of this book designed a number of contributions . 2.1.1 The EFTOS library . EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) ( the acronym stands for "" embedded , fault-tolerant supercomputing "" ) is the name of ESPRIT-IV project 21012 . The aims of this project were to integrate fault-tolerance into embedded distributed high-performance applications in a flexible and effective way . The EFTOS library has been first implemented on a Parsytec CC system ( Parsytec , 1996b ) , a distributed-memory MIMD supercomputer consisting of processing nodes based on PowerPC 604 microprocessors at 133MHz , dedicated high-speed links , I / O modules , and routers . As part of the project , this library has been then ported to a Microsoft Windows NT / Intel PentiumPro platform and to a TEX / DEC Alpha platform ( TXT , 1997 ; DEC , 1997 ) in order to fulfill the requirements of the EFTOS application partners . The main characteristics of the CC system are the adoption of the thread processing model and of the message passing communication model : communicating threads exchange messages through a proprietary message passing library called EPX ( Parsytec , 1996a ) . The porting of the EFTOS library was achieved by porting EPX on the various target platforms and developing suitable adaptation layers . Through the adoption of the EFTOS library , the target embedded parallel application is plugged into a hierarchical , layered system whose structure and basic components ( depicted in Fig. 1 ) are : • At the base level , a distributed net of "" servers "" whose main task is mimicking possibly missing ( with respect to the POSIX standards ) operating system functionalities , such as remote thread creation ; • One level upward ( detection tool layer ) , a set of parameterizable functions managing error detection , referred to as "" Dtools "" . These basic components are plugged into the embedded application to make it more dependable . EFTOS supplies a number of these Dtools , including : – A watchdog timer thread ( see Sect . 4 ) ; – a trap-handling mechanism ( described in Sect . 5 ) ; – in Sect . 6 , a tool to manage transactions . and an API for incorporating user-defined EFTOS-compliant tools ; • At the third level ( control layer ) , a distributed application called "" DIR net "" ( its name stands for "" detection , isolation , and recovery network "" ) is used to coherently combine the Dtools , to ensure consistent fault-tolerance strategies throughout the system , and to play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the fault-tolerance elements ( Deconinck et al. , 1999 ) . The DIR net can be regarded as a fault-tolerant network of crash-failure detectors , connected to other peripheral error detectors . Each node of the DIR net is "" guarded "" by an < I 'm Alive > thread that requires the local component to send periodically "" heartbeats "" ( signs of life ) . For this reason the algorithm of the DIR net shall be described ( in Chapter 8 , devoted to failure detection protocols . ) A special component of the DIR net , called RINT , manages error recovery by interpreting a custom language called RL – the latter being a sort of ancestor of the programming language described in this book in Chapter 6 ; • At the fourth level ( application layer ) , the Dtools and the components of the DIR net are combined into dependable mechanisms , among which will be described : – In Sect . 3 , a distributed voting mechanism called "" voting farm "" ( De Florio , 1997 ; De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998a , 1998c ) . – In Sect . 7 , a so-called data stabilizing tool . Other tools not described in what follows include e.g. a virtual Stable Memory ( Deconinck , Botti , Cassinari , De Florio , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . • The highest level ( presentation layer ) is given by a hypermedia distributed application based on standard World-Wide Web technology , which monitors the structure and the state of the user application ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . This application is based on a special CGI script ( E. Kim , 1996 ) , called DIR Daemon , which continuously takes its inputs from the DIR net , translates them into HTML ( Berners-Lee & Connolly , 1995 ) , and remotely controls a WWW browser ( Zawinski , 1994 ) so that it renders these HTML data . A description of this application is in Chapter 10 . A system of communication daemons , called Server network in the EFTOS lingo , manages communication among the processing nodes in a way somewhat similar to that used in the Parallel Virtual Machine ( see ( Geist et al. , 1994 ) for more details on this ) . The author of this book contributed to this project designing and developing a number of basic tools , e.g. , its distributed voting system ( described in detail in Sect . 3 ) , the EFTOS monitoring tool ( see Chapter 10 ) , the RL language and its run-time system ( that is , the task responsible for the management of error recovery ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998b , 1998c ) , which will evolve into the ariel language discussed in Chapter 6 ) . Furthermore , he took part in the design and development of various versions of the DIR net ( De Florio , 1998 ) . 2.1.2 The SwIFT System . SwIFT ( Huang , Kintala , Bernstein , & Wang , 1996 ) , whose name stands for Software Implemented Fault-Tolerance , is a system including a set of reusable software components ( watchd , a general-purpose UNIX daemon watchdog timer ; libft , a library of fault-tolerance methods , including single-version implementation of recovery blocks and N - version programming ( see Sect . 2.3 ) ; libckp , i.e. , a user-transparent checkpoint-and-rollback library ; a file replication mechanism called REPL ; and addrejuv , a special "" reactive "" feature of watchd ( Huang , Kintala , Kolettis , & Fulton , 1995 ) that allows for software rejuvenation1 . The system derives from the HATS system ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) developed at AT & T. Both have been successfully used and proved to be efficient and economical means to increase the level of fault-tolerance in a software system where residual faults are present and their toleration is less costly than their full elimination ( Lyu , 1998 ) . A relatively small overhead is introduced in most cases ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) . Figure 1 : The structure of the EFTOS library . Light gray has been used for the operating system and the user application , while dark gray layers pertain EFTOS . 2.1.3 Two libraries for Checkpointing and Rollback As mentioned in Chapter 2 , checkpointing and rollback ( CR ) is an important mechanism to achieving software fault-tolerance . The focus here goes on two packages working in the application layer . Library psncLibCkpt . PsncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) is a library for applications written in C. psncLibCkpt has been designed for simplicity – very few changes in the application software allow to add the CR functionality . Such changes are so simple that could be applied automatically , e.g. through the C preprocessor "" # define "" statement . In practice , only the main function needs to be renamed as ckpt target , with no modification on its parameters . Once this is done , the application is ready to catch signals of type "" SIGFREEZE "" and to save a checkpoint as a response . Restarting the application on the last saved checkpoint is quite easy : calling the program with argument "" = recovery "" makes psncLibCkpt load the checkpoint . Configuration is also quite simple and can be done through a configuration file or by editing a header file . The latter case requires compiling the application . Library libckpt . Libckpt ( Plank , Beck , Kingsley , & Li , 1995 ) is another CR library for C applications . It performs several optimizations such as "" main memory checkpointing "" ( a 2-stage pipeline overlapping application execution and flushing of the checkpointed state onto disk ) and state compression . The main reason for our interest in libckpt is its support for so-called "" user-directed checkpointing "" , which means that libckpt makes intense use of the application layer to optimize processing . One of these optimizations is user-driven exclusion of memory blocks from the state to be checkpointed . This allows not to include , e.g. , clean data ( memory yet to be initialized or used ) . Two function calls are available , exclude_bytes ( address , size , usage ) ; include_bytes ( address , size ) ; which allow to adapt the checkpointed state dynamically at run-time . Another application-level mechanism is so-called "" synchronous checkpointing "" : The user can specify , in the application program , points where checkpointing the state would have more sense from an algorithmic point of view . Function checkpoint_here does exactly this . There are also parameters allowing the express a minimum and a maximum amount of time between checkpointings . In the cited articles the authors of libckpt show how the adoption of user-directed checkpointing on the average brought to halving the checkpoint size . Conclusions . Two libraries for checkpointing and rollback , both of them targeting the same class of applications , have been discussed . The first case only manages user commands while the second one allows more control in the Figure 2 : A fault-tolerant program according to a SV system . application layer . Apart from performance issues , one can observe that the second case allows greater control but exhibits lower sc . Such control may be used to achieve adaptive resizing of the checkpointed state , so a slightly better a . 2.2 Conclusions . Figure 2 synthesizes the main characteristics of the SV approach : the functional and the fault-tolerant code are intertwined and the developer has to deal with the two concerns at the same time , even with the help of libraries of fault-tolerance provisions . In other words , SV requires the application developer to be an expert in fault-tolerance as well , because he ( she ) has to integrate in the application a number of fault-tolerance provisions among those available in a set of ready-made basic tools . His ( hers ) is the responsibility for doing it in a coherent , effective , and efficient way . As it has been observed in Chapter 2 , the resulting code is a mixture of functional code and of custom error-management code that does not always offer an acceptable degree of portability and maintainability . The functional and non-functional design concerns are not kept apart with SV , hence one can conclude that ( qualitatively ) SV exhibits poor separation of concerns ( sc ) . This in general has a bad impact on design and maintenance costs . As to syntactical adequacy ( sa ) , one can easily observe how following SV the fault-tolerance provisions are offered to the user through an interface based on a general-purpose language such as C or C ++ . As a consequence , very limited sa can be achieved by SV as a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance . Furthermore , little or no support is provided for off-line and on-line configuration and reconfiguration of the fault-tolerance provisions . Consequently the adaptability ( a ) of this approach is deemed as insufficient . On the other hand , tools in SV libraries and systems give the user the ability to deal with fault-tolerance "" atoms "" without having to worry about their actual implementation and with a good ratio of costs over improvements of the dependability attributes , sometimes introducing a relatively small overhead . Using these toolsets the designer can re-use existing , long tested , sophisticated pieces of software without having each time to "" re-invent the wheel "" . It is also important to remark that , in principle , SV poses no restrictions on the class of applications that may be tackled with it . As a final remark , it is interesting to note how , at least judging from the following recent work ( Liu , Meng , Zhou , & Wu , 2006 ) , it appears that the concept of a reusable "" library "" of fault-tolerance services is re-emerging in the context of service-oriented architectures . 2.3 Multiple-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Structures for Design Diversity This section describes multiple-version software fault-tolerance ( MV ) , an approach that requires N ( N > 1 ) independently designed versions of software . MV systems are therefore xT / yH / N S systems . In MV , a same service or functionality is supplied by N pieces of code that have been designed and developed by different , independent software teams2 . The aim of this approach is to reduce the effects of design faults due to human mistakes committed at design time . The most used configurations are N T / 1H / N S , i.e. , N sequentially applicable alternate programs using the same hardware channel , and 1T / N H / N S , based on the parallel execution of the alternate programs on N , possibly diverse , hardware channels . Two major approaches exist : the first one is known as recovery block ( Randell , 1975 ; Randell & Xu , 1995 ) , and is dealt with in Sect . 2.3 . The second approach is the so-called N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 , 1995 ) . It is described in Sect . 2.3 . The Recovery Block Technique . Recovery Blocks are usually implemented as N T / 1H / N S systems . The technique addresses residual software design faults . It aims at providing fault-tolerant functional components which may be nested within a sequential program . Other versions of the approach , implemented as 1T / N H / N S systems , are suited for parallel or distributed programs ( Scott , Gault , & McAllister , 1985 ; Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . The recovery blocks technique is similar to the hardware fault-tolerance approach known as "" stand-by sparing "" , which is described , e.g. , in ( Johnson , 1989 ) . The approach is summarized in Fig. 3 : on entry to a recovery block , the current state of the system is checkpointed . A primary alternate is executed . When it ends , an acceptance test checks whether the primary alternate successfully accomplished its objectives . If not , a backward recovery step reverts the system state back to its original value and a secondary alternate takes over the task of the primary alternate . When the secondary alternate Figure 3 : The recovery block model with two alternates . The execution environment is charged with the management of the recovery cache and the execution support functions ( used to restore the state of the application when the acceptance test is not passed ) , while the user is responsible for supplying both alternates and the acceptance test . ends , the acceptance test is executed again . The strategy goes on until either an alternate fulfills its tasks or all alternates are executed without success . In such a case , an error routine is executed . Recovery blocks can be nested – in this case the error routine invokes recovery in the enclosing block ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . An exception triggered within an alternate is managed as a failed acceptance test . A possible syntax for recovery blocks is as follows : ensure by else by else by else error acceptance test primary alternate alternate 2 .. alternate N Note how this syntax does not explicitly show the recovery step that should be carried out transparently by a run-time executive . The effectiveness of recovery blocks rests to a great extent on the coverage of the error detection mechanisms adopted , the most crucial component of which is the acceptance test . A failure of the acceptance test is a failure of the whole recovery blocks strategy . For this reason , the acceptance test must be simple , must not introduce huge run-time overheads , must not retain data locally , and so forth . It must be regarded as the ultimate means for detecting errors , though not the exclusive one . Assertions and run-time checks , possibly supported by underlying layers , need to buttress the strategy and reduce the probability of an acceptance test failure . Another possible failure condition for the recovery blocks approach is given by an alternate failing to terminate . This may be detected by a time-out mechanism that could be added to recovery blocks . This addition , obviously , further increases the complexity . The SwIFT library that has been described in Sect . 2.1 implements recovery blocks in the C language as follows : # include <ftmacros.h> ... ENSURE ( acceptance-test ) { primary alternate ; } ELSEBY { alternate 2 ; } ELSEBY { alternate 3 ; } ... ENSURE ; Unfortunately this approach does not cover any of the above mentioned requirements for enhancing the error detection coverage of the acceptance test . This would clearly require a run-time executive that is not part of this strategy . Other solutions , based on enhancing the grammar of pre-existing programming languages such as Pascal ( Shrivastava , 1978 ) and Coral ( Anderson , Barrett , Halliwell , & Moulding , 1985 ) , have some impact on portability . In both cases , code intrusion is not avoided . This translates into difficulties when trying to modify or maintain the application program without interfering "" much "" with the recovery structure , and vice-versa , when trying to modify or maintain the recovery structure without interfering "" much "" with the application program . Hence one can conclude that recovery blocks are characterized by unsatisfactory values of the structural attribute sc . Furthermore , a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance based exclusively on recovery blocks does not satisfy attribute sa3 . Finally , regarding attribute a , one can observe that recovery blocks are a rigid strategy that does not allow off-line configuration nor ( a fortiori ) code adaptability . On the other hand , recovery blocks have been successfully adopted throughout 30 years in many different application fields . It has been successfully validated by a number of statistical experiments and through mathematical modeling ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . Its adoption as the sole fault-tolerance means , while developing complex applications , resulted in some cases ( Anderson et al. , 1985 ) in a failure coverage of over 70 % , with acceptable overheads in memory space and CPU time . A negative aspect in MV system is given by development and maintenance costs , that grow as a monotonic function of x , y , z in any xT / yH / zS system . Development costs may be alleviated by using an approach such as diversity for off-the-shelf products ( Gashi & Popov , 2007 ; Gashi , Popov , & Strigini , 2006 ) . Other researchers have sought cost-effective diversity through the use of different computer architectures , different compilers , or different programming languages ( Meulen & Revilla , 2005 ) . A recent approach is using diversity for security concerns ( Cox et al. , 2006 ) . N-Version Programming . N - Version Programming ( NVP ) systems are built from generic architectures based on redundancy and consensus . Such Figure 4 : The N - Version Software model when N = 3 . The execution environment is charged with the management of the decision algorithm and with the execution support functions . The user is responsible for supplying the N versions . Note how the Decision Algorithm box takes care also of multiplexing its output onto the three hardware channels – also called "" lanes "" . systems usually belong to class 1T / N H / N S , less often to class N T / 1H / N S. NVP is defined by its author ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) as "" the independent generation of N > 1 functionally equivalent programs from the same initial specification . "" These N programs , called versions , are developed for being executed in parallel . This system constitutes a fault-tolerant software unit that depends on a generic decision algorithm to determine a consensus or majority result from the individual outputs of two or more versions of the unit . Such a strategy ( depicted in Fig. 4 ) has been developed under the fundamental conjecture that independent designs translate into random component failures – i.e. , statistical independence . Such a result would guarantee that correlated failures do not translate into immediate exhaustion of the available redundancy , as it would happen , e.g. , using N copies of the same version . Replicating software would also mean replicating any dormant software fault in the source version – see , e.g. , the accidents with the Therac-25 linear accelerator ( Leveson , 1995 ) or the Ariane 5 flight 501 ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . According to Aviz ̆ ienis , independent generation of the versions significantly reduces the probability of correlated failures . A number of experiments ( Eckhardt et al. , 1991 ) and theoretical studies ( Eckhardt & Lee , 1985 ) questioned the correctness of this assumption , though a more recent study involving a large number of independently developed multiple software versions claims otherwise ( Lyu , Huang , Sze , & Cai , 2003 ) . The main differences between recovery blocks and NVP are : • Recovery blocks ( in its original form ) is a sequential strategy whereas NVP allows concurrent execution ; • Recovery blocks require the user to provide a fault-free , application-specific , effective acceptance test , while NVP adopts a generic consensus or majority voting algorithm that can be provided by the execution environment ( EE ) ; • Recovery blocks allow different correct outputs from the alternates , while the general-purpose character of the consensus algorithm of NVP calls for a single correct output4 . The two models collapse when the acceptance test of recovery blocks is done as in NVP , i.e. , when the acceptance test is a consensus on the basis of the outputs of the different alternates . A few hybrid designs derived by coupling the basic ideas of recover blocks and NVP are now briefly discussed . Variations on the Main Theme . N Self-Checking Programming ( Laprie , Arlat , Beounes , & Kanoun , 1995 ) couples recovery blocks with N - version programming : as in N - version programming , N independently produced versions are executed , sequentially or in parallel . Each version is associated to a separate acceptance test , possibly different from the others , which tells whether the version passed the test and also produces a "" rank "" . A selection module then chooses as overall output the one produced by the version with the highest rank . A variant of this technique organized versions in couples and performs comparison between the outputs of their versions as a general-purpose acceptance test . To the best of our knowledge , no application-level support for N Self-Checking Programming has been proposed to date . Consensus recovery blocks ( Vouk , McAllister , Eckhardt , & Kim , 1993 ) targets the chance that the N - version programming scheme fail because it is not possible to find a majority vote among the output of the replicas . When this is the case , instead of declaring failure the outputs are assessed by acceptance tests ( as in recovery blocks ) , which then have the last word in choosing the overall system output or declaring failure . Reliability analysis proves this approach to be better than N - version programming and recovery blocks , though the added complexity may well translate in higher chances of introducing faults in the architecture ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) . Distributed recovery blocks ( K. Kim & Welch , 1989 ) ( DRB ) may be considered as a parallel computing extension of recovery blocks . In DRB there is not a single couple of primary and alternate versions . Instead , several couples are running concurrently on different interconnected processing nodes . Each couple executes the recovery block scheme in parallel . Nodes and couples are organized hierarchically . When the execution of the top-level couple finishes , one queries the result of the acceptance test . If the test is passed by either primary or alternate , then the system declares success . If the test is not passed , instead of declaring failure as in plain recovery blocks , DRB goes on checking the acceptance test at the top-minus-one node . Global failure is only declared if no successful acceptance test can be found when orderly scanning the nodes . A time acceptance test is also used to handle performance failure of the acceptance tests . Again on the Ariane 5 . Chapter 2 briefly reported on the case of the Ariane 5 disaster . As it was mentioned there , the chain of events that brought to the Ariane 5 failure started within the Inertial Reference System ( SRI ) , a component responsible for the measurement of the attitude of the launcher and its movements in space . To enhance the dependability of the system , the SRI was equipped two computers . Such computers were operating in parallel , with identical hardware and software . As described in the mentioned chapter , the SRI software had a number of data conversion instructions . Some of these instructions were "" protected "" ( proper exception handling code had been associated to them ) , while some others were considered "" safe enough "" and were not protected so as to reduce the overhead on performance . One of the unprotected variables experienced an Operand Error . If the Ariane 5 designers had divided the SRI variables into two blocks , and had protected one block on the primary SRI and the other block on the backup SRI , they would have had no increased performance penalty and the failure would not have occurred . 2.3.1 A hybrid case : Data Diversity A special , hybrid case is given by data diversity ( Ammann & Knight , 1988 ) . A data diversity system is a 1T / N H / 1S ( less often a N T / 1H / 1S ) . It can be concisely described as an NVP system in which N equal replicas are used as versions , but each replica receives a different minor perturbation of the input data . Under the hypothesis that the function computed by the replicas is non chaotic , that is , it does not produce very different output values when fed with slightly different inputs , data diversity may be a cost-effective way to fault-tolerance . Clearly in this case the voting mechanism does not run a simple majority voting but some vote fusion algorithm ( Lorczak , Caglayan , & Eckhardt , 1989 ) . A typical application of data diversity is that of real time control programs , where sensor re-sampling or a minor perturbation in the sampled sensor value may be able to prevent a failure . Being substantially an NVP system , data diversity reaches the same values for the structural attributes . The greatest advantage of this technique is that of drastically decreasing design and maintenance costs , because design diversity is avoided . Conclusions . As in recovery blocks , also NVP has been successfully adopted for many years in various application fields , including safety-critical airborne and spaceborne applications . The generic NVP architecture , based on redundancy and consensus , addresses parallel and distributed applications written in any programming paradigm . A generic , parameterizable architecture for real-time systems that supports the NVP strategy straightforwardly is GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) . It is noteworthy to remark that the EE ( also known as N - Version Executive ) is a complex component that needs to manage a number of basic functions , for instance the execution of the decision algorithm , the assurance of input consistency for all versions , the inter-version communication , the version synchronization and the enforcement of timing constraints ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1995 ) . On the other hand , this complexity is not part of the application software – the N versions – and it does not need to be aware of the fault-tolerance strategy . An excellent degree of transparency can be reached , thus guaranteeing a good value for attribute sc . Furthermore , as mentioned in Chapter 2 , costs and times required by a thorough verification , validation , and testing of this architectural complexity may be acceptable , while charging them to each application component is certainly not a cost-effective option . Regarding attribute sa , the same considerations provided when describing recovery blocks hold for NVP : also in this case a single fault-tolerance strategy is followed . For this reason NVP is assessed here as unsatisfactory regarding attribute sa . Off-line adaptability to "" bad "" environments may be reached by increasing the value of N – though this requires developing new versions – a costly activity for both times and costs . Furthermore , the architecture does not allow any dynamic management of the fault-tolerance provisions . One concludes that attribute a is poorly addressed by NVP . In other words , the choices of the designer about the fault model are very difficult to maintain and change . Portability is restricted by the portability of the EE and of each of the N versions . Maintainability actions may also be problematic , as they need to be replicated and validated N times – as well as performed according to the NVP paradigm , so not to impact negatively on statistical independence of failures . Clearly the same considerations apply to recovery blocks as well . In other words , the adoption of multiple-version software fault-tolerance provisions always implies a penalty on maintainability and portability . Limited NVP support has been developed for "" conventional "" programming languages such as C. For instance , libft ( see Sect . 2.1 ) implements NVP as follows : # include <ftmacros.h> ... NVP Figure 5 : A fault-tolerant program according to a MV system . VERSION { block 1 ; SENDVOTE ( v_pointer , v_size ) ; } VERSION { block 2 ; SENDVOTE ( v_pointer , v_size ) ; } ... ENDVERSION ( timeout , v_size ) ; if ( ! agreeon ( v_pointer )) error_handler ; ENDNVP ; Note that this particular implementation extinguishes the potential transparency that in general characterizes NVP , as it requires some non-functional code to be included . This translates into an unsatisfactory value for attribute sc . Note also that the execution of each block is in this case carried out sequentially . It is important to remark how the adoption of NVP as a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance requires a substantial increase in development and maintenance costs : both 1T / N H / N S and N T / 1H / N S systems have a cost function growing with the square of N. The author of the NVP strategy remarks how such costs are paid back by the gain in trustworthiness . This is certainly true when dealing with systems possibly subjected to catastrophic failures – let us recall once more the case of the Ariane 5 flight 501 ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . Nevertheless , the risks related to the chances of rapid exhaustion of redundancy due to a burst of correlated failures caused by a single or few design faults ( Motet & Geffroy , 2003 ) justify and call for the adoption of other fault-tolerance provisions within and around the NVP unit in order to deal with the case of a failed NVP unit . Figure 5 synthesizes the main characteristics of the MV approach : several replicas of ( portions of ) the functional code are produced and managed by a control component . In recovery blocks this component is often coded side by side with the functional code while in NVP this is usually a custom hardware box . 3 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Voting Farm In this section the EFTOS voting farm – a library of functions written in the C programming language and implementing a distributed software voting mechanism – is described : This tool could be used to implement NVP systems in the application software . It has developed in the framework of project EFTOS , which was introduced in Sect . 2.1.1 . The Voting Farm was designed to be used either as a stand-alone tool for fault masking or as a basic block in a more complex fault tolerance structure set up within the EFTOS fault tolerance framework . In what follows the design and structure of the stand-alone voting farm are described as a means to orchestrate redundant resources with fault transparency as primary goal . It is also described how the user can exploit said tool to straightforwardly set up systems consisting of redundant modules and based on voters . An example of such system is given by so-called "" restoring organs . "" 3.1 Basic Structure and Features of the EFTOS Voting Farm A well-known approach to achieve fault masking and therefore to hide the occurrence of faults is the so-called N-modular redundancy technique ( NMR ) , valid both on hardware and at software level . To overcome the shortcoming of having one voter , whose failure leads to the failure of the whole system even when each and every other module is still running correctly , it is possible to use N replicas of the voter and to provide N copies of the inputs to each replica , as described in Fig. 6 . This approach exhibits among others the following properties : 1 . Depending on the voting technique adopted in the voter , the occurrence of a limited number of faults in the inputs to the voters may be masked to the subsequent modules ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) ; for instance , by using majority voting , up to ceil ( N / 2 ) − 1 faults can be made transparent . 2 . If one considers a pipeline of such systems , then a failing voter in one stage of the pipeline can be simply regarded as a corrupted input for the next stage , where it will be restored . The resulting system is easily recognizable to be more robust than plain NMR , as it exhibits no single-point-of-failure . Dependability analysis confirms intuition . Property 2 . in particular explains why such systems are also known as "" restoring organs "" ( Johnson , 1989 ) . Figure 6 : A restoring organ , i.e. , an N-modular redundant system with N voters , when N = 3 . From the point of view of software engineering , this system though has two major drawbacks : • Each module in the NMR must be aware of and responsible for interacting with the whole set of voters ; • The complexity of these interactions , which is a function increasing with the square of N , the cardinality of the voting farm , burdens each module in the NMR . Within EFTOS the two above flaws were recognized as serious impairments to our design goals , which included replication transparency , ease of use , and flexibility ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998a ) . In order to reach the full set of our requirements , the design of the system was slightly modified as described in Fig. 7 : In this new picture each module only has to interact with and be aware of one voter , regardless the value of N. Moreover , the complexity of such a task is fully shifted to the voter , i.e. , it is transparent to the user . The basic component of our tool is therefore the voter ( see Fig. 8 ) which is defined as follows : A voter is a local software module connected to one user module and to a farm of fully interconnected fellows . Attribute "" local "" Figure 7 : Structure of the EFTOS voting farm mechanism for a NMR system with N = 3 ( the well-known triple modular redundancy system , or TMR ) . Figure 8 : A user module and its voter . The latter is the only member of the farm of which the user module should be aware of : from the user point of view , messages will only flow between these two ends . This has been designed so as to minimize the burden of the user module and to keep it free to continue undisturbed as much as possible . means that both user module and voter run on the same processing node . As a consequence of the above definition , the user module has no other interlocutor than its voter , whose tasks are completely transparent to the user module . It is therefore possible to model the whole system as a simple client-server application : On each user module the same client protocol applies ( see Sect . 3.1.1 ) while the same server protocol is executed on every instance of the voter ( see Sect . 3.1.3 ) . 3.1.1 Client-Side of the Voting Farm : the User Module Table 3 gives an example of the client-side protocol to be executed on each processing node of the system in which a user module runs : a well-defined , ordered list of actions has to take place so that the voting farm be coherently declared and defined , described , activated , controlled , and queried : In particular , describing a farm stands for creating a static map of the allocation of its components ; activating a farm substantially means spawning the local voter ( Sect . 3.1.3 will shed more light on this ) ; controlling a farm means requesting its service by means of control and data messages ; finally , a voting farm can also be queried about its state , the current voted value , etc. As already mentioned , the above steps have to be carried out in the same way on each user module : this coherency is transparently supported in Single-Process , Multiple-Data ( SPMD ) architectures . This is the case , for instance , of Parsytec EPX ( Embedded Parallel eXtensions to UNIX , see , e.g. , ( Parsytec , 1996a , 1996b )) whose "" initial load mechanism "" transparently runs the same executable image of the user application on each processing node of the user partition . This protocol is available to the user as a class-like fault-tolerant library of functions dealing with opaque objects referenced through pointers . A tight resemblance with the FILE set of functions of the standard C programming language library ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) has been sought so to shorten as much as possible the user's learning time – the API and usage of Voting Farm closely resemble those of FILE ( see Table 1 ) . phase declaration opening control closings FILE class FILE * f ; f = fopen ( . .. ) ; fwrite ( f , ... ) ; fclose ( f ) ; VotingFarm t class VotingFarm t * vf ; vf = VF open ( ... ) ; VF control ( vf , ... ) ; VF close ( vf ) ; Table 1 : The C language standard class for managing file is compared with the VF class . The tight resemblance has been sought in order to shorten as much as possible the user's learning time . The Voting Farm has been developed using the CWEB system of structured documentation ( De Florio , 1997 ) – an invaluable tool both at design and at development time ( Knuth , 1984 ) . 3.1.2 System and Fault Models A fault and system model document allows to bring to the foreground all the assumptions and dependencies that were used while designing a service . This is done so that when porting that service to a new platform all those underlying dependencies and assumptions do not slip the attention of the designer – see Chapter 2 for possible consequences of such a mistake . The EFTOS target platform was a dedicated system with a custom , dedicated communication network . Accordingly , the adopted system model was that of partially synchronous systems . This assumption is in this case a realistic one , at least for parallel environments like that of the Parsytec EPX , which was equipped with a fast and dedicated communication subsystem , such that processors did not have to compete "" too much "" for the network . Such subsytem also offered a reliable communication means and allowed to transparently tolerate faults like , e.g. , the break of a link , or a router's failure . The internal algorithms of the Voting Farm are assumed to have fail / stop behavior . Upper bounds are known for communication delays . A means to send and to receive messages across communication links is assumed to be available . Let us call these functions Send and Receive . Furthermore , the following semantics is assumed for those functions : Send blocks the caller until the communication system has fully delivered the specified message to the specified ( single ) recipient , while Receive blocks the caller until the communication system has fully transported a message directed to the caller , or until a user-specified timeout has expired . The Voting Farm can deal with the following classes of faults ( Laprie , 1995 ) : • physical as well as human-made , • accidental as well as intentional , • development as well as operational , • internal and external faults , • permanent and temporary , as long as the corresponding failure domain consists only of value failures . Timing errors are also considered , though the delay must not be larger than some bounded value ( which is assumed to be the case in the system model ) . The tool is only capable of dealing with one fault at a time – the tool is ready to deal with other new faults only after having recovered from the present one . Consistent value errors are tolerated . Under this assumption , arbitrary in-code value errors may occur . As a final remark , let us recall what mentioned in Chapter 2 : software engineering for fault-tolerant systems should allow considering the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . The EFTOS Voting Farm allows to do so : If a service using the voting farm is moved to a new environment , for instance one characterized by a higher frequency of faults affecting the voters , the designer has just to choose a new value for N , the number of voters . Nothing changes in the application layer except that value . Of course this is an example of off-line adaptation , as it requires recompiling the service programs . In Chapter 4 an example of a tool will be described , which tracks the environment adjusting its fault model accordingly . 3.1.3 Server-Side of the Voting Farm : the Voter The local voter thread represents the server-side of the voting farm . After the set up of the static description of the farm ( Table 3 , Step 3 ) in the form of an ordered list of processing node identifiers ( positive integer numbers ) , the server-side of our application is launched by the user by means of the VF run function . This turns the static representation of a farm into an "" alive "" ( running ) object , the voter thread . This latter connects to its user module via inter-process communication provisions ( so called "" local links "" ) and to the rest of the farm via synchronous , blocking channels ( "" virtual links "" ) . Once the connection is established , and in the absence of faults , the voter reacts to the arrival of the user messages as a finite-state automaton : In particular , the arrival of input messages triggers a number of broadcasts among the voters – as shown in Fig. 9 – which are managed through the distributed algorithm described in Table 2 . When faults occur and affect up to M < N voters , no arrival for more than ∆ t time units is interpreted as an error . As a consequence , variable input messages is incremented as if a message had arrived , and its faulty state is recorded . By doing so one can tolerate up to M < N errors at the cost of M ∆ t time units . Note that even though this algorithm tolerates up to N − 1 faults , the voting algorithm may be intrinsically able to cope with much less than that : for instance , majority voting fails in the presence of faults affecting ceil ( N / 2 ) or more voters . As another example , algorithms computing a weighted average of the input values consider all items whose "" faulty bit "" is set as zero-weight values , automatically discarding them from the average . This of course may also lead to imprecise results as the number of faults gets larger . Besides the input value , which represents a request for voting , the user module may send to its voter a number of other requests – some of these are used in Table 3 , Step 5 . In particular , the user can choose to adopt a voting algorithm among the following ones : • Formalized majority voting technique , • Generalized median voting technique , Figure 9 : The "" local "" input value has to be broadcast to N − 1 fellows , and N − 1 "" remote "" input values have to be collected from each of the fellows .

Each voter waits for a message for a time which is at most ∆ t , then it assumes a fault affected either a user module or its voter . Function Broadcast sends its argument to all voters whose id is different from voter id . It is managed via a special sending thread so to circumvent the case of a possibly deadlock-prone Send . • Formalized plurality voting technique , • Weighted averaging technique , • Consensus , the first four items being the voting techniques that were generalized in ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) to "" arbitrary N-version systems with arbitrary output types using a metric space framework . "" To use these algorithms , a metric function can be supplied by the user when he or she "" opens "" the farm ( Table 3 , Step 2 , function objcmp ) : this is exactly the same approach used in opaque C functions like e.g. , bsearch or qsort ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) . A default metric function is also available . Note how the fault model assumption : "" arbitrary in-code value errors may occur "" is due to the fact that the adopted metric approach is not able to deal with non-code values . The choice of the algorithm , as well as other control choices are managed via function VF control , which takes as argument a voting farm pointer plus a variable number of control argument – in Table 3 , Step 5 , these arguments are an input message , a virtual link for the output vote , an algorithm identifier , plus an argument for that algorithm . Other requests include the setting of some algorithmic parameters and the removal of the voting farm ( function VF close ) . The voters' replies to the incoming requests are straightforward . In particular , a VF DONE message is sent to the user module when a broadcast has been performed ; for the sake of avoiding deadlocks , one can only close a farm after the VF DONE message has been sent . Any failed attempt causes the voter to send a VF REFUSED message . The same refusing message is sent when the user tries to initiate a new voting session sooner than the conclusion of the previous session . Note how function VF get ( Table 3 , Step 6 ) simply sets the caller in a waiting state from which it exits either on a message arrival or on the expiration of a time-out . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 / * declaration * / VotingFarm t * vf ; / * definition * / vf = VF open ( objcmp ) ; / * description * / For all i in { 1 , ... , N } : VF add ( vf , nodei , identi ) ; / * activation * / VF run ( vf ) ; / * control * / VF control ( vf , VF input ( obj , sizeof ( VFobj t )) , VF output ( link ) , VF algorithm ( VFA WEIGHTED AVERAGE ) , VF scaling factor ( 1 . 0 )) ; / * query * / do { } while ( VF error == VF NONE and VF get ( vf ) == VF REFUSED ) ; / * deactivation * / VF close ( vf ) ; Table 3 : An example of usage of the voting farm . 3.1.4 Voting Farm : An Example This section introduces and discusses a program simulating a NMR ( N modular redundant ) restoring organ which makes use of the Voting Farm class .

A special version has been developed for the latter , which adopts the mailbox paradigm as opposed to message passing via virtual links . In this latter version , the tool has been used in a software fault tolerance implementation of a stable memory system for the high-voltage substation controller of ENEL , the main Italian electricity supplier ( Deconinck et al. , 1998 ) . This stable memory system is based on a combination of temporal and spatial redundancy to tolerate both transient and permanent faults , and uses two voting farms , one with consensus and the other with majority voting . 80 60 Figure 10 : The interaction between Watchdog Timer , DIR net and the application . The dotted line represents control flow , the full line stands for data flow . The Voting Farm can be used as a stand-alone tool , as seen so far ; but it can also be used as a tool to compose more complex dependable mechanisms within a wider framework . Chapter 9 shall describe how to use our tool with the so-called "" recovery language approach "" , a linguistic framework and an architecture for dependable automation services . As a conclusion the Voting Farm is characterized by limited support for sc and bad sa ( as it only targets a single provision ) . As for aone may observe how , despite that tool exhibits no support for adaptability in the form described in this section , this aspect could be enhanced by using an hybrid approach such as the one described in Chapter 9 . 4 The EFTOS Tools : The Watchdog Timer This section describes the EFTOS watchdog timer . It consists of a single thread . This thread does the timing and checking of user-driven timestamps , and informs a DIR Agent thread if a performance failure is detected . This concept is depicted in Fig. 10 . The whole set up of Fig. 10 is built by executing the single StartWD function when the two major system component for EFTOS , the so-called DIR net and Server net , are both used and when the Watchdog thread was pre-configured through the server net ( details on how to do this have been omitted ) . Note that after this step any future interaction with the WatchDog Timer , done via watchdap , is characterized by a satisfactory level of transparency : The user needs not to concern about low level details such as protocols and interface ; he or she has just to control the process through a high-level application-program interface . This user-transparency can no longer be sustained if neither DIR net nor Server net are used . In this case it is the responsibility of the user to deploy the watchdog through function StartWDnd and to let it start watching by issuing function WDStart . In both cases the user interfaces its watchdog through the same function , the already mentioned watchdap . As can be seen from Fig. 10 , an active watchdog connects to a so-called DIR agent and notifies it of all performance failures experienced by its watched task . When no DIR net is used , this message must nevertheless be sent to some other task . The following short source code illustrates the usage of the EFTOS watchdog : // A worker performs some work receiving input and sending output // through a communication link called ioLink // // To protect the worker , a watchdog timer is started ( in this case // by the worker itself ) . Within the processing loop , the watcher // sends n heartbeat signal to the watchdog through function watchdapp // int worker ( LinkCB ̇ t * ioLink ) { // declare the communication link with the watchdog 10 LinkCB ̇ t * AWDLink ; // declare the communication link with the EFTOS server net LinkCB ̇ t * mylink2server ; // input and output buffers char input [ 1024 ] , output [ 1024 ] ; int size , error ; 20 // Connects ( or spawns ) the EFTOS Server net mylink2server = ConnectServer ( ) ; if (( AWDLink = StartWD ( link2server , ... various parameters ... , ... cycle times ... , & error )) == NULL ) fprintf ( stderr , "" Failed to initialise the WD , error : % d "" , error ) ; // main processing loop : get input data ... 30 while (( size = RecvLink ( ioLink , ( byte * ) input , sizeof ( input ))) ! = 0 ) { // ... process data ... process ( input , output ) ; // ... forward output ... SendLink ( ioLink , ( byte * ) output , strlen ( output ) + 1 ) ; // ... and say "" I 'm OK "" if ( watchdap ( AWDLink , TIMESTAMP , 0 ) ! = 0 ) 40 fprintf ( stderr , "" Error re-initialising the watchdog "" ) ; } } For more details on programming and configuring the EFTOS watchdog timer the reader may refer to ( Team , 1998 ) . The system model of the EFTOS Watchdog Timer is the same specified for the whole EFTOS framework : A fully synchronous system – an assumption allowed by the embedded character of the EFTOS target services and platforms . The fault model includes accidental , permanent or temporary design faults , and temporary , external , physical faults . As a final statement let us remark how , as for the structural properties , what has been said for the Voting Farm also applies to the EFTOS watchdog timer : limited support for sc , bad sa due to the single design concern , and no adaptability unless coupled with other approaches and tools . One such hybrid approach is described in Chapter 9 . The EFTOS watchdog timer was developed by Wim Rosseel at the University of Leuven . 5 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Trap Handler Programming languages such as C constitute powerful tools to craft efficient system services , but are streamlined "" by construction "" for run-time efficiency . As a consequence , their run-time executive is very simple : They lack mechanisms for bound checking in arrays , are very permissive with data type conversions , and allow all type of "" dirty tricks "" with pointers . A fortiori , the C language does not provide any support for exception handling . Within project EFTOS a so-called Trap Handler was designed and developed . This tool is basically a library and a run-time executive to manage exceptions taking place in programs written in the C programming language on Parsytec supercomputers based on PowerPC processors . The library was developed Stephan Graeber at DLR ( the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt ) with the Parsytec EPX message passing library . In the following this tool is described . 5.1 The EFTOS Trap Handling Tool As mentioned in Chapter 2 , exception ( or trap ) handling is an important feature to design software fault-tolerant systems . When the processor e.g. tries to access memory that is not allocated or executes illegal instructions then a trap is generated , which causes the processor to jump to a specialized routine called trap handler . As other operating systems , also EPX provides a standard trap handling function which simply stops processing and writes a core dump file . The EFTOS framework provides two ways to alter this behavior : 1 . The Trap Handling Tool connects to a third party ( by default , the EFTOS DIR net ) and creates a "" fault notification stream "" : Caught exceptions are forwarded to a remote handler . A generalization of this strategy is used in Oz ( see Chapter 5 ) and Ariel ( in Chapter 6 ) and , in service-oriented architectures , in the system reported in ( Ardissono , Furnari , Goy , Petrone , & Segnan , 2006 ) . 2 . The programmer defines which exception to catch and how to handle them with the functions of the Trap Handling library . This is semantically equivalent to , e.g. , Java exceptions , but very different from the syntactical point of view . This is because the handling is done with the programming language , as opposed to in . 5.2 Algorithm of the Trap Handling Tool . The first action of StartTrapTool is to give the server network the command to create remotely a thread on a specified node with the code of the TrapTool . After that , it connects to the newly spawn trap tool and exchanges some additional information with it . After this state has been set up properly , it installs a new trap handler for the current thread . The Trap handling Tool itself first gets the connection to the StartTrapTool function and receives the additional information from there . After that it connects to the appropriate DIR agent , and waits for incoming messages for the rest of its execution time . If a trap message arises from the trap handler , the DIR net is informed and the necessary information about the trap that occurred is passed to the responsible DIR agent . The DIR net is also able to send messages to the Trap Handling Tool to enact user-defined exception handling procedures . The trap handler itself is only responsible for passing the message of a fault to the Trap Tool and to set the processor in a sleeping mode . The processor will resume only when proper actions to handle the exception are scheduled for execution . 5.2.1 Structure of user trap handling The concept of user-defined trap handlers is based on a stack of functions . The first element in the stack is the default EPX trap handler . New user-defined handlers are orderly pushed onto the stack . When an exception is caught , the stack is visited from top to bottom calling each visited function . When a function successfully handles the exception the Trap Handler stops this procedure , otherwise the stack reaches its bottom and EPX performs termination and memory dump . A user defined trap handler can handle either one or more classes of traps . Traps are processor-dependent , e.g. the PowerPC defines among others the following classes : 1 . DSI exception : A data memory access can not be performed because of a memory protection violation , or because the instruction is not supported for the type of memory addressed . 2 . ISI exception : An instruction fetch can not be performed . Reasons may be that an attempt is made to fetch an instruction from a non-execute segment , or that a page fault occurred when translating the effective address , or that the fetch access violates memory protection . 3 . Alignment exception : processor can not perform a memory access because of an incorrect alignment of the requested address . 4 . Program exception : This may have several reasons . E.g. the execution of an instruction is attempted with an illegal opcode . The user-defined trap handler should be defined as a function with the following prototype : int MyTrapHandler ( int TrapNo ) With TrapNo this function gets the trap number , that is the exception code corresponding to the exception that was actually caught by the system . This corresponds to the exception code returned by Java in the catch statements . The user defined trap handler function should return 1 if the trap was handled and the system has to be recovered , otherwise the function should return 0 . If a trap occurs , in some cases the whole node has to be rebooted . In such cases a user defined trap handler can be used for instance to store state information on another node , so as to restart execution from there or on the same node after reboot . Obviously this procedure only covers transient faults . In other cases the fault shall represent itself and cause the occurrence of the same failure again . With the function NewTrapHandler the user can push a trap handling function on top of the handling functions stack . When the function is called for the first time , a stack manager is installed as internal trap handler and the stack of functions is initialized . With function ReleaseTrapHandler the user can remove the function at the top of the stack . To remove all functions and bring the stack to its initialization state with just the original EPX trap handler , the user can invoke function SetDefaultTrapHandler . As can be clearly seen , the EFTOS Trap Handler is not as easy and intuitive as e.g. the exception handling mechanism used in Java : As mentioned already , syntactical adequacy ( sa , defined in Chapter 2 ) has a strong link with complexity . The other side of the coin is given by efficiency : The EFTOS trap handling tool is characterized by a very limited overhead and consumes quite few system resources . The following short source code illustrates the usage of user defined trap handlers : // Function MyTraphandler returns 1 if an exception // is caught and processed , and 0 otherwise . // int MyTrapHandler ( int TrapNo ) { switch ( TrapNo ) { // this is the equivalent of the Java catch statement . // NK TRA DFETCH means in EPX '' data access exception '' case NK TRAP DFETCH : 10 // what follows is the handling of the data access exception ... return 1 ; // other cases may follow here .. . * / default : return 0 ; } } 20 void main ( void ) { // some work is done here ... // right before an operation that may result in a data exception NewTrapHandler ( & MyTrapHandler ) ; 30 // here there is an operation that may result in a data exception ... // the default handler is finally restored ReleaseTrapHandler ( ) ; } 5.2.2 System and Fault Models of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool The system model of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool is the same specified for the whole EFTOS framework : A fully synchronous system – an assumption allowed by the embedded character of the EFTOS target services and platforms . Target faults are clearly exceptions and system errors such as the one presented in Chapter 2 . The fault model includes temporary design faults , and temporary external physical faults . 5.2.3 Conclusions A single-version software fault-tolerance tool has been introduced , addressing exception handling and fault information forward . Developed in the framework of the EFTOS project , the tool is characterized by limited support for sc , bad sa due to its single design concern , and no adaptability . 6 The EFTOS Tools : Atomic Actions The main goal of the functions described in what follows is to provide a mechanism for atomic transactions : The actions checked by these functions either end properly or are not executed at all . A description of transactions can be found in Chapter 2 . 6.1 The EFTOS Atomic Action Tool As explained in Chapter 2 , an atomic action or transaction may be defined as the activity of a set of components where no information flows between that set and the rest of the system during that activity , and the activity is either fully completed or not at all ( Anderson & Lee , 1981 ) . To guarantee this property an atomic action needs to be able to checkpoint its state before the beginning of the action and roll back in case of failure . In literature several protocols for atomic commitment have been proposed ( Babaoglu , Toueg , & Mullender , 1993 ; Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) . As mentioned already , probably the best known and the simplest protocol is the two phase commit protocol ( 2PC ) ( Lampson , 1981 ) . The 2PC protocol although very simple has as the big drawback that it may block . For example , if the coordinator fails while all the cohorts are waiting to receive a decision message , then none of these processes will be able to terminate . The cohorts need to wait until the coordinator is recovered before being able to decide on the outcome of the action . It is clear that such behavior is unacceptable . Next to the blocking aspect of several protocols , often the assumption is made that no faults can occur in the communication layer . Clearly this assumption has a coverage , which means one needs accomodate for the cases where it proves to be not valid . The tool described herein takes these aspects into account . Let us begin by introducing our assumptions : Atomic Action Algorithm : ( save the status ) ( Synchronize ) Check an assertion Set the timer t_i , Broadcast the result of the assertion to the other partners { while the deadline has not passed for all partners send result within time if sending timed out change state to abort and inform everyone hereof } Receive the result from all partners { while not received all results and deadline t_i has not passed receive if deadline t_i passed abort and inform everyone } If at least one result was abort then abort Wait ( t_2 ) for potential stray messages if result is abort do recovery Table 4 : A pseudo code sketch of the algorithm of the Atomic Action tools . 6.1.1 System Model Assumptions . As already remarked , any algorithm is valid under specific assumptions . In the case of the EFTOS Atomic Action Tool a partially synchronous model of computation is assumed : although not limited as in the synchronous model , an upper bound on message delays is assumed to be known . At any time a process may be either operational or non-operational . A process is considered to be operational when it follows exactly the actions specified by the program it is executing . Any operational process may end up in a non-operational state due to a failure . In a non-operational state any information related to that process is considered to be lost , unless it was stored into some stable storage . A non-operational process may be returned to an operational state after executing some recovery protocol . During this recovery protocol the information saved in stable memory is used to restore the process . Each processor has its local clock , which does not run synchronous with the neighboring processors . Each local clock however is only used to measure time intervals , so a global time is not a necessary assumption ( Lamport , 1978 ) . The target design platforms require a bounded termination time and a low amount of communication , as communication negatively affect the communication vs. processing ratio . Therefore a reasonably simple and lightweight algorithm has been designed . It has as main constraint that all tasks should be loosely synchronized before making use of the algorithm . The Algorithm . Figure 4 provides the reader with a pseudo code overview of the algorithm . The algorithm has a fairly simple structure as can be seen at first glance . Some pre-processing steps like saving state information and loosely synchronizing should be considered . Hereafter the algorithm will start by checking an assertion which decides on the local status . After the local status has been decided a timer t1 , conditional for the successful completion of the action , is set . As a next step the local status information is propagated to the other partners in the action and the algorithm starts waiting for the status information to be received from the other partners . All expected messages should be received within the time-out t1 to be able to result in a successful action . Once all status messages are received , a decision is made on success or failure of the action . The decision propagation however is delayed for some more time t2 , so that possible failure messages can be received . This will be further elaborated in the next section where some failure cases are discussed . By means of these multiple time-outs ( t1 , t2 ) the algorithm can guarantee successful functioning under the specified restrictions . Failure Mode . Both process and communication failures are considered . For process failures , it may be clear that the time-out ( t1 ) will trigger a transition to the ABORT state ( see Fig. 11 ) . For communication , due to the synchronous nature hereof on the design platforms , failures can be compared to process failures . This is clear in case of blocking . In such a case either one partner never joined in the communication or both partners tried to send or receive over the same communication link . Otherwise the link communication might also truly fail . This case can be considered as a failure of the two partners in communication . This assumption is valid because the only thing the processes are aware of is the fact that their communication with another process failed . In Fig. 12 some failure cases are illustrated . In the first case it is considered a process failure . The failure of this process will lead to a condition in which insufficient inputs have been received for a successful decision phase . This will lead to a time-out that will automatically trigger the ABORT behavior of the action . In the second case it is assumed that some communication fails . This will lead to the situation where some partners will decide to ABORT as they have not received sufficient inputs , while others will Figure 11 : The behavior in case of a not responding partner . C ? stands for potential commit . A ? stands for potential abort , A ! is an agreed abort . T ? is a potential time-out in communication . t1 is the primary time-out the action should respect , t2 is the secondary timeout used to receive stray messages . decide to COMMIT in the first step . The transition to ABORT however , due to insufficient input , will trigger the propagation of the ABORT message to all other partners . Upon receipt of this message all partners will still change their status to ABORT . 6.1.2 The Implementation The status of the action is decided upon by assertions provided by the user . The implementation has two working modes . In one mode only the local status is changed , unless there is a transition from COMMIT to ABORT at which point this new state is propagated to all partners in the action . In the second mode the distributed state decision is made . This is the mode illustrated in Fig. 13 . Notice that the communication time-out is realized by means of a return message that should be received within time T. In Fig. 14 the state graph of the used algorithm is shown . AA End in this graph is the intermediate state complying with the first mode of the algorithm . From this graph it is clear that any error will result in a transition to the ABORT state . 6.1.3 Functionality The whole mechanism basically is based on two levels of control ( see Fig. 15 . The first level embraces the local state . This is achieved by direct interaction with a local Atomic Action thread . The second level embraces a global state . This global state is maintained by the Atomic Action threads themselves , using the knowledge of the requirements to limit the communications . The communication limitation is achieved for in-block checks , where the global state will only be adapted if a request comes to change to local state to Figure 12 : The behavior in case of a communication fails ( time-out ) . "" abort "" . A final check always leads to a proprietary decision among all local states and the current global state . This leads to communication from every partner to every other partner , thus having a quadratic complexity . More details about the EFTOS Atomic Action tool is available in ( Team , 1998 ) and ( Rosseel , De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . 6.2 Conclusion A single-version software fault-tolerance provisions for managing atomic actions has been briefly sketched . As most of the EFTOS tools , it is characterized by limited support for SC , bad SA and no adaptability . 7 The TIRAN Data Stabilizing Software Tool An application-level tool is described , which implements a software system for stabilizing data values , capable of tolerating both permanent faults in memory and transient faults affecting computation , input and memory devices by means of a strategy coupling temporal and spatial redundancy . The tool maximizes data integrity allowing a new value to enter the system only after a user-parameterizable stabilization procedure has been successfully passed . Designed and developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN ( the follow-up of project EFTOS , described in more detail in Chapter 6 ) , the tool can be used in stand-alone mode but can also be coupled with other dependable mechanisms developed within that project . Its use had been suggested by ENEL , the main Italian electricity supplier , in order to replace a hardware stable storage device adopted in their highvoltage sub-stations . Figure 13 : The message passing scheme in fault free case for the EFTOS implementation . The application starts the AA thread which will spawn a sender thread on its own . This is illustrated in the beginning of the time-scale . At this point node I also will save some status information to a stable storage entity . Once a distributed decision is to be achieved messages are exchanged according to the algorithm . Upon the agreed decision of ABORT , the first node will restore its saved status . The central zone between node 0 and node i illustrates execution locked time , the black rectangle illustrates the beginning of the user-function the unfilled rectangle illustrates the returning of the user-function . Figure 14 : This is a state-graph of the implementation . AACommit is the intermediate COMMIT state , AA END is an intermediate ABORT state and AA Abort is the ABORT state . AA Commit is the start state for the algorithm . Figure 15 : The Atomic Action embraces two levels of control , local within the Atomic Action thread and global in agreement with the other Atomic Action threads . 7.1 Introduction In this text the design and the implementation of a data stabilizing software system are introduced . Such system is a fault-tolerant software component that allows validating input and output data by means of a stabilization procedure . Such data stabilizing system has been developed with the explicit goal of taking over a pre-existing stable storage hardware device used at ENEL S.p.A. – the main Italian electricity supplier , the third largest world-wide – - within a program for substation automation of their high voltage sub-stations . The mentioned hardware device is able to tolerate the typical faults of a highly disturbed environment subject to electro-magnetic interference : transient faults affecting memory modules and the processing devices , often resulting in bit flips or even in system crashes . This hardware component was mainly used within control applications with a cyclic behavior only dependent on their state ( that is , Moore automata ) . Typically these applications : • Read their current state from stable storage , • produce with it an output that , once validated , is propagated to the field , • then they read their input from the field and compute a tentative future state and future output . The whole cycle is repeated a number of times in order to validate the future state . When this temporal redundancy scheme succeeds , the tentative state is declared as a valid next state and the stable storage is updated accordingly . The cyclic execution is paced by an external periodic signal which resets the CPU and re-fetches the application code from an EPROM . External memory is not affected by this step . This policy and the nature of faults ( frequency , duration and so forth ) allow confining possible impairment affecting the internal state of the application within one cycle . Developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN , a prototypic version of this data stabilizing tool has been successfully integrated in a test-bed control application at ENEL , whose cyclic behavior is regulated by a periodic restart device – the only custom , dedicated component of that architecture . Initially developed on a Parsytec CC system equipped with 4 processing nodes , the tool has been then ported to a number of runtime systems ; at ENEL , the tool is currently running under the TEX nanokernel ( DEC , 1997 ; TXT , 1997 ) and VxWorks on several hardware boards , each based on the DEC Alpha processor . Preliminary results on these systems show that the tool is capable to fulfill its dependability and data integrity requirements , adapting itself to a number of different simulated disturbed environments thanks to its flexibility . In what follows an analysis of the requirements to the Data Stabilizing System tool is carried out . Basic functionalities of the tool are then summarized . The two "" basic blocks "" of our tool , namely a manager of redundant memories and a data stabilizer , are then introduced . Finally some conclusions are drawn , summarizing the lessons learned while developing our Data Stabilizing Software Tool . 7.2 Requirements for the Data Stabilizer In an electrical power network , automation is a fundamental requirement for the subsystems concerning production , transport and distribution of energy . In many sites of such a network , remotely controlled automation systems play an important role towards reaching a more efficient and cost-effective management of the networks . While considering the option to install high performance computing nodes as controllers into such environments , the question of a software solution for a data stabilizer arose . The goal of a data stabilizer is to protect data in memory from permanent faults affecting memory devices and from transient faults affecting data of systems running in disturbed environments , as they typically arise by electro-magnetic interference , and to validate these data by means of a stabilization procedure based on the joint exploitation of temporal and spatial redundancy . When controlling high voltage , an important source of faults is electricity itself – because all switching actions in the field cause electrical disturbances , which enter the control computers via their I / O devices , often overcoming the filtering barriers . Furthermore , electro-magnetic interference causes disturbs in the controllers . Clearly , due to the very nature of this class of environments , such faults can not be avoided ; on the other hand , they should not impair the expected behavior of the computing systems that control the automation system . In order to overcome the effects of transient faults , temporal redundancy is employed . This means that all computation is repeated several times ( a concept also known as "" redoing "" and introduced in Chapter 5 ) , assuming that due to the nature ( frequency , amplitude , and duration ) of the disturbances , not all of the cyclic replications are affected . As in other redundancy schemes , a final decision is taken via a voting between the different redundant results . Clearly this calls for a memory component that be more resilient to transient faults with respect to conventional memory devices . In traditional applications often a special hardware device , called stable storage device , is used for this . The idea was to replace this special hardware with a software solution , which offers on the one hand more flexibility , while on the other hand it provides the same fault tolerance functionality . The following requirements were deduced from this : 1 . The data stabilizer has to be implemented in conventional memory available on the hardware platform running the control application . Typical control applications show a cyclic behavior , which is represented in the following steps : ( a ) Read sensor data , ( b ) calculate control laws based on new sensor data and status variables , ( c ) update status variables , ( d ) and output actuator data . The data stabilizer has to interface with such kind of applications . 2 . The Data Stabilizing System has to tolerate any transient faults affecting the elaboration or the inputs . Furthermore , it has to tolerate permanent and transient faults affecting the memory itself . 3 . The Data Stabilizing System has to store and to stabilize status data , i.e. if input data to the Data Stabilizing System have been confirmed a number of times , they should be considered as stable . 4 . Because of this stabilization the Data Stabilizing System has to provide a high data integrity , i.e. only correct output should be released . A few further requirements were added , namely : 1 . The Data Stabilizing System has to minimize the number of custom , dedicated , hardware components in the system : In particular , the system has to work with conventional memory chips . 2 . The system has to make use of the inherently available redundancy of a parallel or distributed system . 3 . Its design goal must include maximizing flexibility and re-usability , so as to favor the adoption of the system in a wide application field , which , in the case of ENEL , ranges from energy production and transport to energy distribution . 4 . The Data Stabilizing System has to eliminate the use of mechanisms possibly affecting the deterministic behavior , for instance by not using dynamic memory allocation during the critical phases of real-time applications . 5 . A major focus of the system is on service portability ( see Chapter 2 ) in order to have minimal dependencies with specific hardware platforms or specific operating systems . 6 . The system has to be scalable , at least from 1 to 8 processors . In the following the functionality of the Data Stabilizing System is deduced from the requirements stated in the last paragraph . First one needs to clarify the concept of data stabilization . Let us assume one wants to develop a controller with a short cycle time with respect to the dynamics of the input and the output data . Disturbances from temporal faults can influence either the input or the output data . These temporal effects , in particular on the output data , must be eliminated . For this reason , the controller is run several times with the same input data . Let us furthermore assume that , in the absence of faults , the same output data are produced . This allows the output of the controller from several runs to be compared . If the output does not change in a number of consecutive cycles , the output is staid to be stable . The described process of repeated runs of the controller and comparison of the results is called stabilization . The described procedure of cyclic repetition of a process is the basis of temporal redundancy ( that is , redoing ) . In order to detect and overcome transient faults , even if their characteristics such as distribution of frequency and duration are not known , temporal redundancy can be applied . If the computation time for a process is outspoken longer than the expected duration of a transient fault , and the frequency of the disturbances is low enough , it is assumed that in several repetitive computations of the same data only one fault may show up . So if the algorithm performs the same computation several times , there will be a period of some consecutive , not impaired results . The number Ntime of consecutive equal data inputs to the Data Stabilizing System is the level of temporal redundancy . It is the minimum number of cycles the Data Stabilizing System has to execute until a new input can be assumed to be stable . Another strong requirement of our design is that of maximizing data integrity . To reach this goal , the Data Stabilizing System tool adopts a strategy , to be described later on , aiming at ensuring that data are only allowed to be stored in the Data Stabilizing System the moment they have been certified as being "" stable "" . On a read request from a given memory location , the Data Stabilizing System will then return the last stabilized data , while a write into Data Stabilizing System will actually take place only when the strategy guarantees that data that are going to be written are stable . Another important requirement is that permanent faults affecting the system should not destroy the data . A standard method for increasing the reliability of memory is replication of data in redundant memories : a "" write "" is then translated into writing into each of a set of redundant memories , with voting of the data when reading out . An approach like the one described in Chapter 4 , that is , redundant variables , was not available yet and therefore it was not used in this case . No additional hardware is required for this , as the writings are done in the memories of the processing nodes of the target , distributed memory platform . Using the principles of spatial redundancy , the same data are replicated in different memory areas – let us call them banks . The spatial redundancy factor Nspat is the number of replicas stored in the Data Stabilizing System . Changing this parameter the user is allowed to trade off dependability with performance and resource consumption . In order to fulfill the above mentioned requirements the Data Stabilizing System implements a strategy based on two buffers , one for reading the last stabilized data , and the other for receiving the new data . These two buffers are called the memory banks . • The bank used for the output of the stabilized data is called the current bank . • The other bank , called future bank , receives the Ntime input data for the Data Stabilizing System one after the other and checks whether the results are stable . If the results are stable the role of the banks is switched , so that the future bank becomes the new current bank and the output data are fetched from there . During the design and implementation phases of the Data Stabilizing System tool , the idea arose to isolate the spatial redundancy from the tool to build a custom tool especially devoted to the distributed memory approach – the Distributed Memory Tool . It showed that this approach simplifies the design and the implementation of the Data Stabilizing System tool . 7.2.1 The Distributed Memory Tool The Distributed Memory Tool is the sub-system responsible for the management of the spatial redundancy scheme for the Data Stabilizing System . Let us call a local user context either a thread or a process , which the user application sees as one task with its own local environment . Assume that the user application consists of several such local user contexts , which are distributed among several nodes of a multiprocessor system . The basic component of the distributed memory tool is the local handler , which is defined as follows : A local memory handler is a local software module connected to one local user context and to a set of fully interconnected fellows . The attribute "" local "" means that both user context and memory handler run on the same processing node and they represent the whole tool from the viewpoint of the processing node . As a consequence of this definition , the local user context regards the local memory handler as the only interface to the distributed memory tool . The local memory handler and the attached user module are connected via an IPC mechanism based on shared memory , referred to in the following as a "" local link "" and borrowed from the EPX terminology5 . Commands to the distributed memory or messages from the memory will only flow between local user context and local memory handler . The tasks of the local memory handler are completely transparent to the user module . The same design concepts used for the EFTOS Voting Farm and described in Sect . 3 have been used here . Figure 16 : The local memory handler with its memory banks . The associated partitions are represented in a hatched way . 7.2.2 The Local Memory Handler and Its Tasks As mentioned in the previous section , the local memory handler ( see Fig. 16 ) is responsible for the management of two banks of memory , i.e. , the current bank , that is , the bank where all read access take place , and the future bank , which is the bank for all writing actions . Each bank is cut into Nspat partitions , where each handler is responsible for exactly one partition . This partition can be seen as the part of the redundant memory attached to the local user context , which is assigned to the local handler . This partition is referred to as the one associated to the user module . If a user module ( i.e. a local user context ) initiates to write data into its partition , this is done via a command to the local memory handler , which is sent via the connecting local link . The local handler then stores the data into the associated partition , and distributes them to the other local memory handlers residing on the other nodes . With this method the data are distributed as soon as they are received from the application . For reading from the local memory handler there are several concurrent commands available . The common way is to request voted data from the local memory handler . In this case , one local handler receives a request for voted data from the attached user module . It then informs all other handlers and requests a voting service to vote among the replicas of the partition associated to the requesting user module . The result of the voting is provided to the calling user module as result of the read action . The kind of voting is user definable among those treated in ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) . If a voting task fails , a time-out system allows regarding such an event as the delivery of a dummy vote . If the user application has a cyclic behavior , such that the user modules on the different nodes all execute the same cycle , and under the hypothesis of each node serving exclusively the same set of tasks , then under the hypothesis Figure 17 : Structure of the Distributed Memory Tool . The associated partitions are represented hatched . State 1 2 3 4 Flag A 0 0 1 1 Flag B 0 1 0 1 Current A B B A Future B A A B Table 5 : Coding of the current and future bank flags of a synchronous system model it is possible to assume that the requests for reading may be processed more or less simultaneously on all nodes . In this case , this information can be used to synchronize the nodes via the set of local memory handlers and some data transfer between the nodes can be run in an optimized way . Clearly the Distributed Memory Tool is not aware of the logics pertaining to the stabilization mechanism , hence it is a task of the user application to inform the local memory handler about when to switch the banks ( in the next section it is shown how the temporal redundancy tasks take care of this ) . Normally this can be done once per cycle . The switching can also be connected with a checking phase , testing whether the current banks are equal on all nodes by means of an equality voting . Clearly , both determining the role of each bank and switching these roles are crucial points for the whole strategy . In particular , these actions need to be atomic . A fast and effective way to reach this property is the use of two binary flags – one per bank – whose contents concurrently determines the roles of the banks . These flags have been protected by storing them in the bank themselves . Table 5 shows how the coding of the flags in both banks is done . The idea is that , for changing from one state to another , just one write action is needed in the future bank . The current bank can therefore be regarded as being a readonly memory bank . As an example if the actual state is state 2 , and one wants to switch the banks , then it suffices to change the flag in the future bank , which is bank A. Changing Flag A from 0 to 1 brings the system to state 4 . 7.2.3 Application-program Interface and Client side Using function calls the user module is able to initialize the tool , to setup the net of local handlers , and to activate the tool . This process is done in several steps : 1 . Each instance of a DMT is built up by declaring a pointer to a corresponding data structure : dmt_t * dmt ; This data structure is the place to hold all information for one instance of the Distributed Memory Tool on each node . So each user module that wants to use the Distributed Memory Tool needs to declare a variable of this type . Figure 18 : Structure of the Data Stabilizing System Tool . 2 . In the next step , the Distributed Memory Tool is defined and described . This creates a static map which holds all necessary information to drive the tool on each node . The following code fragment : dmt = DMT_open ( id , VotingAlgorithm ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < NumHandlers ; i ++ ) DMT_add ( dmt , i , PartitionSize , ( i == MyNodeId )) ; when executed on every node where the Distributed Memory Tool is intended to run , sets up a local memory handler to be used by the tool . The voting algorithm can be selected by the user via a kind of call-back function . 3 . After the definition and description of the Distributed Memory Tool , the latter has to be started to set up data structures and threads . This activation is done via function int DMT_run ( dmt_t * dmt ) ; This function simply spawns the local memory handler thread after having checked the consistency of the structures defined in the description phase . All allocation of memory is done in the handler itself . 7.3 The Data Stabilizing System Tool As already mentioned , the Data Stabilizing System tool builds on top of the Distributed Memory Tool . The latter is used for the management of the spatial redundancy ( see Fig. 18 ) , while the Data Stabilizing System takes care of the management of the temporal redundancy strategy . On each node the writing requests to the Data Stabilizing System are done into a temporal redundancy buffer , which holds a user definable number Ntime of copies of the last inputs . As the temporal buffers are only handled locally , this fits well to the concept of local memory handler . The Data Stabilizing System module performs a voting on the contents of the temporal buffers and , if this voting is successful , the result is fed into the Distributed Memory Tool . The Data Stabilizing System handles all accesses as well as the temporal voting transparently of the local user context . 7.3.1 Algorithms The Data Stabilizing System Module as a whole gives each local user context a combination of temporal and spatial redundant memory buffers , which are able to keep the local state variables . The set of all local user contexts that store data in an instance of a Data Stabilizing System is called the context family associated to that tool . The Data Stabilizing System completely hides the memory handling and the handling of the Distributed Memory Tool , so that the user only needs to write to and read from the memory – all other handling is done transparently . This guarantees an acceptable separation of design concerns ( sc ) , which could be further improved by using some translator as in Chapter 4 . The following steps are executed automatically : 1 . The new data is written into the temporal buffer . 2 . Using internal flag values the current and the future banks are determined . This is done within the Distributed Memory Tool , therefore only the flag values of the spatial redundancy buffers are used . 3 . A voting on the temporal buffer takes place . If the temporal buffer is stabilized , i.e. the voting is positive , the content of the temporal buffer is stored into the spatial redundancy buffers , i.e. the respective calls to the DMT are done . 4 . If the evaluation of the internal flags allows it , the Distributed Memory Tool switches the memory banks . 5 . A voting is applied to evaluate the output of the current bank in the distributed memory . Such output is returned to the calling local user context . 7.3.2 Application-Program Interface The Data Stabilizing System is identified via a control block structure . It must be seen in connection with the Distributed Memory Tool – in fact it is a kind of front end to that tool , which provides additional functionality . The steps to be performed to set up the Data Stabilizing System are similar to those elaborated for the Distributed Memory Tool : 1 . Each instance of a Data Stabilizing System Tool is built up by declaring a pointer to a corresponding data structure : smCB_t * sm ; Each local user context that is member of the associated context family needs to declare a pointer to a variable of type smCB t . Similarly to the Distributed Memory Tool , the Data Stabilizing System Tool has to be defined and described . With the SM open statement a local instance of the system is created . In addition to the parameters of the DMT open statement some parameters regarding the temporal redundancy are passed to this statement . sm = SM_open ( id , N_time , TemporalVotingAlgorithm , SpatialVotingAlgorithm ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N_spat ; i ++ ) SM_add ( sm , i , PartitionSize , ( i == MyNodeId )) ; The above code sets up an instance of the Data Stabilizing System tool , provided it is called in every local user context that needs to take part in the processing of the tool . 2 . Up to this point the Data Stabilizing System Tool is defined and described , that is its structure is set up , but no instance has been installed , no memory has been allocated and no handler for the spatial redundant memory has been started yet . To do this the tool must be activated . This is done via the function SM run . This function allocates the temporal redundancy buffers , initializes the variables , and activates the attached Distributed Memory Tool using the function DMT run . The Data Stabilizing System can only be started up if all local user contexts belonging to its context family call SM run at the same point in their start-up phase . At run-time , the Data Stabilizing System Tool is controlled via two functions , which read the data from the application or provide stabilized and voted data to the application : int SM_write ( smCB_t * MyCB , void * SM_in ) ; int SM_read ( smCB_t * MyCB , void * SM_out ) ; The user provides data to the Data Stabilizing System via function SM write , which is then responsible for the handling of these values . This function is used to input the local data of a local user context to the Data Stabilizing System . The parameters submitted to the function describe the Data Stabilizing System control block structure ( MyCB ) and the address of the data to be copied into the Data Stabilizing System ( SM in ) . When the function is returned , all data provided to the function using the SM in pointer are copied out of this memory location into the temporary buffer of the Data Stabilizing System . The SM read function writes the local data of the calling local user context back to the address submitted through the pointer SM out . The Data Stabilizing System control block structure MyCB is used to identify the Data Stabilizing System . Switching from the current to the future bank is achieved by means of the following procedure : • Determine the current meaning of the banks from their internal flags . • Write data into the specified partition ( s ) of the future bank of the memory . • Output data via a voting between the distributed copies of the current bank . • If the contents of the future banks of all nodes are equal , switch the role of the memory banks . 7.3.3 System and Fault Models As already mentioned , the embedded and hard real-time character of the application makes it reasonable to assume a synchronous system model . The overall strategy implemented in the Data Stabilizing System allows to mask a number of transient faults resulting in : • An erroneous input value . • Errors affecting the circular buffer . • Errors affecting the temporal redundancy modules . • Errors affecting the flag values , occurring during the execution cycle , or caused by an external disturbance , or a wrong flag value , and so forth . These are tolerated either through the voting sessions ( temporal redundancy ) or are masked via the periodic restarts which invalidate the current cycle . In this latter case this is therefore perceived as a delay of the stabilized output . The same applies when a fault affects the phase of determining the current bank , or faults occurring during the voting among temporal redundancy modules , or faults affecting the spatial redundancy modules . More details on this can be found in [ 4 ] . Tolerance of permanent faults resulting in node crashes is achieved by using the Data Stabilizing System as a dependable mechanism compliant to the recovery language approach described in Chapter 6 . As explained in that chapter , this approach exploits a high level distributed application ( the TIRAN backbone ) and a library of error detection tools in order to detect events such as node and task crashes . User defined error recovery actions can then be attached to the error detection events so as to trigger corrective actions such as a reconfiguration of the Data Stabilizing System tasks . 7.4 Conclusion In the text above a software system implementing a data stabilizing tool has been described . Such tool is to be placed in highly disturbed environments such as those typical of sub-station automation . Due to its design , based on a combination of spatial and temporal redundancy and on a cyclic restart policy , the tool proved to be capable of tolerating transient and permanent faults and to guarantee data stabilization . Initially developed on a Parsytec CC system , the tool has been then ported to several runtime systems . The most important lessons learned while developing this tool are those that brought the author of this book to the concept of service portability introduced in Chapter 2 : A software code such as the one of the system described so far can be ported to a different environment with a moderated effort ; but porting the service is indeed something else . In this case , a thorough evaluation of the new working environment is due in order to come up with proper new values for parameters such as Ntime and Nspat . A system like the Data Stabilizing tool puts this requirement in the foreground and makes it possible to perform an off-line adaptability of its service . As a consequence a is assessed as "" moderate "" . Augmenting the approach towards acceptable degrees of a would call for the adoption of a strategy such as the one used in redundant variables ( see Chapter 4 ) . As a final remark , its single-purpose design intrinsically translates in bad sa . 8 An Approach to Express Recovery Blocks : The Recovery Meta-Program The Recovery Meta-Program ( RMP ) ( Ancona , Dodero , Giannuzzi , Clematis , & Fernandez , 1990 ) is a mechanism that alternates the execution of two cooperating processing contexts . The concept behind its architecture can be captured by means of the idea of a debugger , or a monitor , which : • is scheduled when the application is stopped at some breakpoints , • executes some sort of a program , written in a specific language , Figure 19 : Control flow between the application program and RMP while executing a fault-tolerance strategy based on recovery blocks . • and finally returns the control to the application context , until the next breakpoint is encountered . Breakpoints outline portions of code relevant to specific fault-tolerance strategies – for instance , breakpoints can be used to specify alternate blocks or acceptance tests of recovery blocks ( see Sect . 2.3 ) – while programs are implementations of those strategies , e.g. , of recovery blocks or N - version programming . The main benefit of RMP is in the fact that , while breakpoints require a ( minimal ) intervention of the functional-concerned programmer , RMP scripts can be designed and implemented without the intervention and even the awareness of the developer . In other words , RMP guarantees a good separation of design concerns . As an example , recovery blocks are implemented , from the point of view of the functionally concerned designer , specifying alternates and acceptance tests , while the execution goes like in Fig. 19 : • When the system encounters a breakpoint corresponding to the entrance of a recovery block , control flows to the RMP , which saves the application program environment and starts the first alternate . • The execution of the first alternate goes on until its end , marked by another breakpoint . The latter returns the control to RMP , this time in order to execute the acceptance test . • Should the test succeed , the recovery block is exited , otherwise control goes to the second alternate , and so forth . In RMP , the language to express the meta-programs is Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes language ( Hoare , 1978 ) ( CSP ) . Conclusions . In the RMP approach , all the technicalities related to the management of the fault-tolerance provisions are coded in a separate programming context . Even the language to code the provisions may be different from the one used to express the functional aspects of the application . One can conclude that RMP is characterised by optimal sc . The design choice of using CSP to code the meta-programs influences negatively attribute sa . Choosing a pre-existent formalism clearly presents many practical advantages , though it means adopting a fixed , immutable syntactical structure to express the fault-tolerance strategies . The choice of a pre-existing general-purpose distributed programming language as CSP is therefore questionable , as it appears to be rather difficult or at least cumbersome to use it to express at least some of the fault-tolerance provisions . For instance , RMP proves to be an effective linguistic structure to express strategies such as recovery blocks and N - version programming ( Yeung & Schneider , 2003 ) , where the main components are coarse grain processes to be arranged into complex fault-tolerance structures . Because of the choice of a pre-existing language like CSP , RMP appears not to be the best choice for representing provisions such as , e.g. , atomic actions ( Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) . This translates in very limited sa . No a was foreseen among the design choices of RMP . Our conjecture is that the coexistence of two separate layers for the functional and the non-functional aspects could have been better exploited to reach the best of the two approaches : Using a widespread programming language such as Java for expressing the functional aspect , while devising a custom language for dealing with non-functional requirements , e.g. , a language especially designed to express error recovery strategies . This design choice has been taken in the approach described in Chapter 6 , the recovery language approach . 9 A Hybrid Case : The RAFTNET Library for Dependable Farmer-Worker Parallel Applications RAFTNET is a tool to compose dependable parallel applications obeying the farmer-worker data parallel paradigm . It is described here as a hybrid example of a system that appears to its users as a library , hence a single-version software fault-tolerance provision , though at run-time manages a potentially large degree of redundant components – a typical characteristics of multiple-version software fault-tolerance . 9.1 Introducing RAFTNET The RAFTNET Library is another example of a library to build fault-tolerant services . The main difference between RAFTNET and a system such as the Voting Farm is that it does not provide the application programmer with a dependable mechanism ( in this case , distributed voting ) , but rather it provides a dependable structure for a class of target applications . In more detail , RAFTNET is a library for data parallel , farmer-worker applications : Any such applications using RAFTNET makes uses of the available redundancy not only to reach higher performance but also to tolerate certain faults and disruptions that would normally jeopardize its progress . In the following the structure of RAFTNET , its models , properties , and features are described . 9.2 Why Dependable Parallel Applications ? Parallel computing is nowadays the only technique that can be used in order to achieve the impressive computing power needed to solve a number of challenging problems ; as such , it is being employed by an ever growing community of users in spite of what are known as two main disadvantages , namely : 1 . harder-to-use programming models , programming techniques and development tools – if any , – which sometimes translate into programs that do n't match as efficiently as expected with the underlying parallel hardware , and 2 . the inherently lower level of dependability that characterizes any such parallel hardware i.e. , a higher probability for events like a node's permanent or temporary failure . A real , effective exploitation of any given parallel computer asks for solutions which take into a deep account the above outlined problems . Let us consider for example the synchronous farmer-worker algorithm i.e. , a well-known model for structuring data-parallel applications : a master process , namely the farmer , feeds a pool of slave processes , called workers , with some units of work ; then polls them until they return their partial results which are eventually recollected and saved . Though quite simple , this scheme may give good results , especially in homogeneous , dedicated environments . But how does this model react to events like a failure of a worker , or more simply to a worker's performance degradation due e.g. , to the exhaustion of any vital resource ? Without substantial modifications , this scheme is not able to cope with these events – they would seriously affect the whole application or its overall performances , regardless the high degree of hardware redundancy implicitly available in any parallel system . The same inflexibility prevents a failed worker to re-enter the computing farm once it has regained the proper operational state . As opposed to this synchronous structuring , it is possible for example to implement the farmer-worker model by de-coupling the farmer from the workers by means of an intermediate module , a dispatcher which asynchronously feeds these latter and supplies them with new units of work on an on-demand basis . This strategy guarantees some sort of a dynamic balancing of the workload even in heterogeneous , distributed environments , thus exhibiting a higher matching to the parallel hardware . The Live Data Structure computational paradigm , known from the LINDA context , makes this particularly easy to set up ( see for example ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989a , 1989b ; De Florio , Murgolo , & Spinelli , 1994 )) . With this approach it is also possible to add a new worker at run-time without any notification to both the farmer and the intermediate module – the newcomer will simply generate additional , non-distinguishable requests for work . But again , if a worker fails or its performances degrade , the whole application may fail or its overall outcome be affected or seriously delayed . This is particularly important when one considers the inherent loss in dependability of any parallel ( i.e. , replicated ) hardware . Next sections introduce and discuss a modification to the above sketched asynchronous scheme , which inherits the advantages of its parent and offers new ones , namely : • it allows a non-solitary , temporarily slowed down worker to be left out of the processing farm as long as its performance degradation exists , and • it allows a non-solitary worker which has been permanently affected by some fault to be definitively removed from the farm , both of them without affecting the overall outcome of the computation , and dynamically spreading the workload among the active processors in a way that results in an excellent match to various different MIMD architectures . 9.3 The Technique For the purpose of describing the technique the following scenario is described : a MIMD machine consists of n + 2 identical "" nodes "" ( n > 0 ) , or processing entities , connected by some communication line . On each node a number of independent sequential processes are executed on a time-sharing basis . A message passing library is available for sending and receiving messages across the communication line . A synchronous communication approach is used : a sender blocks until the intended receiver gets the message . A receiver blocks waiting for a message from a specific sender , or for a message from a number of senders . When a message arrives , the receiver is awaken and is able to receive that message and to know the identity of the sender . Nodes are numbered from 0 to n + 1 . Node 0 is connected to an input line and node n + 1 is connected to an output line . • Node 0 runs : – a Farmer process , connected by the input line to an external producer device . From now on a camera is assumed to be the producer device . A control line wires again the Farmer to the camera , so that this latter can be commanded to produce new data and eventually send this data across the input line ; – a Dispatcher process , yet to be described . Figure 20 : Summary of the interactions among the processes . • Node n + 1 runs a Collector process , to be described later on , connected by the output line to an external storage device e.g. , a disk ; • Each of the nodes from 1 to n is purely devoted to the execution of one instance of the Worker process . Each Worker is connected to the Dispatcher and to the Collector processes . 9.4 Interactions Between the Farmer and the Dispatcher On demand of the Farmer process , the camera sends it an input image . Once it has received an image , the Farmer performs a predefined , static data decomposition , creating m equally sized sub-images , or blocks . Blocks are numbered from 1 to m , and are represented by variables bi , 0 < i < m + 1 . The Farmer process interacts exclusively with the camera and with the Dispatcher process . • Three classes of messages can be sent from the Farmer process to the Dispatcher ( see Fig. 20 ) : 1 . a NEW RUN message , which means : "" a new bunch of data is available "" ; 2 . a STOP message , which means that no more input is available so the whole process has to be terminated ; 3 . a couple ( k , bk ) , k in { 1 , ... m } i.e. , an integer which identifies a particular block ( it will be referred from now on as a "" block-id "" ) , followed by the block itself . • The only type of message that the Dispatcher process sends to the Farmer process is a block-id i.e. , a single integer in the range { 1 , ... , m } which expresses the information that a certain block has been fully processed by a Worker and recollected by the Collector ( see Sect . 9.4.2 . ) At the other end of the communication line , the Dispatcher is ready to process a number of events triggered by message arrivals . For example , when a class-3 message is received , the block is stored into a work buffer as follows : receive ( k , bk ) sk = DISABLED wk = bk ( Here , receive is the function for receiving an incoming message , ~ s is a vector of m integers pre-initialized to DISABLED , which represents some status information that will be described later on , and w ~ is a vector of "" work buffers "" , i.e. , bunches of memory able to store any block . DISABLED is an integer which is not in the set { 1 , ... , m } . ) As the Farmer process sends a class-1 message , that is , a NEW RUN signal , the Dispatcher processes that event as follows : ~ s = 0 broadcast RESUME that is , it zeroes each element of ~ s and then broadcasts the RESUME message to the whole farm . When the first image arrives to the Farmer process , it produces a series ( bi ) 0 < i < m + 1 , and then a sequence of messages ( i , bi ) 0 < i < m + 1 . Finally , the Farmer sends a NEW RUN message . Starting from the second image , and while there are images to process from the camera , the Farmer performs the image decomposition in advance , thus creating a complete set of ( k , bk ) couples . These couples are then sent to the Dispatcher on an on-demand basis : as soon as block-id i is received , couple ( i , bi ) is sent out . This is done for anticipating the transmission of the couples belonging to the next run of the computation . When eventually the last block-id of a certain run has been received , a complete set of "" brand-new "" blocks is already in the hands of the Dispatcher ; at that point , sending the one NEW RUN message will simultaneously enable all blocks . 9.4.1 Interactions Between the Dispatcher and the Workers The Dispatcher interacts with every instance of the Worker process . • Four classes of messages can be sent from the Dispatcher to the Workers ( see Fig. 20 ) : 1 . a SLEEP message , which sets the receiver into a wait condition ; 2 . a RESUME message , to get the receiver out of the waiting state ; 3 . a STOP message , which makes the Worker terminate ; 4 . a ( k , w ) couple , where w represents the input data to be elaborated . • Worker j , 0 < j < n + 1 , interacts with the Dispatcher by sending it its worker-id message , i.e. , the j integer . This happens when Worker j has finished dealing with a previously sent w working buffer and is available for a new ( k , w ) couple to work with . In substance , Worker j continuously repeats the following loop : send j to Dispatcher receive message from Dispatcher process message Clearly , send transmits a message . The last instruction , in dependence with the class of the incoming message , results in a number of different operations : • if the message is a SLEEP , the Worker waits until the arrival of a RESUME message , which makes it resume the loop , or the arrival of any other message , which means that an error has occurred ; • if it is a STOP message , the Worker breaks the loop and exits the farm ; • if it is a ( k , w ) couple , the Worker starts computing the value f ( w ) , where f is some user-defined function e.g. , an edge detector . If a RESUME event is raised during the computation of f , that computation is immediately abandoned and the Worker restarts the loop . Contrariwise , the output couple ( k , f ( w )) is sent to the Collector process . When the Dispatcher gets a j integer from Worker j , its expected response is a new ( k , w ) couple , or a SLEEP . What rules in this context is the ~ s vector – if all entries of ~ s are DISABLED , then a SLEEP message is sent to Worker j . Otherwise , an entry is selected among those with the minimum non-negative value , say entry l , and a ( l , bl ) message is then sent as a response . Then sl is incremented by 1 . More formally , considered set S = { s in ~ s | s ¬ = DISABLED } , if S is non-empty it is possible to partition S according to the equivalence relation R defined as follows : For all ( a , b ) in S × S : aR b if and only if sa = sb . So the blocks of the partition are the equivalence classes : def [ x ] = { s in S | Exists y in { 1 ... m } such that ( s = sy ) and ( sy = x ) } . Now , first let us consider a = min { b | Exists b > = 0 such that [ b ] in S / R } ; then l is chosen in [ a ] in some way , e.g. pseudo-randomly ; finally , message ( l , bl ) is sent to Worker j , sl is incremented , and the partition is reconfigured accordingly . If S is the empty set , a SLEEP message is generated . In other words , entry si when greater than or equal to 0 represents some sort of a priority identifier ( the lower the value , the higher the priority for block bi ) . The block to be sent to a requesting Worker process is always selected among those with the highest priority ; after the selection , si is updated incrementing its value by 1 . In this way , the content of si represents the degree of "" freshness "" of block bi : it substantially counts the number of times it has been picked up by a Worker process ; fresher blocks are always preferred . As long as there are "" brand-new "" blocks i.e. , blocks with a freshness attribute of 0 , these are the blocks which are selected and distributed . Note that this means that as long as the above condition is true , each Worker deals with a different unit of work ; on the contrary , as soon as the last brand-new block is distributed , the model admits that a same block may be assigned to more than one Worker . This is tolerated up to a certain threshold value ; if any si becomes greater than that value , an alarm event is raised – too many workers are dealing with the same input data , which might mean that they are all affected by the same problem e.g. , a software bug resulting in an error when bi is being processed . This special case shall not be considered . Another possibility is that two or more Workers had finished their work almost at the same time thus bringing rapidly a flag to the threshold . Waiting for the processing time of one block may supply the answer . A value of DISABLED for any si means that its corresponding block is not available to be computed . It is simply not considered during the selection procedure . 9.4.2 Interactions Between the Workers and the Collector Any Worker may send one class of messages to the Collector ; no message is sent from this latter to any Worker ( see Fig. 20 ) . The only allowed message is the couple ( k , o ) in which o is the fully processed output of the Worker's activity on the k th block . The Collector's task is to fill a number of "" slots "" , namely pi , i = 1 , ... , m , with the outputs coming from the Workers . As two or more Workers are allowed to process a same block thus producing two or more ( k , o ) couples , the Collector runs a vector of status bits which records the status of each slot : if fi is FREE then pi is "" empty "" i.e. , it has never been filled in by any output before ; if it is BUSY , it already holds an output . f ~ is firstly initialized to FREE . For each incoming message from the Worker , the Collector repeats the following sequence of operations : receive ( k , o ) from Worker if fk is equal to FREE then send k to Dispatcher pk = o fk = BUSY check-if-full else detect endif where : check-if-full checks if , due to the last arrival , all entries of f ~ have become BUSY . In that case , a complete set of partial outputs has been recollected and , after some user-defined post-processing ( for example , a polygonal approximation of the chains of edges produced by the Workers ) , a global output can be saved , and the flag vector re-initialized : if f ~ is equal to BUSY then post-process p ~ save p ~ f ~ = FREE endif detect is a user-defined functionality – he or she may choose to compare the two o 's so to be able to detect any inconsistency and start some recovery action , or may simply ignore the whole message . Note also that an acknowledgment message ( the block-id ) is sent from the Collector to the Dispatcher , to inform it that an output slot has been occupied i.e. , a partial output has been gathered . This also means that the Farmer can anticipate the transmission of a block which belongs to the next run , if any . 9.4.3 Interactions Between the Collector and the Dispatcher As just stated , upon acceptance of an output , the collector sends a block-id , say integer k , to the Dispatcher – it is the only message that goes from the Collector to the Dispatcher . The Dispatcher then simply acts as follows : sk = DISABLED send k to Farmer that is , the Dispatcher "" disables "" the k th unit of work – set S as defined in Sect . 9.4.1 is reduced by one element and consequently partition S / R changes its shape ; then the block-id is propagated to the Farmer ( see Fig. 20 ) . On the opposite direction , there is only one message that may travel from the Dispatcher to the Collector : the STOP message that means that no more input is available and so processing is over . Upon reception of this message , the Collector stops itself , like it does any other receiver in the farm . 9.5 Discussion The just proposed technique uses asynchronicity in order to efficiently match to a huge class of parallel architectures . It also uses the redundancy which is inherent to parallelism to make an application able to cope with events like e.g. , a failure of a node , or a node being slowed down , temporarily or not . • If a node fails while it is processing block k , then no output block will be transferred to the Collector . When no more "" brand-new "" blocks are available , block k will be assigned to one or more Worker processes , up to a certain limit . During this phase the replicated processing modules of the parallel machine may be thought of as part of a hardware redundancy fault tolerant mechanism . This phase is over when any Worker module delivers its output to the Collector and consequently all others are possibly explicitly forced to resume their processing loop or , if too late , their output is discarded . • If a node has been for some reason drastically slowed down , then its block will be probably assigned to other possibly non-slowed Workers . Again , the first who succeeds , its output is collected ; the others are stopped or ignored . In any case , from the point of view of the Farmer process , all these events are completely masked . The mechanism may be provided to a user in the form of some set of basic functions , making all technicalities concerning both parallel programming and fault tolerance transparent to the programmer . Of course , nothing prevents the concurrent use of other fault tolerance mechanisms in any of the involved processes e.g. , using Watchdog timers to understand that a Worker has failed and consequently reset the proper entry of vector f ~ . The ability to re-enter the farm may also be exploited committing a reboot of a failed node and restarting the Worker process on that node . 9.5.1 Reliability Analysis In order to compare the original , synchronous farmer-worker model with the one described in this paper , a first step is given by observing that the synchronous model depicts a series system ( Johnson , 1989 ) i.e. , a system in which each element is required not to have failed for the whole system to operate . This is not the case of the model described in this paper , in which a subset of the elements , namely the Worker farm , is a parallel system ( Johnson , 1989 ) : if at least one Worker has not failed , so it is for the whole farm subsystem . Note how Fig. 20 may be also thought of as the reliability block diagram of this system . Considering the sole farm subsystem , if Ci ( t ) , 0 < i < n + 1 is the event that Worker on node i has not failed at time t , and R ( t ) is the reliability of any Worker at time t then , under the assumption of mutual independency between the events , one can conclude that : ( 1 ) being Rs ( t ) the reliability of the farm as a series system , and ( 2 ) where Rp ( t ) represents the reliability of the farm as a parallel system . Of course failures must be independent , so again data-induced errors are not considered . Figure 21 shows the reliability of the farm in a series and in a parallel system as a Worker's reliability goes from 0 to 1 . An Augmented LINDA Model . The whole idea pictured in this paper may be implemented in a LINDA tuple space manager ( see for example ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989b , 1989a )) . Apart from the standard functions to access "" common "" tuples , a new set of functions may be supplied which deal with "" book-kept tuples "" i.e. , tuples that are distributed to requestors by means of the algorithm sketched in Sect . 9.4.1 . As an example : fout ( for fault tolerant out ) may create a book-kept tuple i.e. , a content-addressable object with book-kept accesses ; frd ( fault tolerant rd ) may get a copy of a matching book-kept tuple , chosen according to the algorithm in Sect . 9.4.1 ; fin ( fault tolerant in ) may read-and-erase a matching book-kept tuple , chosen according to the algorithm in Sect . 9.4.1 , and so on . The ensuing augmented LINDA model results in an abstract , elegant , efficient , dependable , and transparent mechanism to exploit a parallel hardware . Chapter 9 describes another example of a dependable LINDA model . 9.6 Implementation Issues The RAFTNET system has been developed for network of workstations using a subset of the MPICH routines ( MPICH ( MPICH , n.d. ) is a portable implementation of the MPI message passing library ( Gropp , Lusk , & Skjellum , 1 n = 16 0.8 n = 8 n = 4 either n = 2 0.6 Rp ( t ) or Rs ( t ) n = 1 0.4 n = 2 n = 4 0.2 n = 8 n = 16 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 R ( t ) Figure 21 : For a fixed value ~ t , a number of graphs of Rp ( ~ t ) ( the reliability of the parallel system ) and Rs ( ~ t ) ( the reliability of the series system ) are portrayed as functions of R ( ~ t ) , the reliability of a Worker at time t , and n , the number of the components . Each graph is labeled with its value of n ; those above the diagonal portray reliabilities of parallel systems , while those below the diagonal pertain to series systems . Note that for n = 1 the models coincide , while for any n > 1 Rp ( ~ t ) is always above Rs ( ~ t ) except when R ( ~ t ) = 0 ( no reliable Worker ) and when R ( ~ t ) = 1 ( totally reliable , failure-free Worker ) . Figure 22 : Data structures and data structure conversions in the masterworker library . 1999 )) . The code of this system has been also ported to a "" pure "" TCP / IP environment by porting the MPICH subset ( Raftnet , n.d. ) . The implemented master-worker system acts as black box . Firstly , knowledge about the algorithm details is not required by the user application programmer . This allows a fast integration of the master-worker library in existing serial applications . Secondly , in RAFTNET data structures in the user application can take any form . They need not to be known beforehand by the master-worker algorithm . Both aspects contribute to the flexibility of the system . The resulting master-worker library can be integrated in a wide variety of programs , on the condition that a limited set of user application functions are written . Both ideas are explained in this section . The modified master-worker algorithm is implemented in the master-worker library . The application that is to be parallelized , resides in the user application library . A main process calls the master-worker library with a restricted set of arguments . Most of these arguments are pointers to functions in the user library for splitting , merging , post-processing the output data or for handling data structures . Communication between the master-worker and the user application library is solely via these functions . Writing these functions forms the main effort of the programmer for integrating the master-worker library with his / her user application library . This setup ensures that the master-worker algorithm can be used for a wide variety of programs . Furthermore , the detailed implementation of the master-worker algorithm remains a black box for the user . The concept of the user application acting as a black box for the master-worker library , is mainly a matter of handling data structures and requires a more elaborated explanation . Often , the program flow can be regarded as a series of data structure conversions . To support a variety of applications , the master-worker library keeps track of various data structures ( Fig. 22 ) . DW STRUCT , WC STRUCT and CM STRUCT denote the input blocks , the processed blocks and the post-processed output data respectively . The prefixes are the first letters of source and destination . Conversion between these structures is performed in the user functions for processing and merging . MC MERGED STRUCT is a structure containing supporting information for merging the data . Fields in data structures are sent one at a time . Details Figure 23 : Process for sending and receiving one field of a data structure . about these structures are beforehand only known by the user library . On the other hand , the master-worker library needs to know these details for sending and receiving the data . Two functions written by the user application programmer , that are passed on via the master-worker interface , serve as a communication channel between user application library and master-worker library for these structure details ( Fig. 23 . ) • The first function ( describe ) receives as input from the master-worker library , information such as the index of the structure ( which is one of the structures in Fig. 22 ) and the field index . The describe function in the user library returns information such as the number of entries in that field ( in case it is an array ) and the data type . For the receiving process , the returned information allows allocating memory for the receive buffer by the master-worker library . For the sending process , also the data itself is returned to the master-worker library , which is transmitted immediately . • After actually receiving this data , the receive process fills in the users data structure with this received field . The user function fillstruct receives via its arguments the structure and field index , the structure itself and the data . It returns the structure with the data field filled in . Via this schedule , the master-worker library does not need to be aware of the data structure details – these are returned and filled in by the user application 's describe and fillstruct functions . The user programmer is completely in control of the data structures that are used . 9.6.1 Failure semantics Due to the characteristics of the underlying algorithm , our system compensates omission / performance and state-transition failures of its workers . • Omission failures occur when an agreed reply to a request is missing . The request appears to be ignored . This is compensated by redistributing a request when its "" freshness "" allows it . • Performance failures occur when the service is supplied , though too late with respect to some real-time interval possibly agreed upon in the specifications . This class of failures can be compensated by adopting a number of workers large enough to mask , e.g. , crashing or late processing workers . • State transition failures are also covered , as the state of the system is never lost because of a failing worker : Indeed , by construction , each state transition is atomic : A block is marked as processed only when its completion is explicitly acknowledged . Half finished blocks are simply discarded . Memory Allocation Delays and Failures . A memory allocation failure can be due to either not enough available memory on that node possibly resulting from memory leaks or due to another memory-greedy program running . In the former case , memory allocation fails permanently and contribution to the system eventually ends . In the latter , the worker might be able to continue after the other program is finished or when it is in a further stage of processing . When receiving data , the receiving process can fail to allocate memory for the receive buffer . In this case , the process sleeps a certain time slice , polling for available memory regularly . In case the failure is temporary ( e.g. another memory-greedy program running on the same node ) , this will allow the process to continue its program cycle . For permanent failures , the process stops contribution after trying to allocate memory for a certain number times . Processes Sending to Failed Workers . The algorithm handles failures of workers if error codes are returned to the master-worker library . These can fail to contribute or be delayed for quite some time . However , processes that send towards these workers are not aware of these kinds of events . Therefore , such events are handled by using appropriate send operations . When using synchronous messages for sending a bunch of data , a sort of "" handshake "" is required between the sender and the receiver . When the send operation is a blocking one and the receiving process is a worker that failed meanwhile , the whole system will block . For this reason , using synchronous blocking messages for sending towards workers is avoided . In the MPI-1 standard , no explicit asynchronous send operation is available . The standard send operation can be asynchronous , but this depends typically on the MPI implementation and – in case of MPICH – also on the length of the message that is to be transmitted . Therefore , non-blocking send operations are invoked . This is combined with standard messages , in order to exploit optimizations of buffering in the MPI implementation . 9.6.2 Initialization and Finalization The master-worker library and the MPI environment are initialized and finalized with two separate calls to the master-worker library , masterworker_init and masterworker_final . The masterworker interface itself can be invoked one or more times in between . One master-worker run can e.g. use the output of a former master-worker run as input . Also , other process functions or other user functions can be used in these separate masterworker runs . All nodes can be initialized and finalized via user application functions that are passed on to the master-worker library via the masterworker interface . These functions can be used for setting up or freeing global variables in these processes once . These global variables can be used during the program flow of that node , avoiding re-initialization and re-finalization after each process cycle of that node . If such initialization is not necessary , empty functions can be used . Not all variables that are needed for processing are available at all nodes . If a set of variables is needed by the collector for merging the data , these can be transmitted in the MC_MERGED_STRUCT structure . Variables needed for processing a block , but changing according to the blockid ( k ) , should be sent to the workers via the DW_STRUCT . Variables that do not change according to the blockid , should however not be transmitted with each block . These can be initialized as global variables before calling the masterworker_init function . All processes will possess these variables in this case . 9.6.3 Speeding up Possible time-consuming operations , such as saving results , splitting input units or merging and post-processing the output , are performed in RAFTNET by separate threads . In this way , temporary delays are smoothed out over one cycle of the master-worker system for splitting , processing and postprocessing a data unit . The same reasoning has been applied to the master and the dispatcher . These consist of separate threads on the same node . Sending a certain set of input blocks from the master to the dispatcher results in this case in only exchanging pointers . This avoids the communication cost of sending input blocks from the master to the dispatcher or output units from the dispatcher to the master . 9.7 9.7.1 Application and System Description Parallelization Choice Not all algorithms are good candidates to apply the master-worker on . Parallelising an application over different processors offers a real added value when code optimizations have been done on the algorithm . As such , these two approaches are complementary . The following rules of thumb were used in the decision of applying the raftnet library on the algorithms described in the rest of this section : Algorithm locality : Splitting up the input data for parallel execution is most efficient when operations have no or little data dependency or when these operations are very local if there is a positional data dependency ( e.g. pixels in an image grid ) . Input and output : When data is split up , this can affect the final result . Either the result is erroneous ( mostly because of the absence of locality in the algorithm ) , the output has noise added to it or the merged output is correct ( identical to serial execution ) . This example is often because parallel execution only used a similar split policy that was already inherently used in the serial execution ( e.g. audio MP3 encoding ) . In the second case , the evaluation has to be made if the noise is significant for the final outcome and if it is , can the noise be filtered out in an efficient way . In the following , a case study is briefly described : Feature selection via corner detection and Delaunay triangulation on the reconstructed points . The testing environment consisted of a PA RISC 85000 processor with a 400 MHz clock and 1.5 MB cache , running the HP-UX 11.0 operating system . MPICH 1.2.2 has been used , which implements the MPI 1.2 standard . 9.7.2 Corner Detection The corner detection algorithm ( Harris & Stephens , 1988 ) forms the basis of , e.g. , a 3D reconstruction algorithm . The features selected in this phase are matched ( i.e. the corresponding corners in several images ) and used for reconstruction of the 3rd dimension , which was lost in the projection to 2D while capturing . During the tests , the setup in Fig. 24 was used . Machine A captures , via a Conexant Bt878 based card , the data onto a local disk ( NVREC , n.d. ) . In turn , this disk is shared via NFS with the rest of the network , in particular the parallel master-worker cluster . The images are captured in PAL VideoCD format , 352 × 288 , 25 fps ( frames per second ) , to pgm frames . The initial version in C , based on the C ++ development code was not even close to be able to process the images in soft real time and only 7 fps were processed . In a following step , the algorithm was optimized by including faster Figure 24 : Capture and processing setup . Figure 25 : Image processing parallelization schemes . and more memory aware data types and by reducing intermediate buffers and loop transformations ( Leeman et al. , 2005 ) . Due to these changes , this algorithm got a speedup of 30 % , which still put it about two times slower than the minimal soft real time requirement ( 10 – 12 fps ) . Since conventional code optimization techniques were exhausted , assigning a larger cycle budget to the task within the available environment was done by adding a parallelization layer . Figure 25 shows two possible parallelization schemes . One possibility is to split up the figure . In doing this , edge effects have to be accounted for , so about 7 % of the pixel values need to be replicated . In the test setup , the second option was preferred : The frames are handled in a FIFO by the master and are sent as a whole to the workers . This has also the advantage that no splitting is needed at the dispatcher side , nor is there need for merging of the results ( coordinate data ) on the collector's side . For the integration of the master-worker algorithm , only 125 extra lines of code had to be written to use the required functionality of raftnet . Tests on the implemented system show that soft real time feature detection in the absence of faults is possible with 4 to 5 workers ( depending on the network and worker load ) . Adding more workers improves further performance and , at the same time , enhances the dependability of the service . Voting Farm Trap Handler Atomic Actions Broadcast algorithm General algorithm General algorithm Sect . 3.1.3 Sect . 5.2 Sect . 6.1.1 Table 2 Table 4 Table 6 : The algorithms of the EFTOS tools . 10 CONCLUSION In this chapter single-version and multiple-version software fault-tolerance have been described . Also the main features of a few systems based on these approaches have been discussed . After this a number of examples have been treated in more detail – a flexible and easy to use mechanism for software voting ; a software watchdog timer ; a tool providing exception handling for the C programming language ; a tool to manage transactions in C ; and a system combining spatial and temporal redundancy to achieve data stabilization . Some of their algorithms have been introduced – Table 6 locates them in the chapter . A so-called recovery meta-program – a syntactical structure for the expressions of provisions such as recovery blocks – has been also introduced . Finally a hybrid system , RAFTNET , combining aspects of both approaches , has been discussed . Main aspect of the SV approach is the inherent mixture of the functional and the fault-tolerant code , which requires the developer to deal with the two corresponding concerns at the same time . MVSFT do not suffer from such flaw . On the other hand , as already mentioned , MVSFT have been designed expressly in order to address residual design faults . Such fault model though is intrinsically static , as the approach requires an off-line definition of the variants . This means that any service adopting the MVSFT provision assumes a static , stable environment , the typical faults of which are known as well as the extent of their consequences . Any time this is not valid anymore , the risk is higher of a coverage failure for the assumption of statistical independence becomes greater . Despite their relatively long life , the approaches reviewed in this chapter are still being used and debated upon . This is especially true for MVSFT based on design diversity , whose effectiveness with respect to the problem of correlated failures appears to be a constant field of debate ( Meulen & Revilla , 2005 ) , while its applicability is being enlarged to domains such as security ( Cox et al. , 2006 ) and to non custom-made versions ( Gashi et al. , 2006 ) .

In software the redundancy required is not simple replication of programs but redundancy of design . "" Chapter 2 reported the consequences of a well known case where redundancy of design would have prevented a catastrophic failure – the Ariane 5 flight 501 . 3 Randell himself states that , given the ever increasing complexity of modern computing , there is still an urgent need for "" richer forms of structuring for error recovery and for design diversity "" ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . 4 This weakness of NVP can be narrowed , if not solved , adopting the approach used in the so-called "" voting farm "" ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998c , 1998a ; De Florio , 1997 ) , a generic voting tool designed by author of this book in the framework of his participation to project "" EFTOS "" ( see Sect . 2.1.1 ) : such a tool works with opaque objects that are compared by means of a user-defined function . This function returns an integer value representing a "" distance "" between any two objects to be voted . The user may choose between a set of predefined distance functions or may develop an application-specific distance function . Doing the latter , a distance may be endowed with the ability to assess that bitwise different objects are semanticly equivalent . Of course , the user is still responsible for supplying a bug-free distance function – though is assisted in this simpler task by a number of template functions supplied with that tool . 5 We recall that EPX , or Embedded Parix , was the operating system and message passing library of EFTOS' target platforms . page Contents 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES 49 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLEVERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE 49 2.1 Single-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Libraries of Tools .... 50 2.1.1 The EFTOS library ...................... 50 2.1.2 The SwIFT System ...................... 52 2.1.3 Two libraries for Checkpointing and Rollback ....... 54 2.2 Conclusions ............................... 55 2.3 Multiple-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Structures for Design Diversity ............................... . 56 2.3.1 A hybrid case : Data Diversity ................ 61 3 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Voting Farm 3.1 Basic Structure and Features of the EFTOS Voting Farm 3.1.1 Client-Side of the Voting Farm : the User Module . 3.1.2 System and Fault Models .............. 3.1.3 Server-Side of the Voting Farm : the Voter ..... 3.1.4 Voting Farm : An Example ............. 3.1.5 Voting Farm : Some Conclusions .......... 4 The EFTOS Tools : The Watchdog Timer ........................ 64 64 67 68 69 72 74 75 5 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Trap Handler 77 5.1 The EFTOS Trap Handling Tool .................. 78 5.2 Algorithm of the Trap Handling Tool ................ 78 5.2.1 Structure of user trap handling ............... 78 5.2.2 System and Fault Models of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool ............................. . 81 5.2.3 Conclusions .......................... 81 6 The EFTOS Tools : Atomic Actions 6.1 The EFTOS Atomic Action Tool . 6.1.1 System Model ........ 6.1.2 The Implementation .... 6.1.3 Functionality ... ..... 6.2 Conclusion ................................................ .......... 81 81 82 84 84 85 ........................................ 7 The TIRAN Data Stabilizing Software Tool 7.1 Introduction ....................... 7.2 Requirements for the Data Stabilizer ......... 7.2.1 The Distributed Memory Tool ........ 7.2.2 The Local Memory Handler and Its Tasks .. 7.2.3 Application-program Interface and Client side 7.3 The Data Stabilizing System Tool ... ....... 7.3.1 Algorithms ................... 7.3.2 Application-Program Interface ........ 7.3.3 System and Fault Models ........... 7.4 Conclusion ........................... ........................................................ 85 . 88 . 89 . 92 . 93 . 95 . 97 . 97 . 98 . 99 . 100 8 An Approach to Express Recovery Blocks : The Recovery MetaProgram 100 9 A Hybrid Case : The RAFTNET Library for Dependable FarmerWorker Parallel Applications 102 9.1 Introducing RAFTNET ..... .................. 102 9.2 Why Dependable Parallel Applications ? .............. 103 9.3 The Technique ............................ 104 9.4 Interactions Between the Farmer and the Dispatcher ....... 105 9.4.1 Interactions Between the Dispatcher and the Workers .. 106 9.4.2 Interactions Between the Workers and the Collector ... 108 9.4.3 Interactions Between the Collector and the Dispatcher .. 109 9.5 Discussion ............................... 110 9.5.1 Reliability Analysis ........ .............. 110 9.6 Implementation Issues ........................ 111 9.6.1 Failure semantics ....................... 115 9.6.2 Initialization and Finalization ....... ......... 116 9.6.3 Speeding up .......................... 116 9.7 Application and System Description ................ 117 9.7.1 9.7.2 Parallelization Choice ............... ..... 117 Corner Detection ....................... 117 10 CONCLUSION 119 References 119 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING COMPILERS AND TRANSLATORS 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES In this chapter our survey of methods and structures for application-level fault-tolerance continues getting closer to the programming language : Indeed , tools such as compilers and translators work at the level of the language – they parse , interpret , compile or transform our programs , so they are interesting candidates for managing dependability aspects in the application layer . An important property of this family of methods is the fact that fault-tolerance complexity is extracted from the program and turned into architectural complexity in the compiler or the translator . Apart from continuing with our survey , this chapter also aims at providing the reader with two practical examples : • Reflective and refractive variables , i.e. a syntactical structure to express adaptive feedback loops in the application layer . This is useful to resilient computing because a feedback loop can attach error recovery strategies to error detection events . • Redundant variables , that is a tool that allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of redundancy is not fixed once and for all at design time , but rather it changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . Both tools are new research activities that are currently being carried out by the author of this book at the PATS research group of the University of Antwerp . It is shown how through a simple translation approach it is possible to provide sophisticated features such as adaptive fault-tolerance to programs written in any language , even plain old C. 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING COMPILERS AND TRANSLATORS Our first subject is tools that work "" within "" the compiler : Meta-object protocols . Most of such tools are based on the concept of reflection : The ability to mirror the feature of a system by creating a causal connection between sub-systems and internal objects . In other words , events experienced by a reflected sub-system trigger events on the object representing that sub-system , and vice-versa . 2.1 Compiler-level Tools : Meta-object Protocols , Reflection , and Introspection Some of the negative aspects pointed out while describing single and multiple version software approaches can be in some cases weakened , if not solved , by means of a generic structuring technique that allows to reach in some cases an adequate degree of flexibility , transparency , and separation of design concerns : the adoption of meta-object protocols ( Kiczales , Rivières , & Bobrow , 1991 ) . The idea is to "" open "" the implementation of the run-time executive of an object-oriented language like C ++ or Java so that the developer can adopt and program different , custom semantics , adjusting the language to the needs of the user and to the requirements of the environment . Using meta-object protocols , the programmer can modify the behavior of a programming language's features such as methods invocation , object creation and destruction , and member access . The transparent management of spatial and temporal redundancy ( Taylor , Morgan , & Black , 1980 ) is a context where meta-object protocols appear to be particularly adequate . The key concept behind meta-object protocols is that of computational reflection , or the causal connection between a system and a meta-level description representing structural and computational aspects of that system ( Maes , 1987 ) . The protocols offer the meta-level programmer a representation of a system as a set of meta-objects , i.e. , objects that represent and reflect properties of "" real "" objects , i.e. , those objects that constitute the functional part of the user application . Meta-objects can for instance represent the structure of a class , or object interaction , or the code of an operation . This mapping process is called reification ( Robben , 1999 ) . The causality relation of meta-object protocols could also be extended to allow for a dynamical reorganisation of the structure and the operation of a system , e.g. , to perform reconfiguration and error recovery . The basic object-oriented feature of inheritance can be used to enhance the reusability of the fault-tolerance mechanisms developed with this approach . A related concept is introspection , a technique that hacks the compiler to unravel and reason upon the hidden structure of our programs . 2.1.1 OpenC ++ and Project FRIENDS OpenC ++ has been defined as a "" code analysis library "" ( Karpov , 2008 ) : A tool to parse and analyze C ++ source code . Such tool makes use of a meta-object protocol to provide services for language extensions . In OpenC ++ , classes are objects as in Smalltalk , and called class metaobjects . A class metaobject translates – at compile time – expressions involving a class . In a sense , it works like a filter parsing all the expressions that mention its class . The default filter leaves the expressions unmodified , but the programmer can choose otherwise . This simple idea translates in a powerful tool for the programmer : For instance ( Shigeru , 1996 ) , shows how easy it is to perform some accounting on all methods invocations of a given class ( doing this in a standard programming language such as C ++ would require considerable programming effort ( Leeman et al. , 2005 )) . As one can easily understand , such features may translate in a useful syntactical structure for the tolerance of faults . An architecture supporting this approach is the one developed in the framework of project FRIENDS ( Fabre & Pérennou , 1996 , 1998 ) . Name FRIENDS is the acronym of "" Flexible and Reusable Implementation Environment for your Next Dependable system "" . This project aims at implementing a number of fault-tolerance provisions ( e.g. , replication , group-based communication , synchronization , voting ) at meta-level . In FRIENDS a distributed application is a set of objects interacting via the proxy model , a proxy being a local intermediary between each object and any other ( possibly replicated ) object . 2.1.2 Javassist Javassist ( Java Programming Assistant ) ( Javassist , n.d. ) is a Java meta-library : It allows the programmer to access and manipulate the bytecode of an application , that is , the Java pseudo-code that is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine to execute that application . This powerful feature allows to change the implementation of a class at run-time , which is known as structural reflection . Javassist can edit the bytecode either in the high-level form of the corresponding Java source level or directly as bytecodes . It is even possible to compile bytecode strings on the fly . Working with the standard Java compiler and virtual machine , Javassist offers a meta-object interface to control method invocations on base-level objects . All these features makes it a powerful tool for program transformation . One of the possible uses of Javassist is to augment Java for aspect-oriented programming1 , e.g. inserting before , after , and around advices . This gave raise to the GluonJ system , "" a light-weight but powerful AOP framework on top of Javassist "" ( GluonJ , n.d. ) . Another interesting application would be to make use of Javassist to monitor and protect objects , for instance taking periodic "" snapshots "" of their state . This is but one possible way to achieve higher dependability through an approach like the one offered by Javassist , though to the best of our knowledge no research is being carried out on this topic yet . 2.1.3 MetaC ++ MetaC ++ ( Strasser , 2005 ) is a tool that reads a C ++ program and produces a tree with a representation of language constructs . The tree is exported to clients through an API or in the form of an XML file . The gathered meta-data can be used to rewrite a modified version of the original program , including all types of patches , filters , and improvements – which makes it interesting as a fault-tolerance provision . It was designed by its author primarily as a source-to-source code translator , but also to be used by source code analysis tools , stub generators , and source-to-UML converters . According to its author , future releases of MetaC ++ will provide mechanisms to mark elements of the language with attributes , as in persistent class MyDatabaseObject ; This will facilitate the set up of systems such as redundant variables , the dynamically redundant data structures described in Chapter 10 . 2.1.4 Introspection Data hiding and encapsulation are powerful tools to master the complexity of complex computer services , but they also represent a process that inhibits the access to complexity that is still there , and therefore can potentially jeopardize those services . The idea of introspection is to gain access into this complexity , to inspect the hidden structure of programs , and to interpret their meaning through semantic processing , the same way the Semantic Web promises to achieve with the data scattered in the Internet . Quoting its author , "" introspection is a means that , when applied correctly , can help crack the code of a software and intercept the hidden and encapsulated meaning of the internals of a program "" . The way to achieve introspection is by instrumenting the software with data collectors producing information available in a form allowing semantic processing , such as RDF . This idea is being used in the Introspector project , which aims at instrumenting the GNU programming tool-chain so as to create a sort of semantic web of all software derived from those tools . The ultimate goal is very ambitious : "" To create a super large and extremely dense web of information about the outside world extracted automatically from computer language programs "" ( DuPont , n.d. ) . Should this become possible , we would be given a tool to reason ( and to let computers reason on our behalf ! ) about the dependability characteristics of the application software – imagine what could mean for instance being able to check for the presence of a hidden design goal and have the problem solved without human intervention . Some years ago this would have sounded like science fiction , now it appears that many researchers are focussing on tools that go in this direction : GASTA ( Gcc Abstract Syntax Tree Analysis ) ( Thouvenin , 2004 ) for instance uses introspection to automatically annotate C code to analyze the presence of null pointer design faults ) . GCC-XML ( King , 2004 ) has similar goals . A more advanced example appears to be XOGASTAN ( XML-Oriented Gcc Abstract Syntax Tree ANalyzer ) ( Antoniol , Di Penta , Masone , & Villano , 2004 ) , which uses the abstract syntax tree produced by the GNU compiler while processing a C file and translates it into XML . Another of their tools then can read the XML file and analyze it . So let us hope this may become part of our future . Conclusions . Meta-object protocols and reflection are indeed a promising system structure for embedding different non-functional concerns in the application-level of a computer program . They work at language level , providing means to modify the semantics of basic object-oriented language building blocks like object creation and deletion , calling and termination of class methods , and so forth . This appears to match perfectly to a proper subset of the possible fault-tolerance provisions , especially those such as transparent object redundancy , which can be straightforwardly managed with the meta-object approach . When dealing with these fault-tolerance provisions , meta-object protocols and reflection provide a perfect separation of the design concerns , i.e. , optimal sc . Some other techniques , specifically those who might be described as "" the most coarse-grained ones "" , such as distributed recovery blocks ( Kim & Welch , 1989 ) , appear to be less suited for being efficiently implemented via meta-object protocols . These techniques work at distributed , i.e. , macroscopic , level . The above situation reminds the author of this book of another one , regarding the "" quest "" for a novel computational paradigm for parallel processing able of dealing effectively with the widest class of problems , the same way the Von Neumann paradigm does for sequential processing , though with the highest degree of efficiency and the least amount of changes in the original ( sequential ) user code . In that context , the concept of computational grain came up : Some techniques were inherently looking at the problem "" with coarse-grained glasses , "" i.e. , at macroscopic level , while others were considering the problem exclusively at microscopic level . Meta-object protocols are an example of the latter approaches : They provide a small grain access to a program's atomic structures and provide means to modify their behavior . Meta-object protocols look at the problem from a microscopic point of view . Some of the hitherto developed fault-tolerance techniques fit perfectly with this approach – for instance , object redundancy can be easily managed with the meta-object approach , and , for instance , Robben ( Robben , 1999 ) describes meta-programs for checkpointing , active replication , and transaction processing . It is still unclear whether this set is general enough to host , efficaciously , many forms of fault-tolerance , as it is remarked for instance in ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ; Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) ( "" what reflective capabilities are needed for what form of fault-tolerance , and to what extent these capabilities can be provided in more-or-less conventional programming languages , and allied to other structuring techniques [ like RB and NVP ] remain to be determined "" ) . It is therefore difficult to establish a qualitative assessment of attribute sa for meta-object protocols and reflection . Judging from the evidence acquired to date one can cautiously assess their sa as "" ≥ average "" ( average or more . ) The run-time management of libraries of meta-object protocols may be used to reach satisfactory values for attribute a . To the best of our knowledge this feature has not been exploited for reaching higher dependability in any system supporting meta-object protocols and reflection . As evident , the target application domain is mostly the one of object-oriented applications written with languages extended with a meta-object protocol , such as Open C ++ . One can conclude that meta-object protocols and reflection offer an elegant system structure to embed a certain set of non-functional services ( including some fault-tolerance provisions ) in an object-oriented program . Computational reflection is a relatively old concept , though still actively investigated in various forms , especially because it is one of the possible ways to realize aspect-orientation , which is being given an even larger attention by researchers these days . OpenC ++ is still referenced and investigated ( Karpov , 2008 ) . MetaC ++ does not appear to have received wide attention . On the contrary , introspection appears to be spreading with projects such as GASTA , XOGASTAN and GCC-XML . Both computational reflection and introspection are conceptual ingredients that can be used to craft fault-tolerance systems , though can not provide an answer of their own but must be coupled with other approaches . No fault-tolerance provisions based on introspection surfaced to date , so it is difficult to assess the value of the structural attributes for introspection for the time being . 2.2 2.2.1 Enhancing Programs through Translations LINDA Systems The Linda ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989b , 1989a ) approach adopts a special model of communication , known as generative communication ( Gelernter , 1985 ) . According to this model , communication is still carried out through messages , though messages are not sent to one or more addressees for them to be retrieved from local mailboxes – on the contrary , messages are included in a distributed ( virtual ) shared memory , called tuple space , where every Linda process has equal read / write access rights . In generative communication , the sender of a message can not know who will read any sent message – if any eventually will . This means that traditional terms such as client-server or peer-to-peer , which are normally used to describe relationships between communicating entities , do not apply to generative communication . A tuple space is some sort of a shared relational database for storing and withdrawing special data objects called tuples , sent by the Linda processes . Tuples are basically lists of objects identified by their contents , cardinality and type . Two tuples match if ( 1 ) they have the same number of objects , ( 2 ) if the objects are pairwise compatible for what concerns their types , and ( 3 ) if the memory cells associated to the objects are bitwise equal . A Linda process inserts , reads , and withdraws tuples via blocking or non-blocking primitives . Read operations can be performed by supplying a template tuple – that is , a prototype tuple consisting of constant fields and of fields that can assume any value . A process trying to access a missing tuple via a blocking primitive enters a wait state that continues until any tuple matching its template tuple is added to the tuple space . This allows processes to synchronize . When more than one tuple matches a template , the choice of which actual tuple to address is done in a non-deterministic way . Concurrent execution of processes is supported through the concept of "" live data structures "" : Tuples requiring the execution of one or more functions can be evaluated on different processors – in a sense , they become active , or "" alive "" . Once the evaluation has finished , a ( no more active , or passive ) output tuple is entered in the tuple space . Parallelism is implicit in Linda – there is no explicit notion of network , number and location of the system processors , though Linda has been successfully employed in many different hardware architectures and many applicative domains , resulting in a powerful programming tool that sometimes achieves excellent speedups without affecting portability issues . Unfortunately the model does not cover the possibility of failures – for instance , the semantics of its primitives are not well defined in the case of a processor crash , and no fault-tolerance means are part of the model . Moreover , in its original form , Linda only offers single-op atomicity ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) , i.e. , atomic execution for only a single tuple space operation . With single-op atomicity it is not possible to solve problems arising in two common Linda programming paradigms when faults occur : Both the distributed variable and the replicated-worker paradigms can fail ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) . As a consequence , a number of possible improvements have been investigated to support fault-tolerant parallel programming in Linda . Apart from design choices and development issues , many of them implement stability of the tuple space ( via replicated state machines ( Schneider , 1990 ) kept consistent via ordered atomic multicast ( Birman , Schiper , & Stephenson , 1991 )) ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Xu & Liskov , 1989 ; Patterson , Turner , Hyatt , & Reilly , 1993 ) , while others aim at combining multiple tuple-space operations into atomic transactions ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ; Cannon & Dunn , 1992 ) . Other techniques have also been used , e.g. , tuple space checkpoint-and-rollback ( Kambhatla , 1991 ) . The author of this book also proposed an augmented Linda model for solving inconsistencies related to failures occurring in a replicated-worker environment ( see Chapter 9 ) and an algorithm for implementing a resilient replicated worker scheme for message-passing farmer-worker applications . As seen in Chapter 3 , this algorithm can mask failures affecting a proper subset of the set of workers ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1999 ) . Linda can be described as a parallel processing extension that can be added to any existing programming language . The greater part of these extensions requires a preprocessor translating the extension in the host language . This is the case , e.g. , for FT-Linda ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) , PvmLinda ( De Florio , Murgolo , & Spinelli , 1994 ) , C-Linda ( Berndt , 1989 ) , and MOM ( Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ) . A counterexample is , e.g. , the POSYBL system ( Schoinas , 1991 ) , which implements Linda primitives with remote procedure calls , and requires the user to supply the ancillary information for distinguishing tuples . Linda systems allow dealing with redundant data and redundant processes in a transparent way , so they are in general characterized by good sc . Though available in many flavours , typically Linda systems focus on a few fault-tolerance solutions , hence sa is assessed as "" average / potentially good "" . Adaptivity is not supported in the available Linda systems , so their a is deemed as insufficient . The Linda approach , on the other hand , may make use of its high transparency to achieve fault-tolerance applications whose redundancy changes with the experienced or forecast faults – which would bring to good a . Very popular some years ago , Linda appears not to be an emergent fault-tolerance the solution these days . 2.2.2 The Porch Translator Porch ( Strumpen , 1998 ) is a source-to-source translator that converts a sequential C program into an equivalent one that supports the saving and reloading of "" portable checkpoints "" . This means that Porch allows to dump a checkpoint on machine m and restart it on machine n , even though m and n have different computer architecture . Clearly this can be used to achieve task migration and reconfiguration . Porch allows to execute checkpoints periodically , or by sending signals e.g. through the UNIX "" kill "" command . Porch suffers from several limitations : Rolling back a checkpoint does not preserve open file descriptors and sockets ; only initialized pointers are stored in the checkpoints , hence uninitialized pointers may change their value . Porch is functionally not dissimilar from other checkpoint and rollback systems such as psncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) , ckpt ( Zandy , n.d. ) or Dynamite ( Iskra et al. , 2000 ) . Its added value is the use of a translator , which improves its sc . Clearly sa is limited to a single class of fault-tolerance provisions . No adaptivity is foreseen in Porch , so a is set to insufficient . Next section describes an application-level approach to fault-tolerance employing translators . The approach is based on so-called Reflective and refractive variables . Available as a rough prototype , a system supporting this approach is currently being developed by the author of this book . Figure 1 : A simple example of the use of reflective and refractive variables . 3 AN EXAMPLE : REFLECTIVE AND REFRACTIVE VARIABLES The idea behind reflective and refractive variables is to use memory access as an abstraction to perform concealed tasks . Reflective and refractive variables are volatile variables whose identifier links them with an external device , such as a sensor , or an RFID , or an actuator . In reflective variables , memory cells get asynchronously updated by service threads that interface those external devices . The well-known concept of reflection is used , because those variables "" reflect "" the values measured by those devices . In refractive variables , on the contrary , write requests trigger a request to update an external parameter , such as the data rate of the local TCP protocol entity or the amount of redundancy to be used in transmissions . We use to say that write accesses "" refract "" ( that is , get redirected ( Institute for Telecommunication Sciences , n.d. )) onto corresponding external devices . The reflective and refractive variables model does not require any special language : Figure1 is an example in the C language . The portrayed program declares two variables : "" cpu "" , a reflective integer , which reports the current percentage of usage of the local CPU as an integer number between 0 and 100 , and "" tcpTxRate "" , a reflective and refractive integer , which reports and sets the send rate parameter of the TCP layer . The code periodically queries the CPU usage and , when that reaches a value greater than 90 % , it requests to change the TCP send rate . Note that the only non standard C construct used in the example is attribute "" Ref t "" , which specifies that a corresponding declaration is reflective or refractive or both . Through a translation process , discussed in detail in Sect . 3 , this code is instrumented so as to include the logics required to interface the cpu and the TCP external devices . Figure3 shows this simple code in action on our development platform – a Pentium-M laptop running Windows XP and the Cygwin tools . One can observe that through the reflective and refractive variable model the design complexity is partitioned into two well defined and separated Figure 2 : An excerpt from the execution of the code in Fig. 2 . components : The code to interface external devices is specified "" elsewhere "" ( Sect . describes where and how ) while the functional code is specified in a familiar way , in this case as a C code reading and writing integer variables . The result is a structured model to express tasks such as cross-layered optimization , adaptive or fault-tolerant computing in an elegant , non intrusive , and cost-effective way . Such model is characterized by strong separation of design concerns ( that is , excellent sc ) , for the functional strategies are not to be specified aside with the layer functions . Only instrumentation is required , and this can be done once and for all . This prevents spaghetti-like coding for both the functional and the non-functional aspects , and translates in improved maintainability and enhanced efficiency . The reflective and refractive variable model provides the designer also with another attribute : a variable , be it a reflective / refractive variables or a "" common "" one , can be tagged as being "" redundant "" . Redundant variables are variables whose contents get replicated several times so as to protect them from memory faults . Writing to a redundant variable means writing to a number of replicas , either located strategically2 on the same processing node , or on remote nodes – when available and the extra overhead be allowed . Reading from a redundant variable actually translates in reading from each of its cells and performing majority voting ( through an approach such as the one described in Chapter 3 ) . The result of this process is monitored by a special device , called Redundance . Redundance measures the amount of votes that differ from the majority vote , and uses this as a measure of the disturbance in the surrounding environment . Under normal situation , Redundance triplicates the memory cells of redundant variables . This corresponds to tolerating up to one memory fault in the cells associated to a redundant variable . Under more critical situations , the amount of redundancy should change . This is indeed what actually happens : The component that manages redundant variables Figure 3 : General structure of feedback loops . Figure 4 : Redundant variables . declares the integer reflective variable "" ref t int redundance "" . The latter is set asynchronously by the Redundance device , which adjusts the corresponding memory cells3 with a number representing the ideal degree of redundancy with respect to the current degree of disturbances . The reflective and refractive variables model can also be used in contexts such as cross-layer optimization . In general , it provides an application-level construct to manage feedback loops . Feedback loops ( see Fig. 2 ) – a well known concept from system theory – are ideal forms to shape our systems so as to be adaptive-and-dependable ( Van Roy , 2006 ) . As we have mentioned already in Chapter 2 , such property is an important pre-requisite for the welfare of our computer-dominated societies and economies : In the cited paper Van Roy explains their relevance to future software design . Reflective and refractive variables provide a straightforward syntactical structure and software architecture for the expression of feedback loops . This structure is used , e.g. , to implement redundant variables . The main advantage in this case is that , instead of taking a design decision once and for all , one lets a system parameter change as needed , zeroing in on the optimum . The use of reflective and refractive variables simplifies the design of our solution , which also enhances maintainability . But probably the most important consequence of that design choice is that our solution does not assume a fixed , immutable fault model , but lets it change with the actual faults being experienced – which is precisely the property pointed out in Chapter 2 as a key requirement for modern dependable software . Figure4 shows how simple it is to use a redundant variable : No syntactic differences can be noticed . The required logic is "" hidden "" in the translation process . More detail about redundant variables is provided in Sect . 4 . 3.1 Implementation The core of the reflective and refractive variables architecture is a LEX analyzer4 that translates the input source code into two source files , one with an augmented version of the original code and one server-side to monitor and drive the external devices . This process is considered in Fig. 5 , an excerpt from the translation of the code in Fig. 4 . Let us review the resulting code in more detail ( please note that item x in the following list refer to lines tagged as "" // x "" in the code ) : 1 . First the translator removes the occurrences of attributes "" ref t "" and "" redundant "" . 2 . Then it performs a few calls to function "" aopen "" . This is to open the associative arrays "" reflex "" and "" rtype "" . As well known , an associative array generalizes the concept of array so as to allow addressing items by non-integer indexes . The arguments to "" aopen "" are functions similar to "" strcmp "" , from the C standard library , which are used to compare index objects . The idea is that these data structures create links between the name of variables and some useful information ( see below ) . 3 . There follow a number of "" awrites "" , i.e. , associations are created between variables identifiers and two numbers : The corresponding variables' address and an internal code representing its type and attributes . 4 . Then "" Server "" , the thread responsible to interface the external devices , is spawned . 5 . Besides a write access into refractive variable tcpTxRate , the translator places a call to function "" CalltcpTxRate "" . In general , after a call to refractive variable v , the call "" Callv ( & v ) "" is produced . 6 . Similarly , a write access to redundant variable w , of type t , is followed by a call to "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" . 7 . Finally , reading from redundant variable w , of type t , is translated into a call to function "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" . It is the responsibility of the designer to make sure that proper code for functions "" Callv ( & v ) "" is produced . Functions "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" and "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" are automatically generated through a template-like approach – the former performs a redundant write , the latter a redundant read plus majority voting . For voting , an approach similar to that in Chapter 3 has been followed ( that is , voting farms ) . As already mentioned , the "" Server "" thread is the code responsible to monitor and interface the external devices . Its algorithm is quite simple ( see Fig. 6 ) : Figure 5 : Abridged version of the main function of the translated code . the code continuously waits for a sensor update ( lines tagged with "" // 1 "" ) , then retrieves the address and type of the corresponding reflective variable ( in "" // 2 "" ) and finally updates that variable ( "" // 3 "" ) . The complexity to interface external devices is charged to function "" getValue "" , an excerpt of which is shown in Fig. 7 . The core of "" getValue "" is function "" cpu "" , which returns the amount of CPU currently being used . 3.2 Other Uses of Reflective and Refractive Variables As mentioned at the beginning , our research on this topic has begun only recently . We are in the process of making use of our approach in several real-life applications – most likely the subject of future publications . In what follows a few contexts where our variables could provide effective and low-cost solutions are discussed . 3.2.1 Management of Concurrency As cleverly explained e.g. by Gates in ( Gates , 2007 ) , a well known challenge in robotics is concurrency , defined in the cited paper as "" how to simultaneously handle all the data coming in from multiple sensors and send the appropriate commands to the robot's motors "" . The conventional approach , i.e. , making use of a long loop that first reads all the data from the sensors , then processes the input and finally controls the robot is not adequate enough . Because of this , the robot control could be using stale values , which could bring to disastrous consequences . As Gates mentions in the cited paper , this is a scenario that applies not only to Figure 6 : The Server code . Figure 7 : Function getValue interfaces all the external devices that are connected to reflective and refractive variables . Figure 8 : RR var to localize objects with RFID tags on them . robotics but also to all those fields such as distributed , parallel and resilient computing where data and control often need to be effectively orchestrated under strict real-time constraints and despite the occurrence of faults . "" To fully exploit the power of processors working in parallel , the new software must deal with the problem of concurrency "" , Gate says . It is our belief that an approach such as the one offered by reflective and refractive variables could result in an effective syntactic structure for that : A control loop using reflective variables , for instance , would not need to specify a reading order for the input variables , which are updated asynchronously , as new values need to replace old ones . Within that loop one could attach e.g. the asynchronous management of failures . 3.2.2 Localizing Hidden Assets Extending our translator it can be possible to allow writing programs such as the one in Fig. 8 . At first sight the program may sound meaningless , as it only declares a function and a reflective variable , "" rfid "" , and does not seem to perform any useful action . "" Behind the lines "" – a nice feature offered by translators – what happens is that surrounding RFID tags reflect their content onto variable "" rfid "" . Data stored into that variable is compared with the initialization value ( in this case , an ISBN number ) . In case of a match , function "" beep "" is called . Now imagine running this code onto your PDA while walking through the lanes of a large library such as the Vatican Library in search for a "" lost "" or misplaced book . When in reach of the searched item , the PDA starts beeping5 . Or imagine that , thanks to international regulations , all "" companies "" building antipersonnel mines be obliged by law to embed RFID tags into their "" products "" . When activated , these tags and a program as simple as the one in Fig. 8 could easily prevent dreadful events that continuously devastate the lives of too many a human being . Changing context , the same approach could be used to speed up the localizing of people trapped in the ruins of a fallen building after an earthquake , and so forth . This could be sensible in a highly seismic region . Conclusions . This section introduced a translation system that allows making use of reflection in a standard programming language such as C. The same translator supports "" refraction "" , that is the control of external devices through simple memory write accesses . These two features are used to realize redundant data structures . As well known , redundancy is a key property in fault-tolerance . The Shannon theorem teaches us that through any unreliable channel it is possible to send data reliably by using a proper degree of redundancy . This famous result can be read out in a different way : For each degree of unreliability , there is a minimum level of redundancy that can be used to tolerate any fault . Our approach uses reflective and refractive variables to attune the degree of redundancy required to ensure data integrity to the actual faults being experienced by the system . This provides an example of adaptive fault-tolerant software . Reflective and refractive variables can be used to express problems in cross-layer optimization , but also in contexts where concurrency calls for expressive software structures , e.g. robotics . Localization problems could also be solved through a very simple scheme . Other fields where our tool is being exercised include personalized healthcare ( De Florio , Vaerenbergh , & Blondia , 2007 ) and global adaptation frameworks to enhance the quality of experience of mobile services ( Sun , De Florio , Ning , & Blondia , 2007 ) . By construction , reflective and refractive variables exhibit a good amount of transparency , which translates in good sc . sa is limited to those fault-tolerance techniques that can be expressed in terms of the variables ; some variables could be used e.g. to express processing and communication entities , and allow them to migrate transparently ; other variables could change their state to represent the detection of faults , and so forth . As authors we are convinced of their merits , but we must be objective and state that no such provisions exist so far – with the exception of the ones described in next section . So a fair assessment for sa could be "" limited / potentially good "" . The hidden implementation of reflective and refractive variables allows to achieve a good a with an approach such as the one described in the next section . 4 ADAPTIVE DATA INTEGRITY THROUGH DYNAMICALLY REDUNDANT DATA STRUCTURES Changes , they use to say , are the only constant in life . Everything changes rapidly around us , and more and more key to survival is the ability to rapidly adapt to changes . This consideration applies to many aspects of our lives . Strangely enough , this nearly self-evident truth is not always considered in computer science with the seriousness that it calls for : The assumptions that are drawn for our systems often do not take into due account that e.g. , the run-time environments , the operational conditions , or the available resources will vary . Software is especially vulnerable to this threat , and with today's software-dominated systems controlling crucial services in nuclear plants , airborne equipments , health care systems and so forth , it becomes clear how this situation may potentially lead to catastrophes . Let us consider in particular the viewpoint of the software fault-tolerance engineer and the design goal of enhanced data integrity : It is clear that protecting data against memory faults requires the definition of a fault model stating the possible fault scenarios that our software is going to experience . The current practice is to take this as a static choice , which means that our data integrity provisions ( DIP ) have a fixed range of admissible events to address and tolerate . This translates into two risks : 1 . overshooting , i.e. , over-dimensioning the DIP with respect to the actual threat being experienced , and 2 . undershooting , namely underestimating the threat in view of an economy of resources . Note how those two risks turn into a crucial dilemma to the designer : Wrong choices here can lead to either unpractical , too costly designs or cheap but vulnerable provisions . A sensible example of the problem just stated is given by redundant data structures ( RDS ) . Here redundancy and voting are used to protect memory from possible transient or permanent corruptions . The common choice would be that of adopting a static fault model assumption , such as e.g. "" during any mission , up to 3 faults shall affect the replicas "" , which translates into using a 7-redundant cell to address the worst possible scenario . This is precisely a case of the above stated dilemma . Our starting point in the research reported herein was the question "" Is this the right approach ? , "" or "" Does it make sense in the first place to fix , once and for all , a set of possible conditions affecting memory modules ? "" We do n't think so . First of all , memory technology ( like all technologies ) changes , which means that while yesterday our software was running atop CMOS chips , today the common choice e.g. for airborne applications is SDRAMs because of speed , cost , weight , power and simplicity of design ( Ladbury , 2002 ) . But CMOS memories for airborne applications mostly experience single bit errors ( Oey & Teitelbaum , 1981 ) , while SDRAMS are known to be subject to several classes of faults , including so-called "" single-event effects "" , i.e. single faults affecting whole chips6 ( Ladbury , 2002 ) . Furthermore the cited paper remarks how even from lot to lot error / failure rates vary more than one order of magnitude . A static choice of the fault model can not take all this into proper account . A second argument is that run-time environments change , often because the application is mobile but sometimes also because of external events affecting e.g. temperature , radiation , electro-magnetic interference , or cosmic rays ( think of a wireless sensor network to assist a fire brigade , or of a spaceborne application circulating around the sun ) . Also in these cases a static choice would be unpractical , as the nature of faults may change during a same mission . Figure 9 : A simple example of use of redundant variables . Our conjecture is that the solution to this problem should come by considering the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . Consequently , any fault-tolerance provision that be able to solve effectively the problem of over-dimensioning and under-dimensioning should function as an adaptation feedback loop ( Van Roy , 2006 ) in which the resources are allocated after the estimated values of F ( t ) , derived by monitoring sensible environmental variables . This section reports on the design of a tool compliant to that model . Our tool allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures where the degree of redundancy changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced at run-time . Our approach attunes the degree of redundancy required to ensure data integrity to the actual faults being experienced by the system and provides an example of adaptive fault-tolerance software provision . In what follows a description of our tool and design issues are given . 4.1 Dynamically Redundant Data Structures Our tool is a translator that loosely parses a source code performing some transformations as reported in the rest of this section . A translator was developed in the C programming language together with the Lex lexical analyzer generator and the YACC syntactic analyzers generator ( Levine , Mason , & Brown , 1992 ) . The reported version supports the C syntax though the same principles can be easily applied to any other language . Our translator performs a simple task – it allows the programmer to tag variables with a keyword , "" redundant , "" and then instruments the memory accesses to tagged variables . Figure 9 shows how this is done in practice with a very simple example whose translation is provided in Fig. 10 . Let us review the resulting code in more detail ( please note that item x in the following list refer to lines tagged as "" // x "" in the code ) : 1 . First the translator removes the occurrences of attribute "" redundant "" . 2 . Then it performs a few calls to function "" aopen "" . This is to open the associative arrays "" redun "" and "" rtype "" . As well known , an associative Figure 10 : An excerpt from the translation of the code in Fig. 9 . Variable "" Redundance "" represents the current amount of redundancy , initially set to "" REDUNDANCE "" ( that is , 3 ) . array generalizes the concept of array so as to allow addressing items by non-integer indexes . The arguments to "" aopen "" are functions similar to "" strcmp "" , from the C standard library , which are used to compare index objects . The idea is that these data structures create links between the name of variables and some useful information ( see below ) . 3 . There follow a number of "" awrites "" , i.e. , associations are created between variables' identifiers and two numbers : the corresponding variables' address and an internal code representing its type and attributes ( code 64 means "" redundant int "" ) . 4 . Then the "" Server "" thread , responsible to allocate replicas and to monitor and adapt to external changes , is spawned . 5 . A write access to redundant variable w , of type t , is followed by a call to "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" . 6 . Finally , reading from redundant variable w , of type t , is translated into a call to function "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" . The strategy to allocate replicas is a research topic on its own . Solutions range from naı ̈ ve simple strategies such as allocating replicas into contiguous cells – which makes them vulnerable to burst faults – to more sophisticated strategies where replicas get allocated e.g. in different memory banks , or different memory chips , or even on different processors . Clearly each choice represents a trade-off between robustness and performance penalty . In our current version replicas are separated by strides of variable length . The core of our tool is given by functions "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" and "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" , which are automatically generated for each type t through a template-like approach . The former function performs a redundant write , the latter a redundant read plus majority voting . For voting , an approach similar to that in ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) is followed . What differs our tool from classical libraries for redundant data structures such as the one in ( Taylor et al. , 1980 ) is the fact that in our system the amount of replicas of our data structures changes dynamically with respect to the observed disturbances . A monitoring tool is assumed to be available to assess the probability of memory corruptions of the current environment . An example of such monitoring tool , which estimates that probability by measuring for each call to "" RedundantRead t "" the risk of failure r , is provided . Quantity r may be defined for instance as follows : If our current redundancy is 2n + 1 , and if the maximum set of agreeing replicas after a "" RedundantRead t "" is m ( 0 < m < 2n + 2 ) , then ( 1 ) For instance if redundancy is 7 and m = 6 , that is if only one replica differs , then r = 1 / 3 . Clearly the above choice of r lets risk increase linearly with the number of replicas not in agreement with the majority . Other formulations for r and for the monitoring tool7 are possible and likely to be more effective than the ones taken here – also a matter for future research . Our strategy to adjust redundancy is also quite simple : If r > 0.5 , redundancy is increased by 2 ; if r = 0 for 1000 consecutive calls to "" RedundantRead t "" , redundancy is decreased by 2 . Lower bound and upper bound for redundancy have been set to 3 and 11 respectively . Each request for changing redundancy is reflected by the "" Server "" thread into variable "" Redundance "" through the scheme introduced in ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007 ) . In Chapter 10 it is described how our tool behaves when memory faults are injected . It us shown how , despite the above naı ̈ ve design choices , our tool already depicts valuable results . 4.2 Conclusions As already pointed out , redundancy is a key asset to achieve fault-tolerance . The Shannon theorem teaches us that through any unreliable channel it is possible to send data reliably by using a proper degree of redundancy . This famous result can be read out in a different way : For each degree of unreliability characterizing a run-time environment there is a minimum level of redundancy that can be used to tolerate any fault . Unfortunately environments change , e.g. because of external events , or because assets dissipate , or because the service is mobile . Hence , there is no static allocation of redundancy that can accommodate for any possible scenario : A highly redundant system will withstand no more faults than those considered at design time , and will allocate a large amount of resources even when no faults are threatening the service . Denying this truth is not a wise choice : As Einstein said , the rule should be "" Make everything as simple as possible , but not simpler "" . Likewise , hiding complexity is good , but hiding too much can lead to disasters – history of computing is paved with dreadful examples unfortunately . The main lesson learned by carrying out our research is that this problem must be addressed , and that this complexity must not be neglected , but isolated into architectural components . This section introduced a translation-based approach that has precisely these design goals – addressing the problem of complex fault behaviors and providing an architectural solution that make it as simple as possible for the designer to concentrate on their functional design goals . Our tool provides programmers of commodity languages such as C or Java with adaptively redundant data structures . Designers using our tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of replication is not fixed once and for all at design time , but changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . In Chapter 10 the performance of our tool is reported . Such analysis is carried out through a fault injector called scrambler , which is also briefly introduced . Redundant variables are a recent research project of our group at the University of Antwerp . Future work will be devoted to further developing and enhancing both those tools , e.g. by experimenting with other adaptation strategies , other replica allocation strategies , and introducing more complex fault injection scenarios such as single event effects . The global effect of adaptive dependable provisions on power consumption shall also be investigated in the near future . 5 CONCLUSIONS Focus of this chapter has been approaches that reach fault-tolerance by means of compilers and translators . Such tools are not only used to bring "" syntactic sugar "" and possibly enhance sa and sc : It was shown how compilers can become another important "" place "" where one may place application-level fault-tolerant protocols that operate at the level of the programming language through so-called meta-object protocols . The reader is also provided of what we consider to be a glimpse into the future of our discipline : As cleverly stated by Torres-Pomales , "" we use computer languages to try to capture the essence of software , but the concepts are so intricate that they generally defy attempts to completely visualize them in a practical manner and require the use of techniques to simplify relationships and enable communication among designers . "" ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) This is exactly the starting point of the approaches based on introspection . It is our belief that such approaches , combined with knowledge management , semantic processing , and service orientation , may provide us with an important tool to deal effectively with software complexity .

Also in this case a significant part of the complexity of dependability enforcement is moved from each single code to the architecture , in this case the programming language . Many cases exist of fault-tolerance programming languages ; this chapter proposes a few of them , considering three cases : Object-oriented languages , functional languages , and hybrid languages . In particular it is discussed the case of Oz , a multi-paradigm programming language that achieves both transparent distribution and translucent failure handling . 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING CUSTOM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES Another approach is given by working at language level enhancing a pre-existing programming language or developing an ad hoc distributed programming language so that it hosts specific fault-tolerance provisions . The following two sections cover these topics . 2.1 2.1.1 Object-oriented approaches The Arjuna Distributed Programming System Arjuna ( Arjuna Technologies , ltd . ) is an object-oriented system for portable distributed programming in C ++ ( Shrivastava , 1995 ) . It can be considered as a clever blending of useful and widespread tools , techniques , and ideas – as such , it is a good example of the evolutionary approach towards application-level software fault-tolerance . It exploits remote procedure calls ( Birrell & Nelson , 1984 ) and UNIX daemons ( Haviland & Salama , 1987 ) . On each node of the system an object server connects client objects to objects supplying services . The object server also takes care of spawning objects when they are not yet running ( in this case they are referred to as "" passive objects "" ) . Arjuna also exploits a "" naming service "" , by means of which client objects request a service "" by name "" . This transparency effectively supports object migration and replication . Arjuna offers the programmer means for dealing with atomic actions ( via the two-phase commit protocol ) and persistent objects . Unfortunately , it requires the programmers to explicitly deal with tools to save and restore the state , to manage locks , and to declare in their applications instances of the class for managing atomic actions . As its authors state , in many respects Arjuna asks the programmer to be aware of several complexities – as such , it is prejudicial to transparency and separation of design concerns ( insufficient sc ) . On the other hand , its good design choices result in an effective , portable environment . Arjuna provides the programmer with "" a computation model in which application programs manipulate persistent objects under the control of atomic actions "" ( Shrivastava , 1995 ) . This concise definition reflects the opinions of many fault-tolerance language designers , that is , that coupling the object and atomic action model with object persistency provides a good solution to designing fault-tolerant systems . In Arjuna a failure appears to the programmer as a persistent object becoming unavailable . Actual reasons for this event may be e.g. a crash of the object repository , or a network partitioning . Accordingly , avoiding failures in Arjuna is achieved by any method directed to increasing the availability of its objects . The main approach used for this in Arjuna is object replication . Like in any replication scheme , clearly this calls for consistency protocols among the replicas . As mentioned above , Arjuna uses an object server to turn passive objects into active ones , when a reference to any such object is detected in the system . Binding is the name of the operation that creates a local instance of any valid Arjuna object and creates one such reference . The object server then attaches the latest ( committed ) state of the named object to the local instance . An example ( from the cited reference ) follows : { / * scope of o1 , o2 and act is between the C ++ block ( "" automatic variables "" ) * / MyArjunaObject o1 ( Name-A ) ; / * o1 is bound to object whose global name is "" A "" * / MySecondArjunaObject o2 ( Name-B ) ; / * o2 to "" B "" * / AtomicAction act ; / * o1 and o2 will be used in atomic action act * / act . Begin ( ) ; / * act starts * / o1 . method1 ( ... ) ; o2 . method1 ( ... ) ; / * invocations , possibly changing state of o1 and o2 * o2 . method2 ( ... ) ; ....... act . End ( ) ; / * act commits : if successful , "" A "" and "" B "" get updated } / * o1 and o2 are deallocated , which breaks bindings to A and B * / As it is often the case for ALFT based on programming languages , Arjuna builds on top of a few design axioms that determine its effectiveness but also limit its general usability . Hence sa is assessed as "" average "" . No support for adaptivity exists , though transparency replication could have been exploited to reach a better a ( limited / potentially good ) . 2.1.2 Programming languages based on Compositional Filters Composition Filters ( CF ) are a concept developed and explored at the University of Twente , The Netherlands . Originally CF were embedded into a custom programming language called Sina . Later the concept was enucleated from Sina and made available as extensions to existing languages such as C ++ ( Glandrup , 1995 ) or Java ( Wichman , 1999 ) . The latter reference provides a very nice and clear metaphor explaining what CF are . In what follows the main reference is ( Wichman , 1999 ) and the Java implementation of composition filters , ComposeJ . Composition filters allow extending the object oriented model with the possibility to model concerns such as coordinated behavior , dynamic inheritance , delegation and multiple interfaces / views in a reusable , extensible and adaptable way . The main idea is that of introducing input and output filters , i.e. components that intercept and manipulate message transmission and reception . An input filter set filters incoming messages and an output filter set filters outgoing messages . Filters in a filter set orderly evaluate and possibly manipulate the messages before passing them to the target object . All messages sent to the object have to pass its input filter set . All messages sent by the object have to pass its output filter set . A special object ( the filter object ) provides the filters as its methods , which are not publicly available to the filtered object . Filter set are like a block of selection statements : An ordered cascade of conditions , each of which checks whether the incoming message belongs or not to some category . If so , the message is intercepted ( "" accepted "" , in the CF lingo ) and processed . As a consequence of this processing , the message may change . Then the message is passed to the next filter in the set and this goes on until the last filter in the set is encountered . A message that is not accepted by the last filter raises an exception . Clearly this procedure can be added to any hosting language , as it is a procedural addition that has no impact on the language grammar . The input and output filter set are declared within a class through the inputfilters and outputfilters keywords , for instance , inputfilters filter1 : Error = .. ( will be explained shortly ) filter2 : Dispatch = ( will be explained shortly ) The general structure of a filter element is FilterName : FilterType = Conditions ConclusionOperator MatchingPattern Parameters "" Conditions "" is a Boolean that rejects the message when false . If true , the second and the third sections come into play : if "" ConclusionOperator "" is an inclusion , represented by ' = > ' , then one accepts all messages that verify the matching pattern ; if it is an exclusion , represented by ' ~ > ' , then one accepts all message that did not verify a previous inclusion operator . "" Parameters "" is an optional section that depends on the filter being used . If a message is accepted , the filter 's accept handler is executed , otherwise the next filter element is evaluated . If there are no more elements left in the current filter , the filter's reject handler is executed . Filters belong to different types : • Dispatch : any accepted message is delegated to one or more objects ; rejected messages go to the next filter in the set . • Error : any accepted message does to next filter ; rejected ones raise an exception . • Substitution : the accepted message is substituted with another one as specified in section "" Parameters "" ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Send : accepted messages are passed to any object ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Meta : any accepted message is reified and delegated to a "" meta-object "" ( that is , an object describing and monitoring the behavior of another object ) ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Wait : accepted messages go to the next filter , while rejected ones are blocked until a certain condition is met – which is clearly useful for concurrency control and synchronization . For the sake of brevity these filters shall not be discussed in detail , but it is clear that they have the potential to compose powerful fault-tolerance mechanisms based , e.g. , on replication and reflection . As an example , a Dispatch input filter could be used to redirect an input message to several replicas , while a Substitution or a Meta filter could be used to do voting among the output objects produced by the replicas ; a Wait filter could make sure that all replicas synchronize , and so forth . Composition Filters and Aspect Oriented Programming ( described in Chapter 7 ) have many points in common , as they represent two paths towards reaching similar goals , e.g. , separation of concerns . The main difference between the two approaches is in the fact that Composition Filters work on a per object basis , while AOP languages provide a system-wide ( application-wide ) specification which is integrated with the class hierarchies by means of a pre-processor ( the aspect weaver , see Chapter 7 ) . Composition Filters provide "" by construction "" , so to say , excellent sc . As it is often the case in this category of fault-tolerance provisions , sa is limited to those fault-tolerance techniques that can be expressed in terms of composition filters ( average sa ) . All CF implementations we are aware of work at compile-time , which impacts negatively on a . 2.1.3 FT-SR FT-SR ( Schlichting & Thomas , 1995 ) is basically an attempt to augment the SR ( Andrews & Olsson , 1993 ) distributed programming language with mechanisms to facilitate fault-tolerance . FT-SR is based on the concept of fail-stop modules ( FSM ) . A FSM is defined as an abstract unit of encapsulation . It consists of a number of threads that export a number of operations to other FSMs . The execution of operations is atomic . FSM can be composed so to give rise to complex FSMs . For instance it is possible to replicate a module n > 1 times and set up a complex FSM that can survive to n − 1 failures . Whenever a failure exhausts the redundancy of a FSM , be that a simple or complex FSM , a failure notification is automatically sent to a number of other FSMs so to trigger proper recovery actions . This feature explains the name of FSM : as in fail-stop processors , either the system is correct or a notification is sent and the system stops its functions . This means that the computing model of FT-SR guarantees , to some extent , that in the absence of explicit failure notification , commands can be assumed to have been processed correctly . This greatly simplifies program development because it masks the occurrence of faults , offers guarantees that no erroneous results are produced , and encourages the design of complex , possibly dynamic failure semantics ( see Chapter 1 ) based on failure notifications . Of course this strategy is fully effective only under the hypothesis of perfect failure detection coverage – an assumption that sometimes may be found to be false . FT-SR exloits much of the expressive power of SR to offer fault-tolerance to the programmer ; the only additions added by FT-SR are : • Automatic generation of failure notifications , when a resource is destroyed due to failure or explicit termination , and • so-called higher-level fail-stop atomic objects . Automatic generation of failure notifications . In FT-SR a failure is detected by the language runtime system . The focus herein is on the ways the application programmer instructs a notification . FT-SR offers so-called synchronous and asynchronous failure notifications : • Synchronous notification is one that is attached to a method's invocation and specifies a backup method to be executed as soon as the primary has been detected as failed . This is done very simply from the point of view of the programmer : He or she has just to add the identifier of the backup method , as in call { task1 . primary , task2 . backup } . • Asynchronous failure notifications are used when one wants to make sure that , whenever a certain condition takes place during a certain time interval , a given "" alarm "" or reactive measure will be instructed . This is specified by issuing the monitor statement , as in monitor task1 send task2 ( arguments ) , after which the FT-SR run-time executive starts monitoring task1 with task2 ( arguments ) as reactive measure . This mean that , in case task1 fails during monitoring , method task2 ( arguments ) is implicitly invoked with the current value of its arguments . Higher-level fail-stop atomic objects . FT-SR makes use of replication and error recovery techniques to build more complex fault-tolerance mechanisms ( Schlichting & Thomas , 1992 ) . Replication is used to create a group of replicated resources that appear to the user as a single , more resilient or more performant resource . A similar concept has been adopted in Ariel for tasks ( see Chapter 6 ) . Replication is available to the FT-SR programmer through the create statement – an augmented version of the SR statement with the same name . As an example , task1_cap : = create ( i : = 1 to N ) task2 ( ) on remote_node_caps [ i ] creates a replicated task consisting of N replicas of task2 , with replica i to be executed on the processing node specified in remote_node_caps [ i ] . Once the replicated task is created , all operations to that task are managed accordingly : Sending messages becomes a multicast and the same applies for invoking methods . The system guarantees consistent total order , but the programmer can choose otherwise . Sending is managed through atomic broadcast . When performing a call to a method in a replicated task , it is the run-time system that makes sure that only a single result is returned to the caller . No voting is done by the run-time system in this case : the failure semantic assumptions of fail-silent processes allows the system to just return the first result becoming available . Another important feature offered by FT-SR is restartability – the ability to instruct the automatic restart of a failed entity in a healthier location of the system's . The syntax for doing so is very simple : restart entity on somewhere_else . The entity may be replicated , in which case the programmer can make use of a syntax similar to that of create : restart ( i : = 1 to N ) task2 ( ) on remote_node_caps [ i ] . Restarted FT-SR entities are not ... restarted from scratch : they retain their state – a useful property which is not available , e.g. , with the RESTART recovery code of Ariel ( again , see Chapter 6 for more details on Ariel ) . Finally , FT-SR offers persistency ( also called "" implicit restart "" by its authors ) : any entity tagged with the persistent attribute when declared is automatically restarted on any of a certain number of backup nodes ( "" backup virtual machines "" in FT-SR lingo ) . This allows to compose easily a stable storage resource , which in turn is an important requirement to build even more complex and advanced fault-tolerance protocols . FT-SR places fault-tolerance in the foreground of system design , which translates in bad sc . It offers several constructs , with sufficient sa . No support for a is part of the language . 2.1.4 ARGUS Argus ( Liskov , 1988 ) is a distributed object-oriented programming language and operating system . Argus was designed to support application programs like banking systems . To capture the object-oriented nature of such programs , it provides a special kind of objects , called guardians , which perform user-definable actions in response to remote requests . To solve the problems of concurrency and failures , Argus allows computations to run as atomic transactions . Argus' target application domain is clearly the one of transaction processing . Like in Arjuna , Argus builds on top of a few fault-tolerance design axioms , which limits Argus' sa . Explicit , non-transparent support translates in insufficient sc . No support for adaptivity has been foreseen in Argus . 2.1.5 The Correlate Language The Correlate object-oriented language ( Robben , 1999 ) adopts the concept of active object , defined as an object that has control over the synchronization of incoming requests from other objects . Objects are active in the sense that they do not process immediately their requests – they may decide to delay a request until it is accepted , i.e. , until a given precondition ( a guard ) is met – for instance , a mailbox object may refuse a new message in its buffer until an entry becomes available in it . The precondition is a function of the state of the object and the invocation parameters – it does not imply interaction with other objects and has no side effects . If a request can not be served according to an object's precondition , it is saved into a buffer until it becomes servable , or until the object is destroyed . Conditions like an overflow in the request buffer are not dealt with in ( Robben , 1999 ) . If more than a single request becomes servable by an object , the choice is made non-deterministically . Correlate uses a communication model called "" pattern-based group communication "" – communication goes from an "" advertising object "" to those objects that declare their "" interest "" in the advertised subject . This is similar to Linda's model of generative communication , introduced in Chapter 4 . Objects in Correlate are autonomous , in the sense that they may not only react to external stimuli but also give rise to autonomous operations motivated by an internal "" goal "" . When invoking a method , the programmer can choose to block until the method is fully executed ( this is called synchronous interaction ) , or to execute it "" in the background "" ( asynchronous interaction ) . Correlate supports meta-object protocols . It has been effectively used to offer transparent support for transaction , replication , and checkpoint-and-rollback . The first implementation of Correlate consists of a translator to plain Java plus an execution environment , also written in Java . Correlate bears several similarities with Composition Filters and reaches the same values of the structural attributes . 2.1.6 Fragmented Objects Fragmented Objects ( FO ) are an extension of objects for distributed environments ( Makpangou , Gourhant , Narzul , & Shapiro , 1994 ) . FO do not reside integrally in one processing node , but are decomposed into chunks called "" fragments "" , consisting of data and methods , which may reside on different nodes . The logics for the distribution of fragments is part of the objects themselves . The client of a FO must have access to at least one fragment . FO offer an abstract view and a concrete view : In the abstract view they appear as a single , shared object . In the concrete view , the designer can decompose the objects into fragments and can deploy them on different machines . He or she may also control the communications among fragments . All these aspects are specified through a custom programming language , FOG ( an extension of C ++ ) , a toolbox , and a compiler also responsible for object serialization . The key aspect of FO with respect to dependability is the full transparency that they provide their users with : In particular there is no way to distinguish between a local object and a local fragment . This paves the way to the transparent adoption of dependability methods based on replication and reconfiguration ( Reiser , Kapitza , Domaschka , & Hauck , 2006 ) . In particular the amount of redundancy used could be made adaptively tracking the current disturbances – with an approach similar to the redundant variables described in Chapter 4 . This translates in potentially good a . Also sc is good in FO , due to the ingenious separation between abstract and concrete views . sa appears to be somewhat limited due to specifics of the approach . The interest around FO has never abated – examples include the adaptive fragmented objects of FORMI ( Kapitza , Domaschka , Hauck , Reiser , & Schmidt , 2006 ) . 2.2 2.2.1 Functional Languages Fault-Tolerance Attribute Grammars The system models for application-level software fault-tolerance encountered so far all have their basis in an imperative language . A different research trend exists , which is based on the use of functional languages . This choice translates in a program structure that allows a straightforward inclusion of fault-tolerance means , with high degrees of transparency and flexibility . Functional models that appear particularly interesting as system structures for software fault-tolerance are those based on the concept of attribute grammars ( Paakki , 1995 ) . This paragraph briefly introduces the model known as FTAG ( fault-tolerant attribute grammars ) ( Suzuki , Katayama , & Schlichting , 1996 ) , which offers the designer a large set of fault-tolerance mechanisms . A noteworthy aspect of FTAG is that its authors explicitly address the problem of providing a syntactical model for the widest possible set of fault-tolerance provisions and paradigms , developing coherent abstractions of those mechanisms while maintaining the linguistic integrity of the adopted notation . This means that optimizing the value of attribute sa is one of the design goals of FTAG . FTAG regards a computation as a collection of pure mathematical functions known as modules . Each module has a set of input values , called inherited attributes , and of output variables , called synthesized attributes . Modules may refer to other modules . When modules do not refer any other module , they can be performed immediately . Such modules are called primitive modules . On the other hand , non-primitive modules require other modules to be performed first – as a consequence , an FTAG program is executed by decomposing a "" root "" module into its basic submodules and then applying recursively this decomposition process to each of the submodules . This process goes on until all primitive modules are encountered and executed . The execution graph is clearly a tree called computation tree . This scheme presents many benefits , e.g. , as the order in which modules are decomposed is exclusively determined by attribute dependencies among submodules , a computation tree can be mapped onto a parallel processing means straightforwardly . The linguistic structure of FTAG allows the integration of a number of useful fault-tolerance features that address the whole range of faults – design , physical , and interaction faults . One of these features is called redoing . Redoing replaces a portion of the computation tree with a new computation . This is useful for instance to eliminate the effects of a portion of the computation tree that has generated an incorrect result , or whose executor has crashed . It can be used to implement easily "" retry blocks "" and recovery blocks by adding ancillary modules that test whether the original module behaved consistently with its specification and , if not , give rise to a "" redoing "" , a recursive call to the original module . Another relevant feature of FTAG is its support for replication , a concept that in FTAG translates into a decomposition of a module into N identical submodules implementing the function to replicate . The scheme is known as replicated decomposition , while involved submodules are called replicas . Replicas are executed according to the usual rules of decomposition , though only one of the generated results is used as the output of the original module . Depending on the chosen fault-tolerance strategy , this output can be , e.g. , the first valid output or the output of a demultiplexing function , e.g. , a voter . It is worth remarking that no syntactical changes are needed , only a subtle extension of the interpretation so to allow the involved submodules to have the same set of inherited attributes and to generate a collated set of synthesized attributes . FTAG stores its attributes in a stable object base or in primary memory depending on their criticality – critical attributes can then be transparently retrieved from the stable object base after a failure . Object versioning is also used , a concept that facilitates the development of checkpoint-and-rollback strategies . FTAG provides a unified linguistic structure that effectively supports the development of fault-tolerant software . Conscious of the importance of supporting the widest possible set of fault-tolerance means , its authors report in the cited paper how they are investigating the inclusion of other fault-tolerance features and trying to synthesize new expressive syntactical structures for FTAG – thus further improving attribute sa . FTAG also exhibits "" by construction "" a good separation of concerns ( sc ) . No support for a is known to exist for FTAG . Unfortunately , the widespread adoption of this valuable tool is conditioned by the limited acceptance and spread of the functional programming paradigm outside the academia . 2.3 A Hybrid Case : Oz Oz is defined by its authors as "" a multiparadigm programming language "" . The main reasons for that is that Oz offers , by construction , several features common to programming paradigms such as logic , functional , imperative , and object-oriented programming . Another important feature of Oz is that it provides the programmer with a network-transparent distributed programming model that facilitates considerably the development of distributed fault-tolerant applications . The Oz programming system , called Mozart , was designed by the so-called Mozart Consortium . Thanks to its rich model , Oz allows to solve , to some extent , the transparency conundrum of distributed computing : Indeed distributed computing approaches either choose to mask all complexity providing an illusion of a fully synchronous system where all failures and disruptions are masked , or go for a fully translucent system where everything is made known and reflected onto the system controller . Oz solves this and shows that "" network transparency is not incompatible with entity failure reflection "" ( Collet & Mejı ́ as , 2007 ) . The idea is that the language gives the illusion of a single memory space shared by distributed processing nodes called sites . Full transparency is achieved for this : It is simply not possible to tell whether a method or an entity is local or distributed . But this is not true for all aspects of distribution – in particular , site crashes and partial failures are made translucent and reflected in the language . The mechanism offered by Oz to handle partial failures is asynchronous failure detectors , managed through failure listeners : All entities produce streams of events that reflect the sequential occurrence of their fault states . Any Oz task can become a failure listener , that is , it can hook to such streams and be informed of all the faults experienced by any other tasks . This means that fault detection is intrinsically managed by Oz and Mozart . Error recovery can then be managed by guarded actions , a little like in ariel , the error recovery language described in next chapter . This facilitates considerably the development of asynchronous failure detectors with one of the algorithms described in Chapter 8 . The trade off between transparency and translucency in Oz leads to a satisfactory sc . Its multiparadigmic nature should translate in a good score for sa , though no concrete evidence to this appears to exist . Oz has been used to express adaptive control loops ( Van Roy , 2006 ) for self-management , so it proved to exhibit good a . 3 CONCLUSION Several examples of fault-tolerance protocols embedded in custom programming languages have been shown . This class of methods can achieve satisfactory degrees of sc . The language designer has the widest syntactic freedom which is necessary to achieve good values of sa , but often , as a result of the design choices , the programmer is confined to a limited amount of possibilities . Attribute a depends on specific characteristics of the language , e.g. being able to select dynamically the error recovery strategy when the environment and its faults change . Most of the programming languages discussed so far is not being supported anymore , a noteworthy exception being Oz , whose most widespread platform , Mozart , is a strategic research path at the University of Louvain-la-neuve , Belgium . Next chapter is devoted to a special case of a fault-tolerance programming language : The ariel error recovery language . References Andrews , G. R. , & Olsson , L. L. ( 1993 ) .

It is also described an approach towards resilient computing based on ariel and therefore dubbed the "" recovery language approach "" ( RεL ) . In this chapter first the main elements of RεL are introduced in general terms , coupling each concept to the technical foundations behind it . After this a quite extensive description of ariel and of a compliant architecture are provided . Target applications for such architecture are distributed codes , characterized by non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language such as C , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a predefined ( fixed ) set of processing nodes . Reason for giving special emphasis to ariel and its approach is not in their special qualities but more on the fact that , due to the first-hand experience of the author , who conceived , designed and implemented ariel in the course of his studies , it was possible for him to provide the reader with what may be considered as a sort of practical exercise in system and fault modeling and in application-level fault-tolerance design , recalling and applying several of the concepts introduced in previous chapters . 2 THE ARIEL RECOVERY LANGUAGE This section casts the basis of a general approach in abstract terms , while a particular instance of the herein presented concepts is described in Section 3 as a prototypic distributed architecture supporting a fault-tolerance linguistic structure for application-level fault-tolerance . System and fault models are drawn . The approach is also reviewed with respect to the structural attributes ( sc , sa and a ) and to the approaches presented in Chapter 3 , 5 , and 6 . The structure of this section is as follows : • Models are introduced in Sect . 2.1 . • Key ideas , concepts , and technical foundations are described in Sect . 2.2 . • Section 2.4 shows the workflow corresponding to using RεL . • Sect . 2.5 summarizes the positive values of the structural attributes sa , sc , and a for RεL . 2.1 System and Fault Models This section introduces the system and fault models that will be assumed in the rest of this chapter . 2.1.1 System Assumptions In the following , the target system is assumed to be a distributed or parallel system . Basic components are nodes , tasks , and the network . • A node can be , e.g. , a workstation in a networked cluster or a processor in a MIMD parallel computer . • Tasks are independent threads of execution running on the nodes . • The network system allows tasks on different nodes to communicate with each other . Nodes can be commercial-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) hardware components with no special provisions for hardware fault-tolerance . It is not mandatory to have memory management units and secondary storage devices . A general-purpose operating system is required on each node . No special purpose , distributed , or fault-tolerant operating system is required . The number N of nodes is assumed to be known at compile time . Nodes are addressable by the integers in { 0 , ... , N − 1 } . For any integer m > 0 let us call the set of integers { 0 , ... , m − 1 } as Im . Let us furthermore refer to the node addressed by integer i as ni , i in IN . Tasks are pre-defined at compile-time : in particular for each i in IN , it is known that node ni is to run ti tasks , up to a given node-specific limit . No special constraints are posed on the task scheduling policy . On each node , say node i , tasks are identified by user-defined unique local labels – integers greater than or equal to zero . Let us call Ini the set of labels for tasks to be run on node ni , i in IN . The task with local label j on node i will be also referred to as ni [ j ] . The system obeys the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) already introduced in Chapter 2 . As already mentioned , such model allows a straightforward modeling of system partitioning – as a consequence of sufficiently many omission or performance communication failures , correct nodes may be temporarily disconnected from the rest of the system during so-called "" periods of instability "" ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) . Moreover it is assumed that , at reset , tasks or nodes restart from a well-defined , initial state – partial-amnesia crashes ( defined in Chapter 1 ) are not considered . A message passing library is assumed to be available , built on the datagram service . Such library offers asynchronous , non-blocking multicast primitives . The adoption of a library like ISIS ( see Chapter 3 ) is suggested , in order to inherit the benefits of its reliable multicast primitives . As clearly explained in ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , the above hypotheses match well to nowadays distributed systems based on networked workstations – as such , they represent a general model with no practical restriction . The following assumptions characterize the user application : 1 . ( When N > 1 nodes are available ) : the target application is distributed on the system nodes . 2 . It is written or is to be written in a procedural language such as , e.g. , C or C ++ . 3 . The service specification includes non-safety-critical dependability goals – safety-critical systems may also be addressed , but in this case the crash failure semantics assumption must be supported with a very high coverage ( Mortensen , 2000 ) This would require : • Extensive self-checking ( by means of , e.g. , signature checking , arithmetic coding , control flow monitoring , or dual processors ) . • Statistical estimation of the achieved coverage , by means of proper fault injection . 4 . Inter-process communication takes place by means of the functions in the above mentioned message passing library . Higher-level communication services , if available , must be built atop that message passing library too . The reason behind the third assumption is that , forcing communication through a single virtual provision , namely the functions for sending and for receiving messages , allows a straightforward implementation of mechanisms for task isolation . This concept is explained in more detail in Sect . 3.2.9 . 2.1.2 Fault Model As suggested in Chapter 2 , any effective design including dependability goals requires provisions , located at all levels , to avoid , remove , or tolerate faults . Hence , as an application-level structure , RεL is complementary to other approaches addressing fault-tolerance at system level , i.e. , hardware-level and OS-level fault-tolerance . In particular , a system-level architecture such as GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , that is based on redundancy and hardware and operating system provisions for systematic management of consensus , appears to be particularly appropriate for being coupled with RεL , which offers application-level provisions for NVP and replication ( see later on ) . The main classes of faults addressed by RεL are those of accidental , permanent or temporary design faults , and temporary , external , physical faults . Both value and timing failures are considered . The architecture addresses one fault at a time : The system is ready to deal with new faults only after having recovered from the present one . 2.2 Key Ideas and Technical Foundations The design of RεL tries to capture , by construction , some of the positive aspects of most of the approaches so far surveyed . Some of the key design choices of RεL are : • The adoption of a fault-tolerance toolset . • The separation of the configuration of the toolset from the specification of the functional service . • The separation of the system structure for the specification of the functional service from that for error recovery and reconfiguration . These concepts and their technical foundations are illustrated in the rest of this section . 2.3 Adoption of a Fault-Tolerance Toolset A requirement of RεL is the availability of a fault-tolerance toolset , to be interpreted herein as the conjoint adoption of : • A set of fault-tolerance tools addressing error detection , localisation , containment and recovery , such as the ones in SwIFT ( Huang , Kintala , Bernstein , & Wang , 1996 ) or EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) . As seen in detail in Chapter 3 , fault-tolerance services provided by the toolset include , e.g. , watchdog timers and voting . Such tools are called basic tools ( BT ) in what follows . • A "" basic services library "" ( BSL ) is assumed to be present , providing functions for : – intra-node and remote communication ; – task management ; – access to the local clock ; – application-level assertions ; – functions to reboot or shut down a node . This library is required to be available in source code so that it can be instrumented , e.g. , with code to forward information transparently to some collector ( described in what follows ) . Information may include , for instance , the notification of a successful task creation or any failure of this kind . This allows to create fault streams as in Oz ( Chapter 5 ) . If supported , meta-object protocols ( see Chapter 4 ) may also be used to implement the library and its instrumentation . It is also suggested that the functions for sending messages work with opaque objects that reference either single tasks or groups of tasks . In the first case , the function would perform a plain "" send "" , while in the second case it would perform a multicast . This would increase the degree of transparency . • A distributed component serving as a sort of backbone controlling and monitoring the toolset and the user application . Let us call this application "" the Backbone "" . It is assumed that the Backbone has a component on each node of the system and that , through some software ( and , possibly , hardware ) fault-tolerance provisions , it can tolerate crash failures of up to all but one node or component . An application such as the EFTOS DIR net discussed in Chapter 3 may be used for this . Notifications from the BSL and from the BT are assumed to be collected and maintained by the Backbone into a data structure called "" the database "" ( DB ) . The DB therefore holds data related to the current structure and state of the system , the user application , and the Backbone . A special section of the DB is devoted to keeping track of error notifications , such as , for instance , "" divide-by-zero exception caught while executing task 11 "" sent by a trap handling tool like the one discussed in Chapter 3 . If possible , error detection support at hardware or kernel level may be also instrumented in order to provide the Backbone with similar notifications . The DB is assumed to be stored in a reliable storage device , e.g. , a stable storage device , or replicated and protected against corruption or other unwanted modifications . • Following the hypothesis of the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , a time-out management system is also assumed to be available . This allows an application to define time-outs , namely , to schedule an event to be generated a given amount of "" clock ticks "" in the future ( Cristian & Schmuck , 1995 ) . Let us call this component the "" time-out manager "" ( tom ) . A prototype of a RεL-compliant toolset has been developed within the European ESPRIT project "" TIRAN "" . Section 3.2 describes its main components . 2.3.1 Configuration Support Tool The second key component of RεL is a tool to support fault-tolerance configuration , defined herein as the deployment of customized instances of fault-tolerance tools and strategies . RεL envisages a translator to help the user configure the toolset and his / her application . The translator has to support a custom configuration language especially conceived to facilitate configuration and therefore to reduce the probability of fault-tolerance design faults – the main cause of failure for fault-tolerant software systems ( Laprie , 1998 ; Lyu , 1998 ) . As an output , the translator could issue , e.g. , C or C ++ header files defining configured objects and symbolic constants to refer easily to the configured objects . Recompilation of the target application is therefore required after each execution of the translator . Configuration can group a number of activities , including : • Configuration of system and application entities , • configuration of the basic tools , • configuration of replicated tasks , • configuration for retry blocks , • configuration for multiple-version software fault-tolerance . The above configuration activities are now briefly described . 2.3.2 Configuration of System and Application Entities One of the tasks of a configuration language is to declare the key entities of the system and to define a global naming scheme in order to refer to them . Key entities are nodes , tasks , and groups of tasks . For each node ni , 0 < = i < N and for each task ni [ j ] , 0 < = j < Ini , a unique , global-scope identifier must be defined by the user . Let us call this identifier the task's unique-id . This can be done by editing a configuration script with rules of the form taskt = ni [ j ] , ( 1 ) which assigns unique-id t to ni [ j ] , that is , task number j on node i . Similarly one could define groups of task with rules of the form groupg = { u } , ( 2 ) where u is a list of comma-separated integers representing unique-ids . Such rule defines then a group named g and made of the tasks corresponding to the mentioned unique-ids . The translator would then turn a configuration script containing rules of this kind into a header file to be compiled with the target application and , if necessary , in configuration files expected by the toolset . 2.3.3 Configuration of the Fault-Tolerance Tools in the Toolset Specific instances of the tools in the toolset can be statically configured by means of the translator . For instance , in the case of a watchdog timer , configuration can specify : • The unique-id of the watching task as well as that of the watched task . • The initial expected frequency of "" heartbeats "" to be sent from the watched task to the watchdog . • The actions to be taken when an expected heartbeat is not received in time , and so forth . As an example , a watchdog timer may be configured in high level terms as follows : WATCHDOG TASK 10 WATCHES TASK 14 HEARTBEATS EVERY 100 MS ON ERROR WARN TASK 18 END WATCHDOG Ideally , the output of the translator should be a configuration file for the BSL to associate transparently the creation of the configured instance of the watchdog to the creation of the watched task . Doing like this , the only non-functional code to be intruded in the watched task can be the function call corresponding to sending the heartbeat to the watchdog . A generic "" HEARTBEAT "" method , with no arguments , can be used . This can be a symbolic name properly defined in a header file written by the translator and automatically included when compiling the user application . Even when instrumenting is not possible , the watched task can start the watchdog by means of a symbolic name properly defined in the above mentioned header file . This kind of translations can be applied to most of the tools of a library such as SwIFT or EFTOS that have been described in Chapter 3 . Note how the minimal or absent code intrusion provides an optimal sc . The adoption of a custom , ad hoc language for the expression of the configuration concerns can be used to reach high values for sa and compile-time a . Configuration of Replicated Tasks . The translator and the BSL may be used to implement replicated tasks , i.e. , multiple instances of the same task that perform like a more dependable entity . The goal of the translator is to mask this choice and any other fault-tolerance technicalities , including , in this specific case , replication . This can be obtained , e.g. , by solving separately the following sub-problems , both at syntactical and at semantic level : 1 . Replication and forwarding of the input value . 2 . Execution support of a fault-tolerance strategy . 3 . Output management . Problem 1 can be solved by defining a group-of-tasks object that , once passed to the BSL function for sending messages , triggers a multicast of the same message to the whole group , as suggested in Sect . 2.3.2 . Problem 2 can be solved in various ways – for instance , through a temporal redundancy scheme , executing the involved tasks one after the other , on the same node , or via spatial redundancy , executing tasks in parallel . Increased dependability may be obtained via a number of software techniques , implementing schemes such as active replication or primary-backup replication ( Guerraoui & Schiper , 1997 ) . As noticed in the cited paper , each scheme has both positive and negative aspects and requires solving specific problems . All these problems are low-level design issues that can be made transparent to the user of an RεL system . Other choices and options , e.g. , which type and degree of replication and which redundancy scheme to adopt , that would result in non-functional code intrusion , can be also made transparent to the user by means of the translator ( see Sect . 2.3.3 ) , hence increasing configurability . Problem 3 , depending on the adopted scheme , can be as simple as sending a message ( when in primary-backups mode ) or could require special processing . For instance , in the case of active replication , two sub-problems would call for specific treatment : 3.1 . Routing the outputs produced by the base tasks . 3.2 . De-multiplexing , i.e. , production of a unique output value from the values routed in sub-problem 3.1 . Sub-problem 3.1 can be solved , e.g. , by a proper combination of pipelining and redirection . Other approaches may be used when the OS does not support the above tools . De-multiplexing , i.e. , solution of sub-problem 3.2 , can be for instance the result of a voting procedure performed among the outputs produced by the base tasks . Also in this case , the availability of a translator and an appropriate syntax rule could guarantee an almost complete separation of design concerns . The configuration of a replicated task requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task globally representing a set of replicas . • The unique-ids of the replicas . • The replication method and its parameters . • The actions to be taken when an output is produced by the replicated task . • The actions to be taken when an error occurs . In the case of replicated tasks , the translator is also responsible for the set up of a proper run-time executive . The latter would then be responsible , at run-time , for the orchestration of the services required by the replicated tasks – task management , distributed voting , and so forth . Proper calls to the BSL and to instances of the basic tools may be used for this . A voting tool such as the EFTOS voting farm , described in Chapter 3 , appears to be a natural choice , as it addresses many of the required issues . It is worth noting how , also in this case , full transparency is reached : A client of a replicated task would have no way to tell whether its server be simple or replicated – possibly apart from some performance penalty and a higher quality of service . This translates into optimal sc . The same applies to sa and a for the reasons mentioned in Sect . 2.3.3 . Configuration for Retry Blocks . Transparent support for redoing ( see e.g. language FTAG in Chapter 5 ) – another important fault-tolerance provisions – can be provided via "" retry blocks "" . Again , a proper run-time executive is to be produced by the translator . The problems to be solved at this level include 1 . reversibility of a failed task and 2 . input replication . The first problem can be solved by implementing some "" recovery cache "" ( as in the recovery block technique described in Chapter 3 ) : That is a mechanism to checkpoint the state of the calling task before entering the retry block and to roll it back to its original value in case the acceptance test fails . This may be done transparently or with the intervention of the user . In the latter case , one restricts the size of the recovery cache and reduces the corresponding overheads , at the same time increasing the code intrusion . The second problem could be solved via an "" input cache "" , i.e. , a mechanism that : • Intercepts the original input message . • Stores the original message into some stable means . • And forwards the saved original message to each new retry instance . Transparent adoption of an input cache can also be realized , e.g. , by means of pipelining and redirection ( when the OS supports these ) . The configuration of a retry block requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task to be retried in case of errors . • An acceptance test , in the form of the name of a function returning a Boolean value or of a task that , upon termination , returns a Boolean value2 . • A threshold r representing the maximum number of retries . • The actions to be taken when the base task fails for r times in a row . Configuration for Multiple-Version Software Fault-Tolerance . Compile-time support towards multiple-version software fault-tolerance can be provided by the translator through syntax rules and techniques similar to those described for task replication . The configuration of a provision for MV requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task representing the provision . • The unique-id 's of the tasks running the versions . • A set of thresholds representing time-outs on the execution of the version tasks3 . • The name of the user-specified function to be executed by each version task . • A method to de-multiplex the multiple outputs produced by the versions into a single output value . • Possible arguments to the de-multiplexing method . • The unique-id of a task to be notified each time an execution cycle is successfully completed . • The unique-id of a task to be notified each time an execution cycle fails . Support towards consensus recovery blocks ( Scott , Gault , & McAllister , 1985 ) may be provided in a similar way . Acceptance tests should be specified as described in Sect . 2.3.3 . An Example Scenario and Some Conclusions . A possible compile-time and run-time scenario is now described for the case of the configuration of multiple-version software fault-tolerance . This is done in order to provide the reader with a more concrete view of the kind of support supplied by a configuration language . It is assumed that the OS supports pipelining and stream redirection . It is also assumed that , by agreement , the user tasks that are going to be used as NVP versions forward a single output value onto the standard output stream . Finally , user tasks are assumed to be side effect-free . Once fed with a configuration script , the translator writes a number of source files for the tasks corresponding to the employed versions . Each of these source files , set up from some template file , specify how to : • Set up a configured instance of a distributed voting tool ( such as the EFTOS voting farm ) . • Redirect standard output streams . • Execute one of the version tasks . During the execution , when a client needs to access a service supplied by the provisions , it simply sends a request message to the corresponding task . The client does not need to know that the latter is actually an "" NVP task "" , that is , a group . Through the BSL , this sending turns into a multicast to the version tasks . These tasks , which in the meanwhile have transparently set up a distributing voting tool , • get their input , • compute some user-specified function , • produce an output , • and ( by the above agreement ) write that output into their standard output stream . This output , which was already redirected through a piped stream to the template task , is fed into the voting system . The latter eventually produces an output that , in case of success , is sent to some output task with the notification of successful completion of a processing cycle . Note that the client task of such an "" NVP task "" is completely unaware of the context in which it is running , with full transparency and separation of design concern . One can conclude that the adoption of a configuration strategy like the one just sketched can lead to an optimal sc . The variety of fault-tolerance provisions that can be supported by configuration and the adoption of a linguistic environment separated from the functional application layer can be exploited by programming language designers in order to attain optimal values for sa and a as well . 2.3.4 Recovery Languages Two of the three key concepts of RεL have been described , namely the adoption of a fault-tolerance toolset and that of a configuration language . This section now introduces the third component of RεL . This component supports two application layers , namely : • The functional application layer , i.e. , the one devoted to the fulfillment of the functional requirements and to the specification of an intended user service , supported by the run-time modules of conventional programming languages such as , e.g. , C or C ++ . • An ancillary application layer , specifically devoted to error processing and fault identification , to be switched in either asynchronously , when errors are detected in the system , or when the user synchronously signals particular run-time conditions , such as a failed assertion , or when the control flow runs into user-defined breakpoints . In the following the service language is the language constituting the front layer and recovery language the one related to error processing . Note how a recovery language can be specified in a separate script . The latter can then be translated into pseudo-code to be interpreted at run-time , or , e.g. , into plain C to be compiled with the user application . In the first case , the functional code and the recovery code are fully separated , also at run-time , which can be exploited to reach optimal a and to extend or reduce the set of faults to be tolerated . This feature could be used to realize the vision of a fault model structured as a dynamic system , F ( t ) , as described in Chapter 2 . The second case eliminates the overhead of interpreting the pseudo-code . The same translator used for fault-tolerance configuration may be used to generate the pseudo-code or the C source code . The general strategy is as follows : • During the lifetime of the application , in the absence of errors , the front layer controls the progress of the service supply while the Backbone collects and maintains in the DB the data concerning the state of each component of the application , the state of each node of the system , the state and progress of public and private resources , and so forth . • As soon as an error is detected by a basic tool , such as a watchdog timer , the latter transparently forwards a notification of this event to the Backbone , which awakes the ancillary layer by enabling a module to interpret or execute the recovery code . Let us call this module RINT , for recovery interpreter . A possible syntactical structure for the recovery language is that of a list of guarded actions , i.e. , statements in the form g : a , where g is a guard , i.e. , a Boolean expression on the contents of the DB , and a is one or more actions ( to be specified later on ) . Hence , adequate paradigms for the recovery language could be that of procedural or logic programming languages . The following two paragraphs describe guards and actions in more detail . Guards represent conditions that require recovery . As just said , they are Boolean expressions made of basic queries called atoms . Possible atoms may express conditions such as : • Task t has been detected as faulty . • Task t has been detected as faulty by error detection tool d . • For m times in a row , task t has been detected as faulty . • A time-out concerning task t has expired . • An N - version task has signaled that no full consensus has been reached , or in more detail : – For m times in a row , the same version , say task t ' , has been found in minority with respect to the other versions ; – for m times in a row , version t ' did not produce any output within its deadline ; – and so forth . • Node n is down , or , in more detail : – Node n has crashed ; – Node n is unreachable ; – No sign of life from node n in the last s seconds , as measured by the local clock ; – and so forth . • Task t could not be restarted ; • Some of the tasks in group g are faulty . and so forth . Most of the atoms in a Boolean clause will require a DB query or proper actions on DB fields – for instance , conditions such as "" task t is affected by a transient fault "" require the adoption , within the DB , of a thresholding statistical technique such as α-count ( Powell et al. , 1999 ; Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 1997 ) , which is capable of distinguishing between transient and permanent / intermittent faults . In particular , α-count ( described in Sect . 3.2.4 ) can be straightforwardly "" wired "" into the DB management system within the Backbone , because that mechanism is based on adjusting some counters according to the contents in a stream of error messages forwarded by a set of error detectors . Actions are local or remote commands to be executed when their guard is evaluated as true . Actions can specify , for instance , recovery or reconfiguration services . A special case of action can be also another guarded action – this allows to have nested guarded actions that can be represented as a tree . The execution of an inner guard is , again , its evaluation . When a parent guard is evaluated as false , all its actions are skipped , including its child guards . Actions can include , for instance : • Switching tasks in and out of a fault-tolerance structure such as , e.g. , an "" NVP task "" ( see Sect . 2.3.3 ) . • Synchronizing groups of tasks . • Isolating4 groups of tasks . • Instructions to roll the execution of a task or a group of tasks back to a previously saved checkpoint , and so forth . Actions have a system-wide scope and are executed on any processing node of the system where a non-faulty component of the Backbone is running . They may include commands to send control signals to specific components of the Backbone or to user tasks . Basic tools such as a distributed voting tool like the EFTOS voting farm ( discussed in Chapter 3 ) can be instructed so that they respond to that signal supplying transparent support towards graceful degradation , task switching , and task migration , as described for instance in ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Furthermore , the ability to distinguish between transient and permanent / intermittent faults can be exploited , in order to avoid unnecessary reconfigurations or other costly or redundancy-consuming actions , attaching different strategies to these two cases .

Labels refer to usage steps and are described in Sect . 2.4 . 2.4 Workflow This section describes the workflow corresponding to the adoption of the RεL approach . Figure 1 summarizes the workflow . The following basic steps have been foreseen : • In the first steps ( labels 1 and 2 in the cited figure ) , the designer describes the key application and system entities , such as tasks , groups of tasks , and nodes . The main tool for this phase is the configuration language . • Next ( step 3 ) , the designer configures the basic tools and the fault-tolerance provisions he / she has decided to use . The configuration language is used for this . The output of steps 1 – 3 is the configuration code . • Next ( step 4 ) , the designer defines what conditions need to be caught , and what actions should follow each caught condition . The resulting list is coded as a number of guarded actions via a recovery language . • The configuration code and the recovery code are then converted via the translator into a set of C header files , C fragments , and system-specific configuration files ( steps 5 and 6 ) . These files represent : configured instances of the basic tools , of the system and of the application ; initialization files for the communication management functions ; user preferences for the backbone ; and the recovery pseudo-code . • On steps 7 – 9 , the application source code and the configured basic tool instances are compiled in order to produce the executable code of the application . • Next , the backbone is compiled on steps 10 – 12 . • Finally , on step 13 , the communication management services of the BSL are configured in order to allow the proper management of multicasting and other communication services . 2.5 Conclusions In this section an approach to application-level software fault-tolerance has been introduced . Such an approach provides its users with a linguistic structure to express application-level error recovery concerns and to configure a number of fault-tolerance provisions outside the functional application layer . The latter can be provided by any procedural language . The RεL approach addresses dependability goals for distributed or parallel applications written in any procedural language . Its target hardware platforms include distributed and parallel computers consisting of a set of processing nodes known at compile time . Within this application and system domain , the novel approach can be qualitatively assessed as reaching optimal values of the structural attributes . In particular , with respect to the application-level software fault-tolerance approaches reviewed in Chapter 3 , 4 , and 5 : • Error recovery is expressed in a separate programming context – thus good sc can be obtained . • The executable code is separable – that is , at run-time , the portion of the executable code devoted to the fault-tolerance aspects is clearly distinct from the functional code . • Run-time adaptability to diverse environmental conditions may be obtained without requiring the entire executable code to be recompiled . This and previous items bring to a good a . • A large number of well-known fault-tolerance strategies are supported in a straightforward way ( i.e. good sa ) . • The RεL approach addresses a wide class of applications : That of distributed applications , with non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a set of processing nodes known at compile time . • Our approach reaches both the benefits of the evolutionary approaches , which base themselves on standards , and those of "" revolutionary "" approaches , exploiting ad-hoc , non-standard solutions . • It can host other provisions and approaches . • As shown in Chapter 9 , in same cases RεL can be adopted with minimal programming effort and minimal adaptation of a pre-existing , non fault-tolerant application . Finally , one can note that the language-based approaches such as those in Chapter 5 differ considerably from RεL . Despite their many positive characteristics , their very axioms – using a custom syntax for both the functional and the fault-tolerance concerns – may restrict significantly their usability . The lack of standards is further detrimental to their diffusion . On the contrary , the choice to support a standard language for the functional aspects and an ad-hoc syntactical structure for the fault-tolerance aspects allows reach optimal sa with no impact on the usability . Next chapter describes a prototype architecture based on the RεL approach . 3 A DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE BASED ON THE RECOVERY LANGUAGE APPROACH This section describes a prototypic architecture based on RεL that has been designed in the context of the European ESPRIT project TIRAN . The structure of the section is as follows : first , project TIRAN is described in Sect . 3.1 . The main components of the TIRAN architecture are covered in Sect . 3.2 . Section 3.2.6 describes the TIRAN configuration and recovery language . Section 5 closes this part and draws a few conclusions . 3.1 The ESPRIT Project TIRAN TIRAN is the name of the European ESPRIT project 28620 . Its name loosely derives from "" Tailorable fault-tolerance frameworks for embedded applications "" ( Botti et al. , 1999 ) . The main objective of TIRAN was to develop a software framework 5 providing fault-tolerant capabilities to automation systems . Application-level support to fault-tolerance was included by means of a RεL architecture , which is described in the rest of this chapter . The framework provides a library of software fault-tolerance provisions that are parametric and support an easy configuration process . TIRAN builds on top of EFTOS , inheriting several of the concepts and tools developed in that project and described in Chapter 3 . Using the TIRAN framework , application developers are allowed to select , configure and integrate provisions for fault masking , error detection , isolation and recovery among those offered by the library . Goal of the TIRAN project was to provide a tool that significantly reduced the development times and costs for dependable systems . TIRAN's target market segment was that of non-safety-critical6 distributed real-time embedded systems ( Botti et al. , 2000 ) . TIRAN explicitly adopted formal techniques to support requirement specification and predictive evaluation . This , together with the intensive testing on pilot applications , was exploited in order to : • Guarantee the correctness of the framework . • Quantify the fulfillment of real-time , dependability and cost requirements . • Provide guidelines to the configuration process of the users . Most of the TIRAN framework was designed for being platform independent . A single version of the framework has been written in the C programming language making use of a BSL designed by the TIRAN consortium and initially developed by one of the partners for the development platform ( Microsoft Windows NT ) . Within TIRAN , a number of target platforms and systems compliant to the model sketched in Sect . 2.1 have been selected . Porting the TIRAN code to these platforms was mainly obtained through the porting of the BSL . As mentioned already , this does not automatically translate in porting the service expected by the BSL ; the latter was obtained by proper verification and validation of its properties on the target platforms . Such platforms included : • A set of Mosaic0207 boards running the Virtuoso microkernel ( Systems , 1998 ; Mosaic020 , 1998 ) . • A set of VME boards based on PowerPC processors and running the VxWorks operating system ( VxWorks , 1999 ) . An MMU is available on these boards , which translates in special hardware support for memory protection . • A set of DEC Alpha boards running the TEX kernel . These boards have no MMU and address spaces of tasks are not protected . Proper protection is guaranteed by TEX , which does not allow any dynamic memory allocation . All addresses are therefore known at compile time , so a preprocessing tool could be used in principle to prevent memory contamination . • Clusters of Windows-CE personal computers ( PCs ) . The final version of the TIRAN framework , running on all the above systems , was demonstrated in November 2000 at the final TIRAN review meeting and at the TIRAN workshop ( Thielemans , 2000 ) . Some elements of the TIRAN framework ( namely those derived from EFTOS ) are also available on Parsytec CC and Parsytec Xplorer systems based on the PowerPC processor and the EPX kernels ( Parsytec , 1996a , 1996b ) and on a proprietary hardware board based on the DEC Alpha chip and running the TEX kernel . The main components of the TIRAN framework are : 1 . The TIRAN toolset , the components of which are discussed in Sect . 3.2 . 2 . The TIRAN configuration and recovery language ariel , described in Sect . 3.2.6 . In particular : • Its translator is dealt with in Sect . 3.2.9 . • The run-time executive of ariel , which is sketched in Sect . 3.2.9 . As mentioned already TIRAN was built on top of ESPRIT project EFTOS – described in full detail in Chapter 3 . In particular TIRAN adopted and improved the EFTOS voting farm ( De Florio et al. , 1998 ) , also described in the mentioned chapter , so as to function as the distributed voting system of the TIRAN framework . Figure 2 draws the TIRAN architecture and locates its main components into it . Two types of edges are used in the picture : • The thinner , directed edge represents relation "" <Sends> "" : If such an edge goes from entity a to entity b then it means that a sends a data message to b or requests a service provided by b through a control message or a method invocation . • The thicker edge is only used between the RINT and ariel entities and means that the former implements the latter through the process of interpreting a pseudo-code called "" r-codes "" ( detailed information about this is available in Sect . 3.2.9 ) . The central , whiter layers represent the TIRAN framework . In particular : • The level 0 hosts the TIRAN BSL , which gives system-independent access to the services provided by the underlying run-time system ( see Sect . 2.3 ) . The user application , the BT , the Backbone , the Time-out Manager , and the dependable mechanisms ( DMs , see Sect . 3.2.3 ) , all make use of the BSL , e.g. , to create tasks or to send messages through mailboxes . • Level 1 services are provided by the BT for error detection and fault masking ( level 1.1 ) and by the BT addressing error isolation , recovery and reconfiguration ( level 1.2 ) . Both services are supplied by node-local ( simplex ) provisions . Section 3.2.1 describes in more detail the BT . The edge from BT to Backbone represents the sending of error detection or diagnostic messages . The edge from Backbone to BT represents control messages , such as , for instance , a request to modify a parameter of a watchdog , or a request to reboot the local node ( see Fig. 4 ) . Figure 2 : A representation of the TIRAN elements . The central , whiter layers constitute the TIRAN framework . This same structure is replicated on each processing node of the system . • Level 2 hosts the TIRAN Backbone , including the Time-out Manager component , the DB management functions , and the recovery interpreter , RINT . In Fig. 2 , the thicker edge connecting RINT to ariel means that RINT actually implements ( executes ) the ariel programs . Note the control and data messages that flow from Backbone to Time-out Manager , DB , and RINT . RINT also sends control messages to the isolation and recovery BT . Data messages flow also from Backbone to the monitoring tool . • Dependable mechanisms , i.e. , high-level , distributed fault-tolerance tools exploiting the services of the Backbone and of the BT , are located at level 3 . These tools include the distributed voting tool , the distributed synchronization tool , the stable memory tool , and the distributed memory tool , described in Sect . 3.2.3 . Dependable Mechanisms receive notifications from RINT in order to execute reconfigurations such as introducing a spare task to take over the role of a failed task ( see Table 5 ) . The layers around the TIRAN framework in Fig. 2 represent ( from the layer at the bottom and proceeding clockwise ) : • The run-time system . • A provision to inject software faults at all levels of the framework and in the run-time system . • The monitoring tool , for hypermedia rendering of the current state of the system within the windows of an Internet browser . • The functional application layer and the recovery language application layer ( the latter is represented as the box labeled ariel ) . Figure 3 pictures the key elements of the TIRAN architecture within the workflow diagram in Fig. 1 . The following sections describe some of the TIRAN components in more detail . 3.2 Some Components of the TIRAN Framework This section describes some key components of the TIRAN framework , namely : The TIRAN toolset , i.e. , the BT , the BSL , the Backbone , and the Time-out Manager service . It also briefly enumerates the TIRAN level-3 mechanisms . 3.2.1 The TIRAN Basic Tools The TIRAN Basic Tools represent a layer of node-local services for error detection , fault masking , error recovery , and isolation . The TIRAN BT include : 1 . A watchdog timer . Figure 3 : The main components of the RεL architecture developed in TIRAN are located within the workflow diagram of Fig. 1 . A so-called "" SocketServer "" has been also depicted , i.e. , a BSL component managing message transmission and dispatching . 2 . A node-local voting system . 3 . An input replicator , to be used with the voting system . 4 . An output collector , to be used with the voting system . 5 . A tool responsible for node shutdowns . 6 . A tool responsible for node reboots . 7 . A tool responsible for isolating a task . Some of the BT ( such as the level 1.1 BT with numbers 1 – 4 ) are application-level software tools , others ( for instance , the level-1 . 2 BT number 5 – 7 ) provide hooks to lower-level services . Most of these tools have been designed and developed by the TIRAN partners and have been especially conceived in order to meet hard real-time requirements . A deeper description of some of these tools can be found in ( Deconinck , Botti , Cassinari , De Florio , & Lauwereins , 1998 ; Deconinck et al. , 1999 ) . As a side effect of using these tools , the TIRAN Backbone ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) is transparently notified of a number of events related to fault-tolerance . Notifications generally describe the state of a given component and have the form of a 4-tuple of integers ( c , t , u , p ) , in which c identifies a specific condition , t is a label that identifies a class of BT , u is the unique-id of either a task , or a group of tasks , or a node , and p is a possibly empty list of optional arguments . Unlike in Mozart ( Chapter 5 ) , where an entity can register to a fault stream and be notified of all faults affecting any entity , within TIRAN an entity must explicitly set up such fault stream by calling function RaiseEvent . Such function forwards notifications to the Backbone . It has the following prototype : int RaiseEvent ( int condition , int actor , TIRAN TASK ID uniqueId , int nargs , ... ) . 3.2.2 The TIRAN Basic Services Library The TIRAN Basic Services Library offers specific services such as communication , task creation and management , access to the local hardware clock , management of semaphores , and so forth . It supports multicasting : Messages are sent to so-called "" logicals , "" i.e. , groups of tasks . It was designed by the TIRAN Consortium and developed by various partners for the different target platforms and operating systems . Specific adaptation layers may be designed for mapping existing communication libraries , such as MPI2 , to the TIRAN BSL . As a side effect of using some of the BSL functions , the TIRAN Backbone ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) can be transparently notified of events such as a successful spawning of a task , or the failure state of a communication primitive . BSL notifications are similar to BT notifications – 4-tuples of integers ( c , t , u , p ) , where c and p are as in Sect . 3.2.1 , while in this context t is a label that specifies the class of BSL services and u is the unique-id of the task that experienced condition c . A full description of the TIRAN BSL can be found in ( Calella et al. , 1999 ) . 3.2.3 The TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms As already mentioned , the TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms are distributed , high-level fault-tolerance provisions that can be used to facilitate the development of dependable services . The TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms include : • A tool to enhance data integrity by means of a stabilizing procedure ( data is only allowed to pass through the system boundaries when it is confirmed a user-defined number of times ) . This is known as Stable Memory Tool and is described in detail in Chapter 3 . • A Distributed Synchronization Tool , i.e. , a software tool for synchronizing a set of tasks . A description of this tool can be found in ( Calella et al. , 1999 ) . • A so-called Distributed Memory Tool that creates and manages distributed replicas of memory cells . Several features of this tool have been described in Chapter 3 . • A "" Redundant Watchdog "" , i.e. , a distributed system exploiting multiple instances of the watchdog basic tool in order to enhance various dependability properties ( see Chapter 9 ) . • The TIRAN distributed voting tool ( DV ) , an adaptation of the EFTOS voting farm described in Chapter 3 . 3.2.4 The TIRAN Backbone The TIRAN Backbone is the core component of the fault-tolerance distributed architecture described in this chapter . The main objectives of the TIRAN Backbone include : 1 . Gathering and maintaining error detection information produced by TIRAN BT and BSL . 2 . Using this information at error recovery time . In particular , as described in Sect . 3.2.1 , the TIRAN BT focusing on error detection and fault masking forward their deductions to the Backbone . The Backbone maintains these data in the TIRAN DB , replicated on multiple nodes of the system . Incoming data are also fed into an α-count ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) filter ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) . This mechanism allows identifying statistically the nature of faults – whether a given fault is transient or whether it is permanent or intermittent . A set of private functions to query the current state of the DB is available within the Backbone . Other private functions request remote services such as , for instance , rebooting a node or spawning a certain task on a given node . When the underlying architecture is built around a host computer controlling a number of target boards by means of a custom OS , the latter may execute remote commands on the boards . On the contrary , when the OS is general-purpose and node-local , remote services can be executed on any node of the system by sending command messages from one component to the other of the Backbone – for instance , a "" reboot "" message may be sent from the component of the Backbone on node 0 to the component on node 2 . On receipt , the latter may execute the reboot command by forwarding a local request to a BT addressing error isolation or recovery , e.g. , the tool managing the reboot service . Figure 4 represents this scheme . The above remote services can be the basis for more complex , system-wide recovery and reconfiguration actions . Figure 4 : On each processing node exactly one component of the Backbone is located . This component is the intermediary of the Backbone on that node . In particular , it gathers information from error detection and fault containment BT ( grey circles ) and forwards requests to error containment and recovery BT ( light grey circles ) . These latter execute recovery actions and possibly , at test time , fault injection requests . The TIRAN Backbone consists of two core components . In the absence of system partitioning , within the system there is exactly one manager , holding the main copy of the DB and with recovery management responsibilities . On other nodes , Backbone components called assistants deal with DB replicas , forward local deductions to the manager and can take over the role of the manager should the latter or its node fail . A key point in the effectiveness of this approach is guaranteeing that the Backbone itself tolerates internal and external faults . A custom distributed algorithm has been designed to detect the failures of up to all but one of the components of the Backbone or the nodes of the system . The same algorithm also tolerates system partitioning during the "" periods of instability "" ( see the timed-asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , briefly described in Chapter 2 ) . This procedure has been called the "" algorithm of mutual suspicion "" ( AMS ) since each component of the Backbone continuously questions the correctness of all the other valid components . It is described in detail in Chapter 7 . The α-Count Fault Identification Mechanism . It is a well known fact that reconfiguration is a costly activity , in the sense that it always results in redundancy consumption . This translates in a possibly graceful , though actual degradation of the quality of service of a system . This may have drastic consequences , especially in systems where service degradations are static and irreversible . For instance , in satellites and space probes , rapid exhaustion of redundancy may severely affect the duration of the useful mission hours and hence reliability ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . Two important issues towards solving the problem just stated are : 1 . Understanding the nature of faults , and in particular identifying faults as permanent ( and thus actually requiring reconfiguration ) with respect to transient ones . 2 . Tolerating transient faults with less redundancy consuming techniques , possibly not based on reconfiguration . Issue 1 means that the adopted fault-tolerance mechanism is required not only to locate a component subject to an error , but also to assess the nature of the originating fault . This implies processing additional information and unfortunately translates also in a larger delay in fault diagnosis . Despite this larger delay , in same cases the benefits of techniques based on the above issues may be greater than its penalties in performance and latency ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . A number of techniques have been devised to assess the character of faults – some of them are based on tracking the occurrences and the frequency of faults and adopting thresholds of the kind "" a device is diagnosed as affected by a permanent fault when four failures occurs within 24 hours "" . This and other similar heuristics are described in ( Lin & Siewiorek , 1990 ) . A fault identification mechanism , called α-count , has been described in ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) and generalized in ( Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 2000 ) . α-count is also based on thresholds . The basic idea is that each system component to be assessed is to be "" guarded "" by an error detection device . This device should forward its deductions , in the form of a binary digit , to a device called α-count filter . For each incoming judgement , the filter would then perform the α-count technique and issue an assessment about the nature of the fault leading to the detected error . More formally , given n "" guarded "" components ui , 0 < = i < n , the authors of the strategy call J ( i , L ) the L-th judgement on ui . Judgement 0 means success ( ui is "" healthy "" ) , 1 means failure ( ui is faulty ) . A score vector , α ( i ) , 0 < = i < n , is initially set to zero and updated , for each judgement L > 1 , as follows : α ( i , L ) = α ( i , ( L − 1 )) Kif J ( i , L ) = 0 α ( i , L ) = α ( i , ( L − 1 )) + 1if J ( i , L ) = 1 , ( 3 ) being 0 < = K < = 1 . When α ( i , L ) becomes greater than a certain threshold αT , ui is diagnosed as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . This event may be signaled to a reconfigurator or another fault passivation mechanism . The authors of α-count show that their mechanism is asymptotically able to identify all components affected by permanent or intermittent faults – if the threshold αT is set to any finite positive integer A , and if the Figure 5 : The picture shows how an α-count filter , α ( 1 , L ) , is updated when it receives 14 error detection notifications ( 0 < = L < = 13 ) from the Backbone . Notifications are in this case chosen randomly . Note that , on the last notification ( L = 13 ) , a threshold ( in this case , 5.5 ) is reached and the corresponding fault is assessed as permanent or intermittent . component is indeed affected by a permanent or intermittent fault , they prove that α ( i , L ) will eventually become greater than or equal to A ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . The authors also prove that similar results can be reached with some variants of formula ( 3 ) . Figure 5 shows how that counter evolves when random-valued notifications ( either positive or negative assessments ) are sent to the Backbone . It is worth noting how the mechanism described above requires an approach slightly similar to the one of the RεL toolset : in both cases , a fault stream has to flow from a periphery of detection tools to a collector . This collector is the α-count filter in the one case and the TIRAN Backbone and its DB in the other one . This makes it straightforward adopting α-count in TIRAN : The filter can simply be fed with data coming from the detection BT just before this data in inserted into the DB . The added value of this approach is that it is possible to set up a function that returns the current estimation of the nature of a fault ( see Sect . 3.2.9 ) . Clearly , a requirement of this technique is that each detection tool not only forward notifications of erroneous activity , but also confirmations of normal behavior . This may have negative consequences on the performance of the approach , as it may result in many communication requests . In the prototype version developed by the author , Figure 6 : An assistant running on a node of a cluster of PCs . The upper window hosts the assistant , the lower one its SocketServer ( see Fig. 3 ) . In the former one , note how the α-counter detects that task 2 is affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . each notification from any detection tool to the backbone is tagged with an integer label starting at 0 and incremented by 1 at each new deduction . This way , only negative assessments can be sent – in fact , if , for instance , the backbone receives from the same detection tool two consecutive negative assessments labeled respectively , e.g. , 24 and 28 , then this implicitly means that there have been three positive assessments in between , and the α-counter can be updated accordingly – though possibly with some delay . This strategy has been conceived by the author of this book . Figure 6 shows the α-counter in action – a task has reached its threshold and has been declared as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . Clearly a system like Mozart ( Chapter 5 ) may also easily adopt a tool like α-count . 3.2.5 The TIRAN Time-Out Manager As already mentioned , the main assumption of RεL is the adoption of the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , the promising model for solving problems such as dynamic membership ( Cristian & Schmuck , 1995 ) in distributed systems that has been introduced in Chapter 2 . The availability of a class of functions for managing time-outs is an important requirement for that model . The TIRAN Time-out Manager ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) fulfils this need – it is basically a mechanism for managing lists of time-outs , that is objects that postpone a function call for a certain number of local clock units . Time-outs are ordered by clock-units-to-expiration , and time-out lists are managed in such a way that only the head of the list needs to be checked for expiration . When the specified amount of time elapses for the head of the list , its function – let us call it "" alarm "" – is executed and the object is either thrown out of the list or renewed ( in this second case , a time-out is said to be "" cyclic "" ) . A special thread monitors and manages one or more of such lists , checking for the expiration of the entries in the time-out list . Within the strategy of the TIRAN Backbone , a Time-out Manager task is available on each node of the system , spawned at initialization time by the local Backbone component . Time-out Manager is used in this context to translate time-related clauses , such as , "" pa seconds have elapsed "" , into message arrivals . In other words , each Time-out Manager instance of the Backbone may be represented as a function a from C to M such that , for any time-related clause c in C : a ( c ) = message "" clause c has elapsed "" is in M. This homomorphism is useful because it allows deal with the entire set of possible events – both messages and time-related events – as the arrival of a homogeneous set of messages . Hence , a single multiple-selection statement such as the C language switch can be used to manage all cases , which translates into a simpler and more straightforward implementation for error detection protocols such as the AMS . The Time-out Manager uses a well-known algorithm for managing its time-outs ( Tanenbaum , 1996 ) . Once the first time-out is entered , the manager creates a linked-list of time-outs and polls the top of the list . For each new time-out to be inserted , a proper position in the list is found and the list is modified accordingly , as described in Fig. 7 . If the top entry expires , a user-defined alarm function is invoked . This is a general mechanism that allows associate any event with the expiring of a time-out . In the case of the backbone , the Time-out Manager component on node k sends a message to Backbone component on the same node – the same result may also be achieved by sending that component a UNIX signal ( Haviland & Salama , 1987 ) . Special time-outs are defined as "" cyclic "" , i.e. , they are automatically renewed at each new expiration , after invoking their alarm function . A special function renews a time-out , i.e. , it deletes and re-enters that entry . It is also possible to temporarily suspend8 a time-out and re-enable it afterwards . Time-out Manager exploits multiple alarm execution threads in order to reduce the congestion that is due to concurrent execution of alarms and the consequent run-time violations . A description of this strategy can be found in ( De Florio et al. , 2000 ) . Figure 7 : How the alarm manager works : in 1 . , a 330ms alarm called X is inserted in the list . In 2 . , after 100ms , X has been reduced to 230ms and a 400ms alarm , called Y , is inserted ( its value is 170 , i.e. , 400-230 ) . Another 70ms have passed in 3 . , so X has been reduced to 160ms . At that point , a 510ms alarm , Z is inserted – it goes at the third position . In 4 . , after 160ms , alarm X occurs – Y becomes then the top of the list ; its decrement starts . In 5 . another 20ms have passed and Y is at 150ms – at that point a 230ms alarm , called W is inserted . Its position is in between Y and Z , therefore the latter is adjusted . In 6 . , after 150ms , Y expires and W goes on top . The TIRAN Time-out Manager is a fundamental building block for the TIRAN dependability strategies , but it is a useful tool also for other approaches : Chapter 7 describes one of them , that is failure detection protocols . 3.2.6 The Ariel Configuration and Recovery Language ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger That you , his friend , are in ; and sends me forth – For else his project dies – to keep them living . ( Shakespeare , The Tempest , Act II , Scene I ) Within TIRAN , a single syntactical structure – provided by the ariel language ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2001 ; Deconinck , De Florio , & Botti , 2001 ) – has been devised by the author of this book as both a configuration and a recovery language . This chapter describes this language and its compile-time and run-time tools . The structure of the section is as follows : • The general characteristics of ariel are described in Sect . 3.2.7 . • ariel as a configuration language is introduced in Sect . 3.2.8 . • Section 3.2.9 is on ariel as a recovery language . ariel bears its name after the character with the same name of Shakespeare's last Comedy , The Tempest . In fact , in the Tempest , spirit Ariel is a magic creature , the invisible assistant of Prospero , the Duke of Milano . While Prospero plays his role in the foreground of the Comedy – orchestrating a strategy to regain possession of his dukedom , which had been usurped by Prospero's brother Antonio – Ariel faithfully serves Prospero performing his magic in the background , exploiting his powers to execute Prospero's commands when his "" Master through his art foresees the danger "" ( see above quote ) . In a sense , the role of the ariel language is somewhat similar to the one of Prospero's ally . Its run-time support is given by the agent that is sent forth when the Backbone , through its nervous terminals – the error detection basic tools – senses a potentially dangerous condition . The author of this book thinks that the name Ariel captures well this similarity . This is also the reason that led to the choice of "" RεL "" as an abbreviation for "" Recovery Language "" : indeed , the spelling of that word is "" [ a : * ] - [ i : ] - [ el ] "" . 3.2.7 General Characteristics of ariel ariel is a declarative language with a simple syntax somewhat similar to that of a UNIX shell . One instruction per line is allowed . Comments are like in the C shell ( "" # "" starts a comment which ends at next new line or at end-of-file ) . Names are not case-sensitive . ariel deals with five basic types : "" nodes "" , "" tasks "" , "" logicals "" , integers , and real numbers . A node is a uniquely identifiable processing node of the system , e.g. , a processor of a MIMD supercomputer . A task is a uniquely identifiable process or thread in the system . A logical is a uniquely identifiable collection of tasks , possibly running on different nodes . Nodes , tasks , and logicals are generically called entities . Entities are uniquely identified via non-negative integers ; for instance , NODE3 or N3 refer to processing node currently configured as node number 3 . Integer symbolic constants can be "" imported "" from C language header files through the statement INCLUDE . For instance , if the C language header file "" vf . h "" contains a define statement such as : # define PROC NUM 4 , then it is possible to use that symbolic constant wherever an integer is expected in the language . To de-reference a symbolic constant imported via INCLUDEs a "" brace-operator "" has been defined – for instance , under the above assumptions the following valid ariel statement : NPROCS = { PROC_NUM } ( described later on ) is equivalent to NPROCS = 4 . An ariel script basically consists of two parts : • A part dealing with configuration . This is described in Sect . 3.2.8 . • A part containing the guarded actions which constitute the user-defined error recovery strategy . They are described in Sect . 3.2.9 . 3.2.8 ariel as a Configuration Language Special linguistic support has been designed by the author of this book while taking part in the TIRAN project . Aim of this linguistic support is to facilitate the configuration of the instances of the framework elements , of the system and application parameters , and of the fault-tolerance provisions . Let us call these elements a framework instance . Once the user has configured a framework instance with ariel , the TIRAN ariel translator "" art "" must be used to translate these high level specifications into the actual C language calls that set up configured tasks such as , for instance , user-configured watchdogs . The output of the translator is a set of C files that need to be compiled with the user application . A subset of the fault-tolerance provisions described in Chapter 6 is supported by the version of ariel described in this book . The rest of this section describes the process of configuring a framework instance with ariel . System and Application Parameters . The ariel configuration language can be used to define and configure the target system and application entities , e.g. , nodes , tasks , and group of tasks . The rules defined in Sect . 2.3.2 are coded as follows : • Rule ( 1 ) , as for instance in task3 = n0 [ 8 ] , is coded as TASK 3 = "" TMR . EXE "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 . In other words , the above statement declares that task 8 , local to node 0 , is to be globally referred to as "" task 3 "" . String "" TMR . EXE "" may also be used to refer symbolically9 to task3 . More complex rules are possible – for instance , TASK [ 1 , 3 ] = "" Triple "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID [ 6 , 8 ] is equivalent to TASK 1 = "" Triple1 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 6 , TASK 2 = "" Triple2 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 7 , TASK 3 = "" Triple3 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 . • Rule ( 2 ) , as in group10 = { 5 , 6 , 7 } , is coded as LOGICAL 10 = "" TMR "" IS TASK 5 , TASK 6 , TASK 7 END LOGICAL . ( String "" TMR "" may also be used to refer symbolically to group10 ) . The example defines a logical to be globally referred to as "" logical 10 "" , symbolically known as TMR , and corresponding to the three tasks whose unique-id are 5 , 6 , and 7 . Let us assume the following lines have been written in a file called "" test . ariel "" : TASK 5 = "" TMR_LEADER "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 TASK 6 = "" TMR2 "" IS NODE 1 , TASKID 8 TASK 7 = "" TMR3 "" IS NODE 2 , TASKID 8 LOGICAL 10 = "" TMR "" IS TASK 5 , TASK 6 , TASK 7 END LOGICAL File test . ariel can be translated by executing program art as follows : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i test . ariel Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U. Leuven 1999 , 2000 . Parsing file test . ariel ...... done ( 4 lines in 0.01 CPU secs , or 400 lines per CPU sec . ) Output written in file . rcode . Logicals written in file LogicalTable . csv . Tasks written in file TaskTable . csv . Alpha-count parameters written in file alphacount . h . The bold typefaced string is the command line . What follows is the output printed to the user screen . The italics-highlighted strings are the names of two configuration files that are written by art on successful execution . These two files declare tasks and logicals in the format expected by the BSL and by other ancillary components ( e.g. , on the version for Windows NT , these tables are also used by a "" SocketServer10 "" ) . The user can also define a number of other parameters of the TIRAN world like , for instance : • N , i.e. , the total number of processing nodes in the system . • ti , i.e. , the number of tasks running on node ni . • Task-specific parameters of the α-count fault identification mechanism supported by the TIRAN Backbone . As an example , the following lines declare a system consisting of two nodes , each of which has to host 10 user tasks , and define the α-count parameters of task 5 : NPROCS = 2 NUMTASKS 1 = 10 NUMTASKS 2 = 10 ALPHA-COUNT 2 IS threshold = 3.0 , factor = 0.4 END ALPHA-COUNT . The output produced by the art translator is given in this case by a number of header files : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i test . ariel - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U.

Alpha-count parameters written in file alphacount . h . Again , the command has been given in bold typeface and relevant lines have been highlighted using the italics typeface . The "" - s "" option , for "" static "" , requests the writing of a number of header files . The produced header files contain definitions like the following one , from file "" timeouts . h "" : / * Number of available nodes * / # define MAX_PROCS 2 These are the first few lines of the output file "" alphacount . h "" : / ******************************************************************** * * * Header file alphacount . h * * * * This file contains the parameters of the alphacount filter * * ( factor and threshold ) * * Written by art ( v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 ) on Wed Aug 16 15 : 46 : 40 2000 * * ( c ) Katholieke Universiteit Leuven / ESAT / ACCA - 2000 . * * * ******************************************************************* / # ifndef # define ALPHA COUNT ALPHA COUNT # include "" DB . h "" alphacount t alphas [ ] = { { 0.000000 , 0.000000 , { 0.000000 , 0.000000 , { 0.400000 , 3.000000 , { 0.000000 , 0.000000 , 0 0 1 0 } , } , } , } , / * / * / * / * entry entry entry entry 0 1 2 3 * / * / * / * / ( Note how , at entry 2 , the threshold and factor of the α-count related to task 2 have been entered in an array . The latter will then be used by the TIRAN backbone when updating the α-count filters – see Sect . 3.2.4 ) . Backbone Parameters . ariel can be used to configure the Backbone . In particular , the initial role of each Backbone component must be specified through the DEFINE statement . For instance , the following two lines configure a system consisting of four nodes and place the Backbone manager on node 0 and three assistants on the other nodes : DEFINE 0 = MANAGER DEFINE 1-3 = ASSISTANTS A number of backbone-specific parameters can also be specified via the ariel configuration language . These parameters include , for instance , the frequency of setting and checking the < I 'm Alive > flag of the backbone . Values are specified in microseconds . A complete example can be seen in Table 1 . Again , the art translator changes the above specifications into the appropriate C language settings as expected by the TIRAN Backbone . 20 10 1 2 # Specification of a strategy in the recovery language Ariel # Include files INCLUDE "" phases . h "" INCLUDE "" vf . h "" 3 4 5 # Definitions # After keyword ' DEFINE ' , the user can specify # an integer , an interval , or a list , followed by # the equal sign and a backbone role , that may be # ASSISTANT ( s ) or MANAGER NPROCS = 4 Define 0 = MANAGER Define 1-3 = ASSISTANTS 6 7 # Time-out values for the Backbone and the < I 'm Alive > mechanism MIA SEND TIMEOUT = 800000 # Manager Is Alive -- manager side TAIA RECV TIMEOUT = 1500000 # This Assistant Is Alive -- manager side 8 9 MIA RECV TIMEOUT = 1500000 # Manager Is Alive -- backup side TAIA SEND TIMEOUT = 1000000 # This Assistant Is Alive -- backup side 10 TEIF TIMEOUT = 1800000 # After this time a suspected node is assumed # to have crashed . 11 I 'M ALIVE CLEAR TIMEOUT = 900000 # < I 'm Alive > timeout -- clear IA flag 12 I 'M ALIVE SET TIMEOUT = 1400000 # < I 'm Alive > timeout -- set IA flag 13 14 15 16 # Number NUMTASKS NUMTASKS NUMTASKS NUMTASKS 17 18 19 20 TASK TASK TASK TASK of tasks 0 = 11 # node 0 is to be loaded with 11 tasks 1 = 10 2 = 10 3 = 10 [ 0 , 10 ] IS NODE 0 , TASKID [ 0 , 10 ] [ 11 , 20 ] IS NODE 1 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] [ 21 , 30 ] IS NODE 2 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] [ 31 , 40 ] IS NODE 3 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] 21 LOGICAL 1 IS TASK 1 , TASK 2 , TASK 3 END LOGICAL Table 1 : An excerpt from an ariel script : configuration part . Line numbers have been added for the sake of clarity . Basic Tools . ariel can be used to configure statically the TIRAN tools . The current prototypic version can configure only one tool , the TIRAN watchdog . The following syntax is recognized by art to configure it : WATCHDOG 10 WATCHES TASK 14 HEARTBEATS EVERY 100 MS ON ERROR WARN TASK 18 END WATCHDOG . The output in this case is a C file that corresponds to a configured instance of a watchdog . The application developer needs only to send heartbeats to that instance , which can be done as follows : HEARTBEAT 10 . Configuring Multiple-Version Software Fault-Tolerance . As described in Sect . 2.3.3 , it is possible to design syntax rules to support the configuration of the software fault-tolerance provisions described in Chapter 3 . This section describes the solution provided by ariel in order to support N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , and a possible syntax to support consensus recovery blocks ( Scott et al. , 1985 ) and retry blocks ( Huang & Kintala , 1993 ) . The following is an example that shows how it is possible to define an "" N - version task "" with ariel : # include "" my_nvp . h "" N-VERSION LOGICAL { NVP_LOGICAL } VERSION 1 IS TASK { VERSION1 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } VERSION 2 IS TASK { VERSION2 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } VERSION 3 IS TASK { VERSION3 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } METRIC "" nvp_comp "" ON SUCCESS TASK { NVP_OUTPUT } ON ERROR TASK { NVP_ERROR } { NVP_LOGICAL } VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY END N-VERSION The art translator , once fed with the above lines , produces three source files for tasks the unique-id of which is { VERSION1 } , { VERSION2 } and { VERSION3 } . These source files consist of code that • sets up the TIRAN distributed voting tool ( described in Sect . 3.2.3 ) using metric function int nvp_comp ( const void * , const void * ) , setting the voting algorithm to majority voting , and so forth ; • redirects standard output streams ; • executes a user task , e.g. , task { VERSION3 } . By agreement , each user task ( i.e. , each version ) has to write its output onto the standard output stream . During run-time , when the user needs to access a service supplied by an NVP logical , it simply sends a message to entity { NVP_LOGICAL } . This translates into a multicast to tasks { VERSION1 } , { VERSION2 } and { VERSION3 } . These tasks , which in the meanwhile have transparently set up a distributing voting tool , • get their input , • compute a generic function , • produce an output • and ( by the above stated agreement ) they write the output onto their standard output stream . The latter , which had been already redirected through a piped stream to the template task , is fed into the voting system . Such system eventually produces an output that goes to task { NVP_OUTPUT } . A time-out can also be set up so to produce an error notification when no output is sent by a version within a certain deadline . Table 2 shows one of the three files produced by the ariel translator when it parses the script of Sect . 3.2.8 . Note how this file basically configures an instance of the TIRAN DV tool described in Sect . 3.2.3 . Note also how all technicalities concerning : • The API of the tool , • input replication , • the adopted voting strategy , • output communication , and so forth are fully made transparent to the designer , who needs only be concerned with the functional service . This allows the fault-tolerance designer to modify all the above mentioned technicalities with no negative relapses on the tasks of the application designer , and even to deploy different strategies depending on the particular target platform . This can be exploited in order to pursue performance design goals . Support towards consensus recovery block may be provided in a similar way , e.g. , as follows : # include "" my_crb . h "" CONSENSUS RECOVERY BLOCK LOGICAL { CRB_LOGICAL } VARIANT 1 IS TASK { VARIANT1 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT1 } VARIANT 2 IS TASK { VARIANT2 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT2 } # include "" TIRAN . h "" / * Task 101 of NVersion Task 20 Version 1 / 3 * / int TIRAN task 101 ( void ) { TIRAN Voting * dv ; size t size ; double task20 cmp ( const void * , const void * ) ; 10 dv = TIRAN VotingOpen ( task20 cmp ) ; if ( dv == NULL ) { RaiseEvent ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING CANTOPEN , TIRAN DV , 101 , 0 ) ; TIRAN exit ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING CANTOPEN ) ; } / * voting task description : which tasks / * constitute the n-version task * / TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 101 , 1 , TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 102 , 2 , TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 103 , 3 , and which versions * / 1 ) ; 0 ) ; 0 ) ; 20 TIRAN VotingRun ( dv ) ; / * output should be sent to task 40 * / TIRAN VotingOutput ( dv , 40 ) ; TIRAN VotingOption ( dv , TIRAN VOTING IS MAJORITY ) ; / * redirect stdout into a pipe input stream * / TIRAN pipework ( ) ; 30 / * execute the version * / task 101 ( ) ; size = read ( 0 , buff , MAX BUFF ) ; if ( size > 0 ) { / * forward the input buffer to the local voter of this version * / TIRAN VotingInput ( dv , buff , size ) ; } 40 else { / * signal there 's no input * / TIRAN VotingInput ( dv , NULL , 0 ) ; RaiseEvent ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING NOINPUT , TIRAN DV , 101 , 0 ) ; TIRAN NotifyTask ( 60 , TIRAN ERROR VOTING NOINPUT ) ; } } 50 / * EOF file TIRAN task 101 . c * / Table 2 : Translation of the N-Version Task defined in Sect . 3.2.8 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 REPLICATED TASK 10 IS TASK 101 , 102 , 103 METHOD IS MODULAR REDUNDANCY VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY METRIC "" int_cmp "" END METHOD ON SUCCESS TASK 20 ON ERROR TASK 30 END REPLICATED Table 3 : A possible syntax rule for compile-time management of replicated tasks . VARIANT 3 IS TASK { VARIANT3 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT3 } METRIC "" crb_comp "" ON SUCCESS TASK { CRB_OUTPUT } ON ERROR TASK { CRB_ERROR } { CRB_LOGICAL } VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY END CRB This is syntactically similar to the previous example , but the user is asked to supply tasks for the execution of acceptance tests . Other possibilities might also be considered , e.g. , supplying a function name corresponding to the acceptance test , in order to avoid the overhead of spawning a task for that purpose . As described in Sect . 2.3.3 , it is possible to design syntax rules to support the configuration of replicated tasks . Table 3 shows the syntax recognized by ariel for this . Lines have been numbered to ease the discussion . Line 1 specifies which tasks constitute the replicated task . Line 2 defines the method of replication ( NMR in this case ) . Sub-options of the chosen method , at lines 3 and 4 , specify the type of voting to perform when de-multiplexing the multiple outputs of the base modules of the replicated task ( here , majority voting11 ) . Line 6 specifies the task the output of the replicated task is to be sent to . Line 7 specifies which task to notify in case of failure , e.g. , when no majority can be found . ariel supports redoing as described in Table 4 . Note how , in that table , task 10 has to complete within a user-defined deadline ( line 2 ) fulfilling an acceptance test ( executed by task 20 at line 3 ) . This allows regard run-time violations as actual faults . Note also that both the latter task and task 10 could be also transparently replicated by means of the technique depicted in Sect . 2.3.3 . An upper bound on the number of retries is set at line 4 : should task 10 fail three times in a row , task 30 would be notified of this event and could execute some error recovery scheme . 1 2 3 4 5 6 RETRY TASK 10 TIMEOUT 100ms ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK 20 RETRIES 3 ON ERROR TASK 30 END RETRY Table 4 : A possible syntax rule for compile-time management of retry blocks . 3.2.9 ariel as a Recovery Language The same linguistic structure that realizes the TIRAN configuration language is used also to host the structure in which the user defines his or her error recovery strategies . Recovery strategies are collections of sections with the following syntax12 : section : if elif else fi ; if : IF ' [ ' guard ' ] ' THEN actions ; elif : | ELIF ' [ ' guard ' ] ' THEN actions elif ; else fi : | ELSE actions ; : FI ; where non-terminals guard and actions are the syntactical terms defined respectively in Sect . 2.3.4 and Sect . 2.3.4 . Ariel's guards . follows : An excerpt of the context-free grammar rules for guards status : FAULTY | RUNNING | REBOOTED | STARTED | ISOLATED | RESTARTED | TRANSIENT ; entity : GROUP | NODE | TASK ; expr : status entity | ' ( ' expr ' ) ' | expr AND expr | expr OR expr | NOT expr | ERRN ' ( ' entity ' ) ' comp NUMBER | PHASE ' ( ' entity ' ) ' comp NUMBER ; comp : EQ | NEQ | GT | GE | LT | LE ; The following conditions and values have been foreseen : Faulty . This is true when an error notification related to a processing node , a group of tasks , or a single task , can be found in the TIRAN DB . Running . True when the corresponding entity is active and no error has been detected that regards it . Rebooted ( only applicable to nodes ) . This means that a node has been rebooted at least once during the run-time of the application . Started ( not applicable to nodes ) . This checks whether a waiting task or group of task has been started . Isolated . This clause is true when its argument has been isolated from the rest of the application through a deliberate action . Phase ( only applicable to tasks ) . It returns the current value of an attribute set by any task via the public function RaiseEvent . This value is forwarded to the Backbone to represent its current "" phase "" or state ( e.g. , an identifier referring to its current algorithmic step , or the outcome of a test or of an assertion ) . For instance , a voting task could inform the Backbone that it has completed a given algorithmic step by setting a given integer value after each step ( this approach is transparently adopted in the EFTOS voting tool and is described in more detail in ( De Florio et al. , 1998 )) . Recovery block tests can take advantage of this facility to switch back and try an alternate task when a primary one sets a "" failure "" phase or when a guarding watchdog expires because a watched task sent it no signs of life . This condition returns an integer symbol that can be compared via C-like arithmetic operators . Restarted ( not applicable to nodes ) . This returns the number of times a given task or group has been restarted . It implies started . Transient is true when an entity has been detected as faulty and the current assessment of the α-count fault identification mechanism ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) is "" transient "" . It implies faulty . Furthermore , it is possible to query the number of errors that have been detected and pertain to a given entity . Complex guards can be built via the standard logic connectives and parentheses . As an example , the following guard : FAULTY TASK { MASTER } AND ERRN ( TASK { MASTER } ) > 10 AND RESTARTED TASK { MASTER } checks whether the three conditions : • the task , the unique-id of which is the value of the symbolic constant MASTER , has been detected as faulty ; • more than 10 errors have been associated to that task ; • that task has been restarted , are all true . Ariel's actions . "" Actions "" can be attached to the THEN or ELSE parts of a section . In the current implementation of the language , these actions allow to start , isolate , restart , terminate a task or a group of tasks , to isolate or reboot a node , to invoke a local function . Moreover , it is possible to multicast messages to groups of tasks and to purge events from the DB . A section of the context-free grammar for Ariel's actions follows : actions action : | actions action ; : | | section recovery action ; recovery action : STOP entity | ISOLATE entity | START entity | REBOOT entity | RESTART entity | ENABLE entity | SEND NUMBER TASK | SEND NUMBER GROUP | WARN entity ( condition ) | REMOVE PHASE entity FROM ERRORLIST | REMOVE ANY entity FROM ERRORLIST ; | CALL NUMBER | CALL NUMBER ' ( ' list ' ) ' condition : ERR NUMBER entity ; As suggested in Sect . 2.3.4 , a special case of action is a section , i.e. , another guarded action . This allows specify hierarchies ( trees ) of sections . During the run-time evaluation of the recovery strategies , a branch shall only be visited when its parent clause has been evaluated as true . The following actions are supported : Stop terminates a task or a group of tasks , or initiates the shutdown procedure of a node13 . Isolate prevents an entity to communicate with the rest of the system14 . Reboot reboots a node ( via the TIRAN Reboot Node basic tool ) . IF [ FAULTY ( GROUP { My Group } ) AND NOT TRANSIENT ( GROUP { My Group } ) ] THEN STOP TASK @ SEND { DEGRADE } TASK ∼ FI Table 5 : This section queries the state of group { My Group } and , if any of its tasks have been detected as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault , it stops those tasks and sends a control message to those considered as being correct so that they reconfigure themselves gracefully degrading their overall service . Start spawns ( or , in static environments , awakes ) a task or a group . Restart is reverting a task or group of tasks to their initial state or , if no other means are available , stopping that entity and spawning a clone of it . Enable awakes a task or group , or boots a node . Send multicasts ( or sends ) signals to groups of tasks ( or single tasks ) . Warn informs a task or group of tasks that an error regarding an entity has been detected . Action "" WARN x "" is equivalent to action "" SEND { WARN } x "" Remove purges records from the section of the DB collecting the errors or the phases of a given entity . Custom actions and conditions may be easily added to the grammar of ariel15 . When actions are specified , it is possible to use meta-characters to refer implicitly to a subset of the entities involved in the query . For instance , when the first atom specifies a group of tasks , STOP TASK @ 1 means "" terminate those tasks , belonging to the group mentioned in the first atom of the guard , which fulfill that condition "" , while WARN TASK ∼ 2 means "" warn those tasks , belonging to the group mentioned in the second atom of the guard , that do not fulfil the second condition "" . If one does not specify any number , as in STOP TASK @ , then the involved group of tasks is the one that fulfils the whole clause . Table 5 shows an example of usage of this feature . Metacharacter "" star "" ( * ) can be used to refer to any task , group , or processing node in the system . Actions like STOP TASK * or STOP GROUP * are trapped by the translator and are not allowed . Metacharacter "" dollar "" ( $ ) can be used to refer in a section to an entity mentioned in an atom . For instance , STOP GROUP $ 2 means "" stop the group mentioned in the second atom of the clause "" . A larger excerpt of ariel's grammar has been given in Chapter 4 . Compile-time Support for Error-Recovery . Once fed with a recovery script , the art translator produces a binary pseudo-code , called the r-code . In the current version , this r-code is written in a binary file and in a C header file as a statically defined C array , as in Table 6 . As can be seen in that table , the r-code is made of a set of "" triplets "" of integers , given by an opcode and two operands . These are called "" r-codes "" . This header file needs to be compiled with the application . Run-time error recovery is carried out by the RINT module , which basically is an r-code interpreter . This module and its recovery algorithm are described in the following section . The rest of this section describes how to translate an ariel script into the r-code . Within this section and the following one the simple script of Table 7 will be used as an example . The following scenario is assumed : a triple modular redundancy ( TMR ) system consisting of three voting tasks , identified by integers { VOTER1 } , { VOTER2 } , and { VOTER3 } is operating . A fourth task , identified as T { SPARE } , is available and waiting . It is ready to take over one of the voting tasks should the latter fail . The failed voter signals its state to the backbone by entering phase HAS_FAILED through some self-diagnostic module ( e.g. , assertions or control-flow monitoring ) . The spare is enabled when it receives a { WAKEUP } message and it requires the identity of the voter it has to take over . Finally , it is assumed that once a voter receives a control message with the identity of the spare , it has to initiate a reconfiguration of the TMR such that the failed voter is switched out of and the spare is switched in the system . Table 7 shows a recovery section that specifies what to do when task { VOTER1 } fails . The user needs to supply a section like the one in lines 8 – 12 for each voting task . Once the specification has been completed , the user can translate it , by means of the art program , into a pseudo-code whose basic blocks are the r-codes ( see Table 8 ) . A textual representation of the r-codes is also produced ( see Table 9 ) . Other than syntax errors , art catches a number of semantic inconsistencies which are reported to the user – as an example , a non-sense request , such as asking the phase of a node , gives rise to the following response : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i . ariel - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0f 25-Jul-2000 , ( c ) K.U.

The ariel Recovery Interpreter . This section briefly describes the ariel recovery interpreter , RINT . Basically RINT is a virtual machine executing r-codes . Its algorithm is straightforward : Each time a new error or burst of errors is detected , • it executes the r-codes one triplet at a time ; / ************************************************************* * * * Header file trl . h * * * * Hardwired set of r-codes for Ariel file ariel * * Written by art ( v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 ) on Fri Aug 18 2000 * * ( c ) Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 1999 , 2000 . * * * ************************************************************* / # ifndef T R L H # define T R L H 10 # include "" rcode . h "" # define RCODE CARD 15 / * total number of r-codes * / rcode t rcodes [ ] = { / * line # * / / * opcode * / / * operand 1 * / / * operand 2 * / / * 0 * / { R INC NEST , − 1 , − 1 } , 0 , − 1 } , / * 1 * / { R STRPHASE , / * 2 * / { R COMPARE , 1 , 9999 } , / * 3 * / { R FALSE , 10 , − 1 } , 18 , 0 } , / * 4 * / { R STOP , / * 5 * / { R PUSH , 18 , − 1 } , 18 , 3 } , / * 6 * / { R SEND , 0 , − 1 } , / * 7 * / { R PUSH , 18 , 3 } , / * 8 * / { R SEND , / * 9 * / { R PUSH , 3 , − 1 } , / * 10 * / { R SEND , 18 , 1 } , / * 11 * / { R PUSH , 3 , − 1 } , / * 12 * / { R SEND , 18 , 2 } , / * 13 * / { R DEC NEST , − 1 , − 1 } , / * 14 * / { R OANEW , 1 , − 1 } , / * 15 * / { R STOP , − 1 , − 1 } , } ; Table 6 : The beginning of header file trl . h , produced by art specifying option "" - s "" .

RINT plays an important role within the RεL architecture – its main objective is establishing and managing a causal connection between the entities of the Ariel language ( identifiers of nodes , tasks , and groups of tasks ) and the corresponding components of the system and of the target application . This causal connection is supported by the Backbone and its DB . In particular , each atom regarding one or more entities is translated at run-time into one or more DB queries . Under the hypothesis that the DB reflects – with a small delay – the actual state of the system , the truth value of the clauses on the entities of the language will have a large probability to tally with the truth value of the assertions on the corresponding components of the system . Furthermore , by means of RINT , symbolic actions on the entities are translated into actual commands on the components . These commands are then managed by the Backbone as described in Fig. 4 . The RINT task is available and disabled on each Backbone assistant while it is enabled on the Backbone manager . Only one execution process is allowed . RINT has the architecture of a stack-based machine – a run-time stack is used bash-2 . 02 $ art - i ariel - v - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U. Leuven 1999 , 2000 .

It allows error recovery to be expressed in terms of recovery strategies , i.e. , the lightweight code fragments described in Chapter 6 . At run time , the middleware orchestrates their execution . This section reports on the integration of diferent recovery scripts into a distributed run-time environment applied to the embedded automation system of a primary substation . An instrumented automata-based design environment allows the application to be deployed on a heterogeneous platform with several real-time operating systems . While the middleware detects the errors and selects the correct recovery scripts to be executed , the application functionality is maintained through system reconfiguration or graceful degradation . The added value comes from the flexibility to modify recovery strategies without requiring major modifications to the application , while tolerating the same physical faults as in the dedicated hardware solutions . 4.1 Introduction Industrial distributed embedded systems such as those used in the control and automation of electrical energy infrastructures rely on off-the-shelf components and protocols to ensure cost-efficient exploitation ( Caird , 1997 ; Dy-Liacco , 2002 ) . As a particular application can be deployed on a variety of hardware targets ( with different sets of sensors and actuators attached ) and within different environments ( e.g. with different levels of electro-magnetic interference ) , flexibility is needed both to instantiate the application functions appropriately and to react adequately to disturbances to the information and communication infrastructure on which the application is running . For instance , system reconfiguration and recovery may be different , depending on which I / O devices are connected to the different parts of the distributed controllers . More generally , adaptability is required to modify fault tolerance strategies depending on the environment . The DepAuDE architecture deploys a set of middleware modules to provide fault tolerance by exploiting the embedded systems distributed hardware and by separating functional behavior from the recovery strategy , i.e. , the set of actions to be executed when an error is detected . This architecture has been integrated in an innovative demonstrator of a Primary Substation Automation System , i.e. the embedded hardware and software in a substation for electricity distribution , connecting high voltage lines ( HV ) to medium voltage ( MV ) lines over transformers . The Primary Substation Automation System requires protection , control , monitoring and supervision capabilities . It is representative of many applications with dependability requirements in the energy field ( Gargiuli , Mirandola , & et al. , 1981 ) . As mentioned already in Chapter 4 , the major source of faults in the system is electro-magnetic interference caused by the process itself ( opening and closing of HV / MV switchgear ) in spite of the attention paid to designing for electromagnetic compatibility . Software and hardware faults in the automation system have to be considered as well . These cause errors in communication , execution and memory subsystems . In the ongoing renewal of electric infrastructures in Europe , utility companies are replacing their dedicated hardware-based fault tolerance solutions by commercial , interconnected platforms . This trend is motivated by the growing need for more functionality : Development of new , dedicated ( hardware-based ) solutions is considered too expensive and not flexible enough to keep up with the evolving requirements of the liberalized electricity market . The required dependability is reached by exploiting hardware redundancy in the distributed platform , combined with software-implemented fault tolerance solutions at the application and at the middleware level . Although software-based fault tolerance may have less coverage than hardware-based solutions , this was not considered inhibitive , because the physical ( electrical , non-programmable ) protection in the plant continues to act , as a last resort , as a safeguard for non-covered faults16 . Besides , high-quality software engineering and extensive on-site testing remain important to avoid the introduction of design faults that could hamper mission-critical services . This section presents the experience of integrating this DepAuDE software architecture into an application developed with the ASFA distributed run-time environment , a prototypic embedded control system for a primary substation . According to the approach proposed here , support for allocation of tasks to components , for reactions to detected errors and for maintainability of the fault tolerance strategy is accomplished by using the configuration-and-recovery language ariel introduced in Chapter 6 , which was developed in the framework of project TIRAN and later became is a key component of the DepAuDE architecture . In what follows we describe in Sect . 4.2 the DepAuDE assumptions and models , in Sect . 4.3 the Primary Substation Automation System application and in Sect . 4.3 the instantiation of the DepAuDE architecture therein . Section 4.4 concludes with a qualitative evaluation of the experience . 4.2 Assumptions and Models DepAuDE relies on the following assumptions : • Fault model and failure semantics : A single physical fault affects execution or communication entities ( tasks , nodes , links ) . Experiments confirm that EMI affects only the entity to which the responsible I / O element is connected ( Gargiuli et al. , 1981 ) . Depending on the underlying hardware and RTOS ( for instance , whether a memory management unit is available or not ) , a fault containment region is a task or node . Crash failure semantics ( fail-silent behavior ) is assumed for the fault containment region . • System model : A synchronous system model is assumed ( i.e. known and bounded processing delays , communication delays , clock differences and clock drifts , as explained in more detail in Chapter 2 ) . As mentioned already , this is realistic for the set of targeted real-time automation applications , because of their implementation on dedicated systems . • Communication , provided by a Basic Services Library similar to the one designed in the project TIRAN , is assumed to be perfect ( no lost messages , no duplicates , keeping message order ) . In order to increase the coverage for this assumption , a set of mechanisms such as the EFTOS Fault Tolerant Communication tasks described in Chapter 3 can be employed or developed in a similar way . • The communication mechanism targets groups of tasks , that is , a multicast service is prescribed to be available , whose behavior is assumed to be atomic : When a message is sent to a group of tasks , the either all the non-crashed processes receive it or none of them . If this assumption coverage is too low , dedicated atomic multicast support and group membership functions can be added . The DepAuDE middleware supports the reintegration of the basic services library and of the DepAuDE fault tolerance mechanisms ( a concept also derived from the TIRAN project ) . Furthermore it can reload application tasks . The application in itself is responsible for reintegrating these restarted tasks into the ongoing execution , as no checkpoint / restore mechanisms are included . 4.3 Case Study The Local Control Level module is a Primary Substation Automation System component providing control and protection functions for the primary substation , as well as an interface to the operator and – over the inter-site network – to remote control systems and remote operators . The Local Control Level controls the switches to the two HV / MV transformers , the switch connecting the Red MV bar ( on the left ) to the Green MV bar ( on the right ) , as well as switches local to the MV lines ( Figure 8 ) . The pilot application implements two functions from the Local Control Level module : automatic power resumption ( function1 ) and parallel transformers ( function2 ) . Function1 allows automatic power resumption when a HV / MV transformer goes down , e.g. triggered by internal protection ( temperature too high , oil alarm , ... ) . It disconnects the MV lines connected to the busbar of the transformer , computes the load carried by the transformer just before the event happened , and if possible , causes the remaining transformer to take the entire load , as e.g. in the following scenario : • ( Initially ) Red transformer carries 32 MVA ( 8 lines of 4 MVA ) and Green transformer 24 MVA ( 8 x 3 MVA ) ; the switches connecting the Red and Green bars to the transformers are closed ; the switch connecting the Green MV bar to the Red MV bar is open . • ( Anomaly ) An internal protection mechanism shuts down the Green transformer , and its power drops from 24 MVA to zero . The switch connecting the Green bar to the Green transformer opens . ( The switch connecting the Red bar to the Red transformer remains closed and the switch connecting the two bars remains open . ) • ( Reaction ) The switch connecting the Green bar to the Red bar receives the command to close . It closes 1 execution cycle ( 100 ms ) later and the load carried by the Red transformer rises to 56 MVA . Function2 ( parallel transformers ) consists of a series of automatic actions , assisting remote operators . As an example , an operator can request to switch on a transformer and function2 translates this request into a specific sequence of commands . Such a re-insertion scenario may be applied some time after transformer exclusion . System Setup The Primary Substation Automation System application has been developed using a proprietary , automata-based , design environment based on the specification technique ASFA . Application development consists of several steps : • Function1 and function2 are extracted from the Primary Substation Automation System application and specified through the ASFA Graphical Editor , obtaining a tabular description of the pilot application . • These ASFA tables are processed by the ASFA-C Translator , producing a target-independent C-code version of the application , and by the ASFA Partitioner , allowing an application to be mapped to a single task or decomposed into a set of tasks ( Ciapessoni & Maestri , 2001 ) . The single task version has been used for the functional test of the application on a single host node , while a four-task version was selected for testing on a distributed system . Figure 8 : Electric circuit ( grey lines ) and control architecture ( black lines ) of the Primary Substation . Table 10 : Allocation of middleware tasks to nodes . PU stands for "" Peripheral Unit "" . • At run time , the Distributed Execution Support Module , composed of Basic Software ( BSW ) and Executive , enforces cyclic execution , typical for PLC-based automation systems ( PLC = Programmable Logic Controller ) . Robust execution is ensured by cyclically refreshing the I / O image and the non-protected memory areas , while the applications state is safeguarded by hardware or software mechanisms [ 5 ] . The Basic Software takes care of synchronization and exception handling , while the Executive supplies the RTOS interface and a set of ASFA-specific library functions . A peculiarity of the ASFA environment is that the application code is automatically obtained by translating the automata-based specification . Besides reducing the probability of introducing coding errors , this approach provides portability to all platforms supported by the Distributed Execution Support Module . As shown in Figure 9 , this pilot application was deployed on a distributed system consisting of three dedicated heterogeneous ( "" target "" ) processors for the automation functions and two standard PCs for support functions , interconnected by an Ethernet switch : • N1 and N2 : two industrial PCs ( VMIC and INOVA ) , with VxWorks as RTOS ; • N3 : A Siemens SIMATIC M7 , that is , an extended PLC with I / O modules , with RMOS32 as real-time operating system ; • N4 : A number of Linux-based standard PCs , hosting the DepAuDE Backbone ( an enhanced version of the EFTOS DIR net and of the TIRAN Backbone described in previous chapters ) ; • N5 : A Windows-NT PC with Operator Console functions . For inter-site connections ( not considered here ) , an additional node hosts the gateway software . Figure 9 : Primary Substation Automation System hardware architecture . The pilot application runs on this heterogeneous hardware equipment ; input and output from / to the field is simulated . Synchronization signals , for cyclic application execution , are generated by the internal clock of one of the nodes ( in a real set-up , they are obtained from an independent , external device ) . The following assumptions are made for the target nodes : • All three target nodes ( N1 , N2 and N3 in Table 10 ) are attached to I / O components on the field ( the PU boxes in Fig. 8 , that is , peripheral units ) . • The target node N3 handles the synchronization signal . In order to provide a backup solution in case of faults on N3 , synchronization interrupts are also available at N1 and N3 . Instantiating the DepAuDE Mechanisms on the Primary Substation Automation System . The run-time components of the DepAuDE framework are integrated into the Primary Substation Automation System pilot application ( see Table 10 ) . The fault containment region is a node . • An RMOS32 and a VxWorks implementation of the Basic Services Library tasks run on the target nodes ( N1 , N2 , N3 ) ; a Linux and WinNT version runs on the host nodes ( N4 , N5 ) . • A LAN Monitor – that is , a fault-tolerant mechanism used for detecting crashed or isolated nodes – is present on all nodes . • The DepAuDE Backbone task , responsible for the execution of the recovery strategies as described in Chapter 6 , is allocated to N4 . • Each of the three target nodes hosts an instance of the ASFA Distributed Execution Support Module , composed of Basic Software and Executive . Each instance of the Basic Software is able to act as master ( BSW M , on the master node ) or slave ( BSW S , on the slave nodes ) . The role is chosen depending on the specific system configuration . All BSW S entities make up the BSW SLAVE GROUP . The configuration with highest performance ( see below ) requires BSW M to be allocated to N3 and the BSW S processes to run on N1 and N2 . Executive process instances are identical on each processing node and they compose the EXECUTIVE GROUP . The allocation of the application tasks depends on the partitioning of the two Local Control Level functions ( function1 and function2 ) , among which there is no communication . Function2 consists of a single task , PARALLEL TRS , function1 ( automatic power resumption ) consists of three tasks : two tasks ( BUSBAR1 and BUSBAR2 ) handle low-level , I / O dependent , computations relative to the MV lines attached to each busbar ; one task , STRAT , coordinates the whole function and performs no field I / O. There is no communication between the two BUSBAR tasks , while both communicate with STRAT . The basic constraint for allocating tasks to nodes is that a task that controls a specific plant component should be allocated to a processor attached to that plant component ( due to I / O paths ) . As both functions of the pilot application control the same set of field components ( same transformers and switches ) , all target nodes are assumed to be connected to that portion of the field . We assume that target node N2 provides better computing performance than N1 . The start-up configuration is the optimal distribution of application tasks onto the heterogeneous hardware . The most performant configuration , Config 0 in Table 2 , does not require off-node communication among the application tasks : • no application task is allocated to N3 , whose Basic Software acts as master and handles communication with the remote control center ; • PARALLEL TRS runs on N1 ; • BUSBAR1 , BUSBAR2 , and STRAT are allocated to N2 . Table 11 : Different configurations to allocate active Primary Substation Automation System application tasks to target nodes . • Each application task has at least one standby replica task Ri on a different target node Ni ( i = 1 ... 3 ) . 4.3.1 Recovery Strategy of the Primary Substation Automation System In order to cope with temporary and permanent physical faults affecting the information and communication infrastructure of the Primary Substation Automation System , an appropriate recovery strategy has been designed and coded as a set of Ariel recovery scripts . Such strategy combines different kinds of error detection mechanisms , error recovery and system reconfiguration . Reconfiguration is statically associated to the crash of a single node . If two nodes crash simultaneously no reconfiguration is possible . The following scripts are examples of recovery actions . Example 1 . If a slave node ( e.g. , N1 ) crashes , the LAN Monitor detects this event and notifies the Backbone executing the following Ariel code : IF [ FAULTY NODE { N1 } AND RUNNING NODE { N2 } AND RUNNING NODE { N3 } AND PHASE ( TASK { BSW_M } ) == { NEW_CYCLE_PH } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N1 } SEND { CONFIG_1 } TASK { BSW_MSG_M } SEND { CONFIG_1 } GROUP { BSW_SLAVE_GROUP } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } RESTART TASK { PARALLEL_TRS_R2 } FI If the guard of the above script is fulfilled , application tasks are reconfigured as of CONFIG 1 from Table 11 . CONFIG 1 maintains the full Primary Substation Automation System functionality by transferring Parallel TRS to N2 , actually activating its spare replica . This node is able to cope with the whole computational load , as it does not need to perform communication requested by the BSW M's functions . To avoid undesired interference by the Backbone during critical phases of BSW M activity , a condition on the current execution phase ( PHASE ( TASK { BSW_M } ) == { NEW_CYCLE_PH } ) must be satisfied in conjunction with the crash test . The ISOLATE NODE action corresponds to informing other nodes that they may not accept any message from the isolated peer – even if it comes back to life – until the isolation is undone . Example 2 . If a target node ( e.g. N2 ) crashes during a different execution phase of the master Basic Software , then this error is notified by the BSW M to the Backbone ( through function RaiseEvent ( RE_BSW_error )) , causing the execution of the following ARIEL code : IF [ EVENT { RE_BSW_error } ] THEN IF [ FAULTY NODE { N2 } AND RUNNING NODE { N3 } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N2 } SEND { CONFIG_2 } TASK { BSW_MSG_M } SEND { CONFIG_2 } TASK { BSW_MSG_S1 } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } RESTART TASK { BUSBAR1_R3 } , TASK { BUSBAR2_R3 } , TASK { STRAT_R3 } RESTART TASK { PARALLEL_TRS_R1 } FI FI Hence the system is reconfigured as in Config 2 : The spare replicas of BUSBAR1 , BUSBAR2 and STRAT are activated on N3 . Example 3 . In case of a fault on target node N3 ( where BSW M is running ) , the following ARIEL code is executed , triggered by error detection by the LAN Monitor and subsequent notification to the Backbone : IF [ FAULTY NODE { N3 } AND RUNNING NODE { N1 } AND RUNNING NODE { N2 } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N3 } SEND { CONFIG_3 } GROUP { BSW_SLAVE_GROUP } SEND { BACKUP_MASTER } TASK { BSW_MSG_S2 } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } STOP TASK { PARALLEL_TRS } RESTART TASK { STRAT_R1 } , TASK { BUSBAR1_R1 } , TASK { BUSBAR2_R1 } FI Figure 10 : User interface for application supervision and active task allocation . As a consequence , the function of master node is transferred to N2 and the application tasks of N2 are moved to N1 . As N1 can not support both application functions simultaneously , PARALLEL TRS is disabled , thus proceeding to a graceful degradation of the automation system ( config 3 ) . Evaluation . Other recovery strategies , such as restarting all tasks on a node after a transient fault , or shutting down the system when reconfiguration is not possible , have also been coded in ARIEL and implemented . We did not provide recovery strategies associated with a crash of N4 or N5 , because as they are not target nodes , they are not concerned with the automation control function itself ; so even if they crash , the application is not endangered . In a real deployment they could be replicated or could backup each other . Figure 10 shows the user interface of the pilot application demonstrator . 4.4 Summary and Lessons Learned The lack of flexibility that is inherent to dedicated hardware-based fault tolerance solutions makes their adoption not cost-effective in cases where similar functionality has to be deployed in several sites , each characterized by a slightly different environment . This section presented the integration of a fault-tolerance architecture based on the recovery language approach into the distributed automation system of a primary substation . The deployment of this fault tolerance middleware allows different recovery strategies to be integrated on a heterogeneous platform . Given the generality of the methods and techniques used the designed solution is applicable to a wide class of process automation systems . The following points summarize the lessons learned : • The ASFA design environment with automatic code generation provides several advantages : less development time , absence of coding errors , portable application code and possibilities for application partitioning . It is straightforward to interface it to IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices ( IED ) . • The implementation effort required to integrate the DepAuDE Basic Services Library into an ASFA application was limited ( about 2400 lines of code for the RMOS and VxWorks targets ) . The communication mechanism supplied by the DepAuDE Basic Services Library provided transparent inter-process communication among ASFA application tasks . The grouping of tasks revealed itself as a useful tool when implementing the standby replicas . Inter-processor communication among application tasks strongly influences application performance and reconfiguration time in case of faults . Therefore inter-processor data flow should be avoided if possible , or at least minimized . • The deployment of the DepAuDE architecture allowed integrating several recovery strategies on a heterogeneous platform . The separation between functional and error recovery programs provides flexibility to modify recovery strategies without requiring major modifications to the application , while tolerating the same physical faults as in the dedicated hardware solutions . 5 CONCLUSION The recovery language approach and ariel , a configuration-and-recovery language , have been discussed . First the concepts have been treated in general terms ; then , a particular context has been chosen and the concepts in that context have been deployed in the form of a prototypic architecture developed in the framework of a European project , TIRAN . Finally , a real-life example from the domain of electrical automation system has been discussed . ariel and its run-time system provide the user with a fault-tolerance linguistic structure that appears to the user as a sort of second application-level especially conceived and devoted to address the error recovery concerns . Designed by the author of this book while taking part to several European research projects , ariel is currently being used as a linguistic structure to express adaptive feedback loops .

This allowed the crash failure semantics assumption ( see Sect . 2.1.1 ) to be satisfied with less strict coverage , which translates into lower development costs for the framework . 7 Mosaic020 boards have been developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project Dipsap II ( Dipsap-II , 1997 ) by DASA / DSS and Eonic Systems . They are based on the Analog Devices ADSP-21020 DSP and the SMCS communication chip . The SMCS chip complies with the IEEE 1355 standard ( IEEE , 1995 ) and has hardware support for detecting transmission and connection errors and for higher level system protocols such as reset-at-runtime . 8 A time-out is said to be suspended when , on expiration , no alarm is executed . The corresponding entry stays in the time-out list and obeys its rules – in particular , if the timeout was cyclic , on expiration the entry is renewed . 9 An associative array ( see , for instance , ( De Florio , 1996 )) may then be used to de-reference an entity through its symbolic name . 10 In TIRAN lingo , a SocketServer is a task run on each node of the system , which is used by the TIRAN BSL for managing off node communication ( via UDP sockets ) and for local dispatching of remote messages . This is a well-known technical solution which is used , e.g. , in PVM , where a single component , pvmd ( PVM daemon ) , is launched on each node of a PVM cluster to manage global tasks ( Geist et al. , 1994 ) . 11 A number of voting techniques have been generalized in ( Lorczak , Caglayan , & Eckhardt , 1989 ) to "" arbitrary N - version systems with arbitrary output types using a metric space framework "" . To use these algorithms , a metric function can be supplied by the user so to compare any two votes . Such a function is called a "" metric "" and has a fixed prototype , the one of function strcmp of the C standard library function – in the example , a function called int cmp is selected . The object code of this function must be available and addressable when compiling the target application . See Chapter 3 for more details on this . 12 Here and in the following , context-free grammars are used in order to describe syntax rules . The syntax used for describing those rules is that of the YACC ( Johnson , 1975 ) parser generator . Appendix A to Chapter 11 describes YACC in detail . Terminal symbols such as GT are in capital letters . They are considered as intuitive and their definition ( in this case , string "" > "" ) in general will not be supplied . 13 These services are obtained via specific function calls to the level-1 . 2 BT ( see the edge from RINT to those BT in Fig. 2 ) . Such BT , in turn , can either execute , through the BSL , a kernel-level function for stopping processes – if available – or send a termination signal to the involved processes . The actual choice is taken transparently , and RINT only calls one or more times either a TIRAN Stop Task or a TIRAN Stop Node function . 14 This service is obtained as described in the previous footnote . Depending on the characteristics of the adopted platform , isolation can be reached either through support at the communication driver or kernel level , or as follows : when a task opens a connection , a reference to a given object describing the connection is returned to both the user code and the 2 For local component of the Backbone . Action ISOLATE simply substitutes this object with another one , the methods of which prevent that task to communicate . This explains the third application-specific assumption of Sect . 2.1.1 . 15 For instance , condition "" DEADLOCKED "" and action "" CALL "" ( see the Appendix of Chapter 11 ) were added to test the inclusion in ariel , respectively , of a provision for checking whether two tasks are in a deadlock ( see ( Efthivoulidis et al. , 1998 ) for a description of this provision ) and of a hook to the function call invocation method . These two provisions were easily introduced in the grammar of ariel . 16 As we have seen in the case of the Therac-25 linear accelerator in Chapter 2 , it is often a good design choice not to remove hardware safeguards ... page FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING ASPECT ORIENTATION 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES This chapter resumes our survey of application-level fault-tolerance protocols considering approaches based on aspect-oriented programming . Aspect-compliant programming languages allow to treat a source code as a pliable web that the designer can weave so as to specialize or optimize towards a certain goal without having to recode it . This useful property allows separate concerns , bound complexity and enhance maintainability . Aspect programs may be used for different objectives , including non-functional properties such as dependability . To date it is not known whether aspect-orientation will actually provide satisfactory solutions for fault-tolerance in the application layer . Some researchers believe this is not the case ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) – at least for some fault-tolerance paradigm . Some preliminary studies have been carried out ( for instance in ( Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 )) , but no definitive word has been said on the matter . It is our belief that , at least for some paradigms , aspects may reveal themselves as invaluable tools to engineer the application-level of fault-tolerance services . For this reason their approach is described in this chapter . 2 2.1 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS THROUGH ASPECT ORIENTATION General Ideas Aspect-oriented programming ( AOP ) ( Kiczales et al. , 1997 ) is a programming methodology and a structuring technique that explicitly addresses , at application level , the problem of the best code structure to express different , possibly conflicting design goals such as high performance , optimal memory usage , and dependability . Indeed , when coding a non-functional service within an application – for instance an application-level error handling protocol – using either a procedural or an object-oriented programming language , one is required to decompose the original goal , in this case a certain degree of dependability , into a multiplicity of fragments scattered among a number of procedures or objects . This happens because those programming languages only provide abstraction and composition mechanisms to cleanly support the functional concerns . In other words , specific non-functional goals , such as high performance , can not be easily captured into a single unit of functionality among those offered by a procedural or object-oriented language , and must be fragmented and intruded into the available units of functionality . As already observed , this code intrusion is detrimental to maintainability and portability of both functional and non-functional services ( the latter called "" aspects "" in aspect-oriented terminology ) . Such aspects tend to crosscut the system's class and module structure rather than staying , well localized , within one of these unit of functionality , e.g. , a class . This increases the complexity of the resulting systems . The main idea of aspect-oriented programming is to use : 1 . A "" conventional "" programming language ( that is , a procedural , object-oriented , or functional programming language ) to code the basic functionality . The resulting program is called a component program . The basic functional units of the component program are called components . 2 . A so-called aspect-oriented language to implement given aspects by defining specific interconnections ( "" aspect programs "" in aspect-oriented lingo ) among the components in order to address various systemic concerns . 3 . An aspect weaver , that takes as input both the aspect and the component programs and produces with those ( "" weaves "" ) an output program ( "" tangled code "" ) that addresses specific aspects . The weaver first generates a data flow graph from the component program . In this graph , nodes represent components , and edges represent data flowing from one component to another . Next , it executes the aspect programs . These programs edit the graph according to specific goals , collapsing nodes together and adjusting the corresponding code accordingly . Finally , a code generator takes the graph resulting from the previous step as its input and translates it into an actual software package written , e.g. , for a procedural language such as Java . This package is only meant to be compiled and produce the ultimate executable code fulfilling a specific aspect like , e.g. , higher dependability . In a sense , aspect-oriented programming systematically automatizes and supports the process to adapt an existing code so that it fulfils specific aspects . Aspect-oriented programming may be defined as a software engineering methodology supporting those adaptations in such a way as to guarantee that they do not destroy the original design and do not increase complexity . The original idea of aspect-oriented programming is a clever blending and generalization of the ideas that are at the basis , for instance , of optimizing compilers , program transformation systems , meta-object protocols , and even literate programming ( Knuth , 1984 ) . 2.2 2.2.1 AspectJ and Aspectwerkz AspectJ AspectJ is the first and probably most wide-spread aspect-oriented language ( Kiczales , 2000 ; Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) . Developed as a Xerox PARC project , AspectJ can be defined as an aspect-oriented extension to the Java programming language . AspectJ provides the programmer with the following constructs : • Join points , i.e. points in a program where additional behavior ( logging for example ) can be attached . They represent relevant points in a program's dynamic call graph . Join points mark the code regions that can be manipulated later one by an aspect weaver ( see above ) . In AspectJ , these points can be – method executions , – constructor calls , – constructor executions , – field accesses , and – exception handlers . Join points can be expressed through pointcuts ( see below ) . • Pointcuts are a way to express join points in a program . Let us suppose for example one would need to achieve transparent logging of all the methods whose names start with string "" do "" . In AspectJ this can be expressed as pointcut doMethod ( ) : execution ( * do * ( * )) ; • An advice is the additional code ( the actual logging , for instance ) that has to be executed at the join point . In the logging example it can be implemented as follows : after ( ) returning : doMethod ( ) // log something . • Inter-type declarations provide a mechanism to change the structure of existing classes . It is possible to add methods , fields and even interfaces to existing classes without changing the class itself . For instance if one needs to log how many times a method is executed , it is possible to add a counter field to the class . AspectJ is in a sense an extension to Java and in this regard it has two important properties . The first property is that all valid Java programs are valid AspectJ programs and the second is that after transformation of the AspectJ program , it becomes a valid Java program that can be run in the Java Virtual Machine ( jvm ) . In order for AOP to work , AspectJ has an AspectJ-compiler ( ajc ) that weaves the aspects into the code . This weaving can happen at three different times : • Compile-time : ajc will compile the classes from source and produce the woven classes as output . This is the simplest approach and only necessary if the aspects are required for the code to compile ( which would not be a good approach ) . • Post-compile-time : ajc will weave existing class - and jar-files with the aspects . Post-compiletime weaving allows great flexibility as it enables us to add aspects after the original code has been compiled . • Load-time : The weaving only happens when the class loader loads the class in the environment . This requires the support from a weaving class loader and weaving agent by adding aspectjweaver . jar to the classpath . Load-time weaving allows the most flexibility as the aspects to be woven need only be known at runtime . Another extension to Java is AspectJ's support of the Design by Contract methodology ( Meyer , 1997 ) , where contracts ( Hoare , 1969 ) define a set of pre-conditions , post-conditions , and invariants , that determine how to use and what to expect from a computational entity . A study has been carried out on the capability of AspectJ as an aspect-oriented programming language supporting exception detection and handling ( Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) . It has been shown how AspectJ can be used to develop so-called "" plug-and-play "" exception handlers : libraries of exception handlers that can be plugged into many different applications . This translates into better support for managing different configurations at compile-time . This addresses one of the aspects of attribute a defined in Chapter 2 . 2.2.2 Dynamic weaving of aspects As mentioned in ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) , dynamic behavior through run-time weaving is being recognized more and more as a key property in modern aspect-oriented architectures . While early versions of AspectJ could only define joinpoints as static source code locations it is now possible to define joinpoints on the occurrence of run-time conditions . This allows activate or deactivate aspects dynamically . Many researchers believe that through this powerful syntactical framework it will be possible to tackle effectively dynamic adaptation and self-configuration . An interesting example of this trend is AspectWerkz ( Bonér & Vasseur , 2004 ; Vasseur , 2004 ) , defined by its authors as "" a dynamic , lightweight and high-performant AOP framework for Java "" ( Bonér , 2004 ) . AspectWerkz utilizes bytecode modification to weave classes at project build-time , class load time or runtime . This capability means that the actual semantics of an AspectWerkz code may vary dynamically over time , e.g. , as a response to environmental changes . This translates in a useful structure to create dependable service whose fault model changes over time , as discussed in Chapter 2 , hence characterized by an excellent a . Recently the AspectJ and AspectWerkz projects have agreed to work together as one team to produce a single aspect-oriented programming platform building on their complementary strengths and expertise . 2.3 Variations on the Main Theme : AspectC ++ and GluonJ A recent project , AspectC ++ ( AspectCpp , n.d. ) , proposes an aspect-oriented implementation of C ++ which appears to achieve most of the positive properties of the other Java-based approaches and adds to this efficiency and good performance . AspectJ and Aspectwerkz are not the only aspect-oriented languages focusing on Java : Another example is GluonJ ( GluonJ , n.d. ; Chiba & Ishikawa , 2005 ) , whose primary design goal is simplicity – a fundamental property for truly dependable systems . Quoting his author , GluonJ "" provides simple but powerful AOP constructs by using annotations in regular Java . Developers can use GluonJ as a compile-time AOP system or a load-time AOP system "" . GluonJ in particular provides its programmer with a mechanism for extending an existing class , called refinement . As mentioned in Chapter 4 , GluonJ has been written on top of Javassist , the Java Programming Assistant meta-library briefly introduced in that chapter . 3 CONCLUSION Figure 1 synthesizes the main characteristics of AOP : it allows decompose , select , and assemble components according to different design goals . This has been represented by drawing the components as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle created by the aspect program and assembled by the weaver into the actual source code . AOP addresses explicitly code re-engineering , which in principle should allow to reduce considerably maintenance costs . AOP is a relatively recent approach to software development . AOP can in principle address any application domain and can use a procedural , functional or object-oriented programming language as component language . The isolation and coding of aspects requires extra work and expertise that may be well paid back by the capability of addressing new aspects while keeping a single unmodified and general design . For the time being it is not yet possible to tell whether AOP will spread out as a programming paradigm among academia and industry the way object-oriented programming has done since the Eighties . The many qualities of AOP are currently being quantitatively assessed , both with theoretical Figure 1 : A fault-tolerant program according to an AOP system . studies and with practical experience , and results seem encouraging . Furthermore , evidence of an increasing interest in AOP is given by the large number of research papers and conferences devoted to this interesting subject . From the point of view of the dependability aspect , one can observe that AOP exhibits optimal sc ( "" by construction "" , in a sense ( Kiczales & Mezini , 2005 )) , and that recent results show that attribute a can in principle reach good values when making use of run-time weaving ( Vasseur , 2004 ) , often realized by dynamic bytecode manipulation . This work by Ostermann ( Ostermann , 1999 ) is an interesting survey on this subject . The adequacy at fulfilling attribute sa is indeed debatable also because , to date , no fault-tolerance aspect languages have been devised1 – which may possibly be an interesting research domain . Positive values for sa have been questioned , at least in the case of fault-tolerance paradigms such as transactions , which appear to be difficult to be "" aspectized "" ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) especially because of the "" very syntactic-only nature "" of the manipulations supported by the approach . Possibly an evolution of aspects allowing semantic processing , a little like in Introspector ( Chapter 4 ) , could provide us with the ultimate tool to master the application-level complexity of fault-tolerance expression .

Accurate failure detection in asynchronous systems ( Chapter 2 ) is notoriously difficult , as it is impossible to tell whether a process has actually failed or it is just slow . Because of this , several impossibility results have been derived – see for instance the well known paper ( Fischer , Lynch , & Paterson , 1985 ) . As a consequence of these pessimistic results , many researchers have devoted their time and abilities to understanding how to reformulate the concept of system model in a fine-grained alternative way . Their goal was being able to tackle problems such as distributed consensus with the minimal requirements on the system environment . This brought to the theory of unreliable failure detectors for reliable systems , pioneered by the works of Chandra and Toueg ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . This chapter introduces these concepts and the formulation of failure detection protocols in the application layer . In particular a linguistic framework is proposed for the expression of those protocols . As a case study it is described the algorithm for failure detection used in the EFTOS DIR net and in the TIRAN Backbone – that is , the fault-tolerance managers introduced respectively in Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 . 2 FAILURE DETECTION PROTOCOLS IN THE APPLICATION LAYER In Chapter 2 the concept of system model was briefly introduced together with the main features of the classical asynchronous and synchronous system models . The former model , also known as "" time-free "" system model , is the one that is implicitly used by most non real-time services : For such systems there is no bound for the time required to execute any computation or communication step , which means that there is no way to tell whether a certain part of the system is slow or if it has failed . How to distinguish between these two cases ? The answer found by researchers is failure detectors . As cleverly expressed by Michel Raynal , failure detectors may be considered as a sort of distributed oracle for failure detection . This oracle observes the system and draws its conclusions about failures , informing those who query it . It could be regarded as a sort of middleware service for failure detection . Failure detectors are characterized by two properties : • Completeness , which is the actual detection of failures , and • Accuracy , which tells how reliable a failure detector can be in its assessments . In a sense , completeness and accuracy represent two coordinates by means of which the spectrum of all possible failure detectors can be drawn . This spectrum represents also a two-dimensional set of possible system models , a set which is much more detailed and fine-grained than the linear one hitherto available to researchers : In other words , before failure detectors , the researchers had a sort of interval defined by its two extremes , the asynchronous model ( "" I ask nothing , so I get nothing "" ) and the synchronous model ( "" I ask too much , so I ca n't get it "" ) . Partial synchronous systems are points vaguely identified within that interval . With failure detectors everything changes and one can talk of system model ( c , a ) , where ( c , a ) are the completeness and accuracy of the minimal failure detector F D ( c , a ) that can be implemented in a system obeying that model . This view has revolutionized the research on dependable distributed systems . Several and very important have been the consequences of the introduction of failure detectors . Among them the following ones are highlighted herein : • Famous impossibility results such as the impossibility to solve consensus in a fully asynchronous system ( Fischer et al. , 1985 ) , which had puzzled the research community for years , have been now understood and tamed . The correct way to solve it is to ask which is the weakest of failure detectors the underlying asynchronous system has to be equipped with in order for the consensus problem to be solved . This in turns means to be able to identify which minimal set of additional mechanisms must be available in an asynchronous system in order implement that failure detector , thus making it able to support consensus . The same reasoning can be applied to any other distributed computing problem . Clearly this is a powerful conceptual and practical tool to reason about reliable systems . • Another important consequence of introducing a theory of failure detectors is that a failure detector also reveals what are the minimal requirements necessary for a service to migrate from a system to another while keeping the desired quality of service . One of the key messages of this book is that it is important to distinguish between porting a code Construct Repeat periodically Upon t = current time Upon receive message Concurrency management NFD-E no φ no FD yes GMFD no D ∈ ♦ P yes HB yes HB-pt yes yes no yes yes no no no yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no no yes yes yes Table 1 : Syntactical constructs used in several failure detector protocols . φ is the accrual failure detector discussed in ( Hayashibara , 2004 ; Hayashibara et al. , 2004 ) . D is the eventually perfect failure detector of ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . HB is the Heartbeat detector of ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) . HB-pt is the partitiontolerant version of the Heartbeat detector . By "" Concurrency management "" it is meant co-routines , threading or forking . and porting the service that that code is meant to offer , and that the history of the relations between human beings and computers is paved of cases where erroneous software reuse has led to dreadful disasters . Failure detectors provide the designers with powerful "" lens "" through which the differences among systems and the consequences of migrations are put in the foreground . It is a pity that the awareness of the role of failure detectors in dependable software development has not been fully recognized and exploited yet in the ICT community at large . • Finally , from a theoretical point of view , failure detectors create a partial ordering among problems , which is also very important to better understand and compare the threats of dependability . Failure detection protocols are often described by their authors making use of informal pseudo-codes of their conception . Often these pseudo-codes use syntactical constructs such as repeat periodically ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) ( Aguilera , Chen , & Toueg , 1999 ) ( Bertier , Marin , & Sens , 2002 ) , at time t send heartbeat ( Chen , Toueg , & Aguilera , 2002 ; Bertier et al. , 2002 ) , at time t check whether message has arrived ( Chen et al. , 2002 ) , or upon receive ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) , together with several variants ( see Table 1 ) . Such syntactical constructs are not often found in COTS programming languages such as C or C ++ , which leads us to the problem of translating the protocol specifications into running software prototypes using one such standard language . Furthermore the lack of a formal , well-defined , and standard form to express failure detection protocols often leads their authors to insufficiently detailed descriptions . Those informal descriptions in turn complicate the reading process and exacerbate the work of the implementors , which becomes time-consuming , error-prone and at times frustrating . Several researchers and practitioners are currently arguing that failure detection should be made available as a network service ( Hayashibara et al. , 2004 ; Renesse , Minsky , & Hayden , 1998 ) . No such service exists to date . Lacking such tool , it is important to devise methods to express in the application layer of our software even the most complex failure detection protocols in a simple and natural way . In the following one such method is introduced , which is based on the class of time-outs ( i.e. , objects that postpone a certain function call by a given amount of time ) that has been introduced in Chapter 6 . As mentioned already , this feature allows convert time-based events into non time-based events such as message arrivals . It also allows easily express the constructs in Table 1 in standard C1 . In some cases , our class allows get rid of concurrency management requirements such as co-routines or thread management libraries . The formal character of our method allows rapid-prototype the algorithms with minimal effort . This is proved through a Literate Programming ( Knuth , 1984 ) framework that produces from a same source file both the description meant for publication and a software skeleton to be compiled in standard C or C ++ . The rest of this chapter is structured as follows : Section 2.1 introduces our tool . In Sect . 2.1.2 our tool is put to work and used to express three classical failure detectors . Section 2.2 is a case study describing a software system built with our tool . Our conclusions are drawn in Sect . 2.3 . 2.1 TOM : A Time-outs Management System This section briefly describes the architecture of our time-out management system ( TOM ) . The TOM class appears to the user as a couple of new types and a library of functions . Table 2 provides an idea of the client-side protocol of our tool . To declare a time-out manager , the user needs to define a pointer to a TOM object and then call function tom init . Argument to this function is an alarm , i.e. , the function to be called when a time-out expires : int alarm ( TOM * ) ; tom = tom init ( alarm ) ; The first time function tom init is called a custom thread is spawned . That thread is the actual time-out manager . At this point the user is allowed to define his or her time-outs . This is done via type timeout t and function tom declare ; an example follows : timeout t t ; tom declare ( & t , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TID , TSUBID , DEADLINE ) . In what above , time-out t is declared as : • A cyclic time-out ( renewed on expiration ; as opposed to TOM NON CYCLIC , which means "" removed on expiration "" ) , 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . / * declarations * / TOM * tom ; timeout t t1 , t2 , t3 ; int my alarm ( TOM * ) , another alarm ( TOM * ) ; / * definitions * / tom ← tom init ( my alarm ) ; tom declare ( & t1 , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TIMEOUT1 , SUBID1 , DEADLINE1 ) ; tom declare ( & t2 , TOM NON CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TIMEOUT2 , SUBID2 , DEADLINE2 ) ; tom declare ( & t3 , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET DISABLE , TIMEOUT3 , SUBID3 , DEADLINE3 ) ; tom set action ( & t3 , another alarm ) ; / * insertion * / tom insert ( tom , & t1 ) , tom insert ( tom , & t2 ) , tom insert ( tom , & t3 ) ; / * control * / tom enable ( tom , & t3 ) ; tom set deadline ( & t2 , NEW DEADLINE2 ) ; tom renew ( tom , & t2 ) ; tom delete ( tom , & t1 ) ; / * deactivation * / tom close ( tom ) ; Table 2 : An example of usage of the TOM class . In 1 . a time-out list pointer and three time-out objects are declared , together with two alarm functions . In 2 . the time-out list and the time-outs are initialized , and an alarm differing from the default one is attached to time-out t3 . Insertion is carried out at point 3 . At 4 . , some control operations are performed on the list , namely , time-out t3 is enabled , a new deadline value is specified for time-out t2 which is then renewed to activate the changing , and time-out t1 is deleted . The whole list is finally deactivated in 5 . • enabled ( only enabled time-outs "" fire "" , i.e. , call their alarm on expiration ; an alarm is disabled with TOM SET DISABLE ) , • with a deadline of DEADLINE local clock ticks before expiration . A time-out t is identified as a couple of integers , in the above example TID and TSUBID . This is done because in our experience it is often useful to distinguish instances of classes of time-outs . TID is used for the class identifier and TSUBID for the particular instance . A practical example of this is given in Sect . 2.2 . Once defined , a time-out can be submitted to the time-out manager for insertion in its running list of time-outs – see ( De Florio & Blondia , 2006 ) for further details on this . From the user point of view , this is managed by calling function tom insert ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Note that a time-out might be submitted to more than one time-out manager . After successful insertion an enabled time-out will trigger the call of the default alarm function after the specified deadline . If that time-out is declared as TOM CYCLIC the time-out would then be re-inserted . Other control functions are available : a time-out can be temporarily suspended while in the time-out list via function tom disable ( TOM * , timeout t * ) and ( re - ) enabled via function tom enable ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Furthermore , the user is allowed to specify a new alarm function via tom set action ) and a new deadline via tom set deadline ; he or she can delete a time-out from the list via tom delete ( TOM * , timeout t * ) , and renew2 it via tom renew ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Finally , when the time-out management service is no longer needed , the user should call function tom close ( TOM * ) , which possibly halts the time-out manager thread should no other client be still active . 2.1.1 Requirements A fundamental requirement of our model is that processes must have access to some local physical clock giving them the ability to measure time . The availability of means to control the priorities of processes is also an important factor to reducing the chances of late alarm execution . Another assumption is that the alarm functions are small grained both in CPU and I / O usage so as to not interfere "" too much "" with the tasks of the TOM . Finally , asynchronous , non-blocking primitives to send and receive messages are assumed to be available . 2.1.2 Discussion In this section it is shown that the syntactical constructs in Table 1 can be expressed in terms of our class of time-outs . This is done by considering three classical failure detectors and providing their time-out based specifications in the cweb Literate Programming framework ( Knuth , 1984 ) . Let us consider the classical formulation of eventually perfect failure detector D ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . The main idea of the protocol is to require each task to send a "" heartbeat "" to its fellows and maintain a list of tasks suspected to have failed . A task identifier q enters the list of task p if no heartbeat is received by p during a certain amount of time , ∆ p ( q ) , initially set to a default value . This value is increased when late heartbeats are received . The basic structure of D is that of a co-routine with three concurrent processes , two of which execute a task periodically while the third one is triggered by the arrival of a message : The repeat periodically in Task 1 is called a "" multiplicity 1 "" repeat , because indeed a single action ( sending a "" p-is-alive "" message ) has to be tracked , while the one in Task 2 is called a "" multiplicity q "" repeat , which requires to check q events . Our reformulation of the above code is as follows : where tasks and actions are defined as follows : The following observations can be drawn : • Our syntax is less abstract than the one adopted in the classical formulation . Indeed it was deliberately chosen a syntax very similar to that of programming languages like C and its derivatives . Behind the lines , a similar semantics is also assumed . • Our syntax is more strongly typed : We have deliberately chosen to define ( most of ) the objects our code deals with . • Set-wise operations such as union , complement or membership have been systematically avoided by transforming sets into arrays as , e.g. , in outputp ← outputp U { q } , which was changed into outputp [ q ] = PRESENT . • The abstract constructs repeat periodically have been systematically rewritten as one or more time-outs ( depending on their multiplicity ) . Each of these time-out has an associated action that sends one message to the client process , p. This means that 1 . time-related event "" it 's time to send p-is-alive to all "" becomes event "" message REPEAT TASK1 has arrived . "" 2 . time-related events "" it 's time to check whether q-is-alive has arrived "" becomes event "" message ( REPEAT TASK2 , id = q ) has arrived . "" • Due to the now homogeneous nature of the possible events ( message arrivals ) a single process may manage those events through a multiple selection statement ( a switch ) . The requirement for a co-routine has been removed . Through the Literate Programming approach and a compliant tool such as cweb ( Knuth & Levy , 1993 ; Knuth , 1984 ) it is possible to further improve our reformulation . As well known , the cweb tool allows have a single source code to produce a pretty printable TEX documentation and a C file ready for compilation and testing . In our experience this link between these two contexts can be very beneficial : testing or even simply using the code provides feedback on the specification of the algorithm , while the improved specification may reduce the probability of design faults and in general increase the quality of the code . Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively show a reformulation for the HB failure detector for partitionable networks ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) and for the group membership failure detector ( Raynal & Tronel , 1999 ) produced with cweb . A full description of these protocols is out of the scope of this book – for that the reader is referred to the above cited articles . The focus here is mainly on the syntactical constructs used in them and our reformulations , which include simple translations for the syntactical constructs in Table 1 in terms of our time-out API . A case worth noting is that of the group membership failure detector : Here the authors mimic the availability of a cyclic time-out service but intrude its management in their formulation – which could be avoided using our approach . 2.2 A Development Experience : The DIR net As mentioned in Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 , at the core of the software fault tolerance strategies of several European projects ( Deconinck , De Florio , Varvarigou , Verentziotis , & Botti , 2002 ; Botti et al. , 2000 ; Deconinck , De Florio , Dondossola , & Szanto , 2003 ) there is a distributed application Figure 1 : Reformulation of the HB failure detector for partitionable networks . Special symbols such as τ and Dp are caught by cweb and translated into legal C tokens via its "" @ f "" construct . The expression m . path [ q ] ≤ PRESENT means "" q appears at most once in path "" . Figure 2 : Reformulation of the group membership failure detector . called "" DIR net "" ( De Florio , 1998 ) or "" Backbone "" . In this section that application is described ( let us call it just as the DIR net ) and it is reported on how it was designed and developed by means of the TOM system . The DIR net has been described as a fault-tolerant network of failure detectors connected to other peripheral error detectors ( called Dtools in what follows ) . Objective of the DIR net is to ensure consistent fault tolerance strategies throughout the system and play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the Dtools ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) . The DIR net consists of four classes of components . Each processing node in the system runs an instance of a so-called I-am-alive Task ( IAT ) plus an instance of either a DIR Manager ( DIR-M ) , or a DIR Agent ( DIR-A ) , or a DIR Backup Agent ( DIR-B ) . A DIR-A gathers all error detection messages produced by the Dtools on the current processing node and forwards them to the DIR-M and the DIR-B's . A DIR-B is a DIR-A which also maintains its messages into a database located in central memory . It is connected to DIR-M and to the other DIR-B 's and is eligible for election as a DIR - M. A DIR-M is a special case of DIR - B. Unique within the system , the DIR-M is the one component responsible for running error recovery strategies – see ( De Florio , 2000 ; De Florio & Deconinck , 2002 ) for a description of the latter . Let us use DIR-x to mean "" the DIR-M or a DIR-B or a DIR - A. "" An important design goal of the DIR net is that of being fault-tolerant . This is accomplished also through a failure detection protocol that will be described Time-out tIA SET tIA CLR Caller DIR-x IAT Action On TimeNow + dIA SET do send mIA SET ALARM to Caller On TimeNow + dIA CLR do send mIA CLR ALARM to IAT Cyclic ? Yes Yes Table 3 : Description of time-outs tIA SET and tIA CLR . Message mIA SET ALARM mIA CLR ALARM Receiver DIR-x IAT k Explanation Time to set IAF Time to check IAF Action IAF ← TRUE if ( IAF ≡ FALSE ) SendAll ( mTEIF , k ) else IAF ← FALSE , Table 4 : Description of messages mIA SET ALARM and mIA CLR ALARM . in the rest of this section . 2.2.1 The DIR net failure detection protocol Our protocol consists of a local part and a distributed part . Each of them is realized through our TOM class . DIR net protocol : local component . As already mentioned , each processing node hosts a DIR-x and an IAT . These two components run a simple algorithm : they share a local Boolean variable , the I 'm Alive Flag ( IAF ) . The DIR-x has to set periodically the IAF to TRUE while the IAT periodically has to check that this has indeed occurred and reverts IAF to FALSE . If the IAT finds the IAF set to FALSE it broadcasts message mTEIF ( "" this entity is faulty "" ) . The just mentioned cyclic tasks can be easily modeled via two time-outs , tIA SET and tIA CLR , described in Table 3 and Table 4 ( TimeNow being the system function returning the current value of the clock register ) . Note that the time-outs' alarm functions do not clear / set the flag – doing so a hung DIR-x would go undetected . On the contrary , these functions trigger the transmission of messages that once received by healthy components trigger the execution of the meant actions . The following is a pseudo-code for the IAT algorithm : The IAT k executes as follows : timeout t tIA CLR ; msg t activationMessage , m ; tom declare ( ❀ tIA CLR , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , IAT CLEAR TIMEOUT , 0 , dIA CLR ) ; tom set action ( ❀ tIA CLR , actionSendmIA CLR ALARM ) ; tom insert ( ❀ tIA CLR ) ; Receive ( activationMessage ) ; forever { Receive ( m ) ; if ( m . type ≡ mIA CLR ALARM ) if ( IAF ≡ TRUE ) IAF ← FALSE ; else SendAll ( mTEIF , k ) ; delete timeout ( ❀ tIA CLR ) ; } actionSendmIA CLR ALARM ( ) { Send ( mIA CLR ALARM , IAT k ) ; } The time-out formulation of the DIR-x is given in next section . 2.2.2 DIR net protocol : distributed component The resilience of the DIR net to crash faults comes from the DIR-M and the DIR-B 's running a distributed algorithm of failure detection . Algorithm DIR - M. Let us call mid the node hosting the DIR-M and b the number of processing nodes that host a DIR - B. The DIR-M has to send cyclically a mMIA ( "" Manager-Is-Alive "" ) message to all the DIR-B 's each time time-out tMIA A expires – this is shown in the right side of Fig. 3 . Obviously this is a multiplicity b "" repeat "" construct , which can be easily managed through a cyclic time-out with an action that signals that a new cycle has begun . In this case the action is "" send a message of type mMIA A ALARM to the DIR - M. "" The manager also expects periodically a ( mTAIA , i ) message ( "" This-Agent-Is-Alive "" ) from each node where a DIR-B is expected to be running . This is easily accomplished through a vector of ( tTAIA A , ~ ı ) time-outs . The left part of Fig. 3 shows this for node i . When time-out ( tTAIA A , p ) expires it means that no ( mTAIA , p ) message has been received within the current period . In this case the DIR-M enters a so called "" suspicion period "" . During such period the manager has to try to tell a late DIR-B from a crashed one . This is done by inserting a non-cyclic time-out , namely ( tTEIF A , p ) . During the suspicion period only one out of the following three events may take place : 1 . A late ( mTAIA , p ) is received . 2 . A ( mTEIF , p ) from IAT at node p is received . 3 . Nothing comes in and the time-out expires . In case 1 , one gets out of the suspicion period , concludes that DIR-B at node p was simply late and goes back waiting for the next ( mTAIA , p ) . A wrong deduction at this point is possible and will be detected in one of next cycles . Adjustments of the deadlines are possible but not dealt with here for the sake of simplicity of description . Figure 3 : The algorithm of the DIR - M. If 2 is the case the remote component is assumed to have crashed though its node is still working properly , as the IAT on that node still gives signs of life . Therefore an error recovery step is initiated . This includes sending a "" WAKEUP "" message to the remote IAT so that it spawns another DIR-B on that node . In case 3 the entire node is assumed to have crashed and node recovery is initiated . Underlying assumption of our algorithm is that the IAT is so simple that if it fails then the whole node can be safely assumed to have failed . Algorithm DIR - B. This algorithm is also divided into two concurrent tasks . In the first one DIR-B on node i has to cyclically send ( mTAIA , i ) messages to the manager , either in piggybacking or on expiring of time-out tTAIA B. This is represented in the right side of Fig. 4 . The DIR-B 's in turn periodically expect a mMIA message from the DIR - M. As evident when comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 4 , the DIR-B algorithm is very similar to the one of the manager : also DIR-B enters a suspicion period when its manager does not appear to respond quickly enough – this period is managed via time-out tTEIF B , the same way as in DIR - M. Also in this case one can get out of this state in one out of three possible ways : either 1 . a late ( mMIA B ALARM , mid ) is received , or 2 . a ( mTEIF , mid ) sent by the IAT at node mid is received , or 3 . nothing comes in and the time-out expires . In case 1 one gets out of the suspicion period , concludes that manager was simply late , goes back to normal state and starts waiting for the next ( mMIA , mid ) message . Also in this case , a wrong deduction shall be detected in next cycles . If 2 , one concludes that the manager has crashed though its node is still working properly , as its IAT acted as expected . Therefore a manager recovery phase is initiated similarly to the DIR-B recovery step described in Sect . 2.2.2 . In case 3 the node of the manager is assumed to have crashed , elect a new manager among the DIR-B's , and perform a node recovery phase . Table 5 summarizes the DIR-M and DIR-B algorithms .

Figure 4 : Algorithm DIR - B. The DIR net was developed using the Windows TIRAN libraries ( Botti et al. , 2000 ) and the cweb system of structured documentation . Figures 5 – 8 show the DIR net at work in a system consisting of just a DIR-M and a DIR - B. Two ancillary processes called SocketServers are used to manage UDP communication . 2.2.3 Special services Configuration . The management of a large number of time-outs may be an error prone task . To simplify it , the configuration language of Chapter 6 was used . Figure 9 shows an example of configuration script to specify the structure of the DIR net ( in this case , a four node system with three DIR-B 's deployed on nodes 1 – 3 and the DIR-M on node 0 ) and of its time-outs . A translator produces the C header files to properly initialize an instance of the DIR net . Figure 5 : A DIR net consisting of a DIR-B ( top left picture ) and a DIR-M ( bottom left ) . Pictures on the right portray the "" SocketServers "" , i.e. ancillary processes managing communication . Figure 6 : Time-out tTAIA A expires , meaning that expected message mTAIA has not been received within the corresponding deadline dTAIA A. As a result , tTEIF A is inserted . This corresponds to action "" At time TimeNow + dTEIF A check whether mTEIF has arrived "" . Figure 7 : A DIR-B is stopped . Time-out tTEIF A expires and as a result , the assistant is tagged as "" faulty "" . Figure 8 : The DIR-B is restarted . As a result , it begins sending mTAIA messages . Upon receiving , the manager tags the assistant as "" OK . "" Figure 9 : An excerpt from the configuration script of the DIR net . 2.2.4 Fault injection Time-outs may also be used to specify fault injection actions with fixed or pseudo-random deadlines . In the DIR net this is done as follows . First the time-out is defined : # ifdef INJECT tom_declare ( & inject , TOM_NON_CYCLIC , TOM_SET_ENABLE , INJECT_FAULT_TIMEOUT , i , INJECT_FAULT_DEADLINE ) ; tom_insert ( tom , & inject ) ; # endif The alarm of this time-out sends the local DIR-x a message of type "" INJECT FAULT TIMEOUT "" . Figure 10 shows an excerpt from the actual main loop of the DIR-M in which this message is dealt with . Fault tolerance . A service such as TOM is indeed a single-point-of-failure in that a failed TOM brings the local DIR net components to the impossibility to perform their failure detection protocols . Such a case would be indistinguishable from that of a crashed node by the other DIR net components . As well known from , e.g. , ( Inquiry , 1996 ) , a single design fault in TOM's implementation could bring the system to a global failure . Nevertheless , the isolation of a service for time-out management may pave the Figure 10 : An excerpt from the cweb source of the DIR net : the beginning of Code Section 18 ( loop of the DIR-M ) . way for a cost-effective adoption of multiple-version software fault tolerance techniques ( Lyu , 1998 ) such as the well known recovery block ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) or N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1995 ) . No such technique has been adopted in the current implementation of TOM . 2.3 Conclusions A tentative lingua franca for the expression of failure detection protocols was introduced . TOM encloses the advantages of being simple , elegant and not ambiguous . Obvious are the many positive relapses that would come from the adoption of a standard , semi-formal representation with respect to the current Babel of informal descriptions – easier acquisition of insight , faster verification , and greater ability to rapid-prototype software systems . Given the current lack of a network service for failure detection , the availability of standard methods to express failure detectors in the application layer is an important asset : a tool like the one described in this chapter isolates and crystallizes a part of the complexity required to express failure detection protocols . This complexity becomes transparent of the designer – which saves development times and costs – and eligible for cost-effective optimizations . Separation of design concerns is not among the design goals of our tool , which provides the programmer with a library . Hence , our tool is characterized by bad . is not applicable , as TOM only targets one fault-tolerance provisions , i.e. failure detectors . No is considered , but in principle the server side of our system could be designed with adaptivity in mind , e.g. , masking the actual number of failure detectors being used . Similar considerations apply to the DIR net . As a final remark it is noteworthy to remark how , at the core of our design choices , is the selection of C and literate programming , which proved to be invaluable tools to reach our design goals . Nevertheless these choices may turn into intrinsic limitations for the expressiveness of the resulting language . In particular , they enforce a syntactical and semantic structure , that of the C programming language , which may be regarded as a limitation by those researchers who are not accustomed to that language . At the same time we would like to remark also that those very choices allow us a straightforward translation of our constructs into a language like Promela ( Holzmann , 1991 ) , which resembles very much a C language augmented with Hoare's CSP ( Hoare , 1978 ) . Accordingly , our future work in this framework shall include the adoption of the Promela extension of Prof. Bošnački , which allows for the verification of concurrent systems that depend on timing parameters ( Bošnački & Dams , 1998 ) . Interestingly enough , this version of Promela includes new objects , called discrete time countdown timers , which are basically equivalent to our non-cyclic time-outs . Our goal is to come up with a tool that generates from the same literate programming source ( 1 ) a pretty printout in TEX , ( 2 ) C code ready to be compiled and run , and ( 3 ) Promela code to verify some properties of the protocol . 3 CONCLUSION The role of failure detection in dependable computing has been explained . Several examples of failure detection protocols have been described in a uniform way based on the time-out management system used in TIRAN to realize the algorithm used by the Backbone to detect and tolerate crash failures of nodes and Backbone components . That algorithm has been also described with time-outs as a case study . Failure detectors are being studied intensively by many research groups throughout the world . Future work in our group at the University of Antwerp will focus on the expression of failure detection services for service-oriented architectures . References Aguilera , M.

All the approaches reported in the rest of this chapter exploit the recovery language approach introduced in Chapter 6 and couple it with other tools and paradigms described in other parts of this book . Objective of this chapter is to demonstrate how RεL can serve as a tool to further enhance some of the application-level fault-tolerance paradigms introduced in previous chapters . But why hybrid approaches in the first place ? The main reason is that joining two or more concepts and their "" system structures "" ( Randell , 1975 ) , that is , the conceptual and syntactical axioms used in disparate application-level software fault-tolerance provisions , one comes up with a tool with better Syntactical Adequacy ( the SA attribute introduced in Chapter 2 ) . As already mentioned , a wider syntactical structure can facilitate the expression of our codes , while on the contrary awkward structures often lead to clumsy , buggy applications . Hybrid approaches are often more versatile and may also inspire brand new designs . A drawback of hybrid approaches is that they are modifications of existing designs . The extra design complexity must be carefully added to prevent the introduction if design faults in the architecture . Which approaches to make use of is an important design choice . In some cases this may be under the control of the programmer : An example could be for instance , using a fault-tolerance library such as EFTOS to create a library of fault-tolerance meta-objects with OpenC ++ . Section 3 and Sect . 3 are other examples of this case . More ambitious goals would definitely require the design of new frameworks or architectures , such as it is the case for the model described in next section and the system in Sect . 5 . The first case is that of RεLinda , a model coupling RεL with generative communication , introduced in Sect . 2 . Section 3 then shows how to use RεL to enhance the resiliency of N-modular redundant systems by using spare components . A similar method is used in Sect . 4 to come up with flexible and dependable watchdog timers . Finally , Cactus is introduced – a system coupling a sort of recovery language with single-version software fault-tolerance mechanisms . 2 A DEPENDABLE PARALLEL PROCESSING MODEL BASED ON GENERATIVE COMMUNICATION AND RECOVERY LANGUAGES As already remarked , redundancy is an important ingredient at the basis of both parallel computing and dependable computing . In other words , the availability of redundancy and a proper management of the available redundancy can be exploited to reach both functional objectives , such as high performance , and non-functional goals such as the ones at the core of this book , for instance high availability and data integrity . Indeed , the truly extended use of parallel computing technologies asks for effective software engineering techniques to design , develop and maintain dependable parallel software – that is , it requires expressive programming models capable to make effective use of the available redundancy for capturing both the above classes of goals . This happens because any computing service based on parallel computing technologies must be designed in such a way as ( 1 ) to face and counterbalance the inherently lower level of dependability that characterizes any parallel hardware , due to the considerably higher probability for events such as a node's permanent or temporary failure in any such highly redundant system ; and ( 2 ) to match the involved algorithms to the target hardware platform , so as to exploit optimally the available redundancy and reach , e.g. , the expected performance . One can conclude that , in order to be able to set up parallel computing services actually capable to provide their users with the expected high quality of service , it is important that the designers have at their disposal effective structuring techniques and software engineering methodologies for developing and maintaining dependable parallel services : lacking these techniques , the complexity pertaining to the management of the purely functional aspects , i.e. , the service , the aspects related to the performance , i.e. , the parallelism , and those related to fault tolerance , would jeopardize the design of the service increasing both its development times and costs and the probability of introducing design faults . Considering all the above and the main lessons learned exposed in this book , one can conclude that a simple and coherent structuring technique for dependable and parallel services , providing straightforward and effective means to control their complexity , would be a key factor for the wide-spreading of parallel computing technologies . This chapter describes a novel software engineering methodology and structuring technique , RεLinda , whose main goals include separation of design concerns , dynamic adaptability of the service to varying environmental conditions , and expressiveness . Such technique provides a parallel programming model that couples the recovery language approach described in Chapter 5 and generative communication ( Gelernter , 1985 ) i.e. , the well-known model of communication of systems such as , for instance , Linda ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989 ) or JavaSpaces ( Oaks & Wong , 2000 ) briefly introduced in Chapter 4 . RεLinda provides its users with a single model for both parallel and dependable programming , and it is our conjecture that this single software framework provides both the elegance of generative communication and the effectiveness of recovery languages and , as such , is a valuable design tool for the composition of parallel , and dependable , services . A prototypic implementation of some components of a RεLinda architecture took place in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN , also introduced in Chapter 5 . The key characteristic of the reported technique is that it allows structure the target application into three distinct components , respectively responsible for ( 1 ) the functional service , including its performance aspects , ( 2 ) the management of the fault-tolerance provisions , and ( 3 ) the adaptation to the current environmental conditions . As such it provides another solution to the problem of an optimal expression of fault-tolerance protocol whose fault model is not fixed once and for all but changes with the actual faults being experienced . In what follows the RεLinda approach , its models and elements are described . 2.1 The RεLinda Approach This section describes the RεLinda approach . It is structured into two parts . First , the system and application models are provided in Sect . 2.1.1 . After that , in Sect . 2.1.2 , the basic ideas behind RεLinda are exposed . A key component is then described in § 2 . 1 . 3 , which also points out the key relation between the recovery language approach and RεLinda . 2.1.1 System and Application Models The target system for RεLinda is assumed to be a distributed or parallel system . Basic components of this system are the nodes , the tasks , and the communication network . In particular , • a node can be , e.g. , a workstation in a networked cluster or a processor in a MIMD parallel computer . The number of available nodes is n , n > 0 . Nodes can be commercial-off-the-shelf hardware components with no special provisions for hardware fault-tolerance . • Tasks are independent threads of execution running on the nodes . • The network system allows tasks on different nodes to communicate with each other with the same properties described in Chapter 5 for the TIRAN architecture . A general-purpose operating system ( OS ) is required on each node . No special purpose , distributed , or fault-tolerant OS is assumed to be required . The system is assumed to obey the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) ( see Chapter 2 ) . The following assumptions characterize the user application : • the service is supplied by a parallel application ; • it is written or is to be written in a procedural or object-oriented language such as , e.g. , C or Java ; • the service specification includes non-safety-critical dependability goals ; • the target application is characterized by soft real-time requirements . In particular , performance failures ( Cristian , 1991 ) may occasionally show up during error recovery ; • communication is based on the GC model . User tasks communicate exclusively through functions with the semantics of the Linda primitives – in ( ) , out ( ) , rd ( ) , and their non-blocking versions , inp ( ) and rdp ( ) . • task management and , in particular , task creation and termination , is done respectively via a function with the semantics of the Linda primitive eval ( ) and via function lave ( ) , which terminates the matching active tuples . 2.1.2 RεLinda Herein the elements of the RεLinda approach and some key components of its architecture are described . To the performance-oriented designer , RεLinda appears as a standard Linda-like system . In addition to standard tuples , created by the user via function out ( ) , RεLinda supports a special class of tuples , called error notifications ( ENs ) . Error notifications are special , read-only tuples1 that represent error detections such as , for instance "" divide-by-zero exception caught while executing task 11 , "" sent by a trap handling tool , and have the following structure : ( "" ERROR "" , m , t , e , v [ 1 ... e ] ) , where m is an integer that identifies an error detector ( see later on ) , t is an integer that identifies a task found in error by m , e is an integer , e ≥ 0 , and v is a vector of e integers describing the current error detection . By agreement , neither function out ( ) nor function eval ( ) are allowed specify tuples with the same structure as the error notifications . This means that the programmer has no direct way to emit an error notification2 . Indeed , error notifications can only be produced by : • A set of tools addressing error detection and fault masking , collectively called "" error detectors "" ( EDs ) . EDs are tools similar to those of SwIFT ( see Chapter 3 ) or the TIRAN Dtools ( see Chapter 5 ) , and provide services such as , e.g. , watchdog timers and software voting ( a system like the EFTOS Voting Farm could be used for that , see Chapter 3 ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) 3 ; • a failing eval ( ) ; • or a failing assert ( ) , the latter being a function with the semantics of the C standard library function with the same name ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) . On the other hand , each user task has free read-only access to the error notifications , and hence can query the current status of any task t – according to its error detectors . This can be used to unblock potentially dangerous deadlock conditions , such as two Table 1 : Scheme of execution of TS when it processes request r . 1 Begin request ( r ) : 2 if tuple type ( r ) 6 = EN then 3 insert plain tuple ( r ) 4 return SUCCESS 5 endif 6 if sender = ED then 7 8 9 10 11 12 update α-count ( r ) insert EN tuple ( r ) awake recovery interpreter ( r ) return SUCCESS endif return FAILURE tasks where each of them is waiting for the other to become available for processing – by simply specifying , as an unblocking condition , the availability of the error notification describing that the other task is being found in error . As it is for "" plain "" Linda systems , also the RεLinda architecture foresees a tuple space manager ( TS ) . The latter is a distributed application , constituted of c components , where 1 ≤ c ≤ n , each of which is located on a different node of the system . As a whole , the TS executes the algorithm of mutual suspicion , that is , the fault tolerance distributed algorithm described in Chapter 5 which allows tolerate up to c − 1 crash failures affecting either its components or the nodes hosting them . Tuples are stored by the tuple space manager into a database that is replicated on each of its c components . Each time a new request for insertion of either an error notification or a "" plain "" tuple reaches the tuple space manager , it is processed according to the following scheme , also summarized in Table 1 : • If the request pertains to a "" plain "" tuple , the latter is inserted in the tuple space . This implies updating the remote copies of the database . • Otherwise , if the ES was sent by an error detector , – first , a field of the database , called α-counter is updated ( see below for more details on this ) ; – then the error notification is inserted as a plain tuple ; and – ( 3 ) a RINT recovery interpreter is started ( see Chapter 5 for a description of RINT ) . Field α-counter is a task-specific variable that is processed according to the threshold-based statistical technique known as α-count and described in Chapter 5 . As explained there , this technique is capable of assessing whether a task is affected by a transient vs. a permanent or intermittent fault ; as such , it allows express fault-aware error recovery strategies . Apart from managing tuples and error notifications , the tuple space manager also keeps track of the current structure and state of the system , the user application , and itself . These data are used at error recovery time as described in the following text . 2.1.3 RεLinda Error Recovery Component The execution of the recovery actions is done via a fixed ( i.e. , special-purpose ) scheme , portrayed in the sequence diagram of Fig. 1 : as soon as an error is detected , a Figure 1 : Scheme of execution of a RεLinda-compliant distributed application : together with the application , two special-purpose tasks are running – a distributed tuple space manager , which stores both the error notifications sent by the error detectors and the "" plain "" tuples requested via out ( ) or eval ( ) , and a "" recovery application "" , i.e. , a task responsible for the execution of a set of recovery actions . The shown sequence diagram describes the execution of the user-specified recovery actions . notification describing that event is sent to a distributed entity responsible for the collection and the management of these notifications . Clearly , in RεLinda this entity is the TS and the above mentioned notifications are the ENs . Immediately after storing each notification , the guards of the recovery actions are evaluated . Guards evaluation is done by querying the database of the TS . When a guard is found to be true , its corresponding actions are executed , otherwise they are skipped . As a conclusive remark RεLinda may be described as a specialization ( in object-oriented terminology ) of the general abstract class RεL addressing parallel programming . 2.2 Conclusions This section has exposed the key ideas behind a novel approach called RεLinda , coupling Generative Communication with the the RεL approach introduced in Chapter 6 . As such , RεLinda is an attempt to explicitly address both the dependability and the performance aspects making use of a single design framework . RεLinda offers a high degree of separation of design concerns , such that the functional and the FT aspects do not conflict with each other . Its dynamic adaptability to varying environmental conditions , which may obtained as described in ( De Florio , 2000 ) through dynamic linking of the r-code , is another important feature of RεLinda . SA in RεLinda is limited to those fault-tolerance provisions that better match its model ; in particular , the strong link with parallel computing makes it especially in line with methods such as MVSFT ( see Chapter 3 ) . Several other important topics related to RεLinda's components could be investigated in the future . Such topics include , for instance , the inclusion in the TS of the concept of so-called "" book-kept tuples , "" i.e. , tuples that are distributed to requesters by means of the algorithm of RAFTNET for dependable farmer worker applications described in Chapter 3 . This strategy translates into effective and elegant support to highly performing and highly dependable data-parallel applications . Another research path is the extension of these schemes towards persistent object stores ( Oaks & Wong , 2000 ) and CORBA-compliant or service-oriented middleware . Other strategies to further increase the dependability of RεLinda applications are , e.g. , the possibility to combine multiple tuple space operations into atomic transactions ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ; Cannon & Dunn , 1992 ) . Other techniques that could be investigated to further enhance the dependability of the tuple space could be e.g. , tuple space checkpoint-and-rollback ( Kambhatla , 1991 ) . 3 ENHANCING A TIRAN DEPENDABLE MECHANISM As observed by the designers of GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , many embedded systems may benefit from an hardware architecture based on redundancy and consensus in order to fulfill their dependability requirements . As pointed out in Chapter 2 , such a hardware architecture needs to be coupled with some application-level strategy or mechanism in order to guarantee end-to-end tolerance of faults4 . The software architecture described in this book may support in many ways the class of applications eligible for being embedded in a GUARDS system instance . The main tool for this is the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism ( derived from the EFTOS Voting Farm described in Chapter 3 ) . This section describes how it is possible to further increase the dependability of the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism by using ARIEL as both a configuration and a recovery language and making use of the TIRAN framework . An assessment of these enhancements is reported in Chapter 10 . The system realizes a sophisticated N - version programming executive that implements the software equivalent of an NMR system . Because of this assumption , the user is required to supply four versions of the same software , designed and developed according to the N - version approach ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . This requirement can be avoided if it is possible to assume safely that no design faults resulting in correlate failures affect the software . To simplify the case study it is assumed that the service provided by any of the versions or instances is stateless . When this is not the case , the management of the spare would also call for a forward recovery mechanism – e.g. , the spare would need to acquire the current state of one of the non-faulty tasks . Furthermore , when using pipelines of N-version tasks under strict real-time requirements , further techniques ( currently not part of the prototype presented in this work ) would be required in order to restore the state of the spare with no repercussion on the real-time goals ( see ( Bondavalli , Di Giandomenico , Grandoni , Powell , & Rabéjac , 1998 ) for an example of these techniques ) . The enhanced TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism described in what follows is representative of the class of applications that are best eligible for being addressed via an application-level fault-tolerance structure such as NVP . This section describes how RεL provides to those applications two additional features , namely , support of spares and support of fault-specific reconfiguration , which are not part of plain NVP systems . A system of four nodes is assumed . Nodes are identified by the symbolic constants NODE1 , ... , NODE4 , defined in the header file nodes . h . Header file my_definitions . h contains a number of user definitions , including the unique-id of each version task ( VERSION1 , ... , VERSION4 ) and the local identifier of each version task ( in this case , on each node the same identifier is used , namely VERSION ) . In the same file also the time-outs of each version are defined ( TIMEOUT_VERSION1 , ... , TIMEOUT_VERSION4 ) . Let us consider the following ARIEL script : INCLUDE "" nodes . h "" INCLUDE "" my definitions . h "" TASK TASK TASK TASK { VERSION1 } { VERSION2 } { VERSION3 } { VERSION4 } IS IS IS IS NODE NODE NODE NODE { NODE1 } , { NODE2 } , { NODE3 } , { NODE4 } , TASKID TASKID TASKID TASKID { VERSION } { VERSION } { VERSION } { VERSION } N-VERSION TASK { TMR PLUS ONE SPARE } VERSION 1 IS TASK { VERSION1 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION1 } ms VERSION 2 IS TASK { VERSION2 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION2 } ms VERSION 3 IS TASK { VERSION3 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION3 } ms VERSION 4 IS SPARE TASK { VERSION4 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION4 } ms VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY METRIC "" tmr cmp "" ON SUCCESS TASK 20 ON ERROR TASK 30 END N-VERSION IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION1 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION1 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION1 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION1 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION2 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION3 } IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION2 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION2 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION2 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION2 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION1 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION3 } IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION3 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION3 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION3 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION3 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION2 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION1 } The above script consists of two parts – one for managing the configuration of tasks and tools , the other for describing a recovery strategy . The following two subsections describe the two parts . 3.1 Configuration The configuration section of the script just shown defines four tasks , each running on a different node of the system . This decision has been taken to reduce the probability of a common source for multiple failures , in case of a crash of a node . It is worth noting that this design decision – the physical location of the tasks – is made outside the application code and can be changed with no repercussion on it , thus allowing location transparency and high SC . Three of the four tasks are then configured as versions of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism ( derived from the EFTOS Voting Farm described in Chapter 3 ) . The fourth task ( VERSION4 ) is configured as a spare . This means that , when task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE is launched , the first three tasks arrange themselves as components of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism , with each task assisted by a local voter as described in the aforementioned section . On the contrary , the fourth task is blocked waiting for the arrival of a special "" wakeup "" signal . Feeding the ARIEL translator with the configuration script as described in Chapter 6 , a number of source codes are produced , including : • The basic user tasks of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism consisting of three modules , an example of which can be seen in Chapter 6 when configuring multiple-version software fault-tolerance . • The spare user task , initially waiting for the arrival of a wakeup message . • Task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . This task is in charge of the : 1 . Transparent set up of the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism via the TIRAN CreateTask function of the TIRAN Basic Services Library . 2 . Management of the replication of the input value . 3 . Declaration and insertion in the TIRAN TOM of the set of time-outs that represent an upper limit to the duration of the base tasks . This upper limit is set by the user and known by one of the hypotheses of the timed-asynchronous distributed system model introduced in Chapter 2 ( all services are timed ) . 4 . De-multiplexing and delivering the output value . In the absence of faults , task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE would appear to the user as yet another version providing the same service supplied by tasks VERSION1 , ... , VERSION4 . The only difference would be in terms of a higher reliability ( see Chapter 10 ) and a larger execution time , mainly due to the voting overhead . Location transparency in this case is supported by ARIEL , while replication transparency is supported by the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism . The degree of code intrusion in the application source code is reduced to the one instruction to spawn task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . No support for the automatic generation of makefiles is provided in the current version of the ARIEL translator , so the user needs to properly instruct the compilation of the source files written by the translator . 3.2 Recovery The recovery section of the ARIEL script on p. 267 defines a recovery strategy for task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . When any error is detected in the system and forwarded to the backbone , the backbone replies to this stimulus as follows : 1 . It stores the error notification in its local copy of the DB . 2 . It updates the α-count variable related to the entity found in error . 3 . If the notification is local , i.e. , related to a local task , then the local component of the BB forwards the notification to the other components . 4 . If the local BB entity plays the role of coordinator , it initiates error recovery by sending a "" wakeup "" message to the recovery interpreter . This latter orderly reads and executes the r-codes . Table 2 shows a trace of the execution of some of the r-codes produced when translating a simplified version of the ARIEL script on p. 267 . As already mentioned , RINT implements a virtual machine with a stack architecture . Line 5 starts the scanning of a guard . Line 6 stores on RINT's run-time stack the current value of the phase of task 0 ( the value of symbolic constant VERSION1 ) . Line 7 compares the top of the run-time stack with integer HAS FAILED . The result , 0 ( false ) is stored on top of the stack . Line 8 checks the top of the stack for being 0 . The condition is fulfilled , so a jump is made to line 18 of the r-code list . That line corresponds to the end of the current IF statement – the guard has been found as false , therefore the corresponding recovery actions have been skipped . Then , on line 19 , some internal variables are reset . Line 20 starts the evaluation of the clause of the second IF of the recovery script . The scenario is similar to the one just described , though ( on line 22 ) the phase of task 1 ( that is , VERSION2 ) is found to be equal to HAS FAILED . The following conditional jump is therefore skipped , and a stream of recovery actions is then executed : task VERSION2 is terminated on line 24 , then value 10 ( WAKEUP ) is sent to task VERSION4 by means of r-code SEND ( which sends a task the top of the run-time stack ) , and so forth , until line 33 , which closes the current IF . A third guard is then evaluated and found as false . Clearing some internal structures closes the execution of RINT , which again "" goes to sleep "" waiting for a new "" wakeup "" message to arrive . Figure 2 , 3 , and 4 show three different views to a TMR-and-one-spare system at work , as displayed by the TIRAN monitoring tool in a Netscape client ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . The first picture renders the current state and shape of the overall target application . Figure 3 summarizes the framework-level events related to processing node 0 . In particular , a value domain failure is injected on the voter on node 2 . This triggers the execution of a recovery script which reconfigures the TMR isolating the voter on node 2 and switching in the spare voter on node 3 . The execution trace of the r-codes in this script is displayed in Fig. 4 . It is worth noting how , modifying the base recovery strategy of the ARIEL script on p. 267 does not require any modification in the application source code – not even recompiling the code , in case the r-codes are read from an external means ( e.g. , from a file ) . The two design concerns – that of the fault-tolerance software engineer and that of the application software engineer – are kept apart , with no repercussions on the maintainability of the service overall . To prove this , let us consider the ARIEL excerpt in Table 3 . Such a strategy is again based on a TMR plus one spare , though now , before switching off the faulty version and in the spare , the current value of the α-count filter related to the current version is compared with a threshold supplied by the user in the configuration section . If the value is below the threshold , it is not possible to assess that the fault affecting { VERSION1 } is permanent or intermittent . In this case , the faulty task is restarted rather than substituted . In other words , another chance is given to that version , while its "" black list "" ( its α-counter ) is updated . As mentioned in Chapter 6 , research studies have shown that , whatever the threshold , the α-count is bound to exceed it when the fault is permanent or intermittent . In the latter case , therefore , sooner or later the second strategy is to be executed , permanently removing the faulty version . It is worth noting how the adoption of such a scheme , which is no longer purely based on masking the occurrence of a fault , in general implies an execution overhead that may violate the expected real-time behavior – during error-recovery . Further support towards graceful degradation when spares are exhausted could also be foreseen . 5 6 7 8 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 48 49 IF statement .

Note how , at line 37 , the state information of task 2 is found to be equal to "" 9999 "" ( HAS FAILED ) . As a consequence , a number of actions are executed in lines 39 – 47 .

For those applications that best match with the MV application-level fault-tolerance approach , and with NVP in particular , those services allow further increase the dependability without being detrimental to SC – i.e. , without intruding code . Eligible applications include coarse-grained , distributed or parallel applications , i.e. , those addressed by RεL . SA is clearly limited to the above class of provisions . A has not been considered here , but the code separation of ARIEL could be used to achieve some adaptability . Furthermore , safety-critical parallel or distributed airborne and spaceborne applications appear to be well addressed by those services . It must be remarked , though , that the safety-critical character of these applications calls for specific framework-level and system-level support , such as the one provided by the GUARDS architecture ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , a generic , parameterizable hardware and OS architecture for real-time systems , which straightforwardly supports the NVP scheme . 4 COMPOSING DEPENDABLE MECHANISMS : THE REDUNDANT WATCHDOG This section describes how it is possible to compose dependable mechanisms addressing specific needs by means of the RεL architecture devised in TIRAN . The case reported in the rest of this section originated by a requirement of one of the TIRAN partners , ENEL SpA . In present day's fault-tolerance systems at ENEL , a hardware watchdog timer is available and integrated in several of their automation applications . Such device is a custom ( non-COTS ) hardware component that is capable of guaranteeing both high availability and high integrity . This allows its use in contexts where safety is the main concern . As mentioned in Chapter 3 , ENEL has started an internal plan that aims at renewing and enlarging their park of automation systems , also with the goal of improving their efficiency and quality of service . Within this plan , ENEL is investigating the possibility to substitute this hardware device with a software component , exploiting the redundancy of COTS parallel or distributed architectures , in such a way as to guarantee acceptable levels of safety and availability for their applications . While taking part in TIRAN , CESI posed the above problems to the consortium . The TIRAN consortium proposed the solution described in this section , based on the RεL approach . 4.1 An Industrial Problem : The Redundant Watchdog Requirements Technicians of energy automation systems typically express requirements in textual form , capturing the main dependability needs of the applications . Considering the Primary Substation Automation System a list of dependability requirements has been collected and addressed in the TIRAN project ( Botti et al. , 1999 ) . In this section the focus will be on two of those Application Requirements ( referred as AR1 and AR2 below ) that lead to the need of an enhanced watchdog mechanism . They are formulated as follows : AR1 : "" If an erroneous situation can not be recovered according to required mode and within given time constraints , then a mechanism for the auto-exclusion of the system should be provided which , if not reset before the expiration of a pre-fixed time-out , disconnects the system from the plant , leaving the plant in an acceptable state , forcing the output to assume a pre-defined secure configuration , providing appropriate signalling to the operator and to the remote systems ( as automation system failures should not affect the plant ) . "" AR2 : "" The auto-exclusion should guarantee a high availability , integrity and security – e.g. by a redundant and periodically tested mechanism , with auto-diagnostics . "" The auto-exclusion functionality ( as required by AR1 and AR2 ) has been traditionally supported by the so-called plant's watchdog ( plantWD ) mechanism , a dedicated hardware device with high integrity and availability degrees . In most cases the plantWD mechanism is used as an ultimate action of a fault tolerant strategy to detect un-recovered processing errors and to avoid their propagation . Errors are typically run-time violations occurring during the execution of an application process due to , e.g. , a process that has crashed or is slowed down . The watchdog mechanism ( WD ) cyclically sets a timer requiring an application process to explicitly reset it by sending an "" I am alive "" message before it reaches its deadline . If , for any reason , the application process is not able to send the message , the watchdog raises an error condition that has to be treated by some entity in some way . Depending on the global fault tolerance strategy adopted our plantWD is set to count either the double of or the same time of the basic application cycle . In support of the migration to flexible software dependability services running on COTS platforms , the goal of developing a robust , software-based WD mechanism has been addressed by the TIRAN Project . A watchdog basic tool has been implemented characterized by the following Watchdog Requirements ( WR ) and Properties ( WP ) : WR1 : "" The WD has to survive at system reboot or reset , i.e. the memory it allocates for its counter is not to be cleared . "" WR2 : "" In a distributed software architecture the application node's signals have to be put in a logic AND to actually signal the WD , i.e. the WD effectively stops to countdown only if on each node the execution has terminated correctly . "" WR3 : "" The WD has to survive at node failures , i.e. whatever node faults the WD mechanism should be not compromised . "" WR4 : In order to guarantee correct operation of the WD mechanism , it is mandatory that the WD task is running at a higher priority than the tasks ( that run on the same node ) it supervises . WD tasks supervising tasks on other nodes must have appropriate priority to ensure proper operation . It is the responsibility of the application writer to ensure correct partitioning and priority allocation . WP1 : The watchdog task can be placed either on the same node where the application tasks run on or on a different node . WP2 : Placing the watchdog task on the same node where the application task runs on minimizes overhead and detection latency . WP3 : Placing the watchdog task on a different node with respect to the application node lowers the probability of a common failure for both application and watchdog task that would go undetected . WP4 : Detection latency is under the control of the application writer . The higher the frequency of sending "" I 'm alive "" messages , the lower the detection latency . WP5 : Overhead is under the control of the application writer . The lower is the frequency of sending "" I 'm alive "" messages , the lower is the overhead paid by the application task and the communication system . WP6 : WD is just one task which receives system clock ticks and application "" I 'm alive "" messages . Both types of messages are received through interprocess communication and are asynchronous to WD task . WP7 : Being the WD in a distributed software architecture it is able to receive multiple signals and to apply a logical operation on them ( i.e. in the case of the logical operation AND required by WR1 the WD will fire if at least one node does not produce its signal ) . In Section 4 it will be shown how the requirement WR3 above may be fulfilled by instantiating more WD mechanisms and by applying different voting mechanisms to their firings . Such Redundant WatchDog ( RWD ) mechanism is characterized by the following design properties : RWP1 : Processing errors affecting WD replicas can be detected and recovered transparently by the RWD RWP2 : The number of WD replicas and the voting mechanism chosen determine a different improvement of the RWD dependability : e.g. Nreplica = 3 , allows a 2-out-of-3 voting ( which can correct up to 1 fault ) ; the selection of the suitable Nreplica and voting is a compromise among dependability and performance overhead , left to the application writer's experience . RWP3 : WD replicas can be placed all on the same node . This minimizes overhead and detection latency but does not increase the RWD dependability . RWP4 : WD replicas can be placed on different nodes . This minimizes the chance of a common failure affecting each WD replica . 4.2 The Strategy and Its Key Components The strategy proposed within TIRAN exploits the following components : • The Basic Services Library , and specifically its function TIRAN Send , which multicasts a message to a logical , i.e. , a group of tasks . • The configuration support provided by ARIEL . • The TIRAN BB and its DB . • The recovery language ARIEL . • The watchdog Basic Tool , i.e. , a node-local software component in level 1.1 of the TIRAN architecture ( see Chapter 6 for a description of the TIRAN architecture . ) The latter , which executes on a single processing node , can not guarantee the required degree of availability when used as a substitute of the ENEL hardware watchdog . This notwithstanding , the adoption of the above components allowed composing – rather than programming – a new prototypic DM , the so-called Redundant Watchdog ( RW ) . This composition is made in terms of the above elements of the TIRAN framework , with ARIEL playing the role of coordinator . In order to introduce the strategy , the following scenario is assumed : • A distributed system is available , consisting of three nodes , identified as N1 , N2 and N3 . • On each node of this system , a number of application tasks and an instance of the TIRAN watchdog are running . The design goal to be reached is enhancing the dependability of this basic scheme by means of a technique that does not overly increase , at the same time , the complexity of the overall software tool . The adopted strategy is now explained – each step has been tagged with a label describing the main RεL feature being exploited . Configuration : Define and configure the three watchdogs by means of the provisions described in Chapter 6 . In particular , • Assign them the unique-ids W1 , W2 , and W3 . • Specify that , on a missed deadline , a notification is to be sent to the TIRAN BB . • Deploy the watchdogs on different nodes . Configuration : Define logical L , consisting of tasks W1 , W2 , and W3 . Recovery : Define in ARIEL an "" AND-strategy "" , that triggers an alarm when each and every watchdog notifies the BB , an "" OR-strategy "" , in which the alarm is executed when any of the three watchdog expires , and a "" 2-out-of-3 strategy "" , in which a majority of the watchdogs needs to notify the BB in order to trigger the alarm . In the current prototype , the alarm is a notification to the task the unique-id of which is A. The configuration step is coded as in Table 4 . Table 5 lists the recovery actions corresponding to the AND-strategy . When a watched task sends "" watchdog L "" its heartbeats , the Basic Services Library relays these messages to the three watchdogs on the three nodes . In absence of faults , the three watchdogs5 process these message in the same way – each of them in particular resets the internal timer corresponding to the client task that sent the heartbeat . When a heartbeat is missing , the three watchdogs expire and send a notification to the BB , one at the time . The reply of the BB to these notifications is the same : RINT is awoken and the r-codes are interpreted . The difference between the three strategies is then straightforward : • The OR-strategy triggers the alarm as soon as any of the watchdog expires . This tolerates the case in which up to two watchdogs have crashed , or are faulty , or are unreachable . This intuitively reduces the probability that a missing heartbeat goes undetected , hence can be regarded as a "" safety-first "" strategy . At INCLUDE "" watchdogs . h "" TASK { W1 } IS TASK { W2 } IS TASK { W3 } IS NODE { N1 } , TASKID { W1 } NODE { N2 } , TASKID { W2 } NODE { N3 } , TASKID { W3 } WATCHDOG { W1 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG WATCHDOG { W2 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG WATCHDOG { W3 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG LOGICAL { L } IS TASK { W1 } , TASK { W2 } , TASK { W3 } END LOGICAL Table 4 : Configuration of the Redundant Watchdog . IF [ PHASE ( TASK { W1 } ) == { EXPIRE } AND PHASE ( TASK { W2 } ) == { EXPIRE } AND PHASE ( TASK { W3 } ) == { EXPIRE } ] THEN SEND { ALARM } TASK { A } REMOVE PHASE LOGICAL { L } FROM ERRORLIST FI Table 5 : The AND-strategy of the Redundant Watchdog . Action REMOVE resets the phase corresponding to the tasks of logical L. the same time , the probability of "" false alarms "" ( mistakingly triggered alarms ) is increased . Such alarms possibly lead to temporary pauses of the overall system service , and may imply costs . • The AND-strategy , on the other hand , requires that all the watchdogs reach consensus before triggering the system alarm . It decreases the probability of false alarms but at the same time decreases the error detection coverage of the watchdog Basic Tool . It may be regarded as an "" availability-first "" strategy . • Strategy 2-out-of-3 requires that a majority of watchdogs expire before the system alarm is executed . Intuitively , this corresponds to a trade-off between the two above strategies . More sophisticated strategies , corresponding to other design requirements , may also be composed . Other schemes , such as meta-watchdogs ( watchdogs watching other watchdogs ) can also be straightforwardly set up . 5 Cactus Cactus is a design framework and runtime system for implementing and executing configurable services based on an event-driven execution model . As mentioned in Chapter 2 , configurable services such as configurable communication protocols , file systems , database systems , and middleware are a useful approach to explicitate the system and fault model requirements and a useful tool to reach truly portable services , that is systems characterized by dynamic and adaptive system and fault models . One such system is the Configurable Transport Protocol . The Cactus programming model is a clever improvement on the classical layered system design principle : Systems have a macroscopic structure , that is , the traditional layers , called services in the Cactus terminology , and a microscopic structure , that is a web of modules representing the atoms constituting the services and connected non-hierarchically into a network of so-called "" micro-protocols "" . Non-hierarchically means here that there is no communication restriction between modules , which can exchange information and cooperate regardless their macroscopic position ( that is , even though the corresponding services are not contiguous to each other ) . This structuring technique is said to provide the designer with a model coupling enhanced flexibility with the required separation of design concerns . In Cactus micro-protocols communicate through an even-driven execution model . In the above mentioned Configurable Transport Protocol , for instance , all service properties and functional components are implemented as micro-protocols , each of which is a list of event handlers in the familiar form of guarded actions , i.e. , statements structured like in g : a , where g is an event stating a significant change such as the arrival of a message and a is one or more event handler assocuated to the guard g . When g occurs , a is executed . This is clearly the same principle used in the recovery language Ariel discussed in Chapter 6 . The Cactus designers did not choose to develop a custom event-based programming language such as Ariel to specify its guarded actions – instead , they preferred to come up with a set of conventions and a software library . This allowed produce Cactus implementations in several languages , such as C and Java . As explained in ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) , Cactus has been used to build services ranging from low-level communication protocols to group membership and group remote procedure call . Application-level services such as a configurable distributed system monitoring service have also been developed with Cactus . The clever design choices of Cactus place it in between a system like Ariel and library-based approaches ; moreover , several similarities between Cactus and aspect-oriented programming have been pointed out in ( Hiltunen et al. , 2006 ) . One concludes by assessing SC as bad ( the system requires the explicit coding and intertwining of the protocols ) , SA as limited ( by Condor's model and structure ) , and A as potentially good ( though dynamic trading of event handlers , e.g. , appears not to be part of Condor . ) 6 CONCLUSIONS The reported experiences demonstrate how RεL allows fast-prototype complex strategies by composing a set of building blocks together out of those available in the TIRAN framework , and by building system-wide , recovery-time coordination strategies with ARIEL . This allows set up sophisticated fault-tolerance systems while keeping the management of their complexity outside the user application . The compact size of the ARIEL configuration scripts is one of the arguments that can be used as evidence to this claim . Transparency of replication and transparency of location are also reached in this case . No similar support is provided by the application-level fault-tolerance approaches reviewed in Chapters 4 – 6 . As a final remark let us observe how SC is guaranteed here by a custom , separate composition language ( ARIEL ) , that SA is limited to the single class of addressed provisions , and that the possibility to trade off strategies or compose new ones at run-time brings to an excellent degree of A.

Notes 1A read-only tuple is one that can only be read via either rd ( ) or rdp ( ) . rationale behind this decision is that , this way , the user can not produce mock error notifications , which would increase the risk of Byzantine failures ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) . 3 If available , error detection support at driver or kernel level may be also instrumented so to emit ENs . 4 This way , also software design faults would be addressed . 5 In this case study , three instances of the same software component have been used . Clearly this does not protect the system from design faults in the watchdog component itself . Using NVP when developing the watchdogs may possibly guarantee statistical independence between failures . 2 The page MEASURING AND ASSESSING TOOLS 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES As mentioned in Chapter 1 , a service's dependability must be justified in a quantitative way and proved through extensive on-field testing and fault injection , verification and validation techniques , simulation , source-code instrumentation , monitoring , and debugging . An exhaustive treatment of all these techniques falls outside the scope of this book , nevertheless the author feels important to include in this text an analysis of the effect on dependability of some of the methods that have been introduced in previous chapters . 2 RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE TIRAN DISTRIBUTED VOTING MECHANISM As mentioned in Chapter 9 , a number of applications are structured in such a way as to be straightforwardly embedded in a fault-tolerance architecture based on redundancy and consensus . Applications belonging to this class are , for instance , parallel airborne and spaceborne applications . The TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism provides application-level support to these applications . This section analyses the effect on reliability of the enhancements to the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism described in the mentioned chapter , that is , management of spares , dealt with in Sect . 2.1 , and fault-specific recovery strategies supported by the α-count feature , analysed in Sect . 2.2 . 2.1 Using ariel to Manage Spares This section analyses the influence of one of the features offered by ariel – its ability to manage spare modules in N - modular redundant systems – that has been introduced and discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 9 . Reliability can be greatly improved by this technique . Let us first consider the following equation : R ( 0 ) ( t ) = 3R ( t ) 2 − 2R ( t ) 3 , ( 1 ) i.e. , the equation expressing the reliability of a TMR system with no spares , R ( t ) being the reliability of a single , non-replicated ( simplex ) component . Equation ( 1 ) can be derived for instance via Markovian reliability modeling under the assumption of independence between the occurrence of faults ( Johnson , 1989 ) . With the same technique and under the same hypothesis it is possible to show that , even in the case of non-perfect error detection coverage , this equation can be considerably improved by adding one spare . This is the equation resulting from the Markov model in Fig. 1 , expressed as a function of error recovery coverage ( C , defined as the probability associated with the process of identifying the failed module out of those available and being able to switch in the spare ( Johnson , 1989 )) and time ( t ) : R ( 1 ) ( C , t ) = ( − 3C 2 + 6C ) × [ R ( t ) ( 1 − R ( t )) ] 2 + R ( 0 ) ( t ) . ( 2 ) Appendix A gives some mathematical details on Eq. ( 2 ) . Adding more spares obviously implies further improving reliability . In general , for any N ≥ 3 , it is possible to consider a class of monotonically increasing reliability functions , ( R ( M ) ( C , t )) M > 0 , ( 3 ) corresponding to systems adopting N + M replicas . Depending on both cost and reliability requirements , the user can choose the most-suited values for M and N. Note how quantity ( 2 ) is always greater than quantity ( 1 ) as R ( 0 ) ( t ) and ( − 3C 2 + 6C ) are always positive for 0 < C ≤ 1 . Figure 2 compares Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the general case while Fig. 3 covers the case of perfect coverage . In the latter case , the reliability of a single , non-redundant ( simplex ) system is also portrayed . Note furthermore how the crosspoint between the three-and-one-spare system and the non-redundant system is considerably lower than the crosspoint between the latter and the TMR system – R ( t ) ≈ 0.2324 vs. R ( t ) = 0.5 . The reliability of the system can therefore be increased from the one of a pure NMR system to that of N-and-M-spare systems ( see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ) . 2.2 Using the α-count Feature As it has been already mentioned , the TRANSIENT clause of ariel , exploiting the α-count fault identification mechanism introduced in Chapter 6 , can be adopted to associate different recovery or reconfiguration strategies : • To the detection of a permanent or intermittent fault , in general requiring reconfiguration and redundancy exhaustion , • and to the detection of a transient fault , that could be tolerated with a recovery technique such as resetting the faulty component . This section describes a simple Markov reliability model of a TMR system discriminating between these two cases . Figure 4 shows the model . T is the probability that the current fault is a transient one and R is the probability of Figure 1 : Markov reliability model for a TMR-and-1-spare system . λ is the failure rate , C is the error recovery coverage factor . A "" fail safe "" state is reached when the system is no more able to correctly perform its function , though the problem has been safely detected and handled properly . In ' Fail unsafe , ' on the contrary , the system is incorrect , though the problem has not been handled or detected . Every other state is labeled with three digits , d1 d2 d3 , such that d1 is the number of non-faulty modules in the TMR system , d2 is the number of nonfaulty spares ( in this case , 0 or 1 ) , and d3 is the number of undetected , faulty modules . The initial state , 310 , has been highlighted . This model is solved by Eq. ( 2 ) . Figure 2 : Graphs of Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as functions of C and of R. Note how the graph of ( 2 ) is strictly above the other . successful recovery for a component affected by a transient fault . To simplify the model , recovery is assumed to be instantaneous . The system degrades only when permanent faults occur . Solving the model brings to the following equation : α Rtmr ( t ) = 3 exp − 2 ( 1 − RT ) λt − 2 exp − 3 ( 1 − RT ) λt . ( 4 ) Eq. 4 can be written as α Rtmr ( t ) = 3R ( t ) 2 ( 1 − RT ) − 2R ( t ) 3 ( 1 − RT ) , ( 5 ) with R ( t ) the reliability of the simplex system . Note how , in a sense , the introduction of the α-count technique results in a modification of the exponents of Eq. 1 by a factor equal to 1 − RT . In general , the resulting system shows a reliability that is larger than the one of a TMR system . Figure 5 compares these reliabilities . As it is evident from that image , the crosspoint between the reliability graphs of the simplex and that of the TMR system extended with the α-count technique is in general lower . Its exact value is given by the function crosspoint ( R , T ) = 0.51 / ( 1 − RT ) , which is drawn in Fig. 6 . 1 0.8 0.6 Reliability 0.4 0.2 0 TMR-and-1-spare TMR non-redundant system 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Simplex Reliability 0.8 1 Figure 3 : Graphs of Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) when C = 1 ( perfect error detection coverage ) . The reliability of a single , non-redundant system is also portrayed . 3 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF REDUNDANT VARIABLES In Chapter 4 the concept of redundant variables was introduced : Data structures in which the degree of replication is not fixed once and for all at design time , but changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . Here it is shown how the performance of our approach was analyzed . In order to analyze our system , a simulator , called "" scrambler "" was developed . Our scrambler tool allows to simulate a memory , to protect it with redundant variables , to inject memory faults ( bit flips or "" bursts "" corrupting series of contiguous cells ) , and to measure the amount of redundancy actually used . Scrambler interprets a simple scripting language consisting of the following commands : SLEEP s , which suspends the execution of the scrambler for s seconds , SCRAMBLE n , p , which repeats n times action "" scramble a pseudo-random memory cell with probability p "" , BURST n , p , l , which repeats n times action "" scramble l contiguous cells with probability p "" , Figure 4 : The Markov reliability model of a TMR system that gracefully degrades in the presence of a permanent or intermittent fault and "" cleans up "" ( that is , rejuvenates ) the components affected by transient faults . 1 0.8 0.6 Reliability 0.4 0.2 0 simplex tmr tmr + α-count 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Simplex Reliability 0.8 1 Figure 5 : Reliability of a simplex system , of a TMR system , and of a modified TMR system exploiting the α-count fault identification technique . In this case T is 50 % and R = 0.6 . Figure 6 : The crosspoint between the graph of the reliability of the simplex α system and that of Rtmr as a function of R and T. END , which terminates the simulation . The above commands can be used to compose a complex sequence of fault injections . As an example , the following script , corresponds to the following configuration : no faults for 1 second , then various disturbances occurring with Gaussian distribution1 , then no disturbances again for 5 seconds : SLEEP 1 // sleep 1 sec SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.1053992 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( - 3 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.3678794 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( - 2 ) BURST 2000 , 0.7788008 , 10 // execute 2000 bursts of 10 // contiguous cells // with probability f ( - 1 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 1 // scramble 2000 random cells BURST 2000 , 0.7788008 , 10 // execute 2000 bursts of 10 // contiguous cells // with probability f ( 1 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.3678794 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( 2 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.1053992 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( 3 ) SLEEP 5 // sleep 5 secs END // stop injecting faults The idea behind these scripts is to be able to represent executions where a program is subjected to environmental conditions that vary with time and range from ideal to heavily perturbed . Scenarios like these ones are common , e.g. , in applications servicing primary substation automation systems ( Deconinck , De Florio , Dondossola , & Szanto , 2003 ) or spaceborne applications ( Oey & Teitelbaum , 1981 ) . In the following a few experiments are described , together with the results obtained with scrambler . All our experiments have been carried out with an array of 20000 redundant 4-byte cells and an allocation stride of 20 ( that is , replicas of a same logical cell are spaced by 20 physical cells ) . In all the reported experiments the following script was run : SLEEP 1 SCRAMBLE SCRAMBLE SLEEP 3 SCRAMBLE SCRAMBLE END 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 Concurrently with the execution of this script , 1500000 read accesses were performed in round robin across the array . The experiments record the number of scrambled cells and the number of read failures . Scrambler makes use of standard C function "" rand "" , which depends on an initial seed to generate each pseudo-random sequence . In the reported experiments the same value has been kept for the seed , so as to produce exactly the same sequences in each experiment . 3.1 Experiment 1 : Fixed , low redundancy In this first experiment scrambler was executed with fixed ( non adaptive ) redundancy 3 . Table 1 shows the setting of this experiment . The main conclusion one can draw from this run is that a statically redundant data structures provision in this case fails 193 times : In other words , for 193 times it was not possible to find a majority of replicas in agreement , and the system reported a read access failure . The total number of memory accesses is proportional to 3 × 1500000 × k , where k > 0 depends on the complexity of the redundant read operation . 3.2 Experiment 2 : Fixed , higher redundancy Also experiment 2 has fixed redundancy , this time equal to 5 . Table 2 shows the setting of this new experiment . Main conclusion is that the higher redundancy is enough to guarantee data integrity in this case : No read access failures are experienced .

No failures are observed , but the employed redundancy is mostly of degree 3 . 3.3 Experiment 3 : Adaptive Redundancy In this last experiment adaptive redundancy was enabled and initially set to 5 . Table 3 shows the resulting setting . Most worth noting is the fact that also in this case no read access failures show up , but the actual amount of redundancy required to reach this result is much lower . Consequently , also the total number of memory accesses , proportional to ( 3 × 1455404 + 5 × 6054 + 7 × 28967 + 9 × 9576 ) × k , is considerably lower . Figure 7 shows how redundancy varies during the first 100000 read cycles . During this time frame no fault injection takes place . This is captured by our adaptation strategy , which decreases redundancy to 3 after 1000 cycles . Figure 8 depicts an interval where several fault injections do take place . These events are detected and trigger several adaptations . 3.4 Conclusions The analysis of the performance of one of the application-level approaches introduced in Chapter 4 , namely redundant variables , was described . The Figure 7 : The first 100000 cycles of experiment 3 ( Sect . 3.3 ) . Note how redundancy drops to its minimum after the first 1000 cycles . Figure 8 : A section of experiment 3 in which fault injection takes place . Note how redundancy changes accordingly . main focus here was on the methods and tools used to assess , in a quantitative way , the properties of our tool . 4 A TOOL FOR MONITORING AND FAULT INJECTION To conclude this chapter a distributed , multimedia application for monitoring and fault injection is described . Such application was developed in the framework of Project EFTOS ( Embedded Fault-Tolerant Supercomputing , already introduced in Chapter 3 ) . It dynamically sets up a hierarchy of HTML pages reflecting the current status of an EFTOS-compliant dependable application running on a Parsytec CC system . These pages are fed to a WWW browser playing the role of hypermedia monitor . The adopted approach allows the user to concentrate on the high-level aspects of his / her application so as to quickly assess the validity of their dependability assumptions . This view of the system lends itself well for being coupled with a tool to interactively inject software faults in the user application . 4.1 Introduction As systems get more and more complex , the need for a one-look snapshot of their activity is indeed ever increasing . This need has been strongly felt by the people involved in Project EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ) , whose aim was to set up a software framework for integrating fault-tolerance into embedded distributed high-performance applications in a flexible and easy way . Through the adoption of the EFTOS framework , the target application running on a parallel computer is plugged into a hierarchical , layered system whose structure and basic components have been described in detail in Chapter 3 : • at the lowest level , a set of parameterizable functions managing error detection ( Dtools ) and error recovery ( Rtools ) . EFTOS supplies a number of these Dtools and Rtools , plus an API for incorporating user-defined EFTOS-compliant tools ; • at the middle level , the DIR net ( detection , isolation , and recovery network ) is available to coherently combine Dtools and Rtools , to ensure consistent strategies throughout the whole system , and to play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the fault-tolerance elements . To fulfill these requirements , the DIR net makes use of processes called Manager , Agents , and Backup Agents ; • at the highest level , these elements are combined into dependable mechanisms e.g. , methods to guarantee fault-tolerant communication , voting methods and so on . As explained in Chapter 3 , during the lifetime of the application the EFTOS framework guards the service from a series of possible deviations from the expected behavior ; this is done by executing detection , isolation , and reconfiguration tasks . For instance , a memory access exception caught in a thread by a trap handling Dtool may trigger a relocation of that thread elsewhere in the system . As another example , if an error is detected which affects a component of the DIR net itself , say a Manager , then the system will isolate that component and elect another one ( actually , one of the Backup Agents ) as the DIR Manager . In order to allow the user to keep track of events such as those sketched above , the DIR net continuously prints on the system console short textual descriptions . Evidently such a linear , unstructured listing of events pertaining to different aspects of different actions taking place in different points of the user application , does not make up the best of mechanisms to gain insight in the overall state of the fault-tolerant system . On the contrary , a hierarchical , dynamic view of the structure and behavior of that system , including : • Its current shape ( on which node which components are running , and their topology ) , • the current state of its components ( for instance , whether they are regarded to be correct , faulty , or are being recovered ) , • each component's running history , appeared much more attractive . Two main advantages from the adoption of such a strategy were expected to be : • ( At design and system validation time ) the possibility to assist the user assessing and / or validating his / her EFTOS-based fault-tolerance design , • ( at run time ) the possibility to shorten the latency between the occurrence of the event , its comprehension , and a proper reaction at user level2 . This text describes the architectural solution that was successfully adopted within EFTOS to easily and quickly develop a tool fulfilling the above stated needs – a portable , highly customizable hypermedia monitor for the EFTOS applications making use of cheap , ready available off-the-shelf software components like e.g. , an Internet Browser . It also shows how our monitor supplies the user with the needed structured information , and how it proved its usefulness within EFTOS . In particular an extension is described by means of which our monitor can be turned into a versatile tool for fault-injection . 4.2 Design Requirements In order to quickly deliver human-comprehensible information from the gigantic data stream produced by an EFTOS application , two needs have been assessed : • Deriving a hierarchical representation of the data . ( Most of the produced data is available , but it has to be organized and made browsable in "" layers "" : – At the highest level , only the logical structure of the application should be displayed : Which nodes are used , the EFTOS components executed on each node , and their overall state ; – at a medium level , a concise description of the events pertaining to each particular node should be made available ; – at the lowest level , a deeper description of each particular event may also be supplied on user-demand ) , • the use of multimedia . "" An image is worth a thousand words "" , they say , and maybe even more insight can be derived from the extensive use of colors , sounds , video-clips and so on . For instance , re-coloring a green image to red may lead the user into realizing that a previously fault-free state has turned into a problem . The use of colors traditionally associated to meanings , or whose meaning can be borrowed from well-known everyday situations ( e.g. , those of traffic lights ) further speeds up the delivery of the information to the user . Both aspects were already available in Internet browsers available at the time of EFTOS , such as Netscape , which were able to render hierarchies of dynamically produced HTML ( Berners-Lee & Connolly , 1995 ) pages . Therefore it was decided to develop a distributed application piloting an Internet browser that in turn plays the role of a hypermedia renderer for the EFTOS system activity . This product , called the EFTOS Monitor , is described in the following sections . 4.3 The Architecture of the EFTOS Monitor The EFTOS Monitor basically consists of three components ( see Fig. 9 ) : 1 . A client module , to be run by the DIR net ; 2 . an "" intermediate "" module , to be run by a number of Common Gateway Interface ( Kim , 1996 ) ( CGI ) scripts ; 3 . the "" renderer "" i.e. , an Internet browser . • The client part , together with the DIR net and the user application , runs on a Parsytec CC system ( Parsytec , 1996b ) , a distributed-memory MIMD supercomputer consisting of powerful processing nodes based on PowerPC 604 at 133MHz , dedicated high-speed links , I / O modules and Figure 9 : The architecture of the EFTOS Monitor : the CGI scripts and the EFTOS application share the same file system and communicate via a socket stream : Each time a new event takes place , the DIR net updates a special database ( 1 ) and sends a notification to the main CGI script ( 2 ) . The latter reads the database ( 3 ) on the arrival of the notification and converts it into a HTML hypertext , which is then fed back ( 4 ) to a Netscape or another Internet browser for hypermedia rendering . The client part of the Monitor is integrated in the DIR net Manager process . routers . The system adopts the thread processing model ; as mentioned in Chapter 3 , threads communicate via a proprietary message passing library called EPX ( Parsytec , 1996a ) ( Embedded Parallel extensions to uniX ) . The main tasks of the client module are the set up and management of a database maintaining an up-to-date snapshot of the system activity , including the current mapping of the DIR net's components onto the processing nodes and the state and current activity of each component . This module also connects to the intermediate part via TCP sockets ( as described for instance in ( Comer , 1993 )) and sends it signals at the very beginning and on each state transition . • The intermediate module consists of a hierarchy of CGI scripts spawned by an Apache HTTP ( Berners-Lee , Fielding , & Frystyk , 1996 ; Fielding et al. , 1997 ) server , all running on the workstation hosting the CC system . The root script of this hierarchy connects with the client module and acts as a TCP server : for each new stimulus , the snapshot file is read over and a HTML document is produced and fed to the renderer . A connection is also started up with this latter so as to be able to interact with it without the intervention of the HTTP daemon : Having done so , one CGI script may stay alive and produce multiple HTML requests . This special feature is known as "" non-parsing header "" ( NPH ) mode ( Kim , 1996 ) . Logically speaking , one may say that the intermediate module acts as a gateway between the CC system and the hypermedia renderer . Like mythical Janus ( the god of gates , doors and doorways ( Janus , n.d. ) ; in Italian , Giano ) , one "" face "" of the system is turned to the client module and gathers its requests , while a second one is turned to the renderer and translates those requests in HTML . Because of this its main component has been called cgiano . • The third component , the renderer , is a browser playing the role of a server able to display HTML data . The application is started in two steps via a shell script whose first task is to run the renderer ( or to reconnect to a previously run renderer : This latter is possible using e.g. , remote control extensions ( Zawinski , 1994 ) or an approach based on the Common Client Interface mechanism . The renderer is run with a uniform resource locator ( URL ) pointing to the root-level CGI script , which connects to Netscape in NPH-mode and starts listening for a TCP connection . As a second step , the shell script spawns the parallel application on the CC system . Then the application launches the DIR net and the Monitor's client module . The latter initializes the snapshot files , connects to the CGI script and sends it the first signal . The script reacts to that stimulus by translating the main snapshot file in HTML and requesting the renderer to display it . The top-left image in Fig. 10 shows a typical output of this phase : The EFTOS application appears to the user as an HTML table depicting the processing nodes in the user partition . The state of each module is illustrated by means of colors ( green is "" OK "" , red is "" not OK "" , yellow means that the module is currently being recovered , and so on ) . In this way the user can immediately perceive whether a node is ready or not and which actions are carried out on it , as asked for in the requirements ( Sect . 4.2 . ) Information displayed in this HTML document only covers the logical structure of the application . If the user "" clicks "" any icon on this page , a high-level hypertextual description of the DIR net-events pertaining to that specific node is displayed in a separate browser ( see Fig. 10 , Window "" Node-specific Information "" ) . To keep this page up to date , an automatic reload is periodically performed . This technique is explained e.g. , in ( Kim , 1996 ) . This secondary document is in turn a hypertext whose links point to in-depth descriptions of each specific event ( see Fig. 10 , Window "" Attached Information . "" ) 4.4 Architecture Assessment A number of observations may be drawn upon the above presented architecture ; in particular : • Our architecture is based on unmodified , low-cost , off-the-shelf hypermedia components . • It is open , in the sense that the architecture is based on wide-spread standards e.g. , the use of uniform resource locators within a World-Wide Web interconnection , the HTML language , TCP / IP sockets , the MIME classification , and so on ; • It is distributed , and in particular the renderer may run on any X11-compliant Display Server , including remote PCs running Cygwin / X11 . A possible alternative was to develop a custom application to play as a tailored monitoring tool . As an example , Scientific Computing Associates' TupleScope visual debugger is a custom X-based visualization and debugging tool for parallel programs using the LINDA approach introduced in Chapter 4 . This may result in higher performance and possibly be more flexible but of course : • It reasonably requires more time to develop even for a simple prototype ; • it requires custom design and development choices that may impact portability and supported features e.g. , which software development environment and specifically which language and which libraries to use , or whether to restrict the hypermedia rendering to images or to use sounds as well – these choices may be simply skipped in our approach ; • distribution and hypermedia issues call for specific support which turn into higher costs and longer times . For instance , TupleScope runs with the user application by adding a special linking option at compile time to the user application ; this means it has been developed on purpose as a custom X11 application . Though it perfectly addresses its own goals , it has limited rendering capabilities ( it only deals with static images ) and would certainly require non-negligible efforts to adapt it towards other media . Moreover , TupleScope is available on a number of platform , though the costs of this portability and consequent support are certainly not negligible as well . 4.5 A Tool for Fault Injection The same approach used to monitor the state of an EFTOS-compliant application is also effective in order to actively interact with it . Considering once again Fig. 9 , a control path may be drawn starting from the user at his / her browser , then crossing a CGI script , and eventually reaching the user application . It is therefore fairly possible to add a layer to the hierarchy of HTML pages dynamically created by the intermediate modules so that the user may freely choose among a certain set of malicious actions to bring against an EFTOS application , including for instance : • An integer division-by-zero , • a segmentation violation , Figure 10 : The three windows of the EFTOS Monitor . In window 1 ( "" Global view "" ) , the visual column contains graphical hyperlinks pointing to second-level information about the corresponding processing node at the same row . Configuration is the DIR net-role . Status may be one of the following values : OK , Faulty , Isolated , Recovering , and Killed . Some minor information is also displayed at the bottom of the page . The right-hand hypertext ( window "" Node-specific information "" ) is the result of "" clicking "" on the top circular icon and enumerates the actions that have just taken place on node 0 , fresher-to-older . The elapsed time ( in seconds ) corresponding to each event is displayed . Underlined sentences may be further expanded by clicking on them e.g. , the bottom-left image reports about action number 115 of the hypertext . Figure 11 : The recursive loop of fault injection and monitoring . • a link failure , • rebooting a processing node , • killing a thread . These requests would then reach a CGI script , be translated in appropriate system - or application-level actions , which would then be executed or turned into fault-injection requests to be fulfilled by the DIR Manager . As an example of system-level action , the CGI script may directly execute a system command to reboot one node in the CC system . As of application-level actions , the Manager may for instance ask the trap handler tool ( see Chapter 3 ) to trigger a specific signal like SIGSEGV ( segmentation violation ) on a certain thread ; or it may request a watchdog timer tool ( again , described in Chapter 3 ) on a particular node to behave like if it had detected a time-out . As a direct consequence of the injection of these faults , a number of detection , isolation , and recovery actions take place on the system according to the EFTOS-based fault-tolerance strategies adopted by the designer in his / her application . These actions will then be reported in the snapshot files and displayed by the Monitor . This process , summarized in Fig. 11 , may be modeled after a recursive loop like follows : do { Inject fault ; Observe feed-back ; Derive conclusions ; Correct the fault tolerance model ; } while ( model is unsatisfying ) . This procedure should result in a useful tool for rapidly assessing a design , trying alternative fault-tolerance strategies , and overloading the system with malicious attacks aiming at verifying its resilience , with a quick and meaningful feed-back from the system . 4.6 Conclusions A distributed application has been presented , for monitoring the fault tolerance aspects of an embedded parallel application and for interactively injecting faults into it . The overall system makes up an integrated environment in which • the application , • a graphical rendering of the results , and • real-time interactions cyclically evolve . By doing so the researcher is made able to verify the hypothesis he / she is formulating about the system . The design choice to adopt low-cost , off-the-shelf components for hypermedia rendering revealed to be cost-effective , speed up the development process , match the design requirements , and pave the way towards more ambitious capabilities and features . In particular , the use of an Internet browser as hypermedia renderer allows inherit the benefits of the volcanic evolutions of web services , HTML languages , HTTP protocol , multimedia capabilities of the browsers , and so on . The high degree of openness proven by this heterogeneous application basing itself on uniform communication mechanisms and standardized access interfaces guarantees portability and makes it also a good starting point towards the development of similarly structured applications ranging from remote equipment control to hypermedia multi-user environments . The deeper insight gained from the EFTOS Monitor on the run-time aspects of our dependable applications has turned it into an invaluable tool to speed up the development of our application-level fault-tolerance provisions . 5 CONCLUSION We have described three examples of approaches used to assess the dependability of application-level provisions : Reliability analysis is used to quantify the benefits of coupling an approach such as recovery languages to a distributed voting mechanism ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) ; a custom tool is used to systematically inject faults onto the adaptively redundant data structure discussed in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008 ) ; a hypermedia application to watch and control a dependable service is then used for monitoring and fault-injection ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . A MATHEMATICAL DETAILS RELATED TO EQ . 2 The basic steps leading to Eq. 2 , i.e. , are described in what follows . The Markov reliability model of Fig. 1 brings to the following set of equations : The above equations can be written as follows : For any state s , let us now call Ls = L ( ps ( t )) , where L is the Laplace transform . Furthermore , as ( 310 ) is the initial state , it is reasonable to assume that p310 ( 0 ) = 1 and ∀ s 6 = ( 310 ) : ps ( 0 ) = 0 . Then taking the limit of the above equations as ∆ t goes to zero and taking the Laplace transform brings to Inverting the Laplace transform , the following probabilities can be found : ( only useful states have been computed ) . Let us denote with R the reliability of the basic component of the system , i.e. , exp − λt , and Rtmr as the reliability of the TMR system based on the same component . The reliability of the three and one spare system , R ( 1 ) ( C , t ) , is given by the sum of the above probabilities : which proves Eq. ( 2 ) . References Berners-Lee , T. J. , & Connolly , D.

Three well-known accidents have been presented and interpreted in view of coverage failures in the fault and system models . • Next , the critical role of the system structure for the expression of fault-tolerance in computer applications was put forth : From this stemmed the three properties characterizing any application-level fault-tolerance protocol : Separation of concerns , adequacy to host different solutions , and support for adaptability . Those properties address the following question : Given a certain fault-tolerance provision , is it able to guarantee an adequate separation of the functional and non-functional design concerns ? Does it tolerate a fixed set of faulty scenarios , or does it dynamically change that set ? And , is it flexible enough as to host a large number of different strategies ? 309 Figure 1 : Application-level software fault-tolerance protocols according to the three structural attributes sc , sa , and a . • Then it has been shown that there exist a large number of techniques and hence of system structures able to enhance the fault-tolerance of the application . Each of these techniques has its pros and cons , which we tried to point out as best as we could . We also attempted to qualify each technique with respect to the above mentioned properties1 . A summary of the results of this process is depicted in Fig. 1 . • Another key message is that complexity is a threat to dependability , and we must make sure that the extra complexity to manage fault-tolerance does not become another source of potential failures . In other words , simplicity must be a key ingredient of our fault-tolerance protocols , and a faulty fault-tolerant software may produce the same consequence of a faulty non fault-tolerant software – or maybe direr . • Finally , we showed with some examples that adaptive behaviour is the only way to match the ever mutating and unstable environments characterizing mobile systems . As an example , static designs would make bad use of the available redundancy . As the reader will have noticed , this book also has different levels of deepenings : Some approaches are sketched , some others are explained in deep detail . As mentioned already this is due to the fact that this book represents the author's current vision and summa of personal experiences . This is particularly true for ariel , the system described in Chapter 7 . ariel is described in large detail there , then used in Chapter 10 in two of the hybrid cases described there . One of its component , the DIR net , is described in detail in Chapter 9 . Finally , in what follows , a view to the internals of the ariel system is provided so as to give the reader an idea of how a fault-tolerance architecture for the application layer was actually implemented .

Those properties address the following question : Given a certain fault-tolerance provision , is it able to guarantee an adequate separation of the functional and non-functional design concerns ? Does it tolerate a fixed set of faulty scenarios , or does it dynamically change that set ? And , is it flexible enough as to host a large number of different strategies ? 312 Figure 1 : Application-level software fault-tolerance protocols according to the three structural attributes sc , sa , and a . • Then we have shown that there exist a large number of techniques and hence of system structures able to enhance the fault-tolerance of the application . Each of these techniques has his pros and cons , which we tried to point out as best as we could . We also attempted to qualify each technique with respect to the above mentioned properties1 . A summary of the results of this process is depicted in Fig. 1 . • Another key message is that complexity is a threat to dependability , and we must make sure that the extra complexity to manage fault-tolerance does not become another source of potential failures . In other words , simplicity must be a key ingredient of our fault-tolerance protocols , and a faulty fault-tolerant software may produce the same consequence of a faulty non fault-tolerant software – or maybe direr . • Finally , we showed with some examples that adaptive behaviour is the only way to match the ever mutating and unstable environments characterizing mobile systems . As an example , static designs would make bad use of the available redundancy . As the reader will have noticed , this book also has different levels of deepenings : Some approaches are sketched , some others are explained in deep detail . As mentioned already this is due to the fact that this book represents the author's current vision and summa of personal experiences . This is particularly true for ariel , the system described in Chapter 7 . ariel is described in large detail there , then used in Chapter 10 in two of the hybrid cases described there . One of its component , the DIR net , is described in detail in Chapter 9 . Finally , in what follows , a view to the internals of the ariel system is provided so as to give the reader an idea of how a fault-tolerance architecture for the application layer was actually implemented . I trust this to be particularly useful to young researchers in the initial phase of a master or doctoral program in resilient computing . We provide in what follows an introduction to Lex and YACC , two tools that are often useful when dealing with linguistic structures for computers . The provided information is not a full manual , which would be out of the scope of this book , but more a summary of the minimal information required to fully comprehend the next section , devoted to the ariel internals . Enjoy ! A TOOLS FOR TRANSLATORS AND COMPILERS : LEX AND YACC This section describes two well-known tools for crafting efficient translators and compilers : The LEX lexical analyzer and the YACC syntactical analyzer . A. 1 Introduction The capability to compose valid sentences in a given language , as well as to verify that a given string represents a valid sentence in a given language builds upon two lower-level capabilities : 1 . Classification , which is the ability to turn a stream of characters into a stream of lexical entities ( words , punctuation , delimiters ) , and 2 . Verification , that is , the ability to recognize the syntactical correctness of a sentence , starting from a stream of lexical entities . The first capability is also known as lexical analysis , the second as syntactical analysis . Given , for instance , the mathematical expression : p sin ( a + ( 0 . 4 )) , the first capability means translating the stream of characters representing the above expression , i.e. ( ' s ' , ' i ' , ' n ' , ' ' , ' ( ' , ' a ' , ... ) , into a stream of tokens , or syntactical atoms : ( "" sin "" , ' ( ' , "" a "" , ' + ' , "" sqrt "" , ... ) ; Syntactical analysis is indeed the tool that allows us to verify the syntactical correctness of a sentence , given a certain set of rules , called "" grammar "" – in the above example , the grammar of well-formed mathematical formulae . The above mentioned capabilities are experienced by human beings as inherent and natural abilities , of which one has not even full awareness . When one has to set up , e.g. , an interpreter of a computer language , or any other software module that needs recognize a given structure in its input stream , then it is useful to set up a hierarchical structure at the base of which there are tools for lexical and syntactical analysis . Such tools are software systems that ease the development of lexical and syntactical analyzers . Two well known standard utilities for this are LEX and YACC ( or their GNU counterpart , Flex and Bison ) . LEX and YACC allow to speed up considerably the development of parsers , translators , compilers , interpreter , conversion tools and have been used for more than 20 years by the author of this book to craft various tools , including those described in this chapter and in chapters 7 , 10 , and 11 . LEX and YACC have been especially designed for combined use and for hosting user-defined C routines . Custom versions supporting C ++ and Java also exist . In what follows we strictly follow the following two sources : ( Levine , Mason , & Brown , 1992 ) and ( Johnson , 1975 ) . A. 2 The LEX Lexical Analyzer LEX may be defined as a "" tokenizator "" : Given a stream of chars , LEX performs a classification of groups of contiguous characters . These groups are called tokens , i.e. , words and symbols that are atomic from the viewpoint of syntactical analysis . For instance , LEX can translate string sin ( a + sqrt ( 0 . 4 )) in a set of couples "" ( token , token number ) "" , e.g. , as follows : • "" sin "" , FUNCTION • "" ( "" , ' ( ' • and so forth . The token number identifies the class the token belongs to . LEX can be used • either as a stand-alone tool , so to perform simple translations or compute statistics on the lexical atoms , • or in conjunction with a parser generator . YACC is the natural choice , but it is always possible to choose another parser . LEX writes a deterministic finite state automaton from a list of regular expressions . Regardless the number of rules supplied by the user , and regardless their complexity , the LEX finite state automaton breaks the input stream into tokens in a time that is proportional to the length of the input stream . The number of rules and their complexity only influence the size of the output source code . The general structure of a LEX program is as follows : [ Definitions ] %% [ Rules ] [ %% User functions ] Definitions and User functions can be missing . Hence , the minimum size LEX program is the following one : %% LEX performs its classification via a list of regular expressions ( regex ) that the user needs to supply through a standard language . Regex describe patterns of characters to be located in the text . LEX reads these regular expressions and produces a finite state machine that recognizes those patterns . Finite state machines are indeed the simplest conceptual tool with which to recognize words expressed by regex . LEX uses the same regular expressions recognizer used by most of those UNIX tools that offer pattern matching services : vi , sed , awk , find , grep , for instance , adopt a similar set of agreement based on a similar set of "" meta-characters "" , including "" \ [ ] ^ - ? . * + | { } $ / ( ) % < > . ( Perl , archie , and others , adopt slightly different sets ) . In what follows we provide a brief description of the most important among the meta-characters : "" the quotation mark operator is the simplest meta-character : all the characters of a string between quotation marks are interpreted as plain ( non-meta ) characters . [ ... ] Squared parentheses ( pair [ ] ) specify classes of characters . For instance , [ xyz ] means : "" a single x , y or z char "" The hyphen sign between any two chars a and b means that all the chars between ord ( a ) and ord ( b ) are specified . For instance , [ A-Z ] means "" any uppercase letter "" , while [ A-Za-z ] means : "" any letter "" . Furthermore , [ \ 40 - \ 176 ] for instance selects a range of characters , that is , the one between octal ( 40 ) and octal ( 176 ) . [ ^ ... ] Character "" ^ "" , within the squared parentheses , means "" complementary set "" . For instance , [ ^ 0-9 ] means "" any character but the digits "" . \ ( Backslash ) has the same meaning it has , e.g. , in the C language function printf : It turns a meta-character into a plain character .. ( Dot ) means "" any character but ' \ n ' "" . ? The question mark goes after optional strings of characters . For instance , ab ? c means : "" either ' ac ' or ' abc ' "" . * Postfix operator "" star "" means zero or more instances of a given class . As an example , [ ^ a-zA-Z ] * means "" zero or more instances of non-alphabetic chars "" . + Postfix operator "" plus "" means one or more instances of a given class . For instance , [ xyz ] + means "" any non-empty string , of any size , consisting of any of the characters ' x ' , ' y ' and ' z ' "" , such as e.g. xyyyyyyzz . Operators ( ) and | . Parentheses group a set of characters into one object . For instance , in ( xyz ) + , operator + is applied to string xyz . Within a group , the OR between entities is specified via meta-character | . For instance , ( ab | cd + ) ? ( ef ) * means "" zero or more instances of string "" ef "" , possibly preceded either by string ab or by cd + ( c followed by one or more instances of d ) "" . ^ : This char , if not within square parentheses , means "" at begin-of-file or right after a newline . "" $ : This means "" at the end of a line "" or "" at end-of-file "" , i.e. , if the following char is either ' \ n ' or EOF . For instance , ( riga | row ) $ means "" string riga or string row followed either by \ n or by EOF . / : Infix operator slash checks whether an entity is followed by another one . For instance , a / b means "" character a , only when followed by character b "" . Note that ab / \ n is equivalent to ab $ . { } : Curly brackets have two meanings : • When grouping two comma-separated numbers , as in ( xyz ) { 1 , 5 } , they represent a multiple instance . The above example means "" from one to five instances of string xyz "" . • When grouping letters , they represent the value of a regex alias ( see further on ) . % Character % is reserved character , not a meta-character . A LEX source file may include up to three sections ; the first one is the one including the LEX definitions . Definitions include a list of regular expressions : letter letters [ a-zA-Z ] { letter } + This is , so to say , the grammar of the LEX definitions : 1 . At column 1 , an identifier is supplied , 2 . then some blank or tab chars , 3 . and finally a regular expression . After its definition , the identifier becomes an alias for its regular expression . To dereference an alias one has to put curly brackets around it . The Rules section is mainly a list of associations in the form r ⇒ a where r is a regular expression and a is a list of actions , i.e. , user defined C language statements that are executed when the corresponding regular expression is recognized . An example follows : %% begin end printf ( "" { "" ) ; { putchar ( ' } ' ) ; } When no rule is verified , a default rule is executed : ECHO , meaning "" print the current character "" . For readers accustomed to thinking in C , this means that the finite state automaton produced by LEX has a switch statement ending with "" default : ECHO ; . "" Practical consequences of this include , e.g. , that there is no need to supply rules for the so called "" literal tokens , "" i.e. , single characters whose token number is equal to their ASCII code . Another consequence is that in order to "" sift out "" some portion of text from the input stream , one needs recognize it explicitly and to associate a null action to it . As an example , to remove newline characters , one needs write this simple program : %% \ n ; Some simple transformations can be useful in order to facilitate the import of a file . For instance some word processors , such as TEX , regard paragraphs as multiple lines of text separated by two or more line feed characters , while other programs such as Word regard paragraphs as a single line and separate paragraphs with one or more line feed character . When one wants to import some TEX text into Word the following simple script may be useful : %% \ n \ n \ n ECHO ; putchar ( ' ' ) ; It converts every single \ n into a character space . When a regular expression is recognized , the corresponding string ( the token ) is copied in a string pointed by a char * called yytext . This is true also for literal tokens . The corresponding script is similar to the previous one : %% [ ^ \ n ] \ n [ ^ \ n ] { putchar ( yytext [ 0 ] ) ; putchar ( ' ' ) ; putchar ( yytext [ 2 ] ) ; } It is sometimes interesting to take a look at the source code of the program produced by LEX ; for instance , on my system running cygwin and flex , action ECHO turns out to actually be this simple macro : # define ECHO puts ( yytext ) Variable int yyleng is set by LEX to the number of characters of the string that verifies the current rule ; in other words , yyleng == strlen ( yytext ) . The following excerpt shows an example of how to use yyleng : %% [ 0-9 ] + [ a-zA-Z ] + ( . | \ n ) dig + = yyleng ; alp + = yyleng ; oth ++ ; Clearly the above excerpt is not a completely meaningful LEX program : 1 . Variable dig etc. have not been declared . 2 . No output message is provided at the end . Nevertheless , this is not a buggy LEX program : The objective of LEX is to produce a C program , not necessarily an error free one : No checks are done on the syntactic correctness of the output program . Typical situations are that some syntax errors slip in the actions ( indeed , actions are simply copied as strings into the output program ) . Later on we will describe how to introduce C text into the output program so as to declare variables and produce output messages at end of processing time . A number of functions are available to the LEX user : yymore ( ) instructs LEX so that the next matched string is attached to the current value of yytext . An example follows : %% \ "" [ ^ "" ] * { if ( yytext [ yyleng-1 ] == ' \\ ' ) yymore ( ) ; else do_that ( yytext ) ; } yyless ( ) "" sends back "" a given number of characters . This can be very useful in some cases . For instance , in the early days of the C programming language , a = - b had the same meaning of a - = b ( that is , subtract b from a ) . This is no more the case , so the first form could result in a hidden bug when current compilers deal with "" old dusty deck "" software . To detect possible problems one may use the following filter : %% = - [ a-zA-Z ] { printf ( "" Operator = - is ambiguous : "" ) ; printf ( "" not recognized . \ n "" ) ; yyless ( yyleng-2 ) ; manage_assignment ( ) ; } The form yyless ( x ) pushes back onto the input yyleng − x characters . int input ( ) reads the next input character . Character NULL ( bitwise equivalent to ( int ) 0 ) is interpreted as the end-of-file condition ) . void output ( char c ) writes c onto the output stream . void unput ( char c ) "" pushes back "" c into the input stream . The user can choose between a standard version of these functions or make use of his or her own versions of those functions , which must have the same name and prototype . int yywrap ( void ) This system ( or user - ) function is called when an EOF is encountered . The system version of this function returns 1 , which means "" end of processing . "" The user can substitute this function with a new version which , if it returns 0 , lets the execution continue until a new EOF is encountered . By doing so it is possible , e.g. , to process more than one input file during the same run . Another use of yywrap ( ) is to allow the user to specify end-of-job functions ( for instance , printing the final output ) , which is one of the requirement we highlighted for the code fragment at page 319 . LEX adopts two steps to select which user rule to apply : 1 . The rule that recognizes the largest string is always preferred . 2 . If more than one rule recognizes largest strings , it is chosen the rule the user has specified first in the LEX script . Within a same rule , LEX returns the largest possible string : %% \ ' . * \ ' { yytext [ 0 ] = ' [ ' ; yytext [ yyleng-2 ] = ' ] ' ; printf ( "" % s "" , yytext ) ; } produces a program that , when reading an input string such as ' hi ' - he said - ' how are you ? ' , writes the following string on the output : [ hi ' - he said - ' how are you ? ] . When LEX selects which rule to execute , it creates an ordered list of possible candidates . The one to be executed is the one at the top of the list . When that action includes macro REJECT ; the following two actions take place : 1 . The input string is sent back onto the input stream . 2 . The rule is removed from the list . The rule that is selected is therefore the new top one . REJECT is useful , e.g. , to count all the "" digrams "" ( that is , all the couples of contiguous alphabetic characters ) in a given text : %% [ A-Z ] [ a-z ] { ( . | \ n ) digram [ yytext [ 0 ]] [ yytext [ 1 ]] ++ ; REJECT ; } ; Each digram in the text is located by the first rule , as it returns a string of two characters while the second one returns a string of just one character . REJECT writes back the two characters of the digram onto the standard input stream and rejects the first rule . The second one is then executed . As a result , a character is removed from the input stream . LEX allows to include in the output C source code any useful information ( header files , declaration of global variables and so forth ) . An example follows : %% [ a-z ] [ a-z ] { extern int dig [ 26 ] [ 26 ] ; dig [ yytext [ 0 ] - ' a ' ] [ yytext [ 1 ] - ' a ' ] ++ ; REJECT ; } ( . | \ n ) ; %% int dig [ 26 ] [ 26 ] ; int yywrap ( ) { int i , j ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 26 ; i ++ ) for ( j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j ++ ) if ( dig [ i ] [ j ] ) printf ( "" digram [ % c % c ] = % d \ n "" , ' a ' + i , ' a ' + j , dig [ i ] [ j ] ) ; return 1 ; } Inclusion can be done in three "" zones "" of the output source file : 1 . At the end of the file ( as it is done in the above example ) . 2 . At the beginning of the file , that is , before any of the functions . 3 . At the beginning of function yylex ( ) . The three zones in the output source code correspond to the following zones of the LEX script : 1 . In User Functions . 2 . In Definitions , 3 . On top of Rules , i.e. , right after the first %% ; Case 1 is trivial – one has just to write the required C code , as shown in the above example . For 2 and 3 , we need to distinguish the text to be processed by LEX from the text that needs be copied verbatim in the output file . To do so , one can follow any of these ways : • [ t ] + . * ( at least a blank space or tab character at column zero , then the data to be flushed onto the output file . ) • Anything between % { and % } . In most UNIX environments , in order to process a LEX source code available in file source . l , one needs execute the following commands : 1 . lex source . l ( that is we use LEX to translate source . l into the C program lex . yy . c ; the same syntax is used with GNU flex . ) 2 . cc - o output lex . yy . c - ll ( that is we use the C compiler to read the C program produced by LEX and compile it with the assistance of the LEX library , producing an executable file called output . ) 3 . . / output ( that is , we execute the output file . ) File lex . yy . c includes function yylex ( ) i.e. , the actual scanner . Compiling lex . yy . c with the system library libl . a ( or libfl . a in the case of FLEX ) a main ( ) function is automatically supplied , which calls function yylex ( ) . The user can substitute this default main ( ) with one of his or her own design . Doing this , one can choose between either automatically generating an executable or "" pipelining "" LEX output to other programs – for instance , a syntactical analyzer such as YACC . A. 3 Syntactical Analysis with YACC YACC , whose name stands for "" Yet Another Compiler-Compiler , "" has been defined by its authors as a system for describing the input structure of a program . Indeed , the YACC programmer is required to supply : 1 . The syntactical structure of the input , and 2 . C code to be executed when the syntax rules are recognized . On the basis of the above input data , YACC produces a C program with a parsing routine . The parsing routine calls a lower level routine , called yylex ( ) , in order to get the next lexical atoms in the input stream . It goes without saying that LEX produces exactly one such routine . YACC works with grammars of type LALR ( 1 ) , plus rules to solve ambiguities . As its names tell , YACC is just one of many "" compiler compilers "" , and many new powerful syntactical analyzers have been designed , a noteworthy example being ANTLR ( Parr , 2007 ) . Some of them are open software and can be easily downloaded and compiled from the Internet . YACC ( or its GNU sibling , Bison ) is likely to be available on any UNIX distribution , so we decided to focus on its syntax . Another reason to go for YACC with respect to other tools is that its syntax has been designed so as to make it very easy to master its functions for someone who knows LEX already . A. 3 . 1 Structure of a YACC Script The general structure of a YACC script strictly follows the one of a LEX script : [ Definitions ] %% Rules & Actions [ %% User functions ] In particular , the structure of Rules & Actions is similar to the corresponding section of a LEX script : It includes a set of grammar rules , plus actions that are associated to each rule . Each time a rule is recognized , the corresponding actions are executed . Actions may return values and use the values returned by other actions . YACC rules have the following structure : lhs : rhs ; where lhs is a non-terminal symbol and rhs is a sequence of zero or more terminal or non-terminal symbols , "" literals "" ( see below ) , and actions . Identifiers for terminal and non-terminal symbols follow the rules of the C language , with the addition that character ' . ' is considered as a letter . A literal is a constant character defined as follows : literal : QUOTE char QUOTE | QUOTE BACKSLASH char QUOTE | QUOTE BACKSLASH od od od QUOTE ; where in this case QUOTE is character "" and od is an octal digit . The pipe character "" | "" is the YACC way to represent alternative definitions – it reads out as "" or "" . It is used when more than one rule has the same lhs . As with LEX , the parentheses % { and % } allow to include in the output of YACC any C source code . This code is global with respect to the parser function and to the user functions . YACC uses a number of identifiers starting with "" yy "" for internal purposes . As a consequence it is a good idea to avoid that prefix : While the YACC syntax is more or less standard , clearly its implementations may be completely different from each other or from future ones . A variable starting with "" yy "" may translate in a hidden design fault . Lexical atoms ( the tokens ) must be explicitly declared in Definitions . This is done , for instance , by writing one or more lines such as the following one : % token name1 name2 ... All the symbols that have not declared as tokens are implicitly declared as non-terminals ( non-terminals ) . An important property that must be guaranteed for any YACC source program is that each non-terminal must be the lhs of at least one rule . The declaration of the start symbol of the grammar may be done as follows : % start name in Declarations . If this specification is missing , it is assumed that the start symbol is the lhs of the first grammar rule specified by the user . A special token marks the end-of-input . This is called end-marker in YACC lingo . If the tokens encountered between the start of processing and the end-marker ( not including the latter ) verify the start symbol , then the parsers successfully stops processing after having read the end-marker . Reading the end-marker before the start symbol is verified leads to an error . Within each rule , the programmer can specify some actions to be executed each time that rule is recognized while analysing the input stream . Actions may return values and use the values returned by other actions . Also the tokens returned by yylex ( ) may have values . Actions are a group of C statements between curly brackets . Each action can return a value by setting variable $$ . For instance : { action ( ) ; $$ = 1 ; } returns 1 . Also the rules may return values . This value is either the value of the first component or the value of variable $$ . For instance : A : B ; is equivalent to A : B { $$ = $ 1 ; } ; The following example shows how it is possible to use the values returned by previous rules : expr : ' ( ' { expr ' ) ' $$ = $ 2 ; } ; In other words , $ i is the value returned by RHS [ i ] . An example follows : Let us suppose we wanted to build a syntax analysis tree and for that we are using a function node ( ) that allocates a new syntax object and returns its address . Then such functions could be called in rules such as the following one : expr : expr infix_op expr { $$ = node ( $ 2 , $ 1 , $ 3 ) ; } ; Values returned by rules and actions are integers by default . As we mentioned in previous section , function yylex ( ) returns an integer – the token number . This number is either a literal ( when in [ 0 , 255 ] ) or a symbolic constant s > 256 that describes the lexical "" class "" the recognized string belongs to . One such class could be , for instance , NUMBER , identifying all numerical symbolic constants . Function yylex ( ) also returns the actual string that was found in the input . That string is kept in variable extern X yylval ; where X is either int or can be defined by the user . An example follows : %% [ 0-9 ] + { yylval = atoi ( yytext ) ; return NUMBER ; } The choice of which integers to use with tokens can be done automatically by YACC , which associates the integers from 256 one by one to the tokens that have been declared with the % token keyword ; or implicitly for literals , to which it is associated their ASCII code ; or explicitly by the YACC programmer , who can associate an integer greater than 0 after the name of a token or a literal in section Declarations . Token numbers must be different . When executing yacc with the - d option , a header file is created , called y . tab . h , which contains all the token numbers . This file can be included , e.g. , in the LEX script , through a statement such as the following one : % { # include "" y . tab . h "" % } Note that the C program produced by LEX can be either compiled separately or even included in the YACC output program by specifying in User functions the following statement : # include "" lex . yy . c "" A. 3 . 2 Associativity rules Some arithmetical operators have their own associativity rules , and by agreement there are priorities between them . Therefore a method is required in order to set a priority among operators and to choose beforehand the type of associativity that is required . The kind of associativity of an operator can be defined in YACC by the three directives : % left % right % nonassoc Such directives also represent an alternative way to declare tokens and literals with respect to % token . For instance , % right % left ' = ' ' - ' ' + ' selects right association for the assignment operator ( that is , a = b = c is interpreted as a = ( b = c )) and left association for ' + ' and ' - ' . Each row defines a priority level . The earlier the specification appears in the source file , the lower its priority : ' = ' ≺ ( ' + ' , ' - ' ) ≺ · · · For instance , a = b = c ∗ d − e − f / g ; is interpreted as a = ( b = ((( c ∗ d ) − e ) − ( f / g ))) ; Keyword % nonassoc specifies that a certain operator must not be applied more than once . For instance , in Fortran the following expression A. LT . B. LT . C is not valid . The % nonassoc tokens catch such conditions . There are cases in which a same sign , for instance ' - ' , has two different meanings and priorities : expr : | | | expr ' = ' expr expr ' * ' expr expr ' - ' expr ' - ' expr Unary "" minus "" has greater priority than that of diadic "" minus "" . In such cases one can make use of a fictitious token and operator % prec : % left ' + ' ' - ' % left ' * ' ' / ' % left UMINUS %% expr : expr ' - ' expr | .... | ' - ' expr % prec UMINUS / * same priority of UMINUS * / As we have seen already , the value stack of YACC is by default based on short integers . The user can override that choice and choose any other type . In this case the value stack is organized as a vector of union's . The programmer can declare such union and associate the name of its members with the tokens and non-terminals that return a value . When the user does declare the union , the following string is attached to any reference like $$ or $ i : . field-name This is a possible example % union { char * String ; double Real ; int Integer ; } An equivalent way to shape this union is by defining explicitly type YYSTYPE : typedef union { char * String ; double Real ; int Integer ; } YYSTYPE ; After that definition one can associate a field-name to a token like follows : % left % right <Integer> <Real> ' + ' ' = ' ' - ' It is even possible to associate a field-name to a non-terminal : % type % type <String> <Real> expr number Another possibility is to associate a field-name to an action : expr : ' ( ' strexp ' ) ' { $ <Real> $ = atof ( $ <String> 2 ) ; } ; that is , "" $ < "" , followed by a field-name , followed by "" > $ "" References Johnson , S.

Art is built by compiling the Lex source code "" Ariel . l "" and the YACC source code "" Ariel . y "" , together with several ancillary C source codes . Art takes as input an Ariel script and produces as output : 1 . 2 . A number of configuration files describing a distributed application and an execution platform . An error recovery specification , expressed in the form of a pseudo-code for the Ariel virtual machine . The configuration files are to be compiled with the sources of the distributed application , while the error recovery specifications are compiled with the Ariel virtual machine , which then executes concurrently with the distributed application . Each time a fault is detected in the system , the Ariel virtual machine executes the error recovery specification interpreting the pseudo-code . This pseudo-code is called "" r-code "" ( recovery code ) and represents the "" virtual machine language "" for a stack machine called RINT . More details on this can be found in Chapter 7 . We begin with the Ariel's scanner , "" ariel . l "" , then we provide an excerpt of some ancillary source code used by Ariel's parser , and we conclude with an abridged view to the latter . Ariel's scanner Source code Ariel . l starts with a "" % { "" ... "" % } "" section , within which a few comment lines introduce the source code , its version and so forth . C header files are included and some global variables are declared . An example is "" lines "" , an integer starting at 1 and counting the number of lines being processed : % { / ************************** ** ** File : ariel . l ** ** Description : scanner ** ** Language : lex ** ** History : ** Version 2 . 0d 08-Feb-2006 ** - added "" Watchdog "" ... lines omitted ... *************************** # include int lines = 1 ; % } Ariel . l continues with its definitions . These include : Ariel's keywords , such as "" IF "" or "" THEN "" ; generic lexical atoms such as "" NUMBER "" or "" REAL "" ; atoms such as "" THREAD "" or "" NODE "" , defining the Ariel identifiers for Ariel's "" entities "" , in this case respectively processes or computers ; atoms such as "" AGENT "" or "" MANAGER "" , defining the roles that are to be assigned to certain processes : IF FI ELSE THEN ( [ Ii ] [ Ff ] ) ( [ Ff ] [ Ii ] ) ( [ Ee ] [ Ll ] [ Ss ] [ Ee ] ) ( [ Tt ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Nn ] ) ... lines omitted ...

Such guards are to check whether a given entity has been stopped or restarted , or detected as faulty , or isolated , and so forth : KILLED RESTARTED PRESENT RUNNING ISOLATED FAULTY "" - "" ? (( [ Kk ] ( [ Ii ] [ Ll ] [ Ll ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] ) ? ) | ( [ Ss ] [ Tt ] [ Oo ] [ Pp ] [ Pp ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] )) "" - "" ? [ Rr ] ( [ Ee ] [ Ss ] [ Tt ] [ Aa ] [ Rr ] [ Tt ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] ) ? "" - "" ?

[ Ff ] ( [ Aa ] [ Uu ] [ Ll ] [ Tt ] [ Yy ] ) ? There follow some definitions for the configuration of single version and multiple version fault-tolerance provisions . As an example , these are the Lex definitions corresponding to a watchdog timer : WATCHDOG KEYW_AT WATCHES HEARTBEATS EVERY MS US REBOOT EndWatchdog [ Ww ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Cc ] [ Hh ] [ Dd ] [ Oo ] [ Gg ] ( [ Aa ] [ Tt ] ) [ Ww ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Cc ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Ss ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Aa ] [ Rr ] [ Tt ] [ Bb ] [ Ee ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Ss ] [ eE ] [ vV ] [ eE ] [ Rr ] [ Yy ] [ Mm ] [ Ss ] [ Uu ] [ Ss ] [ Rr ] [ Ee ] [ Bb ] [ Oo ] [ Oo ] [ Tt ] ( [ Ee ] [ Nn ] [ Dd ] (( [ ] + ) ? ( { WATCHDOG } ))) Then the Ariel's rules are listed . As an example , when art encounters the token "" GID "" ( in Ariel , the identifier of a group of tasks , e.g. "" G42 "" ) , the corresponding actions set the return value , yylval , with the group number ( 42 ) and with the role of the given entity ( in this case , ID_NORMAL | ID_GROUP , which means "" a user-defined group of tasks "" ) . Note how yylval is in this case is not a scalar value but a complex data type defined by the YACC "" % union "" statement ( see Section 3 ) : %% { GID } { yylval . id . role = ID_NORMAL | ID_GROUP ; sscanf ( yytext + 1 , "" % d "" , & yylval . id . id ) ; return GID ; } Another few examples of Ariel rules . Some of them set yylval ( e.g. "" NUMBER "" , corresponding to an integer input , or "" REAL "" , namely a real number ) ; some others simply return a token number to the calling parser ( e.g. , definition "" WATCHDOG "" returns the token number represented by the symbolic constant having the same name ) . Token numbers are created automatically by YACC in this case . The last rule catches unrecognized characters , which are printed on the output and ignored : { NUMBER } { sscanf ( yytext , "" % d "" , & yylval . integer ) ; return NUMBER ; } { { REAL } sscanf ( yytext , "" % f "" , & yylval . real ) ; return REAL ; { WATCHDOG } { WATCHES } { HEARTBEATS } { EVERY } { MS } { US } { REBOOT } { EndWatchdog } { THRESHOLD } { ALPHACOUNT } { FACTOR } { EndAlpha } . } return WATCHDOG ; return WATCHES ; return HEARTBEATS ; return EVERY ; return MILLISEC ; return MICROSEC ; return REBOOT ; return KEYW_ENDWATCHDOG ; return THRESHOLD ; return ALPHACOUNT ; return FACTOR ; return KEYW_ENDALPHA ; fprintf ( stderr , "" Lex : unrecognized char : % s \ n "" , yytext ) ; Ariel's r-code As we mentioned already , the output of the art translator include the translation of the Ariel script into rcode . To explain in more detail how this is done , we provide here an excerpt of the header files and source codes that create the r-code . Finally , we briefly describe the main loop of RINT , the run-time executive of the r-code . 1 . R-code . h Header file "" rcode . h "" defines the opcode of the RINT virtual machine . These are organized as a series of integer numbers between 0 and LAST_RCODE ( in the current implementation , 56 ) . The opcodes are organized into classes , consisting of one or more opcode . The header file also defines a number of predicates , such as isstoprcode or issetrcode , returning a non-zero value when the argument satisfies the predicate . Rcode . h consists of a compile-time section , used when compiling the Ariel translator "" art "" , and a run-time section , used when compiling the r-code virtual machine RINT . / * The R-opcodes * / # define R_STOP # define isstoprcode ( x ) 000000 ( ! x ) # define R_SET_ROLE # define R_SET_DEF_ACT 1 2 # define issetrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_SET_ROLE && x < = R_SET_DEF_ACT ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 R_AND R_OR R_NOT R_INC_NEST R_DEC_NEST R_STRVAL R_STRPHASE # define is1operandrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_AND && x < = R_STRPHASE ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_FALSE R_GOTO R_PUSH R_FUNCTION_CALL R_OANEW R_CLEAR R_PAUSE 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # define is2operandrcode ( x ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_KILLED R_RESTARTED R_PRESENT R_ISOLATED R_FAULTY R_FIRED R_PAUSED R_REINTEGRATED # define R_STRERRN # define R_STRERRT # define R_COMPARE ( x > = R_FALSE && x < = R_PAUSE ) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 # define isclause ( x ) ( x > = R_KILLED && x < = R_REINTEGRATED ) # define istestrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_KILLED && x < = R_COMPARE ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_KILL R_WARN R_ANDWARN R_START R_RESTART R_REBOOT R_CHKERR R_ENABLE R_REMOVE R_REMOVE_ALL R_SEND R_GET R_SET R_CONST R_ADD R_SUBTRACT R_MULTIPLY R_DIVIDE R_COMPLEMENT R_LOGS R_LOGI R_LOGC R_LOGV R_EVENT R_ISOLATET R_ISOLATEG R_ISOLATEN R_SETPHASE 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 # define isactionrcode ( x ) # define R_DEADLOCKED # define LAST_RCODE // // // // // // // VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , Oct 2002 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 13 Oct 2002 ( x > = R_KILL && x < = R_REMOVE_ALL ) 56 R_DEADLOCKED There follow the definition of type rcode_t , which is a triplet of integers consisting of an opcode and two arguments . The rcode translation of the Ariel script is stored into an array of rcode_t triplets , called compile_time_rcode : typedef int rcode_t [ 3 ] ; # ifdef COMPILETIME static rcode_t compile_time_rcode [ RCODE_MAX_CARD ] ; # endif The rcode . h header file then defines the data structures for the management of Ariel nested IF statements , which need to be translated into their rcode equivalent by means of conditional and unconditional branch instructions ( R_FALSE and R_GOTO ) . Their meaning is explained in Sect . 2 . struct goto_t { int pc ; / * pc is the value of the RINT program counter * / struct goto_t * next ; } ; typedef struct { int pc ; struct goto_t * gotos ; } if_t ; static if_t ifs [ RCODE_MAX_NEST ] , * iftop ; static int ifp ; This concludes the compile-time section of header file rcode . h . There follow the declarations for the r-code functions , i.e. , the functions that are executed by RINT when interpreting the opcodes . All these functions read the three integers corresponding to an r-code and return an integer exit value : # ifndef COMPILETIME int int int int int int R_Stop ( int , int , int ) ; R_And ( int , int , int ) ; R_Or ( int , int , int ) ; R_Not ( int , int , int ) ; R_OArenew ( int , int , int ) ; R_Clear ( int , int , int ) ; ... lines omitted ... int int int R_IsolateGroup ( int , int , int ) ; R_IsolateNode ( int , int , int ) ; R_Deadlocked ( int , int , int ) ; An extra function called R_Nop ( for "" no operation "" ) is also declared . Such function corresponds to outdated opcodes still to be reorganized . Finally , rfunc , an array of function pointers is defined statically ( that is , at compile time ) . Note that entry rfunc [ i ] corresponds to the i-th opcode : int R_Nop ( int a , int b , int c ) ; // { return 0 ; } static int ( * rfunc [ ] ) ( int , int , int ) = { R_Stop , // 0 R_Nop , // 1 R_Nop , // 2 R_And , // 3 R_Or , // 4 R_Not , // 5 R_NestIn , // 6 R_NestOut , // 7 R_StoreVal , // 8 ... lines omitted ... R_IsolateGroup , R_IsolateNode , R_Deadlocked , } ; // 54 // 55 // 56 2 . R-code . c Source file rcode . c defines , among others , the functions to generate the rcode-equivalent of an Ariel recovery script . Some of these functions are very simple , such as rcode_stop : / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_STOP R-code , which closes an R-code object file * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_stop ( ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] = R_STOP ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 1 ] = -1 ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = -1 ; pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } Some others are complex and intertwined , such as those corresponding to the IF THEN ... ELSE / ELIF ... FI statements : / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_FALSE R-code , corresponding to the beginning of * / / * ' if / then / elif / else / fi ' statements . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_if ( ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { if ( iftop == NULL ) { iftop = & ifs [ 0 ] ; ifp = 0 ; } else { ifp ++ ; iftop = & ifs [ ifp ] ; } / * top-level if * / / * non top-level if * / iftop - > gotos = NULL ; iftop - > pc = pc ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ DEST ] compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = R_FALSE ; = 0 ; = -1 ; / * new R_FALSE statement * / / * goto value initially set to 0 * / / * unused * / pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code ( unconditioned branch ) . It is used to * / / * jump to the next ' elif ' or the ' else ' part of an ' if ' statement . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_goto ( int where ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] = R_GOTO ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 1 ] = where ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = -1 ; pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code statement which closes the current section * / / * of an ' if ' statement , together with the R_FALSE R-code which starts a * / / * new ' elif ' section . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_elif ( int goto_address ) { / * when we encounter an ' elif ' statement , three things have to be managed : 1 . first , a goto_t block has to be allocated and linked to the list , and an incomplete goto statement has to be added to rcode list ; 2 . secondly , compile_time_rcode [ iftop - > pc ] [ 3 ] i.e. , the running value , has to be updated with the current value of the pc register ; 3 . third , a new ' false ' statement has to added , and iftop - > pc should be updated with the current value of the pc register . * / ... lines omitted ... } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code , corresponding to the beginning of * / / * an ' else ' section of an ' if ' statement .

When everything is done for each and every goto , then it 's time to pop the ' if ' statement off the stack . When we reach the bottom we also have to reset iftop to NULL . * / ... lines omitted ... } Rcode . c also defines rflush , the function that , at the end of processing time , flushes the contents of compile_time_rcode into the output files . One such file is "" trl . h "" , an example of which is available in Table 6 of Chapter 7 . Function rflush is called by the main function of the Ariel . y parser . / ***************************************************************************** / / * flushes the R-codes to the object file , resets counters accordingly * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rflush ( ) { extern FILE * f ; n = fwrite (( void * ) & compile_time_rcode [ 0 ] [ 0 ] , sizeof ( rcode_t ) , pc , f ) ; fflush ( f ) ; 3 . Rint . c This section briefly sketches the source code of the RINT virtual machine , the interpreter of the r-code generated by the art translator . Its main function is rather simple : int main ( void ) / * RINT main module * / { rdump = fopen ( "" rdump . txt "" , "" w "" ) ; / * rdump logs all the executed rcodes * / if ( BSL_InitLibrary ( ) == BSL_ERROR ) { / * connects to the BSL ( re : Chap . 7 , Sect . 3 . 2 ) * / fprintf ( stderr , "" RINT : failed to initialise BSL \ n "" ) ; BSL_CloseLibrary ( ) ; return -1 ; } dowhile ( ) ; / * executes a loop in function "" dowhile "" * / if ( BSL_CloseLibrary ( ) == BSL_ERROR ) { / * and disconnects * / fprintf ( stderr , "" RINT : failed to close BSL . Clean up the system manually ! \ n "" ) ; return -1 ; } return 0 ; } Clearly the greater part of the complexity of RINT lies in its dowhile function , which just waits continuously for a waking message after which it executes the rcodes one by one : dowhile ( ) { int line ; extern int rcode_card ; size = sizeof ( message_t ) ; while ( 1 ) { RINTGetMessage ( ) ; / * "" Wake up ! "" * / printf ( "" Recovery starts ( % d r-codes ) . \ n "" , rcode_card ) ; BSL_ResetTimerBase ( ) ; / * Zero time counters * / line = 0 ; while ( line < rcode_card ) { / * line ( program counter ) is zeroed * / / * while there are rcodes ... * / ... lines omitted ... / * execute the function corresponding to the current rcode * / rfunc [ rcodes [ line ] [ 0 ] ] ( rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] , rcodes [ line ] [ 2 ] , line ) ; line ++ ; } The execution of the rcodes implies the use of a run-time stack for the evaluation of arithmetical and Boolean expressions . Such stack is accessed through function R_Push and R_Pop , defined elsewhere . After the execution of any arithmetical or Boolen operation , the result is pushed onto the stack . This is for instance the execution of R_False , _the function corresponding to recovery opcode R_FALSE : if ( R_Pop ( ) == FALSE ) // check the top of the stack { fprintf ( rdump , "" % d \ tConditional GOTO , fulfilled , % d . \ n "" , line , line + rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] ) ; line + = rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] ; // if FALSE , execute jmp continue ; } Another simple example is given by function R_Or ( the run-time executive for opcode R_OR ) : int R_Or ( int op1 , int dummy , int rline ) { / * RCODE : R_OR ARIEL : part of the expressions within IF statements * / int t = R_Pop ( ) ; int s = R_Pop ( ) ; R_Push ( t || s ) ; fprintf ( rdump , "" % d \ tOR statement ( popped % d and % d , pushed % d ) . \ n "" , rline , t , s , t || s ) ; return t || s ; } After having described the Ariel scanner and Ariel's compile-time and run-time components , we can now focus our attention on the Ariel parser . Ariel's parser The Ariel parser is the program that actually instructs the translation from the high-level Ariel source into the lower-level rcodes and configuration header files . A thorough description of this section would be inappropriate , so we concentrate on a few particularly meaningful fragments . As already mentioned , the structure of a YACC parser closely resembles that of LEX scanners . For instance , like Ariel . l , also Ariel . y begins with a "" % { "" ... "" % } "" section . Among other things , in that section we include header file "" rcode . h "" , described in previous section , and define the type of yylval through the "" % union "" statement : % { ... lines omitted ... # include "" rcode . h "" typedef struct { unsigned int role ; / * a bit pattern with one or more of these bit positions turned on : ID_GROUP , ID_THREAD , ID_NODE , ID_ENTITY , ID_NORMAL , ID_STAR , ID_DOLLAR * / int id ; } / * an integer identifying the entity * / ident_t ; % union { float real ; int integer ; ident_t id ; struct { char name [ 64 ] ; int rcode ; } string ; char quoted_string [ 64 ] ; int status ; // // // // value of value of role and symbolic the just scanned real number the just scanned integer number id of an entity name of an rcode opcode // value of a quoted string // status info } Ariel also defines 26 integer variables , each for each letter of the English alphabet . The Definitions section of YACC also makes room for them : static int var [ 26 ] ; / * Ariel's 26 pre-defined and pre-initialised variables * / Several sections follow , which describe the data structures for the configuration of some of the "" Basic Tools "" ( see Chapter 7 , Sect . 2.3 for more detail on this ) . One such tool is the watchdog timer , a Singleversion software fault-tolerance provision that would normally be configured in the functional source code of the user application . Ariel allows configuring such tools in the Ariel ( non-functional ) source code . Here is the YACC section of the watchdog : ... lines omitted ... / ************************** watchdogs ***************************** / typedef struct { int watching , / * id of the watching task * / watched , / * id of the watched task * / rate , unit , action , target , running ; } watchdog_t ; # define MAX_WDOGS 32 watchdog_t watchdog [ MAX_WDOGS ] ; int w_sp = 0 ; # define INCWATCH ++ w_sp ; # define WATCHTOP watchdog [ w_sp ] # define BADWATCH ( w_sp > MAX_WDOGS ) # define MAX_WD_FNAME 80 # define MAX_WD_NAME 40 int watchdog_flush ( watchdog_t * , int ) ; // creates the source codes for the watchdogs / *********************** end watchdogs **************************** / Another section defines a restoring organ ( see Chapter 4 , Section 3 on the EFTOS Voting Farm , the source of which was used here ) . Note that this is a software fault-tolerance provision that would normally require a non-negligible amount of code intrusion , which is considerably reduced in this case : / ************************* nversion ****************************** / typedef struct { int version , // version id task , // task id timeout , // max duration of task unit ; // millisecs or microsecs } version_t ; # define MAX_VERS 7 // up to 7 versions ( 7-MR system ) typedef struct { int running , // parsing flag task ; // task id of the restoring organ version_t va [ MAX_VERS ] ; // the versions int va_num ; // running number of encountered versions int voting ; // voting algorithm char * metric ; // name of the metric function int success , error ; int versmin , versmax ; // versions can be given in any order } nversion_t ; # define MAX_NVERS 16 // up to 16 restoring organs nversion_t nversion [ MAX_NVERS ] ; int nv_sp = 0 ; // stack pointer for nversion [ ] # define INCNVERS ++ nv_sp ; # define NVERSTOP nversion [ nv_sp ] # define BADNVERS ( nv_sp > MAX_NVERS ) # define MAX_NV_FNAME 80 # define MAX_NV_NAME 40 int nversion_flush ( nversion_t * , int ) ; // creates the sources of the restoring organs / *********************** end nversion **************************** / Another section defines the tokens , ( optionally ) their type , and precedence / associativity rules : % token % token % token % token ROLE <integer> NUMBER VAR <real> REAL <id> GID NID TID % token % token % token % token % token % token % token % token % token IF ELSE ELIF FI THEN KILL RESTART START ISOLATE KEYW_TASK KEYW_TASKID KEYW_NODE KEYW_IS KEYW_ALIAS KEY KEYW_LOGICAL KEYW_ENDLOGICAL WATCHDOG WATCHES HEARTBEATS EVERY REBOOT KEYW_ENDWATCHDOG NVERSION KEYW_VERSION TIMEOUT VOTING MAJORITY ALGORITHM METRIC SUCCESS KEYW_ENDNVERSION ... lines omitted ... % token <integer> LET VAL % token <integer> EQ NEQ GT GE LT LE % token <integer> MILLISEC MICROSEC % left AND OR % left NOT % token KILLED RESTARTED PRESENT % token ISOLATED FAULTY DEADLOCKED % token REINTEGRATED FIRED PAUSED % type % type % type % type % type status <id> id <integer> compare <integer> seconds <integer> expression linexp / * precedences / associativity * / % left ' + ' ' - ' % left ' * ' ' / ' % left UMINUS We get then to the main YACC section , that of Rules & Actions . The start symbol is "" rlstats "" , which states that an Ariel script consists of one or more "" rlstat "" or erroneous lines : %% rlstats : | rlstats rlstat | error ' \ n ' { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : syntax error . \ n "" , lines ) ; errors ++ ; } ; It is the definition of "" rlstat "" that lists all possible cases for a valid Ariel statement . Here it follows its ( abridged ) specification : rlstat : ' \ n ' | definition ' \ n ' { if ( rec ) { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" Ca n't define roles in strategy section "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } | section ' \ n ' | include ' \ n ' | timeouts ' \ n ' | definitions ' \ n ' | identifiers ' \ n ' | alphacounts ' \ n ' | aliases ' \ n ' | logicals ' \ n ' | entrypoints ' \ n ' | stacksizes ' \ n ' | watchdog ' \ n ' | nversiontask ' \ n ' | injection ' \ n ' ; An exhaustive description not being appropriate here , we decided to focus our attention on some of the above mentioned statements . We begin with an example of a configuration statement : this is the syntax of statements for the configuration of watchdogs . watchdog : ; watchdog_args : | | | ; watchdog_start watchdog_args watchdog_end on_error watchdog_args heartbeats watchdog_args w_alphacount watchdog_args watchdog_start : WATCHDOG KEYW_TASK NUMBER WATCHES KEYW_TASK NUMBER ' \ n ' { WATCHTOP . running = 1 ; / * flag : we 're within a watchdog * / WATCHTOP . watching = $ 3 ; WATCHTOP . watched = $ 6 ; taskram [ $ 3 ] . actor = RE_WD ; } ; w_alphacount : ALPHACOUNT KEYW_IS THRESHOLD ' = ' REAL ' , ' FACTOR ' = ' REAL KEYW_ENDALPHA ' \ n ' { alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . used = 1 ; alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . threshold = $ 5 ; alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . k = $ 9 ; } ; seconds : ; MILLISEC | MICROSEC heartbeats : HEARTBEATS EVERY NUMBER seconds ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) { WATCHTOP . rate = $ 3 ; WATCHTOP . unit = ( $ 4 == MILLISEC ) ? 0 : 1 ; } else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ; on_error : | | ON ERROR WARN KEYW_TASK NUMBER ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) { WATCHTOP . action = 0 ; WATCHTOP . target = $ 5 ; } else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ON ERROR REBOOT ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) WATCHTOP . action = 1 ; else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR .

789	Operating system : NLTSS , VMS , UNIX , MAC OS , DOS . Keywords : Boltzmann equation , Electron distribution , Transport coeffcients , Physics laser , Plasma physics , Gas discharges , Kinetic model . Classification : 19.8 , 19.11 . Nature of problem : ELENDIF calculates the time evolution of the electron energy distribution function in a mixture of partially ionized gases with or without an applied electric field . The code can treat inelastic and superelastic processes , electron-electron and electron-ion collisions , photon-electron ( free-free ) processes , attachment and recombination , ionization including a distribution of secondary electrons , and an external source of electrons ( e.g. an electron beam ) . The code also computes the mean electron energy , drift velocity , diffusion coefficient , rate coefficients and energy flow rates for the processes being included in the calculation . Solution method : ELENDIF solves the time-dependent Boltzmann transport equation in terms of the electron number density . By finite-differencing the electron energy axis , the Boltzmann equation is transformed into a finite set of coupled differential equations for the electron number density at each energy grid as a function of time . The matrix of densities is then evolved forward in time using a combination of explicit and implicit methods . The electron energy distribution is then convolved with the cross section to provide the transport coefficients , collisional rates and energy flow rates . Restrictions : It is assumed in the formulation of ELENDIF that the two-term spherical harmonic expansion of the electron distribution function is adequate . Running time : On the Vax 8650 the code takes 0.11 seconds per timestep if the effects of electron-electron collisions are ignored , and 0.46 seconds per timestep if electron-electron collisions are included .

222	"Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Abkhazia , Georgia Introduction The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1427 ( 2002 ) of 29 July 2002 , by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia ( UNOMIG ) until 31 January 2003 and requested me to report three months from the date of the adoption of the resolution . It provides an update on developments since my report of 10 July 2002 ( S / 2002 / 742 ) . Heidi Tagliavini continued to head UNOMIG as my Special Representative for Georgia , and Major General Kazi Ashfaq Ahmed ( Bangladesh ) continued to serve as the Chief Military Observer . The strength of UNOMIG on 1 October 2002 stood at 108 military observers ( see annex ) . Political process During the period under review , UNOMIG continued to search for ways to engage the Georgian and Abkhaz sides on the paper entitled "" Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi "" and its transmittal letter , as a step towards holding substantial negotiations on the core issue of the conflict , namely , the future status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia . In these efforts , it had the support of the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General . At the same time , UNOMIG devoted considerable energy to the situation in the Kodori Valley , which remained a major source of tension . The situation in the wider area remained tense in the context of which UNOMIG carries out its work . In addition to consulting with the leadership of the two sides , and in order to find ways to move the political process forward and overcome continuing Abkhaz refusal to even discuss the paper on competences , my Special Representative embarked on a round of consultations in the capitals of the Member States constituting the Group of Friends . In August and September , she visited Moscow , Washington and Berlin and she intends to visit London and Paris in the near future . She also conducted consultations at Headquarters in New York . The efforts to arrange a meeting in Sukhumi at which my Special Representative , together with the representatives of the Group of Friends , would familiarize the Abkhaz leadership with the substance of the paper on competences ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 4 ) have not succeeded so far . In view of this , and in consultation with the Group of Friends and my Special Representative , the Russian Federation offered to facilitate a meeting in Moscow with the de facto Abkhaz Prime Minister , Anri Jergenia . It was envisaged that , at that meeting , Mr. Jergenia would be acquainted with the substance of the paper on competences and the rationale behind it , but that it would not be handed over ; Mr. Jergenia in turn would have the opportunity to explain his views on the settlement of the conflict . The meeting was scheduled for 5 October but it was not held because Mr. Jergenia rejected a discussion of the paper and the participation of my Special Representative . UNOMIG continued its efforts to bring the two sides together in the framework of the Coordinating Council . While it again proved to be impossible to arrange a meeting of the Council itself , the sides did meet on 20 July in Working Groups I ( on security matters ) and II ( on internally displaced persons and refugees ) of the Council . They also met several times , both in the presence of UNOMIG and bilaterally , to discuss the situation in and around the Kodori Valley . Operational activities The UNOMIG military observers continued to perform their mandated tasks through daily ground patrols in the Gali and Zugdidi sectors , as well as two - or three-day patrols in the Kodori Valley , the latter jointly with the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force . On three occasions the patrols had to be cancelled because of the lack of security guarantees . Patrolling by helicopter remained suspended ; administrative flights were conducted following a flight path over the Black Sea . The investigation into the shooting down of a UNOMIG helicopter on 8 October 2001 is to be completed by the end of October 2002 . Kodori Valley Following the gradual stabilization of the situation in and around the Kodori Valley in May and June ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 10 ) , a joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol was conducted from 16 to 18 July . It assessed the situation as calm but unstable ; the mortars and ammunition observed in the Georgian-controlled upper valley by earlier patrols ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 11 ) had , however , still not been removed . On 20 July , Working Group I of the Coordinating Council met under the chairmanship of the Chief Military Observer to discuss measures to further stabilize the situation in the Kodori Valley . The Georgian side stated that it had reduced the number of border guards and undertook again to remove the military equipment from the valley . Late in July , the situation took a turn for the worse . On 30 July , the Georgian authorities informed UNOMIG that Abkhaz troops had been spotted near the Marukhi Pass ( on the Russian-Georgian border ) which is connected to the upper Kodori Valley by the approximately 40-kilometre long Chkhalta Valley . On the same day , the Abkhaz side informed UNOMIG that several Georgian helicopters had landed troops close to the pass ; it threatened military action if the Georgian side did not withdraw immediately . On 31 July , a UNOMIG / CIS patrol was told by Georgian officials that a Russian helicopter carrying troops had landed south of the Marukhi Pass . Later in the day , the Georgian Defence Minister and the Chief of the National Guard arrived in the Kodori Valley and went to the Marukhi Pass . On their return , the two officials stated to the UNOMIG patrol that the Russian helicopter had flown into the area mistakenly and that the situation had been resolved . Also on 31 July , UNOMIG received a letter from the Abkhaz side , expressing strong concerns about Georgian landings in the Marukhi Pass area the day before and informing UNOMIG that several checkpoints would be established there to prevent infiltration by "" international terrorists "" and "" illegal actions "" by the Georgian side . As the tensions were mounting , UNOMIG worked with the two parties to prevent a resort to force . On 4 August , it arranged a meeting between the Georgian State Minister , Avtandil Jorbenadze , and Mr. Jergenia on the Inguri River bridge . At that meeting , and a follow-up meeting of the respective Chiefs of General Staff on 6 August , the parties agreed to withdraw their units from the Marukhi Pass area and jointly inspect it as soon as possible . That inspection has not so far been carried out . The parties also requested UNOMIG to participate in the inspection and consider establishing a permanent post in the upper Kodori Valley . During the following days , the tensions continued . The Georgian side accused the Abkhaz of moving their forces to Georgian-controlled territory near the Marukhi Pass and firing on a border guard helicopter . On 13 August , another high-level meeting between the two sides was convened . Soon after the talks started , however , the Georgian delegation received a report that fighting had broken out between the two sides near the Marukhi Pass . The meeting was suspended , and the Georgian delegation flew to the area to clarify the situation . It returned later that day and stated that Abkhaz armed units had moved forward from their positions into the Chkhalta Valley and that Georgian forces had opened fire . On 14 August , the Defence Ministers of the two sides met . They again agreed to withdraw their forces from the positions in the Marukhi Pass area , to remove jointly newly laid mines there , and to request UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force to monitor the withdrawal and mine clearing . A joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol to the Kodori Valley planned for mid-August was cancelled because the Georgian authorities did not provide the necessary security guarantees . The planned joint mine clearance has not been carried out so far , because the sides at subsequent technical meetings , could not agree on the modalities for the operation . Despite this lack of tangible results of the various meetings , they succeeded in defusing the tensions for the time being and a joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol to the Kodori Valley was conducted from 31 August to 2 September . It found that the Abkhaz side was repairing the road in the lower part of the valley and that the CIS checkpoints there had increased their protective measures ; the Georgian mortars and ammunition in the upper valley had still not been removed . The next two patrols , however , planned to start on 12 and 25 September respectively , were cancelled , the first because the Georgian side had not cleared the mines at the entrance to the Georgian-controlled upper part of the valley ( as is the usual procedure ) , and the second because the Abkhaz side did not provide security clearance for the Abkhaz-controlled lower part , owing to the alleged presence of armed irregulars there . A patrol did go to the Kodori Valley from 3 to 8 October and observed the removal of the Georgian mortars and ammunition from the valley . Gali and Zugdidi sectors The general security situation in the Gali sector was calm , with the exception of the lower Gali area , where there were two particularly violent shooting incidents . The first was an exchange of fire between the Abkhaz militia and an unidentified armed group during the night of 31 August / 1 September at Khumuskhuri ( about 15 kilometres south-west of Gali city ) ; three members of the armed group were killed . The second occurred on 25 September , when three Abkhaz officials were killed in an ambush in broad daylight near the main bridge across the Inguri River . There were also a number of shootings at Abkhaz and CIS positions , as well as two explosions ; none of these incidents led to fatalities . There was the usual upsurge in robberies during the hazelnut harvest , though the crime rate overall was lower than in previous years . Still , 14 robberies were reported , as well as a number of tit-for-tat abduction cases . The activities of local law enforcement agencies are seen as insufficient by the returnee population in the lower Gali area . In order to explore ways of strengthening the law enforcement agencies , my Special Representative continued consultations with the two sides . In this connection , a meeting of Working Group II of the Coordinating Council was convened on 20 July , chaired by the representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) to Georgia . Working Group II had previously only met twice in 1998 . The outcome included a request for UNOMIG to dispatch a security assessment team to the Gali and Zugdidi districts later this year , as a follow-up to the recommendations of the joint assessment mission undertaken in November 2000 ( see S / 2001 / 59 , annex II ) . The assessment team will provide options and make recommendations to my Special Representative for improving the effectiveness of law enforcement personnel and agencies and their cooperation with the judiciary , with the aim of creating a safer and more secure environment for persons wishing to exercise their right of return or having already returned . Working Group II also agreed that the problems of the returnee population would become a topic for the weekly quadripartite meetings ( these meetings bring together the two parties , UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force for a regular exchange on practical issues on the ground ) . The general security situation in the Zugdidi sector was calm . The law and order situation has improved to some extent ; there were only two robberies reported to UNOMIG during the reporting period . Criminal activities across the ceasefire line nevertheless remained a problem , and often perpetrators of crimes on one side flee to the other side to take refuge . Demonstrations by internally displaced persons , including a blockade of the main bridge over the Inguri River from 22 August to 5 September , reflected the desperation among the refugees 10 years after the start of the hostilities . They demanded the proper payment of their allowances , the withdrawal of the CIS peacekeeping force and the prompt return of refugees to their original homes . As a result of heavy rainfall at the end of June , a significant number of bridges and roads within the Zugdidi sector were either damaged or destroyed , which had a negative effect on UNOMIG patrols . Cooperation with the collective peacekeeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force continued to work in close cooperation , in particular in conducting the joint patrols to the Kodori Valley , and maintained good relations at all levels . The staff of the two organizations held regular meetings , complementing the exchanges between the Chief Military Observer and the CIS Force Commander . The weekly quadripartite meetings and the activities of the Joint Fact-Finding Group also remained useful platforms for information sharing and coordination . Humanitarian situation and human rights International humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations continued their programmes , targeting the acute food and medical needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population in Abkhazia , and conducted mine-clearance , small-scale rehabilitation and community development activities . Their operations continued to be hampered by restrictions on border crossings at the Psou River . UNHCR continued its limited humanitarian operation in Abkhazia , against the background of recurrent concerns about security and criminality . In cooperation with local authorities and beneficiary communities , it pursued the basic rehabilitation of school buildings , as endorsed by the parties in Working Group III of the Coordinating Council . This year , the emphasis of this activity , which covers 49 schools , is in areas beyond the Gali district . The project has essentially been implemented , though some construction work remains to be completed by the local communities . A group of vulnerable elderly persons in Sukhumi continued to benefit from a small-scale UNHCR assistance programme through a local non-governmental implementing partner . Following the establishment of a sub-account for humanitarian quick-impact projects in the UNOMIG Trust Fund , efforts are under way to obtain funding for a number of projects that have been identified . The human rights situation in Abkhazia remained fragile , particularly in the security zone at the Gali side of the ceasefire line . The Mission's Human Rights Office continued to promote human rights awareness through a specialized programme on a district television station and the publication of two United Nations human rights documents in the Abkhaz language , "" Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement "" and "" Minority Rights "" . It also started to participate in the weekly quadripartite meetings , following the decision by Working Group II that returnee issues would be discussed regularly in that forum . Support issues UNOMIG has now installed two more satellite communication stations , thereby providing full interconnectivity throughout the Mission area , including the two sectors . A further 14 microwave systems are being deployed in the Mission area . The VHF network has been expanded from 16 to 32 channels to make provision for operational , evacuation , security , air operations and medevac / search and rescue channels . Observations During the period reviewed in this report , the situation in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone has , unfortunately , not improved . In the absence of a substantive negotiation process on the core issue of the conflict – the status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia – upsurges of tension , including exchanges of gunfire , continued to occur with alarming frequency , while the population suffered from crime , partisan violence and the lack of economic development . To reduce these tensions , the Abkhaz side needs to reconsider its refusal even to discuss the paper "" Basic Principles of the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi "" and its transmittal letter , which is , after all , only the starting point for negotiations in which the legitimate interests of the multi-ethnic population of Abkhazia can be addressed . The Georgian side , for its part , needs to make more efforts to promote trust and confidence on the Abkhaz side . My Special Representative will continue her efforts , with the support of the Group of Friends , to encourage advancement in the political process , but the basic responsibility lies with the parties . The Kodori Valley has been a source of tension for more than a year . UNOMIG will continue its efforts to defuse tensions emanating from the area and bring the parties together to address the underlying problems . However , again it is up to the parties , who exercise control in this area , to do their part to prevent destabilization and create the security conditions in which UNOMIG can function . It is deplorable that there has been no progress on refugee returns , owing to the absence of the safe , secure and dignified conditions under which such returns are to be effected according to international law and the 1994 Quadripartite Agreement . The UNOMIG security assessment team will seek to identify ways in which the existing law enforcement personnel and institutions can improve their effectiveness in combating criminal activities and strengthening the rule of law . One year after the shooting down of a United Nations helicopter , as UNOMIG remembers its colleagues who lost their lives in the service of peace , the perpetrators of the crime are still at large , as are those responsible for taking UNOMIG personnel hostage in several incidents from 1998 to 2000 . Every effort must be made to apprehend them and bring them to trial . In conclusion , I should like to express my appreciation for the steadfastness and dedication with which my Special Representative , Heidi Tagliavini , the Chief Military Observer , Major General Kazi Ashfaq Ahmed , and the men and women of UNOMIG have carried out their difficult and often dangerous duties .

775	The biosynthesis of disaccharides , oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases . These are enzymes that catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules , forming glycosidic bonds . A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar , nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [ 1 ] . This classification is available on the CAZy ( CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes ) web site [ 2 ] . The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families . Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences , several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form ' clans ' . Glycosyltransferase family 28 GT_28 comprises enzymes with a number of known activities ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-galactosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 46 ) ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 157 ) ; beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) .

45	"The ugly duckling It was lovely summer weather in the country , and the golden corn , the green oats , and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful . The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language which he had learnt from his mother . The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests , in the midst of which were deep pools . It was , indeed , delightful to walk about in the country . In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river , and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves , so high , that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright . The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood . In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest , watching for her young brood to hatch ; she was beginning to get tired of her task , for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells , and she seldom had any visitors . The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks , and sit under a burdock leaf , to have a gossip with her . At length one shell cracked , and then another , and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried , "" Peep , peep . "" "" Quack , quack , "" said the mother , and then they all quacked as well as they could , and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves . Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked , because green is good for the eyes . "" How large the world is , "" said the young ducks , when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell . "" Do you imagine this is the whole world ? "" asked the mother ; "" Wait till you have seen the garden ; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field , but I have never ventured to such a distance . Are you all out ? "" she continued , rising ; "" No , I declare , the largest egg lies there still . I wonder how long this is to last , I am quite tired of it ; "" and she seated herself again on the nest . "" Well , how are you getting on ? "" asked an old duck , who paid her a visit . "" One egg is not hatched yet , "" said the duck , "" it will not break . But just look at all the others , are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw ? They are the image of their father , who is so unkind , he never comes to see . "" "" Let me see the egg that will not break , "" said the duck ; "" I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg . I was persuaded to hatch some once , and after all my care and trouble with the young ones , they were afraid of the water . I quacked and clucked , but all to no purpose . I could not get them to venture in . Let me look at the egg . Yes , that is a turkey's egg ; take my advice , leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim . "" "" I think I will sit on it a little while longer , "" said the duck ; "" as I have sat so long already , a few days will be nothing . "" "" Please yourself , "" said the old duck , and she went away . At last the large egg broke , and a young one crept forth crying , "" Peep , peep . "" It was very large and ugly . The duck stared at it and exclaimed , "" It is very large and not at all like the others . I wonder if it really is a turkey . We shall soon find it out , however when we go to the water . It must go in , if I have to push it myself . "" On the next day the weather was delightful , and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves , so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water , and jumped in with a splash . "" Quack , quack , "" cried she , and one after another the little ducklings jumped in . The water closed over their heads , but they came up again in an instant , and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible , and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them . "" Oh , "" said the mother , "" that is not a turkey ; how well he uses his legs , and how upright he holds himself ! He is my own child , and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly . Quack , quack ! come with me now , I will take you into grand society , and introduce you to the farmyard , but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon ; and , above all , beware of the cat . "" When they reached the farmyard , there was a great disturbance , two families were fighting for an eel's head , which , after all , was carried off by the cat . "" See , children , that is the way of the world , "" said the mother duck , whetting her beak , for she would have liked the eel's head herself . "" Come , now , use your legs , and let me see how well you can behave . You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder ; she is the highest born of them all , and has Spanish blood , therefore , she is well off . Do n't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg , which is something very grand , and a great honor for a duck ; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her , as she can be recognized both by man and beast . Come , now , do n't turn your toes , a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart , just like his father and mother , in this way ; now bend your neck , and say ' quack . ' "" The ducklings did as they were bid , but the other duck stared , and said , "" Look , here comes another brood , as if there were not enough of us already ! and what a queer looking object one of them is ; we do n't want him here , "" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck . "" Let him alone , "" said the mother ; "" he is not doing any harm . "" "" Yes , but he is so big and ugly , "" said the spiteful duck "" and therefore he must be turned out . "" "" The others are very pretty children , "" said the old duck , with the rag on her leg , "" all but that one ; I wish his mother could improve him a little . "" "" That is impossible , your grace , "" replied the mother ; "" he is not pretty ; but he has a very good disposition , and swims as well or even better than the others . I think he will grow up pretty , and perhaps be smaller ; he has remained too long in the egg , and therefore his figure is not properly formed ; "" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers , saying , "" It is a drake , and therefore not of so much consequence . I think he will grow up strong , and able to take care of himself . "" "" The other ducklings are graceful enough , "" said the old duck . "" Now make yourself at home , and if you can find an eel's head , you can bring it to me . "" And so they made themselves comfortable . But the poor duckling , who had crept out of his shell last of all , and looked so ugly , was bitten and pushed and made fun of , not only by the ducks , but by all the poultry . "" He is too big , "" they all said , and the turkey cock , who had been born into the world with spurs , and fancied himself really an emperor , puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail , and flew at the duckling , and became quite red in the head with passion , so that the poor little thing did not know where to go , and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard . So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse . The poor duckling was driven about by every one ; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him , and would say , "" Ah , you ugly creature , I wish the cat would get you , "" and his mother said she wished he had never been born . The ducks pecked him , the chickens beat him , and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet . So at last he ran away , frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings . "" They are afraid of me because I am ugly , "" he said . So he closed his eyes , and flew still farther , until he came out on a large moor , inhabited by wild ducks . Here he remained the whole night , feeling very tired and sorrowful . In the morning , when the wild ducks rose in the air , they stared at their new comrade . "" What sort of a duck are you ? "" they all said , coming round him . He bowed to them , and was as polite as he could be , but he did not reply to their question . "" You are exceedingly ugly , "" said the wild ducks , "" but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family . "" Poor thing ! he had no thoughts of marriage ; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes , and drink some of the water on the moor . After he had been on the moor two days , there came two wild geese , or rather goslings , for they had not been out of the egg long , and were very saucy . "" Listen , friend , "" said one of them to the duckling , "" you are so ugly , that we like you very well . Will you go with us , and become a bird of passage ? Not far from here is another moor , in which there are some pretty wild geese , all unmarried . It is a chance for you to get a wife ; you may be lucky , ugly as you are . "" "" Pop , pop , "" sounded in the air , and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes , and the water was tinged with blood . "" Pop , pop , "" echoed far and wide in the distance , and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes . The sound continued from every direction , for the sportsmen surrounded the moor , and some were even seated on branches of trees , overlooking the rushes . The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees , and as it floated away across the water , a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes , which bent beneath them wherever they went . How they terrified the poor duckling ! He turned away his head to hide it under his wing , and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him . His jaws were open , his tongue hung from his mouth , and his eyes glared fearfully . He thrust his nose close to the duckling , showing his sharp teeth , and then , "" splash , splash , "" he went into the water without touching him . "" Oh , "" sighed the duckling , "" how thankful I am for being so ugly ; even a dog will not bite me . "" And so he lay quite still , while the shot rattled through the rushes , and gun after gun was fired over him . It was late in the day before all became quiet , but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move . He waited quietly for several hours , and then , after looking carefully around him , hastened away from the moor as fast as he could . He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose , and he could hardly struggle against it . Towards evening , he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall , and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first . The storm continued so violent , that the duckling could go no farther ; he sat down by the cottage , and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way . There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through , which he did very quietly , and got a shelter for the night . A woman , a tom cat , and a hen lived in this cottage . The tom cat , whom the mistress called , "" My little son , "" was a great favorite ; he could raise his back , and purr , and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way . The hen had very short legs , so she was called "" Chickie short legs . "" She laid good eggs , and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child . In the morning , the strange visitor was discovered , and the tom cat began to purr , and the hen to cluck . "" What is that noise about ? "" said the old woman , looking round the room , but her sight was not very good ; therefore , when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck , that had strayed from home . "" Oh what a prize ! "" she exclaimed , "" I hope it is not a drake , for then I shall have some duck's eggs . I must wait and see . "" So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks , but there were no eggs . Now the tom cat was the master of the house , and the hen was mistress , and they always said , "" We and the world , "" for they believed themselves to be half the world , and the better half too . The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject , but the hen would not listen to such doubts . "" Can you lay eggs ? "" she asked . "" No. "" "" Then have the goodness to hold your tongue . "" "" Can you raise your back , or purr , or throw out sparks ? "" said the tom cat . "" No. "" "" Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking . "" So the duckling sat in a corner , feeling very low spirited , till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door , and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water , that he could not help telling the hen . "" What an absurd idea , "" said the hen . "" You have nothing else to do , therefore you have foolish fancies . If you could purr or lay eggs , they would pass away . "" "" But it is so delightful to swim about on the water , "" said the duckling , "" and so refreshing to feel it close over your head , while you dive down to the bottom . "" "" Delightful , indeed ! "" said the hen , "" why you must be crazy ! Ask the cat , he is the cleverest animal I know , ask him how he would like to swim about on the water , or to dive under it , for I will not speak of my own opinion ; ask our mistress , the old woman – there is no one in the world more clever than she is . Do you think she would like to swim , or to let the water close over her head ? "" "" You do n't understand me , "" said the duckling . "" We do n't understand you ? Who can understand you , I wonder ? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat , or the old woman ? I will say nothing of myself . Do n't imagine such nonsense , child , and thank your good fortune that you have been received here . Are you not in a warm room , and in society from which you may learn something . But you are a chatterer , and your company is not very agreeable . Believe me , I speak only for your own good . I may tell you unpleasant truths , but that is a proof of my friendship . I advise you , therefore , to lay eggs , and learn to purr as quickly as possible . "" "" I believe I must go out into the world again , "" said the duckling . "" Yes , do , "" said the hen . So the duckling left the cottage , and soon found water on which it could swim and dive , but was avoided by all other animals , because of its ugly appearance . Autumn came , and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold . Then , as winter approached , the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air . The clouds , heavy with hail and snow-flakes , hung low in the sky , and the raven stood on the ferns crying , "" Croak , croak . "" It made one shiver with cold to look at him . All this was very sad for the poor little duckling . One evening , just as the sun set amid radiant clouds , there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes . The duckling had never seen any like them before . They were swans , and they curved their graceful necks , while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness . They uttered a singular cry , as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea . As they mounted higher and higher in the air , the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them . He whirled himself in the water like a wheel , stretched out his neck towards them , and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself . Could he ever forget those beautiful , happy birds ; and when at last they were out of his sight , he dived under the water , and rose again almost beside himself with excitement . He knew not the names of these birds , nor where they had flown , but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world . He was not envious of these beautiful creatures , but wished to be as lovely as they . Poor ugly creature , how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement . The winter grew colder and colder ; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing , but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller . At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved , and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could , to keep the space from closing up . He became exhausted at last , and lay still and helpless , frozen fast in the ice . Early in the morning , a peasant , who was passing by , saw what had happened . He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe , and carried the duckling home to his wife . The warmth revived the poor little creature . But when the children wanted to play with him , the duckling thought they would do him some harm ; so he started up in terror , fluttered into the milk-pan , and splashed the milk about the room . Then the woman clapped her hands , which frightened him still more . He flew first into the butter-cask , then into the meal-tub , and out again . What a condition he was in ! The woman screamed , and struck at him with the tongs ; the children laughed and screamed , and tumbled over each other , in their efforts to catch him ; but luckily he escaped . The door stood open ; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes , and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow . It would be very sad , were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter ; but when it had passed , he found himself lying one morning in a moor , amongst the rushes . He felt the warm sun shining , and heard the lark singing , and saw that all around was beautiful spring . Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong , as he flapped them against his sides , and rose high into the air . They bore him onwards , until he found himself in a large garden , before he well knew how it had happened . The apple-trees were in full blossom , and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn . Everything looked beautiful , in the freshness of early spring . From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans , rustling their feathers , and swimming lightly over the smooth water . The duckling remembered the lovely birds , and felt more strangely unhappy than ever . "" I will fly to those royal birds , "" he exclaimed , "" and they will kill me , because I am so ugly , and dare to approach them ; but it does not matter : better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks , beaten by the hens , pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry , or starved with hunger in the winter . "" Then he flew to the water , and swam towards the beautiful swans . The moment they espied the stranger , they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings . "" Kill me , "" said the poor bird ; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water , and awaited death . But what did he see in the clear stream below ? His own image ; no longer a dark , gray bird , ugly and disagreeable to look at , but a graceful and beautiful swan . To be born in a duck's nest , in a farmyard , is of no consequence to a bird , if it is hatched from a swan's egg . He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble , because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him ; for the great swans swam round the new-comer , and stroked his neck with their beaks , as a welcome . Into the garden presently came some little children , and threw bread and cake into the water . "" See , "" cried the youngest , "" there is a new one ; "" and the rest were delighted , and ran to their father and mother , dancing and clapping their hands , and shouting joyously , "" There is another swan come ; a new one has arrived . "" Then they threw more bread and cake into the water , and said , "" The new one is the most beautiful of all ; he is so young and pretty . "" And the old swans bowed their heads before him . Then he felt quite ashamed , and hid his head under his wing ; for he did not know what to do , he was so happy , and yet not at all proud . He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness , and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds . Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him , and the sun shone warm and bright . Then he rustled his feathers , curved his slender neck , and cried joyfully , from the depths of his heart , "" I never dreamed of such happiness as this , while I was an ugly duckling .

330	Weight and Body Mass Index A more realistic statistic of how your own body weight compares with general population norms , is an estimate of Body Mass Index ( or BMI ) . This takes into consideration your weight and height ( but not your build ) . You could try the following calculation : Take your weight in Pounds and multiply this by 700 Then divide by your height in Inches Again , divide by your height in Inches The sum is a number representing your BMI If your BMI falls below 20 , than this suggests that you are underweight . If your BMI falls above 27 then this suggests that you are overweight . If your BMI falls below 18 or above 30 then you should speak to your GP about this . For example for a person who weighs 9 stone 7 lbs. ( 133 lbs. ) , and who is 5 feet 5 inches ( 65 inches ) tall 133lbs multiplied by 700 = 93100 Divided by 65 inches = 1432 Divided by 65 inches = a body mass index of 22 ( which falls within the healthy range ) Remember that this calculation gives you only a rough guide to weight in comparison with your height and that there are many other factors which contribute towards maintaining a healthy body weight . If you are concerned about your weight why do n't you make an appointment to see your GP , or visit the Health Centre to see the Practice Nurse or to attend A Well Woman / A Well Man Clinic . You could also visit a counsellor at the Counselling Service to discuss some of your concerns . This page is maintained by the Student Support and Counselling Service	Instruction	Instruction
1489	"Comcast initially declined they were doing anything to web traffic , than changed course and acknowledged they were slowing ( or "" throttling "" ) the traffic speeds but only as a "" reasonable "" measure to manage the traffic loads on their network . Peer to peer software , like Bit Torrent , often involves substantially more uploading of data than is typical for regular Internet browsing and email behavior . The throttling was claimed to be justified as a necessary step to balance the load this puts on servers and insure Comcast can provide and equally high quality of service for all customers . In November several consumer groups and a few companies asked the FCC to look into the allegations . Two of the groups even suggested an outrageous fine of $ 195k per subscriber . ( Comcast has about 12m subscribers ) . The FCC will now officially investigate whether Comcast ' s load balancing behavior was reasonable . They 'll also look into what obligation Comcast had to disclose these practices to their subscribers .

1403	This card game contains 99 cards and follows the format of the original board game , focusing on specific problem or concerns of children . Like the original game , the card game is sure to help children communicate their feelings and develop insight into their problems . Full Description : The Talking , Feeling , and Doing Game - devised by Dr. Richard A. Gardner in 1968 and first published in 1973 - has enjoyed worldwide utilization as an extremely effective psychotherapeutic instrument . Most child therapist 's consider it an indispensable part of their playroom equipment . With a high degree of predictability , the game will engage the most resistant and inhibited children into meaningful psychotherapeutic endeavors . The game routinely facilitates disclosures often not otherwise obtainable . Further , the material elicited by the game serve as points of departure for meaningful psychotherapeutic interchanges . The game has proved helpful for shortening the psychotherapeutic process because quickly and predictably provides the therapist with information about the child's underlying psychological processes . Information that might have taken weeks or even months to elicit may even be obtained during the first few sessions . The game was originally designed to enable inhibited children to reveal themselves , but even children who are more freely engaged in direct discussion and insight-oriented therapy will find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience . Sales of the game are restricted to qualified mental health professionals . Buyers must hold at least a Masters Degree in psychology , counseling , social work or a related field , and should have received appropriate clinical training in working with children or adolescents . Please include license number or the name of your graduate school , degree , and year graduated as part of the order .	Promotion	Information/Explanation

914	"At eight o ' clock I heard a knock at the door , and on opening the window found it was one of the servants from the house of my foes . I cried out to let her in , and I breathed again on hearing that Miss Charpillon had just arrived in a sedan-chair in a pitiable condition , and that she had been put to bed . "" I made haste to come and tell you , "" said the cunning maid , "" not for the sake of your two guineas , but because I saw you were so unhappy . "" This duped me directly . I gave her the two guineas , and made her sit down on my bed , begging her to tell me all about her mistress's return . I did not dream that she had been schooled by my enemies ; but during the whole of this period I was deprived of the right use of my reason . The slut began by saying that her young mistress loved me , and had only deceived me in accordance with her mother's orders . "" I know that , "" I said , "" but where did she pass the night ? "" "" At a shop which she found open , and where she was known from having bought various articles there . She is in bed with a fever , and I am afraid it may have serious consequences as she is in her monthly period . "" "" That 's impossible , for I caught her in the act with her hairdresser . "" "" Oh , that proves nothing ! the poor young man does not look into things very closely . "" "" But she is in love with him . "" "" I do n't think so , though she has spent several hours in his company . "" "" And you say that she loves me ! "" "" Oh , that has nothing to do with it ! It is only a whim of hers with the hairdresser . "" "" Tell her that I am coming to pass the day beside her bed , and bring me her reply . "" "" I will send the other girl if you like . "" "" No , she only speaks English . "" She went away , and as she had not returned by three o ' clock I decided on calling to hear how she was . I knocked at the door , and one of the aunts appeared and begged me not to enter as the two friends of the house were there in a fury against me , and her niece lay in a delirium , crying out "" There 's Seingalt , there 's Seingalt ! He 's going to kill me . Help ! help ! "" "" For God's sake , sir , go away , "" I went home desperate , without the slightest suspicion that it was all a lie . I spent the whole day without eating anything ; I could not swallow a mouthful . All night I kept awake , and though I took several glasses of strong waters I could obtain no rest . At nine o ' clock the next morning I knocked at the Charpillon's door , and the old aunt came and held it half open as before . She forbade me to enter , saying that her niece was still delirious , continually calling on me in her transports , and that the doctor had declared that if the disease continued its course she had not twenty-four hours to live . "" The fright you gave her has arrested her periods ; she is in a terrible state . "" "" O , fatal hairdresser ! "" I exclaimed . "" That was a mere youthful folly ; you should have pretended not to have seen anything . "" "" You think that possible , you old witch , do you ? Do not let her lack for anything ; take that . "" With these words I gave her a bank note for ten guineas and went away , like the fool I was . On my way back I met Goudar , who was quite frightened at my aspect . I begged him to go and see how the Charpillon really was , and then to come and pass the rest of the day with me . An hour after he came back and said he had found them all in tears and that the girl was in extremis . "" Did you see her ? "" "" No , they said she could see no one . "" "" Do you think it is all true ? "" "" I do n't know what to think ; but one of the maids , who tells me the truth as a rule , assured me that she had become mad through her courses being stopped , while she has also a fever and violent convulsions . It is all credible enough , for these are the usual results of a shock when a woman is in such a situation . The girl told me it was all your fault . "" I then told him the whole story . He could only pity me , but when he heard that I had neither eaten nor slept for the last forty-eight hours he said very wisely that if I did not take care I should lose my reason or my life ."

1583	"The May / June ' 06 issue carried an article on the history of run-ins between morays and divers near Stingray City and the Sand Bar in Grand Cayman's North Sound ( "" It 's A Moray . . . You Do n't Always Get What You Feed "" ) . The run-ins have continued sporadically . Despite repeated requests by the Cayman Island's Department of the Environment ( DoE ) that watersports operators refrain from feeding or encouraging interaction with green morays , this practice continues . "" After all , divers and local operators have enjoyed this practice for many years , "" said a DAN Member who recently traveled to Cayman . "" Many of us feel that an occasional bite is worth the interaction . We 're dealing with wild creatures here ; that 's part of the thrill of diving with them . "" According to Cayman News Net , on Oct. 11 , 2006 , in an area off the Sand Bar known as "" the reef , "" a dive guide played with a moray for the entertainment of his diving customers . Apparently aware of possible danger , he reportedly told his group to cross their arms and clench their fists if the creature approached . The customer who recounted this incident noted that several of those on the tour were given squid to feed the eel . At some point , the guide , who was also the captain , was bitten on the arm severely enough to incapacitate him and require multiple surgeries and several days' hospitalization . The May 2006 article noted that the DoE was considering new approaches to manage such activities , including limiting the number of boats and people present at any one time , as well as restricting the amount of squid / bait per craft . To date , the DoE has n't publicized their specific proposed amendments to current marine conservation law . However , it has indicated that "" wildlife interaction zones "" are to be established wherein the feeding of marine animals would be tightly regulated . Feeding of underwater creatures outside of these zones would be prohibited . In the meantime , our earlier advice stands : Pay attention to your surroundings , do n't wear shiny objects , and do n't wave your hands or fingers or provoke marine life in any other way . To this we add , ask watersport operators about their policies regarding interactions with morays . Heed their rules and respect the wildlife , and you 'll enjoy your dive - we 'll all be happier for it . Know What to Do Accidents happen , no matter how cautious we are . Plus , there are those times we forget to be consistently vigilant . You might be searching in a rocky crevice for a lobster dinner ( in season , of course ) , or you might have inadvertently jostled a creature making way for your dive buddy near the reef . What happens if you or your buddies get bitten ? Could you handle the situation ? Would n't it be great to know right away the steps to first aid for this ? You can get that know-how by signing up for DAN's First Aid for Hazardous Marine Life Injuries course . You 'll learn how to identify the problem quickly and how to take immediate action . Here are some tips , however blunt , about getting along with marine life . They appear in DAN's Dive and Travel Medical Guide , a membership benefit when joining DAN . Avoid contact with the animal : This sounds simple , but it may not be if you have poor buoyancy control and / or are experiencing conditions of poor visibility , currents , confined areas or other environmental limitations . Do not attempt to handle , tease , feed or annoy any marine animal . Exploring a crevice with your hand is a good way to receive an injury from a hidden animal defending itself . Strive to develop excellent buoyancy control and be aware of what surrounds you . Do not allow a current to force you against a fixed object ; it may be covered with marine animals . Wear protective clothing . Make an effort to find out which animals you may encounter in your dive and learn about their characteristics and habitats before you begin the dive . This will help you enjoy your dive more and prevent possible injury from the animals you encounter ."	News	News

Scope of the report This document contains a summary of the main issues , technical problems and constraints relating to the preparation of national communications and those that have particularly affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them ( section III ) , and the activities and programmes that facilitated and supported the preparation of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( section IV ) . Section V outlines the recommendations made by the CGE for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Possible actions by the subsidiary bodies The Subsidiary Body for Implementation ( SBI ) may wish to take note of the information presented in this document with a view to improving the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In particular , the SBI may wish to recommend to the COP , a draft decision on further guidance for the future work of the CGE in improving the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In addition , the SBI may wish to consider the recommendations made by the CGE , contained in this report , and make these recommendations available , through the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice , to the IPCC , with a view to developing appropriate methods , tools and models for use in non-Annex I Parties . The SBI may also wish to consider the information contained in this document and make available recommendations , through the COP , to the bilateral and multilateral support programmes to provide additional financial resources and technical support for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Organization of work Pursuant to decisions 8 / CP . 5 and 31 / CP . 7 , the CGE held five meetings , each immediately prior to sessions of the subsidiary bodies , and six workshops , between May 2000 and August 2002 . The issues discussed at the meetings of the CGE included the consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the CGE workshops aimed at the improvement of the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties , development of work plans , examination of the information presented in national communications submitted by non-Annex I Parties , and preparation of the CGE reports for consideration by the subsidiary bodies . The reports of four meetings are contained in documents FCCC / SBI / 2000 / 16 , FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 2 , FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 3 , and FCCC / SBI / 2002 / 2 . The report of the fifth meeting was presented by the CGE Chair as an oral report to the subsidiary bodies at their sixteenth session , and is contained in the annex to this document . The six workshops were conducted by the CGE members with the support of the secretariat to facilitate the exchange of experiences between non-Annex I Parties , within and between each developing region , on the preparation of each of the elements of the national communication , so as to identify problems and constraints relating to analytical , technical and methodological issues , and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies to overcome these problems and constraints . A total of 105 experts nominated by 70 non-Annex I Parties , 9 experts from 8 Annex I Parties and 12 representatives from 4 bilateral and 8 multilateral agencies participated in the workshops . The elements of a national communication considered at the workshops were national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , research and systematic observation , GHG mitigation analysis , education , training and public awareness , information and networking , and financial and technical support . In view of the need to analyse information pertaining to each of the elements of a national communication , the CGE divided itself into six task groups to cover : national GHG inventory ; vulnerability and adaptation assessment and research and systematic observation ; GHG mitigation analysis ; education , training and public awareness ; information and networking ; and financial and technical support . The task groups , each facilitated by a coordinator , analysed information presented in 81 initial national communications , and in CGE meetings and workshops . The CGE members also made active use of the CGE listserv , developed and maintained by the secretariat , to exchange views on various issues pertaining to the discharge of its work . The work of the CGE was supported by the secretariat which provided administrative and technical support , and prepared its reports . The CGE , in fulfilling its mandate and terms of reference , contained in the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 , examined information contained in the first compilation and synthesis report ( FCCC / SBI / 1999 / 11 ) and in the 50 initial national communications which had been officially submitted to the secretariat between June 2000 and March 2001 . A report on this work was completed and submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) . In that report , conclusions and recommendations were made by the CGE relating to the improvement of the preparation of the various elements of the national communication , including the recommendations for the improvement of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties contained in the annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 ( UNFCCC guidelines ) . Since the completion of that report , the CGE was mandated by the COP ( decision 31 / CP . 7 ) to continue its work to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . To this end , it examined , together with the previous 50 initial national communications , an additional 31 communications submitted between April 2001 and June 2002 , in accordance with the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 . Additionally , the CGE identified technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them , in accordance with decision 31 / CP . 7 . Data and information The most common problem / constraint encountered by non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their national communications was related to the scarcity and quality of data ( for example , availability , accessibility and reliability ) in all the relevant areas of the national communications . This problem was exacerbated by lack of capacities and expertise to access , collect , analyse , manipulate and manage the data and databases necessary to conduct these studies and analyses . In almost all relevant categories of GHG sources and sinks ( energy , industrial processes , agriculture , land-use change and forestry , and waste ) most Parties found that there was lack of and / or deficiencies in the activity data . This is particularly true in the informal and household sectors of the economy , as well as on gases such as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFC ) , perfluorocarbons ( PFC ) and sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) . Some Parties found that the lack of disaggregation of data on fuel consumption in the industrial and transport sectors made it difficult to estimate emissions from these sectors ( e . g . in biomass and kerosene combustion ) , which caused delays in completing their national GHG inventories . In the assessment of vulnerability and adaptation , Parties noted a lack of the data required as input to impact models and assessments . Therefore , vulnerability and adaptation assessments were based on broad sensitivity studies and the use of expert judgement , although some experts indicated that this method was not generally the preferred option for conducting such assessments . Many Parties also indicated that the assessment of potential mitigation options was constrained by the lack of relevant data and information . Where data were available they were not relevant for sector - and country-specific mitigation analysis . IPCC methodologies and other models Parties generally reported that many of the methodological problems and constraints they encountered in using the IPCC methodologies and other models were due to the fact that many of the default methodologies from the IPCC did not take into account their specific national circumstances . Many Parties also reported that the use of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines ( IPCC Guidelines ) for estimating the GHG emissions in some sectors was inappropriate to their circumstances , particularly in the land-use change and forestry sector ( LUCF ) where forest classifications and the terms used in the LUCF section of the IPCC Guidelines were not consistent with the classifications and definitions used in non-Annex I Parties . For example , growth rates of biomass and / or emission rates used in the IPCC Guidelines for soil carbon , and estimation of fractions of biomass burnt on site , burnt off site or left to decay , were not appropriate for use in many non-Annex I Parties . Many Parties also had difficulties in matching the classification systems recommended by the IPCC Guidelines for animals and agricultural soils to their own circumstances . This created problems in the choice and use of default emission factors , thereby affecting the reliability of the results in the agriculture sector . Similar problems were experienced in calculating the emissions from waste disposal . Many difficulties were encountered in applying and using the IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation ( IPCC Technical Guidelines ) in completing vulnerability and adaptation assessments . These difficulties mainly stem from the unsuitability of existing methods and tools , lack of national capacity / expertise to develop and / or use socio-economic scenarios , and lack of financial resources for assessment work . The analytical methods provided by the IPCC Technical Guidelines and the internationally developed integrated assessment methods , and policy development and decision support tools were often found to be incompatible with local needs and capacities . Integrated assessments and other such sophisticated diagnostic assessments typically required levels of information and expertise that were not widely and readily available in many non-Annex I Parties . This led Parties to use qualitative studies , which were compatible with local capacities , but could be less credible . Many Parties found that difficulties in undertaking impact assessments were mainly due to unavailability of models and inability to apply them . For example , some countries had difficulties in selecting and testing a general circulation model that would adequately fit their own circumstances . The use of MAGICC / SCENGEN was generally reported as being unsatisfactory due to its inappropriate downscaling methods and output . Other Parties indicated that they did not have sufficient knowledge or expertise to use / apply impact models for vulnerability and adaptation assessment . Most of the Parties identified adaptation to climate change as a major issue and included a list of potential adaptation options in their national communications . However , many of these Parties did not evaluate , prioritize and cost these adaptation options . This could be attributed to the fact that the IPCC Technical Guidelines did not adequately address the identification and evaluation of specific adaptation strategies , and to the lack of national expertise to undertake cost-benefit analysis on adaptation options . In general , the identified GHG mitigation options were not assessed comprehensively , due to the lack of common analytical tools ( e . g . models ) and of specific studies , and expertise . Additionally , the lack of models / software for scenario construction , particularly in the agriculture and livestock sectors , presented a serious constraint in conducting mitigation assessments . For some Parties , the preparation of technical studies was constrained by the fact that many of the methodologies and other models , and their instructions and other related documentation , were available only in English , so it was difficult for some experts to use and apply these methods and models . Institutional arrangements , information and networking A major constraint for many Parties was the lack of appropriate institutional arrangements and of clarity over roles and responsibilities of experts and institutions in carrying out the technical studies relating to the preparation of the national communication , which affected data collection and information exchange and networking among countries , regions and project personnel . Some Parties reported that their activities were constrained by the lack of effective coordination among the different ministries involved , and limited awareness among policy makers . The national climate change committees charged with the preparation of national communications in many countries were neither active , nor operational , and many were not granted the necessary legal and institutional authority to effectively carry out their work ; they were therefore not sufficiently motivated to implement their tasks in a timely manner . They also lacked the necessary human capacity to ensure a minimum level of active participation in and monitoring of technical studies , review and endorsement of the project outputs and launching of concrete follow-up actions relating to the preparation of national communications . In some Parties , project implementation was delayed by high turnover of technical staff , political instability and / or a change in project leadership within the institutions responsible for the preparation of the national communication . Some Parties found that weak institutional arrangements and the lack of human resources and capacities for conducting systematic data collection , together with the absence of universities and / or research centres working on climate change issues , particularly in small and poor countries , made it difficult to implement the activities relating to the preparation of national communications . Many Parties recognized that the use of information systems forms an important part of GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment and mitigation analysis , and that networking helps to provide access to updated information and promote the exchange of experiences on these issues . However , many Parties found that such exchange of information and networking were generally weak due to limited human and financial resources , limited data and information , and underdeveloped systems for collecting , processing and maintaining data and information . The lack of hardware , software and expertise for establishing and maintaining networking facilities for the exchange of information ( computers , communication channels ) , presented major constraints in this regard . Many Parties stressed that the low priority granted to vulnerability and adaptation issues by policy makers at the highest levels of government has affected cooperation and coordination among stakeholders in conducting the vulnerability and adaptation assessments . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Almost all Parties highlighted their limited capacities to undertake research and systematic observation activities such as accessing , analysing and managing data relevant to climate change in the areas of impact assessment , detection and early warning of climate extreme events and climate prediction . These limitations were mainly due to lack of financial resources and of human capacities and capabilities , as well as to limited technical support . Many Parties indicated that the level of scientific research and scholarship in institutions which have been established to conduct research was low and / or deteriorating . Some Parties further noted that the problem of lack of research activities was further compounded by irregular observations , out-dated and / or deteriorating infrastructure / systems for data collection , and the inability to access , process and transfer observational data . Many Parties emphasized that the issue of climate change was new to them and so their effort in climate change education , training and public awareness was not commensurate with the importance they placed on this issue . Some Parties also indicated that unavailability of experts and limited financial resources caused difficulties in organizing training workshops for their technical teams , which contributed to the considerable delays in the preparation of different technical studies ( inventory , mitigation , vulnerability ) . The integration of climate change issues into educational curricula was recognized as crucial for the future , but many Parties did not have appropriate resources for such integration . There was also a lack of clear and targeted awareness and education programmes , and the training provided was limited in scope . Many Parties emphasized that awareness and education on climate change issues among the public at large and the policy makers was minimal , partly because of the limited coverage of climate change issues by local media , the lack of active participation on this issue by non-governmental organizations in that area , and limited technical advice and support material . In this context , several Parties mentioned the lack of sufficiently trained scientific and technical personnel , policy makers , and the institutions to carry out research and training on climate change issues . Resources : human , technical and financial Globally the resources dedicated to vulnerability and adaptation studies were not commensurate with the needs and the importance that Parties place on these issues . Limited financial resources , insufficient and inappropriate tools , limited sectoral coverage , insufficient capacity and expertise , lack of experience to coordinate , implement and participate in climate change activities efficiently at the national , subregional , regional and international levels , were all highlighted . Many Parties considered that the level of funding provided and the period allowed for the preparation of the initial national communication were not sufficient to enable them to provide adequate and reliable information in the initial national communication . Some Parties noted that their governments had limited resources to address climate change issues and pointed out that these limitations were not very well compensated by external support for climate change activities . They further indicated that this may be because some bilateral programmes focus on the countries that have a large GHG mitigation potential . Other Parties stressed that their low economic situation meant that climate change issues were given low priority . Insufficient funds for international consultants and for project team members presented many problems in the implementation of the activities relating to the preparation of the national communications . This was particularly true in engaging and involving experts in training , international meetings and workshops . Some Parties stressed that funding available to conduct impact and vulnerability analyses in many sectors that are of vital importance to the national economy was inadequate . Many Parties indicated that in order to address climate change issues in a multidisciplinary and an efficient way , they would require additional financial and technical resources to develop and train a critical mass of human resources . Specific technical problems and constraints that have affected non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications Many of the problems and constraints faced by those Parties who have not yet submitted their initial national communications were similar to those faced by non-Annex I Parties that had already completed their initial national communications . However , Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications face other specific technical problems and constraints . Some Parties stressed that the implementation of the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications was often hampered by the lack of , or insufficient , level of coordination , especially among the technical experts responsible for such tasks , which often led to lengthy delays in starting and completing technical studies relevant for the preparation of national communications . Many Parties found that bureaucratic inertia / bottlenecks inherent within national institutions responsible for the preparation of national communication , and weak institutional linkages between the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) Country Offices and the national executing agencies , with resulting lack of clarity over their respective roles and responsibilities , often slowed progress in implementing the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties also had difficulties in applying the UNDP modalities for the nationally executed programmes , which were not necessarily consistent with the enabling activities project management procedures . This also led to further delays in the implementation of the projects relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties specifically attributed the delays in the preparation of initial national communications to social disturbances and / or political problems and the resultant changes in the leadership of the projects . Such changes sometimes led to inactivity relating to the preparation of national communications , where either the expertise was not available or the institutional arrangements were not appropriate . Other Parties indicated that it was not always clear which agency would be responsible for preparing the initial national communication , thereby leading to lengthy delays . In its previous report to the subsidiary bodies ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) , the CGE noted that a number of multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes had provided human , technical and financial assistance to 137 of a total of 146 non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their initial national communications . The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) was the largest contributor ( US $ 79.6 million ) , through its climate change enabling activities programmes . This , however , represented only about seven per cent of the total funds ( US $ 1.052 billion ) allocated by the GEF to the climate change focal area for the period 1991 to July 2000 . The majority of non-Annex I Parties ( 124 ) had received support from the GEF climate change enabling activities programmes , and only three Parties that had submitted their initial national communication ( Israel , the Republic of Korea and Singapore ) did not receive any support from any of the support programmes . The GEF , in collaboration with the UNDP , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and the UNFCCC , established and funded the National Communications Support Programme , which provided human and technical support to 130 non-Annex I Parties , including countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States . Technical support and assistance provided was mainly in the form of thematic subregional exchange workshops , technical reviews , a help desk and networking . Funding for this support programme comprised US $ 2.1 million from the GEF and US $ 1.3 million through cofinancing from Denmark , the European Community , Finland and Norway . Support from the bilateral support programmes and Annex II Parties was provided through their respective programmes : the United States Country Studies Programme ( USCSP ) , the German Technical Cooperation Agency ( GTZ ) , the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme ( NCCSAP ) , the Finland Climate Change Assistance Programme , and the governments of New Zealand and Greece . Other Annex II Parties ( Australia , Denmark , Japan , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) had also provided financial resources and technical assistance to non-Annex I Parties through climate change training courses , workshops , studies and projects / programmes . Level of funding As of 30 June 2002 , the GEF has provided US $ 1.5 billion in grants for climate change projects since its establishment as a pilot programme in 1991 . About US $ 87.6 million , representing about six per cent of the total amount , was provided by the GEF to 133 non-Annex I Parties through its climate change enabling activities programmes for the preparation of initial national communications . The analysis of the support provided by multilateral and bilateral support programmes points to a growing need to increase capacity and enhance the work relating to the preparation of the national communications in the areas of national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis . In considering the availability of financial resources and technical support , the CGE found that many needs relating to financial and technical support still exist , and new needs have been identified by Parties . These needs will require additional financial and technical support to improve the preparation of national communications . Additional financial support would be needed for data collection , accessing , archiving , quality control , retrieval and management , as well as for capacity-building , and promotion of education , training and public awareness . The analysis of the distribution of financial resources , however , indicated that some countries had received three or four times more funding than had many other countries . The differing focus of the support activities and of the coverage across technical areas , countries and regions , as well as the lack of a reporting framework for the support programmes , particularly bilateral ones , made it difficult to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of these efforts to date . However , from the information presented above on the funding and activities of the support programmes , and information contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 on this issue , it appeared that the level of funding and the number and scope of activities were not commensurate with the needs of Parties identified in their initial national communications and the needs of those Parties that have yet to complete the preparation of their initial national communications . Coordination An analysis of the implementation of activities of the support programmes indicated that there was a need for better coordination and interaction between these programmes , in order to enhance the overall effectiveness of their use of limited resources and to ensure that smaller and poorer countries received adequate attention . This could be done through the establishment of an information sharing mechanism , developed and hosted by a relevant agency / institution , such as the UNFCCC secretariat , to provide information on assistance programmes that support the preparation of national communication or any of its elements . The CGE noted the important role of the National Communication Support Programme in assisting non-Annex I Parties during the preparation of their initial national communications . The CGE was of the view that the newly established National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP might be well placed to assist countries , particularly those that have recently started to prepare their initial national communications . Additionally , the CGE emphasized that there was a need to develop and strengthen interactions and links within and between countries and regions , through multi-country , regional and global projects , and through regional centres of excellence working on various climate change issues , where appropriate . Lessons learned The experiences gained and lessons learned by the multilateral and bilateral support programmes in providing human , financial and technical support for project implementation point to a number of areas where changes could improve the institutional arrangements necessary for the preparation of national communications : Greater involvement of and participation by key policy stakeholders from the beginning of the project cycle and / or at the project concept level and heightened country-driven discussions on the projects and acitvities ; Political support and buy-in to the project and the enhancement of appropriate institutional frameworks for the preparation of national communication ; Engagement of in-country personnel in project activities and promotion of country ownership of the project ; Provision of financial and technical support and integration of project activities and outputs with national policies and strategies ; Building and maintaining capacity of national and / or regional expertise to collect , process and analyse data for enhancing the preparation of national communications and planning for sustainable development ; Focusing studies undertaken in the context of the preparation of national communications , on national priorities . Future plans The multilateral and bilateral support programmes also indicated their plans to continue their activities and programmes to facilitate and support non-Annex I Parties in the implementation of the Convention , including the preparation of national communications . These programmes include the UNEP / IPCC project on the Assessment of Impacts of and Adaptation to Climate Change in multiple regions or sectors , and the World Bank project on Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in the Caribbean region . The UNDP's National Communication Support Unit will implement three regional pilot projects to build capacity in 34 countries on improving the quality of national GHG inventories through the use of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management and to prepare for stage II adaptation using the UNDP's Adaptation Policy Framework . Additionally , a global project on systematic observation is underway , in conjunction with the Global Climate Observing System secretariat . All these activities will feed into the national communication process . The bilateral programmes include phase II of the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme , support by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to the National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP , and the activities of the Danish Agency for Development Assistance . The United States Agency for International Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have plans to continue to provide human , technical and financial support to non-Annex I Parties for activities that underpin the preparation of national communications , including national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and mitigation analysis . To overcome some of the technical problems and constraints identified by non-Annex I Parties in their initial national communications , and by the CGE in fulfilling its mandate in pursuance of decisions 8 / CP . 5 and 31 / CP . 7 , several recommendations were made by the CGE to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Data and information Additional resources should be mobilized to develop and implement a sustainable data collection , compilation , archiving and updating management system for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis . Regional cooperation in activity data generation and management should be encouraged . Particular groups of nations and or regions should develop emission factors , particularly for key sources , to better reflect their national circumstances . Information relating to technical material , methods , tools and models for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis needs to be made available in all official languages of the United Nations at the earliest opportunity and in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of Parties . IPCC methodologies and other models Existing methodologies for GHG inventories should be improved and made clearer for use in non-Annex I Parties . In particular , more clarification is needed in the use of terms and the forest classification systems in the land-use change and forestry sector . The IPCC should be encouraged to develop methods , tools and other models for use in assessing impacts and adaptations in agriculture , water resources , coastal zones and human health at time scales that are relevant for policy-making processes in non-Annex I Parties . Methodologies and models for assessing mitigation options and analysing abatement potential should be made readily accessible to non-Annex I Parties . Studies to conduct detailed cost-benefit analysis should be encouraged in non-Annex I Parties . Institutional arrangements , information and networking Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged , with international support , to develop appropriate and sustainable institutional frameworks and arrangements to carry out activities relating to the preparation of national communications and the implementation of the Convention on a continuous basis . Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to streamline and mainstream activities relating to national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis in their recurrent programmes of work . The GEF and its implementing agencies should be encouraged to clarify roles and responsibilities in close consultation with the national executing agencies relating to the preparation of national communications . Information exchange and sharing of experiences on the preparation of the national communications should be encouraged within and between countries and regions . Regional research and educational centres should be strengthened and , where appropriate , established in various regions . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to undertake assessment of their capacity and needs for research and systematic observation and for climate change education , training and public awareness . Training of national experts on climate change issues such as national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis should be carried out continuously . The scope of training on climate change issues should be widened , to include data and uncertainty analysis and vulnerability and adaptation assessments , at both basic and advanced levels . Resources : human , technical and financial Additional human , technical and financial resources should be provided to non-Annex I Parties for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications . Additional financial resources should be made available to non-Annex I Parties to enhance national expertise to systematically collect , analyse and maintain appropriate data and databases for the preparation of national communications . Clear additional guidance should be given to the GEF to provide financial resources that are commensurate with the resource needs identified by non-Annex I Parties in their national communications . Existing methodologies and national capacities to undertake integrated assessment of climate change impacts in different sectors , such as water resources , agriculture and human health , coastal zones , human settlements and biodiversity , should be enhanced . Training on the use of software and technical guidelines should be provided to non-Annex I Parties so that the studies can be carried out locally . Financial and technical assistance should be provided for assessment of vulnerability and the economic and social costs of adaptation measures . UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications In fulfilling its mandate contained in decision 8 / CP . 5 , the CGE considered the information presented in the initial national communications in accordance with the UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 ) , with a view to improving them . The CGE report containing recommendations for improving the guidelines for reporting on national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , GHG mitigation analysis and education , training and public awareness in the national communication , was submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session , and is contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 . In pursuance of decision 31 / CP . 7 , the CGE also provided its input to the proposed improved UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention . The input of the CGE on the proposed improved guidelines is contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2002 / INF . 8 . Annex Report of the Chair of the Consultative Group of Experts A report on the work of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ( CGE ) was presented to the sixteenth sessions of the subsidiary bodies by the Chair of that group , Ms. Isabelle Niang-Diop ( Senegal ) . In her report , the Chair of the CGE recalled that the CGE had presented its first report ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) , covering the period 2000-2001 , to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth sessions in October 2001 in Marrakesh , Morocco . In addition to the mandate contained in the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 , the Chair of the CGE reminded delegates of the mandate given by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh session ( decision 31 / CP . 7 ) , requesting the CGE : ( i ) to identify and assess technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies ; ( ii ) to provide input to the draft improved guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ; ( iii ) to conduct two workshops with the objective of sharing experiences ; and ( iv ) to organize , to the extent possible , a meeting back-to-back with a meeting of the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The Chair subsequently gave an overview of the activities undertaken by the CGE since its last report . This included a summary of the workshop held in April 2002 on the identification and assessment of technical problems and constraints faced by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to submit their initial national communications , as well as the outcomes of the fifth CGE meeting which addressed the issue of coordination of activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , the work plan to fulfil its current mandate , the relationship between the CGE and the LEG and the exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications . The Chair noted that the CGE , in implementing the mandate contained in decision 31 / CP . 7 , had held its first workshop from 10 to 12 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The workshop had facilitated the exchange of experiences with non-Annex I Parties on different issues related to the preparation of national communications . It had also provided the initial input by the CGE into the draft improved guidelines which was presented to the intersessional workshop on the revision of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , held from 15 to 17 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The CGE had analysed views provided by some non-Annex I Parties ( not including least developed countries ) that had received funds more than three years ago for the preparation of their initial national communications and had not submitted them . Views on the technical problems and constraints Parties are facing had been provided by means of a questionnaire and presentations at the workshop . The CGE noted that those Parties faced methodological and analytical problems similar to those of Parties that had submitted their initial national communications . However , the presentations in the workshops had revealed additional institutional , management and resource constraints , as reported in document FCCC / SBI / 2002 / INF . 3 . According to the Chair , the CGE recognized the difficulties with the coordination of existing activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . The CGE had thus recommended that exchange of information on existing activities and programmes be improved , for example by establishing a publicly accessible database on past and ongoing activities and programmes relating to the preparation of national communications . The CGE had also recognized with concern that important programmes that supported the preparation of national communications were no longer in place , without any consideration for their replacement . The Chair indicated that the CGE had stressed that there was a need for continuing the financial and technical assistance for the 62 non-Annex I Parties that were still in the process of preparing their initial national communications . Regarding the CGE work plan for the period between June and October 2002 , the Chair stated that the CGE had held discussions on its report to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies and on a tentative programme for its second workshop . From these discussions , the CGE had agreed on the following : The report of the CGE to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies would consist of a synthesis of the work accomplished by the CGE from its establishment at COP 5 up to COP 8 in October 2002 . It would also present the results of exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications ; The CGE had decided to hold its second workshop from 7 to 9 August , possibly in Nassau , Bahamas , with the aim of completing its work on problems and constraints of non-Annex I Parties that had yet to submit their initial national communications , and on support programmes and activities . Countries that had not yet presented information on the technical problems and constraints that they were facing in the preparation of their initial national communications would be invited to do so at this workshop . Representatives of multilateral agencies that support the preparation of national communications would be invited to make presentations on their programmes in accordance with a framework that should be provided by the CGE . Presentations would also be made by experts on how to overcome some of the constraints that had been identified already . The Chair reported that the CGE had also discussed its relationship with the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The group had noted that a back-to-back meeting would unfortunately not be feasible for 2002 as originally decided at COP 7 ( decision 31 / CP . 7 , paragraph 5 ) . The CGE , however , had stressed the importance of exchanging views between the two groups through the two common members , the consideration of each group's reports and the participation of experts from the LEG at the CGE workshops . The CGE had also discussed the provision of financial resources for the preparation of the second national communications . In the light of the gaps and constraints identified in the preparation of the initial national communications , the CGE recognized that it might be necessary to increase the financial resources to improve the process of the preparation of national communications . The CGE recommended that the distribution by the GEF of financial resources among Parties for the preparation of national communications should be based on transparent criteria , considering the specific needs of each Party . Furthermore , the CGE had exchanged views on possible future activities to improve the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties and in this regard had identified as potential areas : a technical assessment of national communications on a voluntary basis ; organization of workshops on specific topics ; monitoring of capacity-building programmes and strengthening of coordination between the national communication processes ; and reporting activities under other environmental agreements . In line with this , it would be necessary to identify the appropriate institutional arrangements to support these activities . The Chair of the CGE stated that it was her belief that many of the technical issues , problems and constraints identified in the preparation of initial national communications , and recommendations made by the CGE , would form the basis upon which financial and technical support would be made available for the preparation of subsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Therefore , the subsidiary bodies might wish to invite the financial mechanism and bilateral organizations to provide financial and technical resources to those non-Annex I Parties that were ready to start the preparation of their second national communications . In concluding , the Chair acknowledged the dedication and commitment provided by the CGE experts , and their respective governments and organizations who had supported their participation in the CGE . She also extended this acknowledgement to the other experts ( 101 participants representing 68 Parties ) that had participated in the CGE workshops . It was to these that the Chair , on behalf of the CGE , expressed her gratitude and thanks . The Chair also thanked the Governments of Australia , Finland , Germany ( through the Bonn Fund ) , Switzerland , the Netherlands and the United States of America for funding the CGE workshops and the UNFCCC secretariat for the excellent support it had provided to the CGE in the organization of its work and the production of its reports . * This document is submitted after the due date because all the necessary information was not available on time . Three regional workshops , one each for the regions of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean , were held in 2000 ; one interregional workshop was held in 2001 ; and two interregional workshops were held in 2002 . Support programmes are those activities , projects and programmes which supported the preparation of initial national communications , and the preparation of various elements of the national communication ( e . g . national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , mitigation assessment ) . The climate change enabling activities programmes include activities that are funded through expedited procedures , full projects that use standard procedures of funding , and projects covering limited components of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties .

794	Recent theoretical studies have suggested that the observed suppression of superconductivity in superconductor / ferromagnet ( S / F ) heterostructures could be modulated by controlling the ferromagnetic exchange interaction in the superconductor . The exchange interaction in the superconductor is the sum of the exchange interaction from the ferromagnetic regions , which has a phase and magnitude that depends upon the direction that the ferromagnet is magnetised and the distance . As the exchange interaction has a phase it is possible that the contribution from two regions will cancel out . The exchange interaction , which can be viewed as an imbalance in the spin populations , suppresses superconductivity so any reduction in the exchange interaction will increase the superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of the heterostructure . Thus by changing the magnetisation of the ferromagnetic regions it is possible to control the exchange interaction in the superconductor and so the superconducting p. ..

Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Why is Dabiq so important for IS ? Suicide bombers have used explosives-laden ambulances to kill at least 21 people and wound many others in the Iraqi cities of Tikrit and Samarra . The so-called Islamic State ( IS ) group said it had carried out both attacks . The attack in the holy city of Samarra targeted Shia pilgrims , including Iranians . A queue of vehicles waiting to enter Tikrit was also hit . Further north , government forces continue to battle IS in Mosul , but deadly street fighting has slowed them . They are facing fierce resistance as they push through the city's eastern and southern suburbs , blocked by concrete barricades and snipers on rooftops . Slow progress The deadliest of Sunday's blasts happened in Tikrit , some 200km ( 123 miles ) south of Mosul . A suicide bomber drove a booby-trapped ambulance into a line of vehicles queuing at a checkpoint at the southern entrance to the city , once the hometown of executed former leader Saddam Hussein . The blast was so huge it blew some victims into a nearby river .

Iranian pilgrims were among the dead . The number of dead and wounded at both attacks varies between reports . Media captionBBC Arabic's Feras Kilani in Mosul , with cameraman Marek Polaszewski : "" A large armed car drives packed with explosives drives directly into the convoy "" Iraq's special forces ( CTS ) have secured a foothold in the eastern districts of Mosul but have moved only a kilometre since Friday . They are now pushing into more densely populated areas and have had to curtail air strikes in order to protect civilians . CTS spokesman Sabah al-Numani said they were facing "" the toughest urban warfare that any force in the world could undertake "" , with sniper fire from rooftops and IS militants using false flags of surrender to entice troops towards car bombs .

231	"Agenda The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The meeting was called to order at 10.45 a . m . Expression of thanks to the retiring President The President : As this is the first open meeting of the Security Council for the month of August , I should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute , on behalf of the Council , to His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations , for his service as President of the Security Council for the month of July 2002 . I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Greenstock for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month . Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted . The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo The President : I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and South Africa , in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda . In conformity with the usual practice , I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion , without the right to vote , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure . There being no objection , it is so decided . On behalf of the Council , I extend a warm welcome to Her Excellency Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . At the invitation of the President , Ms. Dlamini Zuma ( South Africa ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : On behalf of the Council , I extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Léonard She Okitundu , Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the invitation of the President , Mr. She Okitundu ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : On behalf of the Council , I also extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka , Special Envoy of the President of Rwanda on the Great Lakes Region . At the invitation of the President , Mr. Mazimpaka ( Rwanda ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda . The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations . I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and to thank our special guests for having come so far at such short notice . They have shown great statesmanship by signing an Agreement that represents an important step towards ending a war that that has cost countless lives and produced immeasurable suffering . With the help of South African President Mbeki , the signatory heads of State have for the first time met to pledge to bring this difficult chapter in their history to a close . They should be applauded . The Agreement signed in Pretoria on 30 July provides a real opportunity for progress . Members of the Council want to understand fully the provisions of the Agreement and the intentions of the parties to ensure that all those who will play a role in making the Agreement work understand their responsibilities and obligations . Implementation will be a difficult and complicated task that will require unswerving commitment by the parties and by the international community . Having said that by way of introduction , I shall now give the floor to the Secretary-General . The Secretary-General : I shall be brief this morning . Let me say how happy I am to see the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda here this morning , as well as , of course , Minister Dlamini Zuma , representing South Africa , which co-facilitated this agreement . I believe that the signing of the peace agreement between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in Pretoria on 30 July represents an important political milestone which could help pave the way towards a lasting resolution of one of Africa's most complex conflicts . The parties have indicated their determination to honour this agreement and to end the conflict . We , on our side , should do whatever we can to assist them in implementing the agreement . I applaud President Mbeki for his important contribution to the agreement in his capacity as Chairman of the African Union . The two presidents have committed themselves to achieving peace and , specifically , to working with each other to achieve it . That is very encouraging . We must now quickly approach the parties in a pragmatic manner and urge them to take the steps required to operationalize the agreement as soon as possible . I believe that the international community must provide all necessary support to ensure the success of this initiative . The momentum established must be maintained and built upon . I hope this meeting of the Council can contribute to that . I have instructed the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) to determine which actions it can take within its current mandate and resources to assist the parties to carry out the agreement . However , the parties need to be perfectly clear on the tasks to be performed and to provide the necessary information in order for MONUC to define its specific role . The Secretariat is also looking forward to receiving a team of experts from South Africa – in fact , I think they have arrived today – to discuss together the support that the process requires and how we move forward from here . I therefore expect to revert to the Council in due course with specific recommendations for MONUC after the Secretariat undertakes intensive consultations with the parties concerned . The presence with us today of the South African Foreign Minister , as well as of Mr. She Okitundu of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mr. Mazimpaka of Rwanda is particularly valuable because it enables you to engage directly with the Council and enables the Council to engage you on issues that are directly concerned with the implementation of the agreement . Of course , I look forward to a very serious dialogue not only here in the Council but also with the various United Nations departments . I think that reflects the value of the new partnership between the African Union and the United Nations . I am now eager to listen to the Foreign Minister of South Africa and to the representatives of the parties so that we can gain a full and detailed understanding of this important agreement and this implementation as soon as possible . The President : I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . Ms. Dlamini Zuma ( South Africa ) : Mr. President , allow me to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August . Let me also express our sincere gratitude for inviting us to address the Council on an important development in our continent . I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts and contribution to bring about peace and stability throughout the African continent . The recent launch of the African Union has highlighted our commitment to peace and development in Africa . We believe that the United Nations can be an important partner as we rebuild our continent , especially using the principles enshrined in the New Partnership for Africa's Development ( NEPAD ) . Last week , the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Rwandese Republic took an important step by signing a peace agreement on the withdrawal of the Rwandan troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the dismantling of the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . This peace agreement assumes greater significance in that it comes in the wake of the tremendous progress that was made by the Congolese people in the inter-Congolese dialogue , which was held in our country earlier this year . This agreement is very important , and it is at the centre of the peace process . It therefore gives a strong signal of political will on the sides of both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to expedite a peace process between themselves . It is very important that we all support and encourage the implementation of this agreement . We can not be seen to be less than enthusiastic about it . To understand the agreement before us , we must go back to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of 1999 . In that agreement , there was a question on how to deal with the foreign forces that had come into the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Everyone acknowledged that the foreign troops would have to withdraw in order to allow the people of the country to decide on their future without any external interference . The problem remained of the presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the armed military groups such as Interahamwe and ex-FAR , which were implicated in the Rwandese genocide . In the years since the signing of the Lusaka Agreement , it has become even more clear that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could not be resolved until the matter of the armed groups was addressed . We are all aware that these armed groups operate freely within the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not only continue to pose a real threat to the people of Rwanda but can destabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself . We welcome the declared wish of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to have those armed groups utilize its territory for launching attacks against its neighbours . We also welcome the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to withdraw its forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as soon as those military groups cease to be a threat to the people of Rwanda . At the launch of the African Union , a crucial meeting was held when President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda met for the first time . The meeting was held in the presence of President Mbeki and Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who was accompanied by senior leadership of United Nations Secretariat and of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) . Follow-up meetings were later held with ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda , together with MONUC . In this regard , we would like to pay tribute to MONUC for its role in supporting peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Despite its limited strength and the difficult conditions that prevail , MONUC has managed to carry out its duties . The Durban meeting laid the basis for the peace agreement . It was where both President Kagame and President Kabila asked President Mbeki and Secretary-General Annan to act jointly as a third party guaranteeing the agreement . From the outset we wish to make clear that the agreement signed between the two Governments is a reflection of their wishes and interests . Furthermore , it does not supplant the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of 1999 and subsequent agreements but , rather , complements all of them . The need for this Agreement stems from the recognition that progress in establishing lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can not be registered without resolving the conflict between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda . There is no doubt that the developments of the last month have created a political momentum that must be seized and supported by all actors concerned , including the international community . That momentum , in turn , requires that every one of us do everything necessary to achieve the targets set out in the programme of implementation . This Agreement has given the rare gift of hope to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to all the countries of the Great Lakes region . We can not , therefore , be seen to have contributed to the slowing down of the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and , indeed , in the rest of the Great Lakes region . We therefore look forward to the discussions this morning as a step forward towards taking the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region to higher levels . The President : I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Mr. She Okitundu ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : Mr. President , we wish to associate ourselves with earlier speakers in offering you our warmest congratulations and in saying how gratified our delegation is to see you presiding over the Security Council in this month of August 2002 . We believe that your intellectual skills and your diplomatic talents , together with your lengthy experience of international relations , will ensure the success of the work of the Council this month . We wish also to convey to your predecessor , Sir Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom , our warm congratulations and our sincere thanks for having guided the work of the Security Council with a great deal of energy and skill last month . We also wish thank you , Sir , for having convened this important meeting of the Security Council on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which certainly once again has the merit of helping us better to evaluate the peace process that is under way and to welcome the recent and very significant advances made to put an end to the war of aggression that has been waged against my country for more than four years now . We hope also that it will help to pave the way towards lasting peace for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and for all the countries of the region . The Security Council has just heard a comprehensive statement by Ms. Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini Zuma , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . The Minister has clearly and eloquently described the Peace Agreement that was concluded at Pretoria on 30 July between our Government and that of the Republic of Rwanda , as well as the programme for implementation covering the withdrawal of Rwandese troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the dismantling of the former Rwandan army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The Minister has described what is at stake in the Peace Agreement and the prospects for success . We fully share her vision , and – as our head of State , Major-General Joseph Kabila , President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , stated at the signing ceremony of the Agreement – the obligations and commitments undertaken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo pursuant to this peace agreement will be scrupulously complied with . Here we wish to extend our very sincere thanks to President Thabo Mbeki , his Government and the people of South Africa for their determination , and I would even say their obstinacy , which took us from Sun City to Pretoria by way of Durban , to ensure that peace prevails once again in the Great Lakes region . We wish also to pay tribute to our regional organization , the African Union , which , through the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim , was the first to highlight the useless and senseless nature of this war of aggression . The efforts of the interim Chairman of its Commission , Mr. Amara Essy , has always been , and remains , decisive in the quest to restore peace and calm to our region . May I lastly thank Mr. Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of our universal Organization , for his important statement . We are very grateful to him for having lent his moral weight by endorsing the Pretoria Agreement . We wish in this connection to express our full appreciation for all of his endeavours , and especially for his commitment to tirelessly exploring all possibilities likely to bring about a successful and prompt conclusion of the peace process that began at Lusaka . In order to settle the question of the war of aggression once and for all , since last year our Government has been in direct contact with the leaders of countries whose forces are illegally occupying our country , pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which call for the holding of such meetings in order to establish the necessary relations of trust in order to promote the cause of peace . For his part , the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , has tirelessly committed himself to this process , particularly in terms of organizing meetings with the Rwandese party , the most recent of which , at which he was present , took place in Durban , in parallel with the OAU / African Union Summit . The Pretoria Agreement , which is basically bilateral and guaranteed by the third party , falls – as the South African Minister said just now – within the framework of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement . In this regard , the Pretoria Agreement is likely greatly to facilitate and speed up the completion of the remaining phases provided for in the timetable for the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement . The Pretoria Agreement is also in conformity with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council calling for the orderly withdrawal of all foreign troops and in particular resolution 1341 ( 2001 ) , whereby the Council , for the first time , called for , among other things , the elaboration of a plan and a precise timetable which would lead to the finalization of the total and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops , as well as for disarmament , demobilization , reintegration and repatriation or resettlement ( DDRRR ) programmes . With respect to the DDRRR process , the Democratic Republic of the Congo undertakes strictly to comply with its obligations under this Agreement , inter alia , by pursuing the process of the demobilization and disarmament of Rwandese combatants which began at Kamina and by extending it to other areas of the country under foreign occupation as the authority of the State is established there . Moreover , we would like to express to the international community as a whole our trust in the fact that we will receive support from it in the simultaneous process of the withdrawal of troops and repatriation , reintegration and resettlement of combatants in their countries of origin , in conformity with international law . With respect to the withdrawal of foreign troops , it should be noted that the majority of the parties to the conflict had already submitted their plans to the Joint Military Commission and have commenced their withdrawal . Among the countries that came to the assistance of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in defending its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity – countries that we wish once again to thank on behalf of the Republic for the sacrifice of their sons and daughters to the noble cause of truth , justice and dignity – Namibia has totally withdrawn , and Angola and Zimbabwe have repatriated a large number of their contingents . As to the uninvited forces , withdrawal movements have been observed only on the part of Uganda and Burundi . Rwanda , for its part , has considerably increased its forces and remains the only country to be engaged in large-scale military operations on Congolese soil . There will be tremendous rejoicing when the Congolese people , the third party and the international community are officially informed , in a few hours , of the withdrawal plan for Rwandese troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , pursuant to the programme of implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . Another promising sign will be the beginning of the demilitarization of the city of Kisangani , pursuant to resolution 1304 ( 2000 ) . This city , as we have stated before , must no longer be the symbol of the martyrdom of a whole nation . It must , rather , become the political and physical symbol of renewal and return to dignity for the whole of the Congolese people , the emblem of the hope for a better life for present and future generations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the same time , all illegal activities to exploit the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which feed the continued war of aggression , must end . Our Government , which is fully cooperating with the group of experts set up for that purpose , will ensure that this is done . The Agreement is certainly the most serious opportunity for peace since the beginning of the war of aggression on 2 August 1998 . It provides a response – which we hope is adequate – to Rwanda's security concerns , although it is the Democratic Republic of the Congo that has been experiencing total insecurity for four years . The Agreement also envisages the restoration of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which was gravely imperilled by the Rwandan presence . Finally , the Agreement embodies the ingredients for a return to normality for the countries and the peoples of the Great Lakes region . We must succeed , but we must be helped to succeed . The international community , which welcomed the Pretoria Agreement , must invest in it tangibly and unstintingly , on either the bilateral or the multilateral level , to assist the two signatory parties and the third parties in their determination to end a conflict that has caused the deaths of more than 3 million people in four years . For its part , the United Nations can help immediately , especially by formulating for its Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a new concept of operations that would effectively activate phase III of its deployment and would both support the verification mechanism and enable it to participate in the execution structure that the third party will put in place , within the framework of the Pretoria Agreement . Action is needed now . The situation – which continues to be fragile , as demonstrated by recent events in Kisangani and by the deadly skirmishes between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and Congolese combatants of Tutsi origin in the high plateaux of Kivu – may worsen . That would augur ill for the credibility of the United Nations as a whole . We must avoid that at all costs . The improvement in the prospects for peace in the Great Lakes region enables us to look with more serenity to the process of reconciliation and national concord in our country . The political agreement for consensual management of the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , concluded at Sun City , has made possible the reunification of more than 70 per cent of the national territory . Talks are now under way , on the one hand , with the signatory parties to the Sun City agreement and , on the other , with the other armed component , its dissidents and the components of society and the unarmed opposition , in order to define the contours of an agreement that would be more consensual and inclusive . The essential here is that we must procrastinate no longer , but rather must decide to make headway on this issue . In that regard , we are convinced that the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General , Mr. Moustapha Niasse , will meet with success . Those working to advance the transition will certainly be political leaders of all stripes , but also leaders representing religious faiths , the academic world , the media , private and public enterprise and civil society . Leaders dedicated to the moral values of governance , their greatest virtues remain disinterest and love of country . As Mrs. Mary Robinson , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , noted in her report to the Council , impunity remains one of the principal causes of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Putting an end to such impunity is a fundamental requirement for the return to a durable peace in the region . The choice of transition leaders should take that requirement into account . Such an approach is in conformity with the recommendations in the High Commissioner's report , namely , strengthening the rule of law and the administration of justice , and the creation of mechanisms whereby all those responsible for human rights violations and for war crimes must answer for their acts . The creation of a truth and reconciliation commission on the South African model could provide an element of response . We must do justice for the millions of Congolese dead , formulating concrete measures with a view to putting an end to impunity , compensating victims and preventing the resurgence of such acts . The process of restoring peace and establishing and consolidating relations of trust must continue and be strengthened by increased credibility for the United Nations and the Security Council , for there is a risk of seeing crumble the whole edifice of the partnership that the Council has patiently built with the parties bound by the Lusaka Agreement . The United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) needs to review its operations , particularly with regard to the protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence , as the Council reaffirmed in resolution 1417 ( 2002 ) . The Council must redefine the concept of MONUC's operations in order to enable it to properly carry out the mission conferred on it by the Pretoria Agreement . MONUC must be given the means to enable it to operate and have unhindered access to needy populations . For example , it is indispensable that the MONUC team be authorized without further delay to have access to the locality of Minembwe in the high plateaux . It is also imperative that the reopening of the river network for humanitarian assistance and commercial trade between Kinshasa and Kisangani become a reality and that the city of Kisangani be accessible once river traffic is opened to trade in the reunified zones , pursuant to the Sun City agreement . Here , I should like to pay tribute to our friends in MONUC , under the leadership of Mr. Amos Namanga Ngongi , Special Representative of the Secretary-General , for the quality of the work that they have done and for their total devotion to the cause of peace and the restoration of dignity to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Their efforts deserve to be encouraged and supported . For their part , the States of the region must supplement their efforts . First , it is urgent that the Democratic Republic of the Congo conclude with the Governments of Uganda and Burundi agreements similar to the Pretoria Agreement . The Government of Burundi has , in a timely manner , informed us of its intention to do this . Contacts have already been made at the highest level . We must translate into concrete action the good will expressed on both sides . Then we must sit down together and discuss our region's future . The international conference for peace , stability , security and development that we earnestly wish for should lay the basis for a new order . The international conference could help the region's countries ensure the security of their States and of their populations so that no element can intervene to disrupt order and tranquillity , while at the same time conceiving , defining and fostering the creation and development of economic activities of common interest and , lastly , promoting and intensifying trade and the movement of persons and goods . A new order at the regional level presupposes a new order at the national level . Processes of democratic transition are under way in our country and in Burundi . We remain certain that they will succeed . Furthermore , we welcome the willingness expressed by the Rwandese authorities to hold elections in their country in the medium term . We ask the international community to assist that country's efforts so that it can restore internal peace and national concord . In saying that , the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to assure all its partners – in particular our brothers in neighbouring countries – f our fervent desire to live in perfect harmony with the whole world , in a spirit of tolerance , solidarity and frank cooperation . The Pretoria Agreement is the very foundation for restoring the trust that has been lost , on the basis of which we can together renew the bonds of friendship and good-neighbourliness that should govern our future relations . The Democratic Republic of the Congo will never serve as a channel to sow discord and desolation in any country , in particular our neighbours . That is a sacred principle of our diplomacy , which we have always wished to be constructive and not subversive . The Democratic Republic of the Congo looks forward to the advent of a region where peace , security , justice and prosperity prevail . The President : I now give the floor to the Special Envoy of the President of Rwanda on the Great Lakes Region . Mr. Mazimpaka ( Rwanda ) : It is my honour to congratulate you , Sir , as others who have spoken before me have done , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August . In addition , allow me , through you , to extend our recognition to your predecessor , the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom , for the way in which he conducted the affairs of the Council last month . We have come to the Council today , at its invitation , to present what we believe is an unprecedented step towards the resolution of the conflict that has afflicted Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in the main , and the Great Lakes Region as a whole , since the signing of the Lusaka Agreement for a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in 1999 . The Pretoria Agreement provides solutions for what up to now have been intractable problems in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement . The problem of the forces that carried out genocide and then relocated to bases in Zaire , later the Democratic Republic of the Congo , has preoccupied the Council and the signatories for a long time , without their having found a clear solution . Throughout , the Council continued to urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work together to resolve the root causes of the conflict , that is , to find how to dissuade the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces from carrying out attacks on Rwanda from bases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Today we firmly believe that our plan , worked out with the help of the President of the Republic of South Africa and with the encouragement and support of the Secretary-General , has a chance to succeed . We appeal to the Council to do its utmost to assist us along this path . At the signing ceremony in Pretoria , South Africa , of what is now known as the Pretoria Agreement or the Peace Agreement between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda , President Paul Kagame characterized the Agreement as very important . He said that because the Agreement addresses two core issues that underlie the conflict : first , how to resolve the problem of the ex-FAR and Interahamwe and , secondly , the withdrawal of all former forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . By addressing those two issues , the Agreement paves the way for peace and stability , which have eluded our respective countries for a long time . Those familiar with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement , including the Council , know that we have been painfully aware of the poor record of our performance in the area of the disarmament , demobilization and repatriation of the armed groups . As crucial as that part of the Lusaka Agreement may be , the parties have so far failed to make any headway in effecting any meaningful disarmament and , hence , in reducing the security threat to affected countries , principally Rwanda . What the Pretoria Agreement brings to the process is a solemn commitment by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to track , assemble and disarm ex-FAR and Interahamwe , in collaboration with the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) , the Joint Military Commission ( JMC ) and the third party . Rwanda , in turn , undertook to withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as soon as this process gets under way and is judged to be irreversible . Let me recall here that Rwanda's commitment to the repatriation and reintegration of combatants has withstood the test of time , numbers and adverse conditions . Since 1994 , a large number of members of the former Armed Forces of Rwanda have rejoined the military service in our country or been demobilized like any members of the national forces . The militias who accompanied these forces in the wars in the Congo have also come home in large numbers and have been resettled into normal civilian life . The now-well-documented 2,000 captives of the 2001 war in the north-west of Rwanda have by now been settled , and some of them have actually formed a group to carry out sensitization work among those who are still in Congo , using the themes of national unity and reconciliation , which they have witnessed in the country . Recently , this group accompanied MONUC to Benin to help in confidence-building among the small group of combatants who had indicated that they wanted to go home . Unfortunately , for that particular operation , the heavy presence of detractors of this process made it impossible for the group to go home , although they had been waiting for two months to be repatriated . We hope that in the future such groups will not be exposed to so-called political leaders and other agents who interfere with their wish to return home . Through the work of MONUC and the JMC we are all aware , or will have an idea , about where the ex-Far and Interahamwe are operating from in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how they are organized . Indeed , it is on that basis that assembly areas were planned . Those plans were approved by the signatories to the Lusaka Agreement . We need MONUC's assistance to make the assembly areas operational and secure . The repatriation exercise will require more resources , particularly for transport and resettlement . The Government of Rwanda will continue to do its part in ensuring that this process is successful . Rwanda is grateful for all the assistance the United Nations has provided in our trying times . We hope that the Council will see the resolution of the conflict in the region as a shared challenge . Rwanda is grateful to President Thabo Mbeki and the rest of the leadership of the Republic of South Africa for their commitment to peace in our region . Equally , we warmly welcome the commitment of President Mbeki as Chairman of the African Union ( AU ) , as well as that of the Secretaries-General of the AU and of the United Nations , to see the Agreement implemented as signed . We appeal for continued support for all the parties involved in the conflict , as this effort alone can not resolve all the outstanding problems – such as the need to work out an all-inclusive agreement and to achieve the withdrawal of all other foreign forces . On this occasion , Rwanda fully recognizes the problems caused by the presence and activities of our nationals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . That is why we salute and welcome the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to negotiate this Agreement , as well as the leadership demonstrated by President Joseph Kabila in signing the Pretoria Agreement . In this spirit , we believe that all the other outstanding issues should find solutions through a sincere and pragmatic exchange among the countries of our region . Allow me to conclude my remarks by reiterating the commitment President Paul Kagame made on behalf of the people of Rwanda on the occasion of the signing of the Peace Agreement in Pretoria at the end of last month . "" Rwanda is ready to fulfil its part of the obligations as agreed in this Memorandum of Understanding . We are going to sign . We stand ready to work with you , our African brothers and sisters , and to work with the rest of the international community so as to bring about peace and security , which are very important to the people to Rwanda , the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the whole people of Africa . "" The President : There are no further speakers inscribed on my list for this portion of the meeting this morning . The Security Council will continue the consideration of this item on its agenda following the adjournment of the open meeting , whereupon we will enter into a private meeting . But before adjourning this portion of the meeting , I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his presence in having joined us this morning . The meeting rose at 11.35 a . m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-178 ."

1101	Mediolanum ( Whitchurch ) This is the British Mediolanum of the Antonine Itinerary . Ptolemy places a separate Mediolanum , sometimes identified with Meifod , in central Wales . The town was located on a major Roman routeway between Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Viroconium Cornoviorum ( Wroxeter ) . The Romans first built a fort which has been tentatively suggested as forming part of the border defences established by Ostorius Scapula around AD 52 . By about AD 100 , however , the army had probably moved on and the surrounding civilian ' vicus ' would have taken over the site . In the mid-2nd century , the area was at least partly covered by timber-framed industrial buildings . The town reached the height of its prosperity by the early 3rd century and there was much rebuilding in stone . This continued for the next hundred years . Masonry houses with associated wooden outhouses were most common during this period . [ 1 ] Roman artefacts from the site are on display in the Whitchurch Heritage Centre .

929	John looked all about him , drinking the clear air like wine ; then his eyes returned to the cabman's face as he sat , not ungleefully , awaiting John's communication , with the air of one looking to be tipped . The features of that face were hard to read , drink had so swollen them , drink had so painted them , in tints that varied from brick-red to mulberry . The small grey eyes blinked , the lips moved , with greed ; greed was the ruling passion ; and though there was some good nature , some genuine kindliness , a true human touch , in the old toper , his greed was now so set afire by hope , that all other traits of character lay dormant . He sat there a monument of gluttonous desire . John's heart slowly fell . He had opened his lips , but he stood there and uttered nought . He sounded the well of his courage , and it was dry . He groped in his treasury of words , and it was vacant . A devil of dumbness had him by the throat ; the devil of terror babbled in his ears ; and suddenly , without a word uttered , with no conscious purpose formed in his will , John whipped about , tumbled over the roadside wall , and began running for his life across the fallows . He had not gone far , he was not past the midst of the first afield , when his whole brain thundered within him , ' Fool ! You have your watch ! ' The shock stopped him , and he faced once more toward the cab . The driver was leaning over the wall , brandishing his whip , his face empurpled , roaring like a bull . And John saw ( or thought ) that he had lost the chance . No watch would pacify the man's resentment now ; he would cry for vengeance also . John would be had under the eye of the police ; his tale would be unfolded , his secret plumbed , his destiny would close on him at last , and for ever . He uttered a deep sigh ; and just as the cabman , taking heart of grace , was beginning at last to scale the wall , his defaulting customer fell again to running , and disappeared into the further fields . CHAPTER VIII - SINGULAR INSTANCE OF THE UTILITY OF PASS-KEYS WHERE he ran at first , John never very clearly knew ; nor yet how long a time elapsed ere he found himself in the by-road near the lodge of Ravelston , propped against the wall , his lungs heaving like bellows , his legs leaden-heavy , his mind possessed by one sole desire - to lie down and be unseen . He remembered the thick coverts round the quarry-hole pond , an untrodden corner of the world where he might surely find concealment till the night should fall . Thither he passed down the lane ; and when he came there , behold ! he had forgotten the frost , and the pond was alive with young people skating , and the pond-side coverts were thick with lookers - on . He looked on a while himself . There was one tall , graceful maiden , skating hand in hand with a youth , on whom she bestowed her bright eyes perhaps too patently ; and it was strange with what anger John beheld her . He could have broken forth in curses ; he could have stood there , like a mortified tramp , and shaken his fist and vented his gall upon her by the hour - or so he thought ; and the next moment his heart bled for the girl . ' Poor creature , it 's little she knows ! ' he sighed . ' Let her enjoy herself while she can ! ' But was it possible , when Flora used to smile at him on the Braid ponds , she could have looked so fulsome to a sick - hearted bystander ? The thought of one quarry , in his frozen wits , suggested another ; and he plodded off toward Craigleith . A wind had sprung up out of the north-west ; it was cruel keen , it dried him like a fire , and racked his finger-joints . It brought clouds , too ; pale , swift , hurrying clouds , that blotted heaven and shed gloom upon the earth . He scrambled up among the hazelled rubbish heaps that surround the caldron of the quarry , and lay flat upon the stones . The wind searched close along the earth , the stones were cutting and icy , the bare hazels wailed about him ; and soon the air of the afternoon began to be vocal with those strange and dismal harpings that herald snow . Pain and misery turned in John's limbs to a harrowing impatience and blind desire of change ; now he would roll in his harsh lair , and when the flints abraded him , was almost pleased ; now he would crawl to the edge of the huge pit and look dizzily down .

1676	The Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter on July 4 , 2016 , after a journey of nearly five years and 2.7 billion km ( 1 . 7 billion miles ) . It will be the first space probe to orbit Jupiter since Galileo plunged into that planet's atmosphere in 2003 . NASA / JPL-Caltech Jupiter is the most-massive planet in the solar system , and because it is so large , it retained all of the gas it was born with . Nothing could escape its gravitation by seeping into space , like the hydrogen in Earth's atmosphere . By studying the composition of Jupiter , Juno will be able to identify the gas that the planet formed with 4.5 billion years ago and thus maybe learn how Jupiter came to be . NASA / JPL The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth ( about 16,500 km wide ) that has been swirling since at least the 1830s and maybe even since the mid-17th century . Although it 's been observed for centuries , almost nothing is known about it . What is powering it ? Why has it lasted for hundreds of years ? Juno will get a very close view of the spot , from just 4,600 km ( 3 , 000 miles ) away , which may clear up its mysteries . Not much is known about the core of Jupiter , or even if it really has one at all . Scientists have speculated that Jupiter's core is likely hydrogen that has been squeezed by the enormous weight of the atmosphere above it into a metallic form . As the probe's velocity changes as it orbits the planet , the frequency of radio waves that Juno transmits to Earth will change . From these changes , Juno will measure Jupiter's gravitational field and its internal structure precisely . NASA / JPL / Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Jupiter has the largest magnetosphere of any planet . The magnetic field lines stretch out over a space 75 times bigger than the planet itself . Juno is teeming with instruments to study the charged particles trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field . These measurements – when combined with the study of Jupiter's deep internal structure , where the magnetic field is generated – will give a much better understanding of this powerful magnetosphere . NASA / JPL / Space Science Institute Juno will be in a polar orbit around Jupiter in order to avoid encounters with the planet's strong radiation belts , which could damage the spacecraft . Thus , Juno will be the first probe to get a close-up view of Jupiter's poles . The polar regions of Jupiter are very interesting because of Jupiter's powerful magnetosphere , which generates strong aurora . The auroral oval even has spots from which currents of plasma flow from Jupiter's moons to the poles of the planet .	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
933	"The face seemed more heavy and more wrinkled , while that ominous venous tinge was more pronounced as he panted up the hill . The clean lines of his cheek and chin were marred by a day's growth of grey stubble , and his large , shapely head had lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first I glanced at him . He had a letter there , the same , or another , but still in a woman's hand , and over this he was moping and mumbling in his senile fashion , with his brow puckered , and the corners of his mouth drawn down like those of a fretting child . So I left him , with a vague wonder as to who he might be , and why a single spring day should have wrought such a change upon him . So interested was I that next morning I was on the look out for him . Sure enough , at the same hour , I saw him coming up the hill ; but very slowly , with a bent back and a heavy head . It was shocking to me to see the change in him as he approached . "" I am afraid that our air does not agree with you , sir , "" I ventured to remark . But it was as though he had no heart for talk . He tried , as I thought , to make some fitting reply , but it slurred off into a mumble and silence . How bent and weak and old he seemed--ten years older at the least than when first I had seen him ! It went to my heart to see this fine old fellow wasting away before my eyes . There was the eternal letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers . Who was this woman whose words moved him so ? Some daughter , perhaps , or granddaughter , who should have been the light of his home instead of ---- I smiled to find how bitter I was growing , and how swiftly I was weaving a romance round an unshaven old man and his correspondence . Yet all day he lingered in my mind , and I had fitful glimpses of those two trembling , blue-veined , knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them . I had hardly hoped to see him again . Another day's decline must , I thought , hold him to his room , if not to his bed . Great , then , was my surprise when , as I approached my bench , I saw that he was already there . But as I came up to him I could scarce be sure that it was indeed the same man . There were the curly-brimmed hat , and the shining stock , and the horn glasses , but where were the stoop and the grey-stubbled , pitiable face ? He was clean - shaven and firm lipped , with a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great shoulders like an eagle on a rock . His back was as straight and square as a grenadier's , and he switched at the pebbles with his stick in his exuberant vitality . In the button - hole of his well-brushed black coat there glinted a golden blossom , and the corner of a dainty red silk handkerchief lapped over from his breast pocket . He might have been the eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning before . "" Good morning , Sir , good morning ! "" he cried with a merry waggle of his cane . "" Good morning ! "" I answered how beautiful the bay is looking . "" "" Yes , Sir , but you should have seen it just before the sun rose . "" "" What , have you been here since then ? "" "" I was here when there was scarce light to see the path . "" "" You are a very early riser . "" "" On occasion , sir ; on occasion ! "" He cocked his eye at me as if to gauge whether I were worthy of his confidence . "" The fact is , sir , that my wife is coming back to me to day . "" I suppose that my face showed that I did not quite see the force of the explanation . My eyes , too , may have given him assurance of sympathy , for he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low , confidential voice , as if the matter were of such weight that even the sea-gulls must be kept out of our councils . "" Are you a married man , Sir ? "" "" No , I am not . "" "" Ah , then you can not quite understand it . My wife and I have been married for nearly fifty years , and we have never been parted , never at all , until now . "" "" Was it for long ? "" I asked . "" Yes , sir . This is the fourth day . She had to go to Scotland . A matter of duty , you understand , and the doctors would not let me go ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical
83	"Haiti : Beyond the Capital Posted 17 January 2010 22 : 42 GMT Much of the coverage of the destruction in the earthquake's aftermath has been focused in and around Haiti's capital city , Port-au-Prince . But many other areas close to the ' quake's epicentre have also been affected , as bloggers are quick to point out ... Jacmel , located about twenty-five miles south of Port-au-Prince , is "" stranded and increasingly desperate "" , according to Repeating Islands' republication of an excerpt from "" the award-winning team of reporters from the Miami Herald : Residents of Jacmel , a quaint , historic Caribbean port city that suffered widespread damage and has been cut off from Port-au-Prince to the north , complain they have been forgotten . Four days after the quake struck Jacmel with equal force , they say they are still awaiting food , water , medical supplies and relief workers . Despite the blog's discontent "" about the nature of the coverage of the earthquake in Haiti on American television and other media "" , in another post it follows the Herald team as it reports on another area that is receiving little media attention , Carrefour : This town , which on Tuesday was the epicenter of the earthquake , is living in the epicenter of oblivion . Pwoje Espwa - Hope in Haiti , meanwhile , reports on the relief efforts taking place in Les Cayes : In contrast to the situation in PAP , the UN is guiding the relief efforts in les Cayes , and will be coordinating and providing a platform for the efforts of all the NGOs working in the area . There is no fuel left for purchase in Cayes and the UN has very little left . The UN folks are not sure when food and fuel will be delivered . All of us are nervous about this . There was a commercial flight on Tortugair this afternoon from Cap Haitian to Cayes , and they delivered a group of 8 orthopedic surgeons to work at the hospital . As the people arrive here from the destroyed capitol we will assist them in any way we can . Some need money to go on to family on the coast or inland ; some require medical attention ; all are hungry and thirsty ; almost all need clothing and shoes along with personal hygiene items . A simple thing like letting this young woman use my cell phone to call her mother and tell her she was all right and in Cayes was momentous for her and her mother . Konbit Pou Ayiti says that "" Haiti KONPAY has been playing a critical role coordinating a rapid response to the crisis in both Jacmel and Port-au-Prince ... pursuing two major strategies "" : 1 . Delivering immediate support to people on the ground in Jacmel and Port-au-Prince by coordinating the transport of supplies and volunteers . Carefully design volunteer interventions to avoid exacerbating the developing food and water shortages . 2 . Encouraging the evacuation of Port-au-Prince and establishing the resources necessary to assist victims when they arrive in the countryside by assessing existing resources in outlying areas and sending teams and equipment to clinics . The post goes on to quote a report "" from Amber Munger on the ground in Port-au-Prince "" : These are some details of the damage in Jacmel , which is a city of 34,000 : · 1,785 homes completely destroyed · 4410 homes partially destroyed · 87 commercial businesses destroyed · 54 schools destroyed · 24 hotels destroyed · 26 churches destroyed · 5730 families displaced · Death count approaching 3,000 , nearly 10 % of the population ( Reported by Gwenn Mangine , www . mangine . org ) Mangine also posts images from the ( severely damaged ) general hospital , with a further update on Sunday 16 : ... we noticed that the main pharmacy in town was open . And so we went in and bought them out of everything they had from the list – alcohol , hand sanitizer , peroxide , wound care items , meds ... ( another truckload . ) Yesterday we were expecting a big shipment of supplies , but we got one box . Still – we rushed over to the hospital with it . Mostly antibiotics and trauma care supplies – both were desperately needed . The doctors were thrilled . Pye's in Haiti discusses the "" crazy busy "" situation at the local airstrip : We had a plane full of supplies ready to come , however the San Juan airport would not let the plane leave with the medical supplies .... We are hoping that flights start today of supplies and medicine . And Darren Tyler of Conduit Mission , who has been trying to send emergency supplies to Jacmel by boat , shares an update from a member of his organisation on the ground : The port can be used , cruise ships can come in there . We need help bad here is the city . What kind of supplies are on the boat ? How fast can they get here ? We are starting to feel people get frustrated and scared .... Updates are being posted regularly on Twitter . @ melindayiti noted ( 15 January ) that "" Jacmel is a mess - we have planes and boats but US coordinators wo n ' t give us clearance to get in ! "" And a few hours later added : "" 2 boats on the way , still no clearance to land plane w / critical medical teams "" . Meanwhile , @ RescueJacmel , a new Twitter account , is attempting to ensure that international rescue efforts do not overlook the small city . Video bloggers are also chronicling their experiences , with clips from Les Cayes and Jacmel getting lots of attention on YouTube and other video sharing websites . The Cine Institute in Jacmel also posted eyewitness accounts of the earthquake . Lougou Corner is one of the blogs eager to supply information from their community : # We last communicated with Ginette last Thursday evening and she said that an exodus of people left Port-au-Prince already and came back to the provinces and rural areas . # We communicated via email with some ministries in Cayes and they reported that hospitals in Cayes are flooded with patients returning from Port and other areas affected in the provinces . We have seen firsthand in Lougou how an entire community has changed when residents have a say on the issues that affect their own lives . They have the best knowledge on what can and should be done to meet their pressing needs and bring lasting change in their community . And finally , from a U. S. - based Caribbean diaspora blogger , comes a stirring account of her friend's quest to find his mother , most likely in a neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince : ' As we came up on the block , I first walked right by the house because a good portion of it was totally demolished . The fitness center across the street was also completely demolished with a really strong smell coming from in between the bricks . When I asked people if they knew my mom , they shook their heads until I mentioned her by her nickname , Tita . And they were like , "" Oh , yeah , "" with joy in their eyes . "" She 's right there in the house next door . "" ' I opened the door . Her back was to me . I tapped her on the shoulder . The surprise , the tears , the hug so hard to explain . It was an unbelievable moment . She squeezed me so hard , crazy with joy . She paraded me down the street . "" Meet my fourth son . He came for me , "" she said . "" He came for me . "" ' We can only hope for similar stories coming out of other affected areas . For more on the earthquake in Haiti , visit our Special Coverage page ."	News	News

1680	The amount of rain , snow , or other precipitation falling on a given spot on Earth's surface during the year depends a lot on where that spot is . Is it in a desert ( which receives little rain ) ? Is it in a rainforest ( which receives vast amounts of rain ) ? Or is it located somewhere between these two extremes ? Often precipitation runs off along the surface back to the ocean , but it can be held for a time in lakes . Lakes in wetter regions are relatively permanent features , but those in drier regions may be less stable and thus more sensitive to changes in precipitation from season to season and water withdrawals from human activities . The list below discusses some of Earth's lakes that belong to the second category . This lake in west-central Bolivia occupies a shallow depression in the Altiplano , or high plateau , at 12,090 feet ( 3 , 686 meters ) above sea level . Historically the country's second largest lake , it covered 977 square miles ( 2 , 530 square km ) at low stage and was about 56 miles ( 90 km ) long and 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide though only 8 to 10 feet ( 2 . 4 to 3 meters ) deep . By December 2015 , however , the lake had completely dried up as a result of the combined effects of climate change-exacerbated drought and sediment buildup caused by the local mining industry . Since the 1990s , as the process of global warming brought increased temperatures to the region , the evaporation rate for the lake tripled . Lacking a sufficient interval of normal rainfall to replenish its waters , the lake became desiccated , resulting in catastrophic consequences for the region's flora and fauna as well as for the people who had made a living fishing in the lake . Settlement on Lake Poopó's shores – previously made marshy by filtration of water into the lake bed – had long been sparse , but the disappearance of the lake forced many people to relocate . Also called Kati Thanda – Lake Eyre , this great salt lake in central South Australia has a total area of 4,281 square miles ( 11 , 088 square km ) . It lies in the southwestern corner of the Great Artesian Basin , a closed inland basin about 440,150 square miles ( 1 , 140 , 000 square km ) in area that is drained only by intermittent streams . Normally dry but susceptible to occasional flooding , the lake constitutes the lowest point on the Australian continent . In fact the lake's lowest point lies about 50 feet ( 15 meters ) below sea level and consists of two sections , Lake Eyre North and Lake Eyre South . The sections , which together span an area 89.5 miles ( 144 km ) long and 47.8 miles ( 77 km ) wide , are joined by the narrow Goyder Channel . Water reaching the lake evaporates very rapidly , and the surface of the lake bed has a thin crust of salt deposited by water that has evaporated . Lake Eyre's typical state is dry . It fills completely only an average of twice in a century , but partial , minor fillings happen much more often . After being completely filled ( as in 1950 , 1974 , and 1984 ) , the lake takes about two years to dry up again . Lake Eyre is in a region of very low and intermittent rainfall amounting to less than 5 inches ( 125 mm ) annually . The lake is fed by a vast internal continental drainage basin , but evaporation rates in the region are so high that most of the rivers in the basin dry up before reaching the lake . Thus , the waters of the Diamantina and other rivers can feed the lake only when they are in flood after heavy rains . Adapted from Philip Micklin , Western Michigan University Once the world's fourth largest body of inland water , this lake is an inland sea that is also called the Orol Sea , Aral Tengizi , or Orol Dengizi . The lake's remnants nestle in the climatically inhospitable heart of Central Asia , to the east of the Caspian Sea . The Aral Sea and its demise are of great interest and increasing concern to scientists because of the remarkable shrinkage of its area and volume that began in the second half of the 20th century – when the region was part of the Soviet Union – and continued into the 21st century . That change resulted primarily from the diversion ( for purposes of irrigation ) of the riverine waters of the Syr Darya ( ancient Jaxartes River ) in the north and the Amu Darya ( ancient Oxus River ) in the south , which discharged into the Aral Sea and were its main sources of inflowing water . The rapid shrinkage of the Aral Sea led to numerous environmental problems in the region . By the late 1980s the lake had lost more than half the volume of its pre-1960 water . Because of that , the salt and mineral content of the lake rose drastically , which made the water unfit for drinking and killed off the once-abundant fish populations – sturgeon , carp , barbel , roach , and others . The fishing industry along the Aral Sea was thus virtually destroyed . Until the 1960s the most significant factors affecting the water balance of the Aral Sea were the rates of river inflow and water loss through evaporation , which formerly took out each year about the same amount of water that the rivers brought in . In 1960 the surface of the Aral Sea lay 175 feet ( 53 meters ) above sea level and covered an area of some 26,300 square miles ( 68 , 000 square km ) . The Aral Sea's greatest extent from north to south was almost 270 miles ( 435 km ) , while from east to west it was just over 180 miles ( 290 km ) . Although the average depth was a relatively shallow 53 feet ( 16 meters ) or so , it descended to a maximum of 226 feet ( 69 meters ) off the western shore . Lake Chad is a freshwater lake in the Sahelian zone of west-central Africa at the conjunction of Chad , Cameroon , Nigeria , and Niger . It is located in an interior basin that was once occupied by a much larger ancient sea . Historically , the lake ranked among the largest lakes in Africa , though its surface area varies greatly by season as well as from year to year . When the surface of the lake is approximately 920 feet ( 280 meters ) above sea level , the area is about 6,875 square miles ( 17 , 800 square km ) . In the early 21st century , however , the area was typically about 580 square miles ( 1 , 500 square km ) . Lake Chad is a variable body of water , and its surface area typically reaches its maximum in late October or early November , before shrinking by more than half by late April or early May . The volume of the lake reflects local precipitation and the discharge of its catchment area , balanced against losses through evaporation , transpiration , and seepage . The lake is fed chiefly by the Chari ( Shari ) - Logone river system , which accounts for about four-fifths of the inflow . Most of the remaining inflow is contributed by the Ebeji ( El-Béid ) and Yedseram rivers . At times when the lake has a greater surface area , it can be divided into two pools partially separated by a low ridge extending roughly northeast-southwest across the center of the lake . The ridge was formed during a drought at the beginning of the 20th century , and at times it has completely divided the basins . Ehsan Mahdiyan Iran's Lake Urmia , or Daryācheh-ye Orūmīyeh , is located in the northwestern corner of the country . It is the largest lake in the Middle East , and it has historically covered an area that varied from 2,000 to 2,300 square miles ( 5 , 200 to 6,000 square km ) . The lake lies in the bottom of the large central depression of the Azerbaijan region in northwestern Iran , at an elevation of 4,183 feet ( 1 , 275 meters ) above sea level . The basin is surrounded by mountains in the west and north , by plateaus in the south , and by plateaus and volcanic cones in the east . At its fullest volume , in the 1970s , the lake was about 87 miles ( 140 km ) long and 25 to 35 miles ( 40 to 55 km ) wide , with a maximum depth of 53 feet ( 16 meters ) . Because Lake Urmia's waters have no outlet , they are highly saline . The lake is one-fourth as salty as the Dead Sea , with a salt content ranging from 8 to 11 percent in the spring to 26 to 28 percent in the late autumn . The main salts are chlorine , sodium , and sulfates . Since 1967 it has enjoyed the status of a wetland protected region , and efforts have been made by the Iranian government to increase its wildlife . However , Lake Urmia's surface area has declined by some 90 percent since the 1970s , to roughly 230 square miles ( 600 square km ) , from the damming of the rivers that flow into the lake . The Dead Sea has the lowest elevation and is the lowest body of water on the surface of Earth . For several decades in the mid-20th century , the standard value given for the surface level of the lake was some 1,300 feet ( 400 meters ) below sea level . Beginning in the 1960s , however , Israel and Jordan began diverting much of the Jordan River's flow and increased the use of the lake's water itself for commercial purposes . The result of those activities was a precipitous drop in the Dead Sea's water level . By the mid-2010s the lake level was more than 100 feet ( some 30 meters ) below the mid-20th-century figure – i.e. , about 1,410 feet ( 430 meters ) below sea level – but the lake continued to drop by about 3 feet ( 1 meter ) annually . Concern mounted quickly over the continued drop in the Dead Sea's water level , prompting studies and calls for greater conservation of the Jordan River's water resources . In addition to proposals for reducing the amount of river water diverted by Israel and Jordan , those two countries discussed proposals for canals that would bring additional water to the Dead Sea . One such project , which received approval from both sides in 2015 , would involve constructing a canal northward from the Red Sea . The plan , which would include desalinization and hydroelectric plants along the course of the canal , would deliver large quantities of brine ( a by-product of the desalinization process ) to the lake . However , the project met with skepticism and opposition from environmentalists and others who questioned the potentially harmful effects of mixing water from the two sources .

145	"I 'm just going to play a brief video clip . Video : 50,000 pounds . On the fifth of December 1985 , a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record . Mr. Forbes . The buyer was Kip Forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century . The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century . Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar . Benjamin Wallace : Now , that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world . And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock . In 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery . Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784 . He would n ' t reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building . The mystery persisted for about 20 years . It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy . Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious . And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this . There 's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man , and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes . But for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles . I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world . I became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ? So , I decided to embark on a quest . With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes , I decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine . ( Laughter ) This was the first one . A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U. S. is not the real thing . It may come from Wagyu cattle , but it 's not from the original , Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan . There are very few places in the U. S. where you can try real Kobe , and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant , CUT , in Los Angeles . I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars . And it arrived , and it was tiny . And I was outraged . It was like , 160 dollars for this ? And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich . It 's like foie gras -- it 's not even like steak . I almost could n ' t finish it . I was really happy when I was done . ( Laughter ) Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character . Which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price . White truffles . One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world . To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto . The waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , "" Would Signore like the truffles ? "" And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma . It 's not in their taste , really . It 's not in their texture . It 's in the smell . These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up . 10 seconds passed and it was gone . And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so I 'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me . There were several -- several of these items were disappointments . ( Laughter ) Yeah . The magazine would n ' t pay for me to go there . ( Laughter ) They did give me a tour , though . And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet . It has 360-degree views . It has four balconies . It was designed by the architect I. M. Pei . It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver . It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from . When I took the tour , it actually included some Opus One , I was glad to see . 30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel . This is soap that 's made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties . I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this . And it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today . ( Laughter ) But then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans I 'm wearing . These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these . I do n't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value , but I think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that 's a reasonable benchmark . That said , a lot of work goes into these . They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times . But no compliments . ( Laughter ) Thank you . Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany . And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light . He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas . And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness . I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils . It tasted fine . It tasted interesting . It was very green , it was very peppery . But in the blind taste test , it came in last . The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months . ( Laughter ) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you 'll start to notice . I do n't play golf , so I could n ' t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them . Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean , they 'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they 'll say , look , you know , you 're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs . You 're paying for the bling , that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum . The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ... Oh , yeah , you know this one ? This is a coffee made from a very unusual process . The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet . It 's a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations . And apparently it 's a very picky eater and it , you know , homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries . And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form . That 's right . Unrelatedly -- ( Laughter ) Japan is doing crazy things with toilets . ( Laughter ) There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it . There 's one with a fragrance dispenser . There 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor . It 's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in . This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600 . And to try this -- I could n ' t get a loaner , but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , Toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which I used . It 's fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts . The seat is preheated . There 's a water jet that cleans you . There 's an air jet that dries you . You get up , it flushes by itself . The lid closes , it self-cleans . Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it 's a bit of a cultural leap forward . I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet . And I want to get one of these . ( Laughter ) This was another one I could not get a loaner of . Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed . There 's a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it . ( Laughter ) To try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom . Lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things . But anyway , we had a great night's sleep . And you spend a third of your life in bed . I do n't think it 's that bad of a deal . ( Laughter ) This was a fun one . This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car . I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway . And , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods . And it was really amazing . It was such a smooth ride . Most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle . I switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , "" You know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . "" And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth . And if I was a billionaire , I would get one . ( Laughter ) This is a completely gratuitous video I 'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology . This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "" Mission : Impossible III "" premiere . When he tries to open the door , you could call it "" Mission : Impossible IV . "" There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc . The ' 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century . And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape . And 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of Bordeaux . And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following . But it 's 60 years old . There 's not much of it left . What there is of it left you do n't know if it 's real -- it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world . Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist . So , I 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these . I 'd put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty . And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai . Bipin Desai is a UC Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , "" I 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' 47 Cheval Blanc . "" And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc , and 30 vintages of Yquem . And it was an invitation you do not refuse . I went . It was three days , four meals . And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the ' 47 . And you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil . And then I tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways . There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic . There were some people who were a little less impressed . And I was n ' t that impressed . And I do n't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it does n ' t necessarily mean something that I was n ' t impressed , but I was not the only one there who had that reaction . And it was n ' t just to that wine . Any one of the wines served at this tasting , if I 'd been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable . But drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience . And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech . And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags . A lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive . But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag . Thank you . </content"	Opinion/Argumentation	Information/Explanation

1374	"Baby Alligators Young alligators are displayed year ' round and are released each fall and replaced by new hatchlings . The young are either carefully collected from a pod of hatchlings or hatched from collected eggs . A few of the babies are placed on display in the Nature Center . Some are also kept behind the scenes to be used for educational outreach events . The rest will be placed back with the mother alligator or if need be a different mother . Mother alligators will adopt and protect other babies . If it looks and sounds like a baby alligator she 'll accept it , no questions asked . The animals are kept in the nature center no longer than one year as they will become habituated to human contact if kept longer . At one year they are still young enough to revert back to their natural instincts that include a fear of humans . Alligator mating season takes place in the spring and nest building starts around the month of June . The mother alligator protects her nest from would-be predators such as raccoons and opossums . Any infestation of fire ants spells imminent disaster for the young . The eggs will be fine until hatching . Not only is the mother keeping an eye out for predators , she is also listening for chirping calls from the nest which is her signal the babies are ready to hatch . ( The babies will later use this chirping call as a distress call to the mother . ) The mother alligator will carefully dig through the nest helping the babies free themselves from the debris . With the use of an egg tooth , most of the babies are capable of hatching on their own . Others will receive help from Mom . Hatching takes place in a matter of hours , often under the cover of night . Nests are not always visible from park trails . They are usually well hidden away from human activity among the islands in Elm and 40-Acre Lakes . Alligators lay an average of 45 eggs . About 2 / 3 of those hatch , and approximately one alligator from each nest will grow to adulthood . Although the mother will keep a close eye on her young most will get eaten by bullfrogs , fish and wading birds , just to name a few . Imagine if all the eggs hatched successfully and grew to adults . We 'd be up to our knees in alligators ! But with nature's system , we have perfect balance . One could fairly say that alligators start their lives at the bottom of the chain and those lucky enough to survive to adulthood will take their rightful place at the top . Like all reptiles , baby alligators are hatched fully developed and ready to face the world . With a full set of teeth they are equipped to hunt for their own food which consists mainly of aquatic insects and minnows . As the alligator grows in size , so will its prey . However , alligators , no matter what size , are known to mostly hunt food that they can swallow whole though large animals may take deer , feral pigs or even smaller alligators ! All alligators start out fairly even in length at 7 to 9 inches long at hatching and grow about 1 foot per year for the first 5 years of their lives , reaching maturity at around 5 or 6 years of age . Alligators never stop growing . However , growth-rates slow dramatically in females which usually reach lengths of only about 6 or 7 feet . Males may grow to be as long as 10 or maybe even 12 feet . ( Despite popular rumors , the largest alligator ever recorded at the park was a little over 13 & 1 ⁄ 2 feet long and no large adult male alligators are relocated to the park from surrounding areas , this would upset the balance . ) Live animals are used by park staff as teaching tools . Whether in the Nature Center , at an outreach event or interpretive program , visitors have ample opportunities to touch these delicate creatures and learn about their importance in the health and survival of wetland areas in the Southeastern United States . It is important to note that it is illegal to posses any alligator of any size without proper permits . Although baby alligators enter this world cute and harmless , they quickly develop their natural predatory instincts and become dangerous "" pets "" . Always remember that wild animals do not make good pets . All wildlife within state parks is protected and may not be harmed , fed , or removed . Alligator viewing is best during the milder months of the year . Reptiles prefer days that are also comfortable for most humans . They avoid activity during the heat of the summer months and rainy days . They do not hibernate but instead are torpid during cold or hot spells . Mating activity can be seen or heard from April to late May . When hiking the trails in the wetland areas it is important to be familiar with the park's alligator etiquette rules which are found on park maps and posted throughout the park . Remember that nature rules the park and you are a guest in her home ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
1107	"William Howard Taft ( September 15 , 1857 – March 8 , 1930 ) was an American politician who served as the 27th President of the United States ( 1909 – 1913 ) and as the 10th Chief Justice of the United States ( 1921 – 1930 ) , the only person to have held both offices . Taft was elected president in 1908 , the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate . In 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft Chief Justice , a position in which he served until a month before his death . With Roosevelt's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 , and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November . In the White House , he focused on the Far East more than European affairs , and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments . Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs , then a major source of governmental income , but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests . His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party , with which Taft often sympathized , and the progressive wing , toward which Roosevelt moved more and more . Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men . Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912 . Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates , and Roosevelt bolted the party . The split left Taft with little chance of re-election , and in Wilson's victory won only Utah and Vermont . After leaving office , Taft returned to Yale as a professor , continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace . In 1921 , President Harding appointed Taft chief justice , an office he had long sought . Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues , but under him , there were advances in individual rights . In poor health , he resigned in February 1930 . After his death the next month , he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery , the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there . Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents . William Taft was not seen as brilliant as a child , but was a hard worker ; the demanding parents pushed their five boys [ a ] toward success , tolerating nothing less . He attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati . At Yale College , which he entered in 1874 , the heavyset , jovial Taft was popular . One classmate described him succeeding through hard work rather than being the smartest , with sterling integrity . [ 3 ] In 1878 , Taft graduated , second in his class out of 121 . [ 4 ] He attended Cincinnati Law School , [ 5 ] and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1880 . While in law school , he worked on The Cincinnati Commercial newspaper , [ 4 ] edited by Murat Halstead . Taft was assigned to cover the local courts , and also spent time reading law in his father's office ; both activities gave him practical knowledge of the law that was taught in no class . Shortly before graduating from law school , Taft went to the state capital of Columbus to take the bar examination and easily passed . [ 6 ] After admission to the Ohio bar , Taft devoted himself to his job at the Commercial full-time . Halstead was willing to take him on permanently at an increase in salary if he would give up the law , but Taft declined . In October 1880 , Taft was appointed assistant prosecutor for Hamilton County ( where Cincinnati is located ) , and took office the following January . Taft served for a year as assistant prosecutor , trying his share of routine cases . [ 7 ] He resigned in January 1882 after President Chester A. Arthur appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue for Ohio's First District , an area centered on Cincinnati . [ 8 ] Taft refused to dismiss competent employees who were politically out of favor , and resigned effective in March 1883 , writing to Arthur that he wished to begin private practice in Cincinnati . [ 9 ] In 1884 , Taft campaigned for the Republican candidate for president , Maine Senator James G. Blaine , who lost to New York Governor Grover Cleveland . [ 10 ] In 1887 , Taft , then aged 29 , was appointed to a vacancy on the Superior Court of Cincinnati by Governor Joseph B. Foraker . The appointment was good for just over a year , after which he would have to face the voters , and in April 1888 , he sought election for the first of three times in his lifetime , the other two being for the presidency . He was elected to a full five-year term . Some two dozen of Taft's opinions as a state judge survive , the most significant being Moores & Co. v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1 [ b ] ( 1889 ) if only because it was used against him when he ran for president in 1908 . The case involved bricklayers who refused to work for any firm that dealt with a company called Parker Brothers , with which they were in dispute . Taft ruled that the union's action amounted to a secondary boycott , which was illegal . [ 11 ] It is not clear when Taft met Helen Herron ( often called Nellie ) , but it was no later than 1880 , when she mentioned in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him . By 1884 , they were meeting regularly , and in 1885 , after an initial rejection , she agreed to marry him . The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19 , 1886 . William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage . Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had , and she could be very frank with her criticisms . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The couple had three children , of which the eldest , Robert , became a U.S. senator . [ 1 ] There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889 , and Governor Foraker suggested President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it . Taft was 32 and his professional goal was always a seat on the high court . He actively sought the appointment , writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case , while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it . Instead , in 1890 , Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States . When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890 , the office had been vacant two months , with the work piling up . He worked to eliminate the backlog , while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge . [ 14 ] New York Senator William M. Evarts , a former Secretary of State , had been a classmate of Alphonso Taft at Yale . [ c ] Evarts called to see his friend's son as soon as Taft took office , and William and Nellie Taft were launched into Washington society . Nellie Taft was ambitious for herself and her husband , and was annoyed when the people he socialized with most were mainly Supreme Court justices , rather than the arbiters of Washington society such as Theodore Roosevelt , John Hay , Henry Cabot Lodge and their wives . [ 15 ] Although Taft was successful as Solicitor General , winning 15 of the 18 cases he argued before the Supreme Court , [ 1 ] he was glad when in March 1891 , Congress created a new judgeship for each of the United States Courts of Appeal and Harrison appointed him to the Sixth Circuit , based in Cincinnati . In March 1892 , Taft resigned as Solicitor General to resume his judicial career . [ 16 ] Taft's federal judgeship was a lifetime appointment , and one from which promotion to the Supreme Court might come . Taft's older half-brother Charles , successful in business , supplemented Taft's government salary , allowing William and Nellie Taft and their family to live in comfort . Taft's duties involved hearing trials in the circuit , which included Ohio , Michigan , Kentucky , and Tennessee , and participating with Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan , the circuit justice , and judges of the Sixth Circuit in hearing appeals . Taft spent eight years of his life , from 1892 to 1900 , in personal and professional contentment . [ 17 ] According to historian Louis L. Gould , "" while Taft shared the fears about social unrest that dominated the middle classes during the 1890s , he was not as conservative as his critics believed . He supported the right of labor to organize and strike , and he ruled against employers in several negligence cases . "" [ 1 ] Among these was Voight v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway Co. [ d ] Taft's decision for a worker injured in a railway accident violated the contemporary doctrine of liberty of contract , and he was reversed by the Supreme Court . [ e ] On the other hand , Taft's opinion in United States v. Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. [ f ] was upheld unanimously by the high court . [ g ] Taft's opinion , in which he held that a pipe manufacturers' association had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act , [ 18 ] was described by Henry Pringle , his biographer , as having "" definitely and specifically revived "" that legislation . [ 19 ] In 1896 , Taft became dean and Professor of Property at his alma mater , the Cincinnati Law School , a post that required him to prepare and give two hour-long lectures each week . [ 20 ] He was devoted to his law school , and was deeply committed to legal education , introducing the case system to the curriculum . [ 21 ] As a federal judge , Taft could not involve himself with politics , but followed it closely , remaining a Republican supporter . He watched with some disbelief as the campaign of Ohio Governor William McKinley developed in 1894 and 1895 , writing "" I can not find anybody in Washington who wants him "" . [ 21 ] By March 1896 , Taft realized that McKinley would likely be nominated , and was lukewarm in his support . He landed solidly in McKinley's camp after former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan in July stampeded the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech . Bryan , both in that address and in his campaign , strongly advocated free silver , a policy that Taft saw as economic radicalism . Taft feared that people would hoard gold in anticipation of a Bryan victory , but he could do nothing but worry . McKinley was elected ; when a place on the Supreme Court opened in 1898 , the only one under McKinley , the president named Joseph McKenna . [ 22 ] In January 1900 , Taft was called to Washington to meet with McKinley . Taft hoped a Supreme Court appointment was in the works , but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on the commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines . The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench ; the president assured him that if he fulfilled this task , McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court . Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission , with responsibility for success or failure ; McKinley agreed , and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900 . [ 23 ] Many Filipinos had responded to the American takeover with a fierce resistance , seeking independence for the islands , but U.S. forces , led by military governor General Arthur MacArthur , Jr. [ h ] had the upper hand by 1900 . MacArthur felt the commission was a nuisance , and their mission a quixotic attempt to impose self-government on a people unready for it . The general was forced to co-operate with Taft , as McKinley had given the commission control over the islands' military budget . [ 24 ] The commission took executive power in the Philippines on September 1 , 1900 ; on July 4 , 1901 , Taft became civilian governor . MacArthur , until then the military governor , was relieved by General Adna Chaffee , who was designated only as commander of American forces . [ 25 ] Taft sought to make the Filipinos partners in a venture that would lead to their self-government ; he saw independence as something far off . Many Americans in the Philippines viewed the locals as racial inferiors , but Taft wrote soon before his arrival , "" we propose to banish this idea from their minds "" . [ 26 ] Taft did not impose segregation at official events , and treated the Filipinos as social equals . [ 27 ] Nellie Taft recalled that "" neither politics nor race should influence our hospitality in any way "" . [ 28 ] McKinley was assassinated in September 1901 , and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt . Taft and Roosevelt had first become friends around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt a member of the Civil Service Commission . Taft had , after McKinley's election , urged the appointment of Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy , and watched as Roosevelt became a war hero , Governor of New York , and Vice President of the United States . They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recuperate after two operations caused by an infection . [ 29 ] There , Taft testified before the Senate Committee on the Philippines . Taft wanted to have Filipino farmers to have a stake in the new government through land ownership , but much of the arable land was held by Catholic religious orders , priests who were mostly Spanish , and were often resented by the Filipinos . Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to negotiate with Pope Leo XIII , to purchase the lands and to arrange the withdrawal of the Spanish priests , with Americans replacing them and training locals as clergy . Taft did not succeed in resolving these issues on his visit to Rome , but an agreement on both points was made in 1903 . [ 30 ] In late 1902 , Taft had heard from Roosevelt that a seat on the Supreme Court would soon fall vacant on the resignation of Justice George Shiras , and Roosevelt desired that Taft fill it . Although this was Taft's professional goal , he refused as he felt his work as governor was not yet done . [ 31 ] One reason for Roosevelt's action was his desire to neutralize a potential rival for the presidency : Taft's success in the Philippines had not gone unnoticed in the American press . [ 32 ] The following year , Roosevelt asked Taft to become Secretary of War . As the War Department was responsible for the Philippines , Taft would remain responsible for the islands , and Root was willing to postpone his departure until 1904 , allowing Taft time to wrap up his work in Manila . After consulting with his family , Taft agreed , and sailed for the United States in December 1903 . [ 33 ] Roosevelt introduces Taft as his crown prince : Puck magazine cover , 1906 . When Taft took office as Secretary of War in January 1904 , he was not called upon to spend much time administering the army , which the president was content to do himself – Roosevelt wanted him as a troubleshooter in difficult situations , as a legal adviser , and to be able to give campaign speeches as he sought election in his own right . Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses , and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election , "" I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office . It is awful to be afraid of one's shadow . "" [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Between 1905 and 1907 , Taft came to terms with the likelihood he would be the next Republican nominee for president , though he did not plan to actively campaign for it . When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905 , Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it , a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906 . [ 36 ] Edith Roosevelt , the First Lady , disliked the growing closeness between the two men , feeling they were too much alike , and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him . [ 37 ] Alternatively , Taft wanted to be chief justice , and kept a close eye on the health of the aging incumbent , Melville Fuller , who turned 75 in 1908 . Taft believed Fuller likely to live many years . Roosevelt had indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat , but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate . In any event , Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency . [ i ] [ 38 ] Through the 1903 Panamanian Revolution and the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty , the United States had secured rights to build a canal in the Isthmus of Panama . Legislation authorizing construction did not specify which government department would be responsible , and Roosevelt designated the Department of War . Taft journeyed to Panama in 1904 , viewing the canal site and meeting with Panamanian officials . The Isthmian Canal Commission had trouble keeping a chief engineer , and when in February 1907 John D. Stevens submitted his resignation , Taft recommended an army engineer , George W. Goethals . Under Goethals , the project moved ahead smoothly . [ 39 ] Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba , but as freedom for Cuba had been a major purpose of the war , it was not annexed by the U.S. , but was , after a period of occupation , given independence in 1902 . Election fraud and corruption followed , as did factional conflict . In September 1906 , President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention . Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force , and on September 29 , 1906 , under the terms of the Cuban – American Treaty of Relations of 1903 , declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba , a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon . In his time in Cuba , Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability , not occupation . [ 40 ] Taft remained involved in Philippine affairs . During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904 , he urged that Philippine agricultural products be admitted to the U.S. without duty . This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt , who remonstrated with his Secretary of War . Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position , and threatened to resign ; [ 41 ] Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter . [ 42 ] Taft returned to the islands in 1905 , leading a delegation of congressmen , and again in 1907 , to open the first Philippine Assembly . [ 43 ] On both of his Philippine trips as Secretary of War , Taft went to Japan , and met with officials there . [ 44 ] The meeting in July 1905 came a month before the conference which would end the Russo-Japanese War with the Treaty of Portsmouth . Taft met with Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Tarō . After that meeting , the two signed a memorandum , with Japan indicating it had no desire to invade the Philippines , and the U.S. that it did not object to Japanese control of Korea . [ 45 ] There were U.S. concerns about the number of Japanese laborers coming to the West Coast , and during Taft's second visit , in September 1907 , Tadasu Hayashi , the foreign minister , informally agreed to issue fewer passports to them . [ 46 ] Roosevelt had served almost three and a half years of McKinley's term . On the night of his own election in 1904 , Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908 , a pledge he quickly regretted . But he felt bound by his word . Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor , although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run . [ 47 ] Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent . [ 47 ] On pain of loss of their jobs , political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent . [ 48 ] One of a series of candid photographs known as the Evolution of a Smile , taken just after a formal portrait session , as Taft learns by telephone from Roosevelt of his nomination for president . A number of Republican politicians , such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou tested the waters for a run , but chose to stay out . New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran , but when he made a major policy speech , Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against corporate corruption . The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages . [ 49 ] Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term . [ 50 ] Assistant Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock resigned from his office in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort . [ 51 ] In April , Taft made a speaking tour , traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out another contested election . At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June , there was no serious opposition to him , and he gained a first-ballot victory . Yet , Taft did not have things his own way : he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver , but instead the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York , a conservative . Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote his full-time to the campaign . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Taft's opponent in the general election was Bryan , the Democratic nominee for the third time in four presidential elections . As many of Roosevelt's reforms stemmed from proposals by Bryan , the Democrat argued that he was the heir to Roosevelt's mantle and that Taft was not . Corporate contributions to federal political campaigns had been outlawed by the 1907 Tillman Act , and Bryan proposed that contributions by officers and directors of corporations be similarly banned , or at least disclosed when made . Taft was only willing to see the contributions disclosed after the election , and tried to ensure that officers and directors of corporations litigating with the government were not among his contributors . [ 54 ] 1908 Taft / Sherman poster Taft began the campaign on the wrong foot , fueling the arguments of those who said he was not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech , saying that he needed "" the President's judgment and criticism "" . [ 55 ] He for the most part supported Roosevelt's policies . The candidate argued that labor had a right to organize , but not to boycott . Moneyed interests , that is , capital , must also obey the law . Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government , but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector , with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission , subject to judicial review . Taft attributed blame for the recent recession , the Panic of 1907 , to stock speculation and other abuses , and felt some reform of the currency ( the U.S. was on the gold standard ) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times . Specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act . The constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax , thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down . Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial ; Taft proposed to continue his policies , but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation . [ 56 ] Taft upset some progressives by choosing Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) , placing him in charge of the presidential campaign . Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business . [ 57 ] Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs , Virginia , where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy . After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball , Roosevelt warned him against candid shots . [ 58 ] Electoral vote by state , 1908 . States won by Taft are in red . Roosevelt , frustrated by his own relative inaction , showered Taft with advice , fearing that the electorate would not appreciate Taft's qualities , and that Bryan would win . Roosevelt's supporters spread rumors that the president was in effect running Taft's campaign . This annoyed Nellie Taft , who never trusted the Roosevelts . [ 59 ] Nevertheless , Roosevelt supported the Republican nominee with such enthusiasm that humorists suggested "" TAFT "" stood for "" Take advice from Theodore "" . [ 60 ] Bryan urged a system of bank guarantees , so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed , but Taft opposed this , offering a postal savings system instead . [ 54 ] The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September , Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views . Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter , and Nation left indignant , to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance . Taft , at Roosevelt's advice , ignored the issue . [ 61 ] In the end , Taft won by a comfortable margin . Taft defeated Bryan by 321 electoral votes to 162 ; however , he garnered just 51.6 percent of the popular vote . [ 62 ] Nellie Taft said regarding the campaign , "" There was nothing to criticize , except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played . "" [ 63 ] Longtime White House usher Ike Hoover recalled that Taft came often to see Roosevelt during the campaign , but seldom between the election and Inauguration Day , March 4 , 1909 . [ 64 ] William Howard Taft was sworn in as president on March 4 , 1909 . Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice , Taft was inaugurated within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol as is customary . The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been "" one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor "" and to have had a part "" in the reforms he has initiated . I should be untrue to myself , to my promises , and to the declarations of the party platform on which I was elected if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration "" . [ 65 ] He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting , ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy . He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 Dingley Tariff , for antitrust reform , and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government . [ 66 ] Roosevelt left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over and , to keep out of Taft's way , arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa . [ 67 ] Taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that Roosevelt had , choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had . [ 70 ] His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion for the rule of law . [ 71 ] Taft made it a priority to restructure the State Department , noting , "" it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900 . "" [ 72 ] The Department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions , including desks for the Far East , Latin America and Western Europe . [ 73 ] The department's first in-service training program was established , and appointees spent a month in Washington before going to their posts . [ 74 ] Taft and Secretary of State Knox had a strong relationship , and the president listened to his counsel on matters foreign and domestic . According to Coletta , however , Knox was not a good diplomat , and had poor relations with the Senate , press , and many foreign leaders , especially those from Latin America . [ 75 ] There was broad agreement between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals . The U.S. would not interfere in European affairs . The U.S. would use force if necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas . The defense of the Panama Canal , which was under construction throughout Taft's term ( it opened in 1914 ) , guided U.S. policy in the Caribbean and in Central America . Previous administration had tried to defend American business interests overseas , but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to promote trade . Such ties , Taft hoped , would promote world peace . [ 75 ] Taft promoted arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France , but the Senate was not willing to yield to arbitrators its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties . [ 76 ] At the time of Taft's presidency , protectionism through the use of tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party . [ 77 ] The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition . The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act , and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions . Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15 , 1909 to deal with the tariff question . [ 78 ] Sereno E. Payne , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , had held hearings in late 1908 , and sponsored the resulting draft legislation . On balance , the bill reduced tariffs slightly , but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich , attached many amendments raising rates . This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette , who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform . Taft refused , angering them . [ 79 ] Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty , and according to Anderson , showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and really cared about . [ 80 ] When opponents sought to modify the tariff bill to allow for an income tax , Taft opposed it on the ground that the Supreme Court would likely strike it down as unconstitutional , as it had before . Instead , they proposed a constitutional amendment , which passed both houses in early July , was sent to the states , and by 1913 was ratified as the Sixteenth Amendment . In the conference committee , Taft won some victories , such as limiting the tax on lumber . The conference report passed both houses , and Taft signed it on August 6 , 1909 . The Payne-Aldrich tariff was immediately controversial . According to Coletta , "" Taft had lost the initiative , and the wounds inflicted in the acrid tariff debate never healed "" . [ 81 ] Newton McConnell cartoon showing Canadian suspicions that Taft and others were only interested in Canada when prosperous . In Taft's annual message sent to Congress in December 1910 , he urged a free trade accord for Canada . Britain at that time still handled Canada's foreign relations , and Taft found the British and Canadian governments willing . Many in Canada opposed an accord , fearing the U.S. would dump it when convenient as it had the 1854 Elgin-Marcy Treaty in 1866 , and American farm and fisheries interests were also opposed . After January 1911 talks with Canadian officials , Taft had the agreement , which was not a treaty , introduced into Congress and it passed in late July . The Canadian Parliament , led by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier , had deadlocked over the issue . Canadians turned Laurier out of office in the September 1911 election . No cross-border agreement was concluded , and the debate deepened divisions in the Republican Party . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Taft and Porfirio Díaz , Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , 1909 Taft and his Secretary of State , Philander Knox , instituted a policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America , believing U.S. investment would benefit all involved , while keeping European influence away from areas subject to the Monroe Doctrine . Although exports rose sharply during Taft's administration , the policy was unpopular among Latin American states that did not wish to become financial protectorates of the United States , as well as in the U.S. Senate , many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad . [ 84 ] No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's statesmanship and commitment to peace more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution . [ 85 ] When Taft entered office , Mexico was increasingly restless under the grip of longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz and many Mexicans backed his opponent , Francisco Madero . [ 86 ] There were a number of incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons ; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the army to the border areas for maneuvers . Taft told his military aide , Archibald Butt , that "" I am going to sit on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off "" . [ 87 ] He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico . [ 88 ] The day of the summit , Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only a few feet of the two presidents . [ 88 ] Before the election in Mexico , Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero , whose supporters took up arms resulting in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years . In the U.S. ' s Arizona Territory , two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured , some as a result of gunfire across the border . Taft would not be goaded into fighting and so instructed the territorial governor . [ 85 ] Nicaragua's president , José Santos Zelaya , wanted to revoke commercial concessions granted to American companies , [ j ] and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada . [ 89 ] Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers , and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route fall into the hands of Europeans . Zelaya's elected successor , José Madriz , could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered , and in August 1910 , the Estrada forces took Managua , the capital . The U.S. had Nicaragua accept a loan , and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues . The country remained unstable , and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912 , Taft sent troops ; though most were soon withdrawn , some remained as late as 1933 . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Treaties among Panama , Colombia , and the United States to resolve disputes arising from the Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame-duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909 , and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama . Colombia , however , declined to ratify the treaties , and after the 1912 elections , Knox offered $ 10 million to the Colombians ( later raised to $ 25 million ) . The Colombians felt the amount inadequate , and requested arbitration ; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration . [ 92 ] Due to his years in the Philippines , Taft was keenly interested as president in Far Eastern affairs . [ 93 ] Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant , but because of the potential for trade and investment , Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service . Knox did not agree , and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground . Taft replaced Roosevelt's minister there , William W. Rockhill , as uninterested in the China trade , with William J. Calhoun , whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions . Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy , and there were often conflicts . [ 94 ] Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria . [ 95 ] In 1898 , an American company had gained a concession for a railroad between Hankow and Szechuan , but the Chinese revoked the agreement in 1904 after the company ( which was indemnified for the revocation ) breached the agreement by selling a majority stake outside the United States . The Chinese imperial government got the money for the indemnity from the British Hong Kong government , on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line , and in 1909 , a British-led consortium began negotiations . [ 96 ] This came to Knox's attention in May of that year , and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate . Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent , Zaifeng , Prince Chun , and was successful in gaining U.S. participation , though agreements were not signed until May 1911 . [ 97 ] However , the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces . Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders , and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911 . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] After the revolution broke out , the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of what became the Republic of China , overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty , Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government , although American public opinion was in favor of it . The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic , but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers . Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established , but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through . [ 100 ] Taft continued the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt . A revised treaty of friendship and navigation entered into by the U.S. and Japan in 1911 granted broad reciprocal rights to Japanese in America and Americans in Japan , but were premised on the continuation of the Gentlemen's Agreement . There was objection on the West Coast when the treaty was submitted to the Senate , but Taft informed politicians that there was no change in immigration policy . [ 101 ] Taft was opposed to the traditional practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts , preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who , as Taft put it , would recognize an American when they saw one . High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France , Henry White , whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe . White 's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics . Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London , Whitelaw Reid , but Reid , owner of the New-York Tribune , had backed Taft during the campaign , and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports . Reid remained in place until his 1912 death . [ 102 ] Taft was a supporter of settling international disputes by arbitration , and he negotiated treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated . These were signed in August 1911 . Neither Taft nor Knox ( a former senator ) consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process . By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat . He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October , but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept , killing the agreements . [ 103 ] Although no general arbitration treaty was entered into , Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means , often involving arbitration . These included a settlement of the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick , a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan , and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland . The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940 . [ 104 ] Taft continued and expanded Roosevelt's efforts to break up business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act , bringing 70 cases in four years ( Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years ) . Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company , initiated under Roosevelt , were decided in favor of the government by the Supreme Court in 1911 . [ 105 ] In June 1911 , the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel ( U.S. Steel ) . That company had been expanded under Roosevelt , who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal , Iron , and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907 , a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings . Taft , as Secretary of War , had praised the acquisitions . [ 106 ] Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company , but it was in fact a bargain . For Roosevelt , questioning the matter went to his personal honesty . [ 107 ] In October 1911 , Taft's Justice Department brought suit against U.S. Steel , demanding that over a hundred of its subsidiaries be granted corporate independence , and naming as defendants many prominent business executives and financiers . The pleadings in the case had not been reviewed by Taft , and alleged that Roosevelt "" had fostered monopoly , and had been duped by clever industrialists "" . [ 106 ] Roosevelt was offended by the references to him and his administration in the pleadings , and felt that Taft could not evade command responsibility by saying he did not know of them . [ 108 ] Taft sent a special message to Congress on the need for a revamped antitrust statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911 , but it took no action . Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company , the large manufacturer of farm equipment , in early 1912 . As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester , but had taken no action ( a decision Taft had supported ) , the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination . Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly ; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years , and until he was under challenge , to reverse a decision he had supported . [ 109 ] Roosevelt was an ardent conservationist , assisted in this by like-minded appointees , including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield [ k ] and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot . Taft agreed with the need for conservation , but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order . He did not retain Garfield , an Ohioan , as secretary , choosing instead a westerner , former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger . Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement , believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield , and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies . [ 110 ] Roosevelt had withdrawn much land from the public domain , including some in Alaska thought rich in coal . In 1902 , Clarence Cunningham , an Idaho entrepreneur , had found coal deposits in Alaska , and made mining claims , and the government investigated their legality . This dragged on for the remainder of the Roosevelt administration , including during the year ( 1907 – 1908 ) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office . [ 111 ] A special agent for the Land Office , Louis Glavis , investigated the Cunningham claims , and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them , Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot . [ 112 ] In September 1909 , Glavis made his allegations public in a magazine article , disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service . This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for . [ 113 ] On September 13 , 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service , relying on a report from Attorney General George W. Wickersham dated two days previously . [ 114 ] Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal , which Taft tried to avoid , fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt ( still overseas ) . Taft asked Elihu Root ( by then a senator ) to look into the matter , and Root urged the firing of Pinchot . [ 113 ] Taft had ordered government officials not to comment on the fracas . [ 115 ] In January 1910 , Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service , Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands . According to Pringle , this "" was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office "" . [ 116 ] Pinchot was dismissed , much to his delight , and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt . [ 117 ] A congressional investigation followed , which cleared Ballinger by majority vote , but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney , Louis D. Brandeis , proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated , which Taft belatedly admitted . The Ballinger-Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda . [ 118 ] Taft announced in his inaugural address that he would not appoint African Americans to federal jobs , such as postmaster , where this would cause racial friction . This differed from Roosevelt , who would not remove or replace black officeholders with whom local whites would not deal . Termed Taft's "" Southern Policy "" , this stance effectively invited white protests against black appointees . Taft followed through , removing most black office holders in the South , and made few appointments from that race in the North . [ 119 ] At the time Taft was inaugurated , the way forward for African Americans was debated by their leaders . Booker T. Washington felt that most blacks should be trained for industrial work , with only a few seeking higher education ; W.E.B. DuBois took a more militant stand for equality . Taft tended towards Washington's approach . According to Coletta , Taft let the African-American "" be ' kept in his place ' ... He thus failed to see or follow the humanitarian mission historically associated with the Republican party , with the result that Negroes both North and South began to drift toward the Democratic party . "" [ 120 ] A supporter of free immigration , Taft vetoed a bill passed by Congress and supported by labor unions that would have restricted unskilled laborers by imposing a literacy test . [ 121 ] Taft made six appointments to the Supreme Court , the most of any president except George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt . [ 122 ] The death of Justice Rufus Peckham in October 1909 gave Taft his first opportunity . He chose an old friend and colleague from the Sixth Circuit , Horace H. Lurton of Georgia ; he had in vain urged Theodore Roosevelt to appoint Lurton to the high court . Attorney General Wickersham objected that Lurton , a former Confederate soldier and a Democrat , was aged 65 . Taft named Lurton anyway on December 13 , 1909 , and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote a week later . Lurton is still the oldest man to be made an associate justice . [ l ] Lurie suggested that Taft , already beset by the tariff and conservation controversies , desired to perform an official act which gave him pleasure , especially since he thought Lurton deserved it . [ 123 ] Justice David Josiah Brewer ' s death on March 28 , 1910 gave Taft a second opportunity to fill a seat on the high court ; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term , Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat . The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes , but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4 , 1910 . Taft took five months to replace Fuller , and when he did , it was with Justice Edward Douglass White , who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice . [ m ] According to Lurie , Taft , who still had hopes of being chief justice , may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he ( White ) than a younger one ( Hughes ) , who might outlive him , as indeed Hughes did . To fill White's seat as associate justice , Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming , a federal appeals judge . By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910 , he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody ' s retirement because of illness ; he named a Louisiana Democrat , Joseph R. Lamar , whom he had met while playing golf , and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge . [ 124 ] With the death of Justice Harlan in October 1911 , Taft got to fill a sixth seat on the Supreme Court . After Secretary Knox declined appointment , Taft named Chancellor of New Jersey Mahlon Pitney , the last person appointed to the Supreme Court who did not attend law school . [ 125 ] Pitney had a stronger anti-labor record than Taft's other appointments , and was the only one to meet opposition , winning confirmation by a Senate vote of 50 – 26 . [ 126 ] Taft appointed 13 judges to the federal courts of appeal and 38 to the United States district courts . Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts , including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals . [ 127 ] The Commerce Court , created in 1910 , stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission . There was considerable opposition to its establishment , which only grew when one of its judges , Robert W. Archbald , was in 1912 impeached for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January . Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court , but the respite was short-lived as Wilson signed similar legislation in October 1913 . [ 128 ] 1909 Puck magazine cover : Roosevelt departs , entrusting his policies to Taft During Roosevelt's fifteen months beyond the Atlantic , from March 1909 to June 1910 , neither man wrote much to the other . Taft biographer Lurie suggested that each expected the other to make the first move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing . Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return , Taft invited him to stay at the White House . The former president declined , and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance . Nevertheless , he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912 , and did not speak of himself as a candidate . [ 129 ] Taft and Roosevelt met twice in 1910 ; the meetings , though outwardly cordial , did not display their former closeness . [ 130 ] Roosevelt gave a series of speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910 . Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York , [ n ] he accused the federal courts of undermining democracy , and called for them to be deprived of the power to rule legislation unconstitutional . This attack horrified Taft , who privately agreed that Lochner had been wrongly decided . Roosevelt called for "" elimination of corporate expenditures for political purposes , physical valuation of railroad properties , regulation of industrial combinations , establishment of an export tariff commission , a graduated income tax "" as well as "" workmen's compensation laws , state and national legislation to regulate the [ labor ] of women and children , and complete publicity of campaign expenditure "" . [ 131 ] According to John Murphy in his journal article on the breach between the two presidents , "" As Roosevelt began to move to the left , Taft veered to the right . "" [ 131 ] During the 1910 midterm election campaign , Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics , while Taft with donations and influence tried to secure the election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio , former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding . The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate . In New Jersey , Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor , and Harding lost his race in Ohio . [ 130 ] After the election , Roosevelt continued to promote progressive ideals , a New Nationalism , much to Taft's dismay . Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration , arguing that its guiding principles were not that of the party of Lincoln , but those of the Gilded Age . [ 132 ] The feud continued on and off through 1911 , a year in which there were few elections of significance . Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican , and was backed by a convention of progressives . Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911 , writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms . [ 133 ] Roosevelt was receiving many letters from supporters urging him to run , and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf . Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House , he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition . [ 134 ] In February , Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him . Taft felt that if he lost in November , it would be a repudiation of the party , but if he lost renomination , it would be a rejection of himself . [ 135 ] He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt , who helped make him president , but having become president , he was determined to be president , and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term . [ 136 ] As Roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism , Taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re-nomination , as he was convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government . [ 137 ] One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt , one of the last links between the previous and present presidents , as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt . Ambivalent between his loyalties , Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912 . He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking , a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered . [ 138 ] Taft and Roosevelt – political enemies in 1912 Roosevelt dominated the primaries , winning 278 of the 362 delegates to the Republican National Convention in Chicago decided in that manner . Taft had control of the party machinery , and it came as no surprise that he gained the bulk of the delegates decided at district or state conventions . [ 139 ] Taft did not have a majority , but was likely to have one once southern delegations committed to him . Roosevelt challenged the election of these delegates , but the RNC overruled most objections . Roosevelt's sole remaining chance was with a friendly convention chairman , who might make rulings on the seating of delegates that favored his side . Taft followed custom and remained in Washington , but Roosevelt went to Chicago to run his campaign [ 140 ] and told his supporters in a speech , "" we stand at Armageddon , and we battle for the Lord "" . [ 141 ] Taft had won over Root , who agreed to run for temporary chairman of the convention , and the delegates elected Root over Roosevelt's candidate . [ 141 ] The Roosevelt forces moved to substitute the delegates they supported for the ones they argued should not be seated . Root made a crucial ruling , that although the contested delegates could not vote on their own seating , they could vote on the other contested delegates , a ruling that assured Taft's nomination , as the motion offered by the Roosevelt forces failed , 567 – 507 . [ 142 ] As it became clear Roosevelt would bolt the party if not nominated , some Republicans sought a compromise candidate to avert the electoral disaster to come ; they were unsuccessful . [ 143 ] Taft's name was placed in nomination by Warren Harding , whose attempts to praise Taft and unify the party were met with angry interruptions from progressives . [ 144 ] Taft was nominated on the first ballot , though most Roosevelt delegates refused to vote . [ 142 ] Campaign advertisement arguing Taft should be allowed a second term Alleging Taft had stolen the nomination , Roosevelt and his followers formed the Progressive Party . [ o ] [ 145 ] Taft knew he would almost certainly be defeated , but concluded that through Roosevelt's loss at Chicago the party had been preserved as "" the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions . "" [ 146 ] He made his doomed run to preserve the Republican Party . [ 147 ] Governor Woodrow Wilson was the Democratic nominee . Seeing Roosevelt as the greater electoral threat , Wilson spent little time attacking Taft , arguing that Roosevelt had been lukewarm in opposing the trusts during his presidency , and that Wilson was the true reformer . [ 148 ] Opposing Roosevelt , Taft contrasted what he called his "" progressive conservatism "" with Roosevelt's Progressive democracy , which to Taft represented "" the establishment of a benevolent despotism . "" http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/06/the-transformation-of-american-democracy-teddy-roosevelt-the-1912-election-and-the-progressive-party Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking re-election did not campaign , Taft spoke publicly only once , making his nomination acceptance speech on August 1 . He had difficulty in financing the campaign , as many industrialists had concluded he could not win , and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt . The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight , but had no illusions he would win his race . [ 149 ] He had hoped to send his cabinet officers out on the campaign trail , but found them reluctant to go . Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him . [ 150 ] Electoral vote by state , 1912 . States won by Taft are in red . Vice President Sherman had been renominated at Chicago ; seriously ill during the campaign , he died six days before the election , [ p ] and was replaced on the ticket by the president of Columbia University , Nicholas Murray Butler . But few electors chose Taft and Butler , who won only Utah and Vermont , for a total of eight electoral votes . [ q ] Roosevelt won 88 , and Wilson 435 . Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined . Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote , but finished with just under 3.5 million , over 600,000 less than the former president . [ 151 ] Taft was not on the ballot in California , due to the actions of local Progressives , nor in South Dakota . [ 152 ] With no pension or other compensation to expect from the government after leaving the White House , Taft contemplated a return to the practice of law , from which he had long been absent . Given that Taft had appointed many federal judges , including a majority of the Supreme Court , this would raise questions of conflict of interest at every federal court appearance and he was saved from this by an offer for him to become Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School . He accepted , and after a month's vacation in Georgia , arrived in New Haven on April 1 , 1913 to a rapturous reception . As it was too late in the semester for him to give an academic course , he instead prepared eight lectures on "" Questions of Modern Government "" , which he delivered in May . [ 153 ] He earned money with paid speeches and with articles for magazines , and would end his eight years out of office having increased his savings . [ 154 ] While at Yale , he wrote the treatise , Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers ( 1916 ) . [ 155 ] Taft had been made president of the Lincoln Memorial Commission while still in office ; when Democrats proposed removing him for one of their party , he quipped that unlike losing the presidency , such a removal would hurt . The architect , Henry Bacon , wanted to use Colorado-Yule marble , while southern Democrats urged using Georgia marble . Taft lobbied for the western stone , and the matter was submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts , which supported Taft and Bacon . The project went forward ; Taft would dedicate the Lincoln Memorial as chief justice in 1922 . [ 156 ] In 1913 , Taft was elected to a one-year term as president of the American Bar Association ( ABA ) , a trade group of lawyers . He removed opponents , such as Louis Brandeis and University of Pennsylvania Law School dean William Draper Lewis ( a supporter of the Progressive Party ) from committees . [ 157 ] Taft maintained a cordial relationship with Wilson . The former president privately criticized his successor on a number of issues , but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy . Taft was appalled when , after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916 , Wilson nominated Brandeis , whom the former president had never forgiven for his role in the Ballinger-Pinchot affair . When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis , Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents , stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court . Nevertheless , the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis . [ 158 ] Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered ; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency , at a funeral at Yale . They spoke only for a moment , politely but formally . [ 159 ] As president of the League to Enforce Peace , Taft hoped to prevent war through an international association of nations . With World War I raging in Europe , Taft sent Wilson a note of support for his foreign policy in 1915 . [ 160 ] President Wilson accepted Taft's invitation to address the league , and spoke in May 1916 of a postwar international organization that could prevent a repetition . [ 161 ] Taft supported the effort to get Justice Hughes to resign from the bench and accept the Republican presidential nomination . Once this was done , Hughes tried to get Roosevelt and Taft to reconcile , as a united effort was needed to defeat Wilson . This occurred on October 3 in New York , but Roosevelt allowed only a handshake , and no words were exchanged . This was one of many difficulties for the Republicans in the campaign , and Wilson narrowly won re-election . [ 162 ] When Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917 , Taft was an enthusiastic supporter . Taft was chairman of the American Red Cross ' executive committee , occupying much of the former president's time . [ 163 ] He took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the National War Labor Board , tasked with assuring industrial peace . [ 164 ] In February 1918 , the new RNC chairman , Will H. Hays , approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt . In May , Taft was in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel , and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there , walked in on them . The two men embraced to the applause of the room , but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919 . [ 165 ] Taft later wrote , "" Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me , I would have mourned the fact all my life . I loved him always and cherish his memory . "" [ 166 ] When Wilson proposed establishment of a League of Nations , with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles , Taft expressed public support . He was out of step with his party , whose senators were not inclined to confirm the treaty . Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides , destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration , and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party . The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact . [ 167 ] During the 1920 election campaign , Taft supported the Republican ticket , Harding ( by then a senator ) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge ; they were elected . [ 168 ] Taft was among those asked to come to the president-elect's home in Marion , Ohio to advise him on appointments , and the two men conferred there on December 24 , 1920 . By Taft's later account , after some conversation , Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court , for if Taft would , Harding would put him there . Taft had a condition for Harding : that having been president , and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis , he could only accept the chief justiceship . Harding made no response , and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House . In January 1921 , Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him , if given the chance . [ 169 ] White by then was in failing health , but made no move to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4 , 1921 . [ 170 ] Taft called on the chief justice on March 26 , and found White ill , but still carrying on his work and not talking of retiring . [ 171 ] White did not retire , dying in office on May 19 , 1921 . Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat , and waited and worried if he would be White's successor . Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick , Harding made no quick announcement . [ 172 ] Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes , especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle . [ 173 ] It later emerged that Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland a seat on the Supreme Court , and was waiting in the expectation that another place would become vacant . [ r ] [ 174 ] Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring . Taft felt , when he learned of this plan , that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well , and that once confirmed by the Senate , the memory of Day would grow dim . After Harding rejected Day's plan , Attorney General Harry Daugherty , who supported Taft's candidacy , urged him to fill the vacancy , and he named Taft on June 30 , 1921 . [ 172 ] The Senate confirmed Taft the same day , 61 – 4 , without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session . Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat . [ s ] [ 175 ] When he was sworn in on July 11 , he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice . [ 1 ] The Supreme Court , under Taft , posted a conservative record in Commerce Clause jurisprudence . This had the practical effect of making it difficult for the federal government to regulate industry , and the Taft Court also scuttled many state laws . The few liberals on the court – Brandeis , Holmes , and ( from 1925 ) Harlan Fiske Stone – sometimes protested , believing orderly progress essential , but often joined in the majority opinion . [ 176 ] The White Court had , in 1918 , struck down an attempt by Congress to regulate child labor in Hammer v. Dagenhart . [ t ] [ 177 ] Congress thereafter attempted to end child labor by imposing a tax on certain corporations making use of it . That law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1922 in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. , with Taft writing the court's opinion for an 8 – 1 majority . [ u ] He held that the tax was not intended to raise revenue , but rather was an attempt to regulate matters reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment , [ 178 ] and that allowing such taxation would eliminate the power of the states . [ 1 ] One case in which Taft and his court upheld federal regulation was Stafford v. Wallace . Taft ruled for a 7 – 1 majority [ v ] that the processing of animals in stockyards was so closely tied to interstate commerce as to bring it within the ambit of Congress's power to regulate . [ 179 ] A case in which the Taft Court struck down regulation that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital . [ w ] Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia . A 5 – 3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down . Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment , guaranteeing women the vote , meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions ; Taft , in dissent , deemed this unrealistic . [ 180 ] Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents , and because it was one of the few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government . [ 181 ] Taft in 1922 ruled for a unanimous court in Balzac v. Porto Rico . [ x ] One of the Insular Cases , Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a jury trial , a Sixth Amendment protection under the constitution . Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood , only such constitutional protections as Congress decreed would apply to its residents . [ 182 ] The U.S. Supreme Court in 1925 . Taft is seated in the bottom row , middle . In 1926 , Taft wrote for a 6 – 3 majority in Myers v. United States [ y ] that Congress could not require the president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee . Taft noted that there is no restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution . Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster , [ 183 ] Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act , for violation of which his presidential predecessor , Andrew Johnson , had been impeached , though acquitted by the Senate . [ 184 ] Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion . [ 185 ] The following year , the court decided McGrain v. Daugherty . [ z ] A congressional committee investigating possible complicity of former Attorney General Daugherty in the Teapot Dome scandal subpoenaed records from his brother , Mally , who refused to provide them , alleging Congress had no power to obtain documents from him . Van Devanter ruled for a unanimous court against him , finding that Congress had the authority to conduct investigations as an auxiliary to its legislative function . [ 186 ] In 1925 , the Taft Court laid the groundwork for the incorporation of many of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment . In Gitlow v. New York , [ aa ] the court by a 6 – 2 vote with Taft in the majority , upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government ; his defense was freedom of speech . Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion , and both majority and minority ( Holmes , joined by Brandeis ) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states . [ 187 ] Pierce v. Society of Sisters [ ab ] was a 1925 decision by the Taft Court striking down an Oregon law banning private schools . In a decision written by Justice James C. McReynolds , a unanimous court held that Oregon could regulate private schools , but could not eliminate them . The outcome supported the right of parents to control the education of their children , but also , since the lead plaintiff ( the society ) ran Catholic schools , struck a blow for religious freedom . [ 187 ] United States v. Lanza [ ac ] was one of a series of cases involving Prohibition . Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law , and was first convicted in Washington state court , then prosecuted in federal district court . He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment . Taft , for a unanimous court , allowed the second prosecution , holding that the state and federal governments were dual sovereigns , each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question . [ 188 ] Taft exercised the power of his position to influence the decisions of his colleagues , urging unanimity and discouraging dissents . Alpheus Mason , in his article on Chief Justice Taft for the American Bar Association Journal , contrasted Taft's expansive view of the role of the chief justice with the narrow view of presidential power he took while in that office . [ 189 ] Taft saw nothing wrong with making his views on possible appointments to the court known to the White House , and was annoyed to be criticized in the press . He was initially a firm supporter of President Coolidge after Harding's death in 1923 , but became disillusioned with Coolidge's appointments to office and to the bench ; he had similar misgivings about Coolidge's successor , Herbert Hoover . [ 190 ] Taft advised the Republican presidents in office while he was chief justice to avoid "" offside "" appointments like Brandeis and Holmes . [ 176 ] Nevertheless , by 1923 , Taft was writing of his liking for Brandeis , whom he deemed a hard worker , and Holmes walked to work with him until age and infirmity required an automobile . [ 191 ] Believing that the chief justice should be responsible for the federal courts , Taft felt that he should have an administrative staff to assist him , and the chief justice should be empowered to temporarily reassign judges . [ 192 ] He also believed the federal courts had been ill-run . Many of the lower courts had lengthy backlogs , as did the Supreme Court . [ 193 ] Immediately on taking office , Taft made it a priority to confer with Attorney General Daugherty as to new legislation , [ 194 ] and made his case before congressional hearings , in legal periodicals and in speeches across the country . [ 195 ] When Congress convened in December 1921 , a bill was introduced for 24 new judges , to empower the chief justice to move judges temporarily to eliminate the delays , and to have him chair a body consisting of the senior appellate judge of each circuit . Congress objected to some aspects , requiring Taft to get the agreement of the senior judge of each involved circuit before assigning a judge , but it in September 1922 passed the bill , and the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges held its first meeting that December . [ 196 ] The Supreme Court's docket was congested , swelled by war litigation and laws that allowed a party defeated in the circuit court of appeals to have the case decided by the Supreme Court if a constitutional question was involved . Taft believed an appeal should be usually be settled by the circuit court , with only cases of major import decided by the justices . He and other Supreme Court members proposed legislation to make most of the court's docket discretionary , with a case getting full consideration by the justices only if they granted a writ of certiorari . To Taft's frustration , Congress took three years to consider the matter . Taft and other members of the court lobbied for the bill in Congress , and the Judges' Bill became law in February 1925 . By late the following year , Taft was able to show that the backlog was shrinking . [ 197 ] When Taft became chief justice , the court did not have its own building and met in the Capitol . Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded , but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building . In 1925 , Taft began a fight to get the court a building , and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land , on the south side of the Capitol . Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building , and was hired by the government as architect . Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building , but it did not do so until 1935 , after Taft's death . [ 198 ] Taft is remembered as the heaviest president ; he was 5 feet 11 inches ( 1 . 80 m ) tall and his weight peaked at 335 – 340 pounds ( 152 – 154 kg ) toward the end of his presidency , [ 199 ] though this later decreased , and he weighed by 1929 just 244 pounds ( 111 kg ) . By the time Taft became chief justice , his health was starting to decline , and he carefully planned a fitness regimen , walking 3 miles ( 4 . 8 km ) from his home to the Capitol each day . When he walked after work as well , he would usually go by way of Connecticut Avenue ; the crossing over Rock Creek he would often take was after his death named the Taft Bridge . [ 200 ] At Hoover's inauguration on March 4 , 1929 , Taft recited part of the oath incorrectly , later writing , "" my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain "" , misquoting again in that letter , differently . [ 201 ] His health gradually declined over the near-decade of his chief justiceship , and he wrote in 1929 , "" I am older and slower and less acute and more confused . However , as long as things continue as they are , and I am able to answer to my place , I must stay on the court in order to prevent the Bolsheviki from getting control "" . [ 202 ] Taft insisted on going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles , who died on December 31 , 1929 ; the strain did not improve his own health . When the court reconvened on January 6 , 1930 , Taft had not returned to Washington , and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but had been unable to complete because of his illness . Taft went to Asheville , North Carolina for a rest , but by the end of January , he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations . [ 203 ] Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice ; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice . [ ad ] [ 204 ] Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3 , Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices . He died at his home in Washington on March 8 , 1930 . [ 203 ] Lurie argued that Taft did not receive the public credit for his policies that he should have . Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt ( although the lawsuits received much publicity ) . Taft , more quietly than his predecessor , filed many more cases than did Roosevelt , and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such a thing as a "" good "" trust . This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency ; according to Lurie , Taft "" was boring – honest , likable , but boring "" . [ 207 ] Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being "" one of the most interesting , intellectual , and versatile presidents ... a chief justice of the United States , a wrestler at Yale , a reformer , a peace activist , and a baseball fan ... today , Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub , "" a story that is not true . [ 147 ] Mason called Taft's years in the White House "" undistinguished "" . [ 192 ] Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress , but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill . [ 208 ] Anderson noted that Taft's prepresidential federal service was entirely in appointed posts , and that he had never run for an important executive or legislative position , which would have allowed him to develop the skills to manipulate public opinion , "" the presidency is no place for on-the-job training "" . [ 155 ] According to Coletta , "" in troubled times in which the people demanded progressive change , he saw the existing order as good . "" [ 209 ] Inevitably linked with Roosevelt , Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider , who chose him to be president , and who took it away . [ 210 ] Yet , a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete : as Coletta put it , "" Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him ? "" [ 211 ] Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not , Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation . Taft was generally slow to act , and when he did , his actions often generated enemies , as in the Ballinger-Pinchot affair . Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers ; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters , and , with no comment from the White House , hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent . [ 212 ] And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan - like figure , with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good . Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography ( which placed this view in enduring form ) was published after both men had left the presidency ( in 1913 ) , was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party , and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor . While Roosevelt was biased , [ 213 ] he was not alone : every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him . [ 214 ] Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency . [ 213 ] Four-cent stamp issued for Taft ( 1930 ) Taft was convinced he would be vindicated by history . After he left office , he was estimated to be about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness , and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict . Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company , with James Madison , John Quincy Adams and McKinley . [ 215 ] Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft , and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker . [ 216 ] According to Gould , "" the clichés about Taft's weight , his maladroitness in the White House , and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth , but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene , a man of consummate ambition , and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party . "" [ 217 ] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice "" an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics , played out over years , the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history "" . [ 173 ] Taft has been rated among the greatest of the chief justices ; [ 218 ] later Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted that this was "" not so much on the basis of his opinions , perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history "" . [ 219 ] A successor as chief justice , Earl Warren , concurred : "" In Taft's case , the symbol , the tag , the label usually attached to him is ' conservative . ' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics , but its use is too often confused with ' reactionary . ' "" [ 166 ] Most commentators agree that as chief justice , Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court , urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities . [ 166 ] [ 177 ] [ 220 ] Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court . [ 177 ] According to Anderson , Taft as chief justice "" was as aggressive in the pursuit of his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential "" . [ 221 ] The house in Cincinnati where Taft was born and lived as a boy is now the William Howard Taft National Historic Site . [ 222 ] Taft's son Robert was a significant political figure , becoming Senate Majority Leader and three times a major contender for the Republican nomination for president . A conservative , each time he was defeated by a candidate backed by the more liberal Eastern Establishment wing of the party . [ ae ] [ 223 ] Lurie concluded his account of William Taft's career , While the fabled cherry trees in Washington represent a suitable monument for Nellie Taft , there is no memorial to her husband , except perhaps the magnificent home for his Court – one for which he eagerly planned . But he died even before ground was broken for the structure . As he reacted to his overwhelming defeat for reelection in 1912 , Taft had written that "" I must wait for years if I would be vindicated by the people ... I am content to wait . "" Perhaps he has waited long enough . [ 224 ] ^ There were two sons from Alphonso's first marriage and three , including William , by the second . ^ Alphonso Taft died in 1891 in California , retired because of illness contracted during his diplomatic postings . See Pringle vol 1 , p. 119 . ^ Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway Co. v. Voight , 176 U.S. 498 ( 1900 ) .

289	The primary characteristic of Compulsive Skin Picking ( CSP ) is the repetitive picking at one's own skin to the extent of causing bleeding or damage to the skin to relieve anxiety or urges . Skin-picking is often preceded by a strong itch or urge , which the sufferer believes can only be relieved by picking . Then , of course , a feeling of depression or hopelessness follows when the damage caused by the picking is realised . Paradoxically a kind of compulsive perfectionism may convince the sufferer at the time that picking is a necessary means to achieving a clear complexion . In this way a vicious circle arises that is hard to break . Thus CSP may be seen to have obsessive-compulsive aspects that are similar to OCD , Body Dysmorphic Disorder ( BDD ) and trichotillomania . In fact research has shown that around a quarter of those diagnosed with OCD or BDD also have CSP . CSP is thus sometimes described as an Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorder , along with , for example , BDD , eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa , and movement disorders such as Tourette's Syndrome ( TS ) . Skin-pickers often feel the need to camouflage their blemishes with make-up or cover bad areas with clothing . Social embarrassment can lead the sufferer to stay indoors , avoid friends , be late for work as their picking and make-up routine takes so long , or even to take sickness leave from work when their skin is in a very bad state . What treatment is available ? The best advice initially is to consult your GP . Many sufferers are very embarrassed by their symptoms and not all doctors are well-informed , so one idea would be to write down your problem , without minimising it , or print out this webpage for your doctor to read . Very often patients are referred first of all to a dermatologist , which may be appropriate if there is a skin disorder that needs treating but may also delay treatment of the compulsive psychological element . There is evidence that skin-picking may be caused by biological factors such as brain structure and you may be prescribed serotonin enhancing drugs such as Prozac or one of the other SSRIs . This may be augmented with one of the neuroleptics , for example Risperdal , as these often suppress the tic-like behaviour that may be involved in picking . The second and very important treatment for Compulsive Skin-Picking is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) . If your case is severe you may be referred to a trained therapist who will teach you a technique of CBT called Habit Reversal . Habit Reversal was developed in the 1970s by psychologists Nathan Azrin and Gregory Nunn for treating nervous habits such as tics , stammering and skin-picking which are done automatically . Therapy should focus initially on developing Habit Awareness and patients may be asked to keep records of when , where and under what circumstances they normally pick . Many people believe that if they stop one bad habit it will be replaced with another bad habit . However , one of the key ideas of habit reversal is to replace the harmful habit with another harmless habit that makes the bad habit impossible . This new behaviour is known as a competing response . A suitable competing response for skin-picking might be clenching one's fist , as this is incompatible with skin-picking . Another important part of habit reversal training is practising a suitable method of relaxation such as meditation , abdominal breathing or progressive muscle relaxation . Successful CBT will also involve stimulus control . Once the sufferer has identified the particular environmental factors or mood states that lead to picking , steps can be taken to deal with such triggers . For instance this might mean avoiding or covering mirrors or challenging automatic thoughts and emotions connected with picking and replacing them with less negative responses . Further ideas on breaking the habit of skin-picking : - Get advice on skin care . If you have a skin complaint see a dermatologist . - When tempted to pick , care for your skin by applying a moisturising lotion instead - Stimulus control : cover or remove mirrors if they act as a trigger and get rid of all implements such as tweezers and pins used for picking . - Consider the use of artificial nails to make picking more difficult - it may work for some . - Wear rubber fingertips or cotton gloves whenever possible if you feel the urge to pick . - Try replacing some of the sensory aspects of skin-picking with a more desirable alternative . For example , keep an object by you that you can manipulate ( squeeze or pull ) such as a soft rubber ball or some Blu Tak . - Keep your hands busy with something else such as a puzzle or knitting . - If you bite the inside of your cheeks try eating crunchy snacks when you feel the urge to bite . - Reward yourself for making progress with some kind of treat . - As you gain more confidence gradually begin to expose your hands , arms , face or legs to others starting with family and friends . You will no doubt benefit from their support but at the same time the negative consequences of engaging in your habit will be increased .

1658	"Noise figure ( NF ) and noise factor ( F ) are measures of degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , caused by components in a radio-frequency ( RF ) signal chain . It is a number by which the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver can be specified , with lower values indicating better performance . The noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output noise power of a device to the portion thereof attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature T 0 ( usually 290 K ) . The noise factor is thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the device itself did not introduce noise , or the ratio of input SNR to output SNR . The noise figure is simply the noise factor expressed in decibels ( dB ) . The noise figure is the difference in decibels ( dB ) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an "" ideal "" receiver with the same overall gain and bandwidth when the receivers are connected to matched sources at the standard noise temperature T 0 ( usually 290 K ) . The noise power from a simple load is equal to kTB , where k is Boltzmann's constant , T is the absolute temperature of the load ( for example a resistor ) , and B is the measurement bandwidth . This makes the noise figure a useful figure of merit for terrestrial systems , where the antenna effective temperature is usually near the standard 290 K. In this case , one receiver with a noise figure , say 2 dB better than another , will have an output signal to noise ratio that is about 2 dB better than the other . However , in the case of satellite communications systems , where the receiver antenna is pointed out into cold space , the antenna effective temperature is often colder than 290 K. In these cases a 2 dB improvement in receiver noise figure will result in more than a 2 dB improvement in the output signal to noise ratio . For this reason , the related figure of effective noise temperature is therefore often used instead of the noise figure for characterizing satellite-communication receivers and low-noise amplifiers . In heterodyne systems , output noise power includes spurious contributions from image - frequency transformation , but the portion attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature includes only that which appears in the output via the principal frequency transformation of the system and excludes that which appears via the image frequency transformation . F = S N R in S N R out , { \ displaystyle F = { \ frac { \ mathrm { SNR } _ { \ text { in }}} { \ mathrm { SNR } _ { \ text { out }}}} , } where SNR in and SNR out are the input and output signal-to-noise ratios respectively . The SNR quantities are power ratios . The noise figure NF is defined as the noise factor in dB : where SNR in , dB and SNR out , dB are in decibels ( dB ) . These formulae are only valid when the input termination is at standard noise temperature T 0 = 290 K , although in practice small differences in temperature do not significantly affect the values . Attenuators have a noise factor F equal to their attenuation ratio L when their physical temperature equals T 0 . More generally , for an attenuator at a physical temperature T , the noise temperature is T e = ( L − 1 ) T { \ displaystyle T_ { \ text { e }} = ( L-1 ) T } , giving a noise factor of : If several devices are cascaded , the total noise factor can be found with Friis' Formula : where F n is the noise factor for the n - th device , and G n is the power gain ( linear , not in dB ) of the n - th device . The first amplifier in a chain usually has the most significant effect on the total noise figure because the noise figures of the following stages are reduced by stage gains . Consequently , the first amplifier usually has a low noise figure , and the noise figure requirements of subsequent stages is usually more relaxed ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

894	"Silas drew near the man on tiptoe . He lay partly on his back , partly on his side , and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition . Suddenly , while the American was still bending over him , the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes , and Silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of Box Court . "" Good-night , sir , "" said the man , pleasantly . But Silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer , and regained his room in silence . Towards morning , worn out by apprehension , he fell asleep on his chair , with his head forward on the trunk . In spite of so constrained an attitude and such a grisly pillow , his slumber was sound and prolonged , and he was only awakened at a late hour and by a sharp tapping at the door . He hurried to open , and found the boots without . "" You are the gentleman who called yesterday at Box Court ? "" he asked . Silas , with a quaver , admitted that he had done so . "" Then this note is for you , "" added the servant , proffering a sealed envelope . Silas tore it open , and found inside the words : "" Twelve o ' clock . "" He was punctual to the hour ; the trunk was carried before him by several stout servants ; and he was himself ushered into a room , where a man sat warming himself before the fire with his back towards the door . The sound of so many persons entering and leaving , and the scraping of the trunk as it was deposited upon the bare boards , were alike unable to attract the notice of the occupant ; and Silas stood waiting , in an agony of fear , until he should deign to recognise his presence . Perhaps five minutes had elapsed before the man turned leisurely about , and disclosed the features of Prince Florizel of Bohemia . "" So , sir , "" he said , with great severity , "" this is the manner in which you abuse my politeness . You join yourselves to persons of condition , I perceive , for no other purpose than to escape the consequences of your crimes ; and I can readily understand your embarrassment when I addressed myself to you yesterday . "" "" Indeed , "" cried Silas , "" I am innocent of everything except misfortune . "" And in a hurried voice , and with the greatest ingenuousness , he recounted to the Prince the whole history of his calamity . "" I see I have been mistaken , "" said his Highness , when he had heard him to an end . "" You are no other than a victim , and since I am not to punish you may be sure I shall do my utmost to help . And now , "" he continued , "" to business . Open your box at once , and let me see what it contains . "" Silas changed colour . "" I almost fear to look upon it , "" he exclaimed . "" Nay , "" replied the Prince , "" have you not looked at it already ? This is a form of sentimentality to be resisted . The sight of a sick man , whom we can still help , should appeal more directly to the feelings than that of a dead man who is equally beyond help or harm , love or hatred . Nerve yourself , Mr. Scuddamore , "" and then , seeing that Silas still hesitated , "" I do not desire to give another name to my request , "" he added . The young American awoke as if out of a dream , and with a shiver of repugnance addressed himself to loose the straps and open the lock of the Saratoga trunk . The Prince stood by , watching with a composed countenance and his hands behind his back . The body was quite stiff , and it cost Silas a great effort , both moral and physical , to dislodge it from its position , and discover the face . Prince Florizel started back with an exclamation of painful surprise . "" Alas ! "" he cried , "" you little know , Mr. Scuddamore , what a cruel gift you have brought me . This is a young man of my own suite , the brother of my trusted friend ; and it was upon matters of my own service that he has thus perished at the hands of violent and treacherous men . Poor Geraldine , "" he went on , as if to himself , "" in what words am I to tell you of your brother's fate ? How can I excuse myself in your eyes , or in the eyes of God , for the presumptuous schemes that led him to this bloody and unnatural death ? Ah , Florizel ! Florizel ! when will you learn the discretion that suits mortal life , and be no longer dazzled with the image of power at your disposal ? Power ! "" he cried ; "" who is more powerless ? I look upon this young man whom I have sacrificed , Mr."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical

628	Work Opportunities - Ajay My name is Ajay and I have tried lots of jobs . I have done hairdressing for my school work experience . I really enjoyed it . I washed hair and swept the floor and made teas and coffees . I would also take appointments and payment from customers with some help from the staff . After college , I went to the job centre to see a Disability Employment Adviser ( DEA ) . The DEA told me about work and benefits . Some of it was really hard to understand . We talked about work-based training and she said she would look for a job for me . She told me it might take some time . I was out of work , so I had to go on a benefit called Job Seekers Allowance . I had to go to the job centre every 2 weeks to say that I was still looking for work . Then I went to a supported employment agency . The people at the supported employment agency were very nice to me , they asked me lots of questions about jobs I might like to do . They also gave me English and maths tests . They also wanted to know if I could count money and give out the correct change . I worked at Newco Products for 6 months . This work was similar to being in a factory . I learned new skills that could help me find a job at the end of training . I had to manufacture and assemble kitchen units . The placement was for 23 hours per week . On my first day I had to take along my bank details so that they could pay my wages straight into my bank account . I got paid every 2 weeks . They also explained what I should do if I was late for work or off sick . I had to ring the supervisor . I also had to book my holidays in advance so that they could make sure that everyone did n't take the same time off . When I had finished my training at Newco Products I went to do some more work experience at Matalan . I worked on different sections throughout the store . I helped with deliveries ; unpacking and putting out items . I also helped out in the fitting room and customer services . I worked every Monday and Tuesday . I started work at 10 . 00a . m . and I finished at 3 . 00p . m . I had a half-hour lunch break at 1 . 00p . m . I would take sandwiches and eat them in the staff room and play pool with other members of staff . When my work experience ended I asked the manager if I could work weekends but he said that they only had evening work available and I did n't want that . Then I started work for MacIntyre . I work for the Transition project and I am an illustrator . I am creating all the images to be used in the resource pack . I work for 14 hours a week in the office and at home . I get paid for this work so I had to have a meeting to stop all my benefits . I get paid monthly like everyone else . I really enjoy this work and I hope to continue with my illustration work when the project ends .	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
758	This paper looks at conservation policy responses to the potential loss of biodiversity benefits in Kenya from the conversion of essentially wild and undeveloped land to developed agriculture . One fundamental issue is the extent to which traditional owners and users of land have the right to benefit from the development potential of their land to further their economic and social progress , even if by so doing they create domestic and global externalities through the loss of biodiversity . Property rights are central to the debate , and we discuss here the interaction between three completely different property rights : the state over its own land , private land owners over their land , and the state over individual wild animals which migrate between state and privately owned lan	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
1518	"Nonverbal Communication Help for Salespeople Dear Sue : I am fairly new to an outside sales position and am looking for information about non-verbal communication . I am interested in learning about office settings . Any other information that can help me to ' read ' a situation better would be appreciated . - Amy Sue Says : During the average 30-minute sales call , a buyer and seller exchange approximately 800 different nonverbal messages , yet most salespeople focus on the verbal part of the sale , according to Jan Hargrave , a body language consultant and author of the book , Strictly Business Body Language . Salespeople who pay attention to body language typically focus almost exclusively on facial expressions . However , the way words are spoken and the speakers face all provide information about how the sales call is going . The voice and face are only part of the picture . The body is the communication channel over which we have the least control and understand the least , but has the most impact . Where you sit and how the furniture is arranged can either encourage friendliness and cooperation or confrontation . Hargrave says that sitting across the table from a person during a negotiation creates a defensive , competitive atmosphere and can lead to each party taking a firm stand on his or her point of view . The table becomes a solid barrier between both parties and allows for a distinct division of ideas . Massive desks create a physical barrier , and serve as a visual barrier as well . If you ca n't see someone from the chest down , you do n't know if the buyer's legs are crossed , if he 's tapping his foot or cleaning his nails . Office furniture can be arranged in a way to give a person as much power , status or control over others as they wish . Just sitting behind a desk conveys a sense of power and positioning because all who enter must look across it , which gives the person behind it control . Increased status and power can be achieved with : Low sofas for visitors to sit on . A wall covered with photos , awards or qualifications that the occupant has received . A slim briefcase ; those who do all the work carry large , bulky briefcases . Red folders on a desk marked "" Strictly Confidential . "" An expensive ashtray placed out of reach of the visitor causing him inconvenience when ashing a cigarette . ( I do not recommend smoking on a sales call , however . ) You are wise to take in a person's environment to learn more about that person . If you are having trouble communicating with someone , moving to a new location , changing positions or getting him or her to come out from behind a desk can change the dynamics of the interaction ."

363	"During July the most popular areas of training that we have received additional enquiries have been : Speedwriting Word / Excel / Access / PowerPoint Finance for Non-Financial Managers Redundancy Emotional Intelligence The popular ares of consultancy that we list are those areas that members have enquired about in particular , and it is always interesting , because each month the areas change . CIPD ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION October 27th - 29th , Harrogate - For all people management and development specialists - the latest thinking and business strategies , debate topical issues , explore new ideas , and network with your fellow professionals . For further information : training . h otline @ cipd . c o . u k TRAINING SERVICES INDEX - PUBLICATION - Latest issue Work is well under way for the new edition of the Index , which will be published in early October . SNIPPETS - from providers : CAPITA : Bite-sized Learning Would Attract ' Switched Off ' People , Study Disadvantaged individuals from 19-24 years old are often "" switched off "" when it comes to learning , and thus ill equipped for the modern workforce . But they would be receptive to learning offered in bite-sized chunks in an informal environment and a short-term commitment , concludes a new study from the Campaign for Learning and Ufi . This so-called "" rejector "" group represents 16 percent of the population and is largely untouched by government learning campaigns , it claims . The research , entitled First Steps into Learning , recommends that the government speed up the creation of a credit framework which incorporates bite-sized learning , enabling the accumulation of credits towards recognised qualifications from a wider range of courses . It also recommends that a variety of learning styles be offered to the group . Increase in Stress-Related Absences is Cited by CIPD . Stress-related absences are on the rise within UK workplaces , but many employers are addressing the problem with training and other initiatives , according to the latest survey on employee absence from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) . The organisation's fifth annual report on employee absence found that 52 % of surveyed employers reported an increase of stress-related absences due to workload , management , organisational change and other reasons . Efforts in response include management training , improvement of work-life balance , stress audits , and employee assistance programs . "" A large part of managing stress is about good people management "" says report author Ben Willmott "" It is about providing employees with well-defined job roles , challenging , but realistic targets and the support , training and recognition to help them achieve these targets "" he says . Legislation Employers face hefty fines or even imprisonment if they fail to comply with the new duty to manage asbestos . What 's more , staff , former staff and even contractors could bring compensation claims for personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos . Company directors run the risk of being prosecuted if an offence has been committed with their consent , connivance or neglect ( pleading ignorance will be no defence ) . If the employer is the person responsible for the maintenance or repair of non-domestic property ( the ' relevant duty holder ' ) it must take active steps to identify , record and manage any asbestos that is or may be p resent . This duty will be enforced by HSE inspectors and any breach is likely to be treated very seriously - premises may even be shut down if an asbestos hazard is identified . Under the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 ( which should have been complied with by 21 May 2004 ) this ' duty to manage ' requires duty-holders to pay for making safe or removing any asbestos that is in a poor condition or is likely to be disturbed by planned building work or routine maintenance . If it can be established that the asbestos is in a sound state and not likely to be disturbed , then it can be left there , although its location must be recorded and the record retained on site for the lifetime of the building . From 1 October 2004 new forms will have to be used where the questionnaire procedure is used in cases of disability discrimination . These can be found in the Disability Discrimination ( Questions and Replies ) Order 2004 . Currently employers have to respond to such questionnaires ' within a reasonable period ' ( unless they have a good excuse ) to avoid a tribunal drawing an adverse inference from the failure to reply . As of 1 October employers will have to respond within 28 days of receiving such a questionnaire ( unless they have a reasonable excuse ) to avoid any such inferences being drawn . Holiday pay Is a worker who has n ' t taken all the holiday to which he is entitled during a year entitled to pay in lieu of the untaken holiday ? The answer under the Working Time Regulations 1998 ( WTR ) is generally ' No ' . But , in Canada Life v Gray and Farrar , the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that , on termination , workers are entitled to backdate their claims for holiday pay to when the WTR were introduced ( 1 October 1998 ) . Whilst under the WTR no entitlement to holiday can be carried forward from one year to the next , post termination the position is different . The WTR specifically provide , on termination , for a payment to be made in lieu of leave to which a worker was entitled , but had not taken . Provided the claim is made within 3 months of termination , this can include unpaid holiday dating back to October 1998 ( regardless of whether the worker actually took holiday or not ) . Training Challenge - Speedwriting This is a topic that we have had before , but our top enquiry this month was on the subject of speed writing , so worth looking at the subject again . Speedwriting is an area that there should be a lot more choices available . The leading secretarial college that used to bombard the London Underground tubes with posters , which enabled you to try your hand at reading and translating Speed Writing messages has long disappeared . A shame it passed the time on the tube ! Now a thing of the past , yet we get a lot of enquiries about the subject . I have tracked down a distance-learning course on the subject .

The course aimed to improve participants' negotiating skills , to establish a framework for understanding the negotiating process , to identify negotiating skills , and to provide an opportunity for delegates to practice negotiating in a non-risk environment . Objective achievement was considered good or very good . Two tutors appear on each holding of this course , names have included John McMillan , Richard Rowland , Chris Mitchell , Sue Paradise , Stephen White , Mike Roberts , Mike Hatton , Keith Risk , David Perry , Robin Copland , Mike Barrier , and David Durrant . Their standard was high , and each was well received . Delegates found most useful the coverage on learning the structured ( 8-step ) approach to negotiating , the different negotiating styles and their pitfalls , the video-taped role-playing of negotiations in areas ranging from prices to wage disputes , recognising the need to "" trade "" in any negotiation , the coverage on the way out of an argument , the vital importance of thorough preparation for negotiations , case participation and team evaluation ; and the abundance of practical advice . One delegate stated , "" This is a very well-developed course , and the standard consistently good . "" The only criticism was that they would have liked more time in which to practise negotiating . Those who have to undertake negotiating at work were thought to be the most suitable delegates , especially those involved in buying or selling . Course administration was very good , 10 - 12 delegates attending . Delegates comments : "" Educational , relative to role and inspiring ! "" "" The long term benefits to the company - make this a very cost effective course "" "" Essential to all people who negotiate for the company or with employees of the company "" "" Both tutors fully in tune and very experienced in all aspects of negotiating .

She was at the airport returning to the UK on the 3rd April when she was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard . She has been transferred to an unknown location in Kerman Province , 1,000 kilometres south of Tehran , and is being held in solitary confinement . Gabriella Ratcliffe our 22 month old daughter ( who has British citizenship only ) has had her British passport confiscated , and is stranded in Iran with her grandparents . Nazanin has not been allowed to access a lawyer or her daughter . She has not been able to call out of the country to speak to me , her British husband , and the Red Cross have not been able to make contact . There have been no charges . Nazanin has informed her family that she has been required to sign a confession under duress , its content unknown . Her family have been informed that the investigation relates to an issue of ' national security ' . It is hard to understand how a young mother and her small child on holiday could be considered an issue of national security . She has been to Iran to visit her family regularly since making Britain her home . Nazanin currently works as a project manager for the Thomson-Reuters Foundation ; which delivers charitable projects around the world . It does not work in Iran . Nazanin has now been in solitary confinement for over 30 days .

63	"CHAPTER III . _IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS , IMMANIOR IPSE_ . Now , in 1482 , Quasimodo had grown up . He had become a few years previously the bellringer of Notre-Dame , thanks to his father by adoption , Claude Frollo , -- who had become archdeacon of Josas , thanks to his suzerain , Messire Louis de Beaumont , -- who had become Bishop of Paris , at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472 , thanks to his patron , Olivier Le Daim , barber to Louis XI . , king by the grace of God . So Quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame . In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church . Separated forever from the world , by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity , imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle , the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow . Notre-Dame had been to him successively , as he grew up and developed , the egg , the nest , the house , the country , the universe . There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church . When , still a little fellow , he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults , he seemed , with his human face and his bestial limbs , the natural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement , upon which the shadow of the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms . Later on , the first time that he caught hold , mechanically , of the ropes to the towers , and hung suspended from them , and set the bell to clanging , it produced upon his adopted father , Claude , the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak . It is thus that , little by little , developing always in sympathy with the cathedral , living there , sleeping there , hardly ever leaving it , subject every hour to the mysterious impress , he came to resemble it , he incrusted himself in it , so to speak , and became an integral part of it . His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral ( if we may be allowed this figure of speech ) , and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that , its natural tenant . One might almost say that he had assumed its form , as the snail takes on the form of its shell . It was his dwelling , his hole , his envelope . There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy , so many magnetic affinities , so many material affinities , that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell . The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell . It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular , symmetrical , direct , almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice . It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him , after so long and so intimate a cohabitation . That dwelling was peculiar to him . It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated , no height which he had not scaled . He often climbed many stones up the front , aided solely by the uneven points of the carving . The towers , on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering , like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall , those two gigantic twins , so lofty , so menacing , so formidable , possessed for him neither vertigo , nor terror , nor shocks of amazement . To see them so gentle under his hand , so easy to scale , one would have said that he had tamed them . By dint of leaping , climbing , gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become , in some sort , a monkey and a goat , like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks , and plays with the sea while still a babe . Moreover , it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral , but his mind also . In what condition was that mind ? What bent had it contracted , what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope , in that savage life ? This it would be hard to determine . Quasimodo had been born one-eyed , hunchbacked , lame . It was with great difficulty , and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk . But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling . Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen , a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes : the bells had broken the drums of his ears ; he had become deaf . The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed , and forever . In closing , it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo . His soul fell into profound night . The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity . Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb . For , in order not to make others laugh , the very moment that he found himself to be deaf , he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone . He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose . Hence , it came about , that when necessity constrained him to speak , his tongue was torpid , awkward , and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty . If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick , hard rind ; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism ; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature , to elucidate his obscure corners , his absurd no-thoroughfares , and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave , we should , no doubt , find the unhappy Psyche in some poor , cramped , and ricketty attitude , like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice , who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them . It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body . Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image , moving blindly within him . The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind . His brain was a peculiar medium ; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted . The reflection which resulted from this refraction was , necessarily , divergent and perverted . Hence a thousand optical illusions , a thousand aberrations of judgment , a thousand deviations , in which his thought strayed , now mad , now idiotic . The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things . He received hardly any immediate perception of them . The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us . The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious . He was malicious , in fact , because he was savage ; he was savage because he was ugly . There was logic in his nature , as there is in ours . His strength , so extraordinarily developed , was a cause of still greater malevolence : "" _Malus puer robustus_ , "" says Hobbes . This justice must , however be rendered to him . Malevolence was not , perhaps , innate in him . From his very first steps among men , he had felt himself , later on he had seen himself , spewed out , blasted , rejected . Human words were , for him , always a raillery or a malediction . As he grew up , he had found nothing but hatred around him . He had caught the general malevolence . He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded . After all , he turned his face towards men only with reluctance ; his cathedral was sufficient for him . It was peopled with marble figures , -- kings , saints , bishops , -- who at least did not burst out laughing in his face , and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness . The other statues , those of the monsters and demons , cherished no hatred for him , Quasimodo . He resembled them too much for that . They seemed rather , to be scoffing at other men . The saints were his friends , and blessed him ; the monsters were his friends and guarded him . So he held long communion with them . He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues , in solitary conversation with it . If any one came , he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade . And the cathedral was not only society for him , but the universe , and all nature beside . He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows , always in flower ; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out , loaded with birds , in the tufts of the Saxon capitals ; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church ; of no other ocean than Paris , roaring at their bases . What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice , that which aroused his soul , and made it open its poor wings , which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern , that which sometimes rendered him even happy , was the bells . He loved them , fondled them , talked to them , understood them . From the chime in the spire , over the intersection of the aisles and nave , to the great bell of the front , he cherished a tenderness for them all . The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages , whose birds , reared by himself , sang for him alone . Yet it was these very bells which had made him deaf ; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering . It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear . On this score , the big bell was his beloved . It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him , on festival days . This bell was named Marie . She was alone in the southern tower , with her sister Jacqueline , a bell of lesser size , shut up in a smaller cage beside hers . This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu , who had given it to the church , which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfauçon . In the second tower there were six other bells , and , finally , six smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing , with the wooden bell , which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the morning of the day before Easter . So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio ; but big Marie was his favorite . No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded . At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him , and said , "" Go ! "" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it . He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell ; he gazed at her a moment , devoutly and lovingly ; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand , like a good horse , which is about to set out on a long journey . He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer . After these first caresses , he shouted to his assistants , placed in the lower story of the tower , to begin . They grasped the ropes , the wheel creaked , the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion . Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled . The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver . Quasimodo vibrated with the bell . "" Vah ! "" he cried , with a senseless burst of laughter . However , the movement of the bass was accelerated , and , in proportion as it described a wider angle , Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely , phosphoric and flaming . At length the grand peal began ; the whole tower trembled ; woodwork , leads , cut stones , all groaned at once , from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit . Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed ; he went and came ; he trembled from head to foot with the tower . The bell , furious , running riot , presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat , whence escaped that tempestuous breath , which is audible leagues away . Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat ; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell , breathed in this overwhelming breath , gazed by turns at the deep place , which swarmed with people , two hundred feet below him , and at that enormous , brazen tongue which came , second after second , to howl in his ear . It was the only speech which he understood , the only sound which broke for him the universal silence . He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun . All of a sudden , the frenzy of the bell seized upon him ; his look became extraordinary ; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed , as a spider lies in wait for a fly , and flung himself abruptly upon it , with might and main . Then , suspended above the abyss , borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell , he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps , pressed it between both knees , spurred it on with his heels , and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body . Meanwhile , the tower trembled ; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth , his red hair rose erect , his breast heaving like a bellows , his eye flashed flames , the monstrous bell neighed , panting , beneath him ; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo : it was a dream , a whirlwind , a tempest , dizziness mounted astride of noise ; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper , a strange centaur , half man , half bell ; a sort of horrible Astolphus , borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze . The presence of this extraordinary being caused , as it were , a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral . It seemed as though there escaped from him , at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd , a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame , and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate . It sufficed for people to know that he was there , to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion . And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand ; it waited on his will to raise its great voice ; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo , as with a familiar spirit . One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe . He was everywhere about it ; in fact , he multiplied himself on all points of the structure . Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers , a fantastic dwarf climbing , writhing , crawling on all fours , descending outside above the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows . Again , in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera , crouching and scowling ; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought . Sometimes one caught sight , upon a bell tower , of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope ; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus . Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework , which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse ; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame . Then , said the women of the neighborhood , the whole church took on something fantastic , supernatural , horrible ; eyes and mouths were opened , here and there ; one heard the dogs , the monsters , and the gargoyles of stone , which keep watch night and day , with outstretched neck and open jaws , around the monstrous cathedral , barking . And , if it was a Christmas Eve , while the great bell , which seemed to emit the death rattle , summoned the faithful to the midnight mass , such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng , and that the rose window was watching it . And all this came from Quasimodo . Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple ; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon : he was in fact its soul . To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed , Notre-Dame is to-day deserted , inanimate , dead . One feels that something has disappeared from it . That immense body is empty ; it is a skeleton ; the spirit has quitted it , one sees its place and that is all . It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes , but no longer sight ."

639	Well back to work I went , on a part-time basis , I have to confess my employers Iceland were very understanding and accommodating which made things a lot easier . I do n't know why I went back to work because to this day I know I went back too soon . I do think that I went back to work because of my financial situation , since coming out of hospital my bills were getting out of control and I was finding it hard to keep my head above water . I just could n't keep my bank balance in the black and my sick pay was running out - the wrong reason to go back to work , I know but the honest reason all the same . Some people say your health comes first , not me , not when you 've got bills to pay - the philosophy according to a dafty like me !! On returning to work I decided to try for Disability Living allowance , elementary I thought , but as a lot of you will know it 's not so easy . Meanwhile back at the shop it was proving very difficult , but the bonus was I was meeting people and talking to people again , not just sitting behind my four walls alone getting depressed . That is one thing that has changed with me for those who have known me for years , I always loved my own company , but now I am pining for company . I 'm a bit confused about my sudden change . I wanted to go out but I was always so conscious of my tremor and people watching me I would n't go out . I got knocked back for DLA but reapplied after a lot of hassle from family and friends , so reapply I did . I was still going through severe mood swings , work was n't helping me much either , the shop I am manager of is a very fast moving store with things happening all the time , your always on the go working from 7 am to 7 pm - it was proving too much for me . There were times I locked myself in the office and just cried , yes I was still at it . You 'd think they would have dried up by now . Work in Galashiels was proving very difficult , I had a major problem to face , after 13 years working what could I do ..... It was a problem that did n't help my sleep pattern much , whatever that was ? It also did n't help my walking much as I found my left leg dragging severely . I was having great difficulty in walking . In October I had a week's holiday and discovered I hated holidays from work . I just got depressed and lonely , but I had a visit from a doctor through my holiday to see if I was entitled to DLA . I went through hell on that visit , bet you cannae guess what I did , yes my trear ducts started again , especially when I spoke about what I could do before but could n't do anymore . I never realised my life had changed as much in such a short time , but bloody change it did . Also during my holiday I attended my first YAPP & R's meeting in Edinburgh , brilliant I was finally meeting folk with the same problem as myself . Helen asked if I minded talking to the group about my operation - no problem . I must admit I think I used a few too many swear words in my talk , for that I b ......... y apologise . But yes I had a great day . I even won a motorbike in the raffle - what a day . Yes , I was on a high , but I forgot what they say about what goes up ............ Yes soon I plumetted again , but I had made contact with folk frae the Glesga area , Robert , Louise and Ann . They stay not far from Jeff and Karen so on my next visit there we met in the pub for a bit of lubrication . It was a great night . Jeff thoroughly enjoyed meeting folk with a similar problem to me . Jeff is the opposite of me he wants to learn as much as possible - me I do n't want to know ......... I do n't know why ......... but I do n't . On return to work after my holidays I made a decision to meet my boss . I arranged to meet Stewart Dyson , my Area Manager , in the pub after work . I confessed my concern about not being able to do the job anymore - you know what comes next , crying in the pub . I was worried my employers would drop me like a hot potato after my confession but I could n't be further from the truth . Stewart said he would help me as much as possible but he could n't do anything before Christmas . Roll on the New Year !!! After my talk with my boss we had our Annual Managers' Conference in Birmingham . In the afternoon I was presented with a holiday for two in Florida - Florida by golly !!! For what I had gone through . I felt really guilty taking the holiday , especially after my confession that I could n't do the job anymore but I kept getting told it was for what I had gone through not what I 'm doing now . What a Brucie Bonus ....... I was starting to get more bad days than good days .......... I put this down to my working environment and the stress I was putting myself under . I was finding it hard to walk , my tremor was coming back more often and I was depressed . I honestly believe I was near to a nervous breakdown , but battle on I would , why ? because it paid the bills . I was now starting to clear my debts 8 months on and was finally beginning to get my head above water , so what does the future hold ........... Contents Back : 3 .

37	"Mark 1 John the Baptist Prepares the Way 1 The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ , the Son of God . [ a ] 2 It is written in Isaiah the prophet : "" I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way "" [ b ] – 3 "" a voice of one calling in the desert , ' Prepare the way for the Lord , make straight paths for him . ' "" [ c ] 4 And so John came , baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins . 5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him . Confessing their sins , they were baptized by him in the Jordan River . 6 John wore clothing made of camel's hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey . 7 And this was his message : "" After me will come one more powerful than I , the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie . 8 I baptize you with [ d ] water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "" The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus 9 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan . 10 As Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove . 11 And a voice came from heaven : "" You are my Son , whom I love ; with you I am well pleased . "" 12 At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert , 13 and he was in the desert forty days , being tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and angels attended him . The Calling of the First Disciples 14 After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God . 15 "" The time has come , "" he said . "" The kingdom of God is near . Repent and believe the good news ! "" 16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen . 17 "" Come , follow me , "" Jesus said , "" and I will make you fishers of men . "" 18 At once they left their nets and followed him . 19 When he had gone a little farther , he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat , preparing their nets . 20 Without delay he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him . Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit 21 They went to Capernaum , and when the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach . 22 The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught them as one who had authority , not as the teachers of the law . 23 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil [ e ] spirit cried out , 24 "" What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are – the Holy One of God ! "" 25 "" Be quiet ! "" said Jesus sternly . "" Come out of him ! "" 26 The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek . 27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other , "" What is this ? A new teaching – and with authority ! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him . "" 28 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee . Jesus Heals Many 29 As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew . 30 Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever , and they told Jesus about her . 31 So he went to her , took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her and she began to wait on them . 32 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed . 33 The whole town gathered at the door , 34 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases . He also drove out many demons , but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was . Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place 35 Very early in the morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house and went off to a solitary place , where he prayed . 36 Simon and his companions went to look for him , 37 and when they found him , they exclaimed : "" Everyone is looking for you ! "" 38 Jesus replied , "" Let us go somewhere else – to the nearby villages – so I can preach there also . That is why I have come . "" 39 So he traveled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons . A Man With Leprosy 40 A man with leprosy [ f ] came to him and begged him on his knees , "" If you are willing , you can make me clean . "" 41 Filled with compassion , Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . "" I am willing , "" he said . "" Be clean ! "" 42 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured . 43 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning : 44 "" See that you do n't tell this to anyone . But go , show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them . "" 45 Instead he went out and began to talk freely , spreading the news . As a result , Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places . Yet the people still came to him from everywhere . Mark 2 Jesus Heals a Paralytic 1 A few days later , when Jesus again entered Capernaum , the people heard that he had come home . 2 So many gathered that there was no room left , not even outside the door , and he preached the word to them . 3 Some men came , bringing to him a paralytic , carried by four of them . 4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and , after digging through it , lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on . 5 When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , "" Son , your sins are forgiven . "" 6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves , 7 "" Why does this fellow talk like that ? He 's blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "" 8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts , and he said to them , "" Why are you thinking these things ? 9 Which is easier : to say to the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Get up , take your mat and walk ' ? 10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... "" He said to the paralytic , 11 "" I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home . "" 12 He got up , took his mat and walked out in full view of them all . This amazed everyone and they praised God , saying , "" We have never seen anything like this ! "" The Calling of Levi 13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake . A large crowd came to him , and he began to teach them . 14 As he walked along , he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth . "" Follow me , "" Jesus told him , and Levi got up and followed him . 15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house , many tax collectors and "" sinners "" were eating with him and his disciples , for there were many who followed him . 16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "" sinners "" and tax collectors , they asked his disciples : "" Why does he eat with tax collectors and ' sinners ' ? "" 17 On hearing this , Jesus said to them , "" It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but the sick . I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . "" Jesus Questioned About Fasting 18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came and asked Jesus , "" How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting , but yours are not ? "" 19 Jesus answered , "" How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ? They can not , so long as they have him with them . 20 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and on that day they will fast . 21 "" No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . If he does , the new piece will pull away from the old , making the tear worse . 22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined . No , he pours new wine into new wineskins . "" Lord of the Sabbath 23 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields , and as his disciples walked along , they began to pick some heads of grain . 24 The Pharisees said to him , "" Look , why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? "" 25 He answered , "" Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need ? 26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest , he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he also gave some to his companions . "" 27 Then he said to them , "" The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath . 28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath .

785	"Dr Hamid Dehghani "" Dr Julian Moger "" "" Full table of contents Biophysics of the Extracellular Matrix The extracellular matrix is a component of all mammalian tissues and consists of a network of fibrous proteins , elastin and collagens , embedded in a viscoelastic gel rich in high molecular weight anionic polymers known as proteoglycans . This structure , which is quantitatively a major component in tissues such as cartilage , intervertebral disc and blood vessels , endows tissues with the requisite mechanical properties and regulates the movement of water , nutrients and other solutes . There is strong evidence that changes in these functions are associated with diseases as apparently diverse as arthritis , atherosclerosis and cancer . There is a delicate symbiosis between the behaviour of the cells , whose functions include the repair and remodelling of the extracellular matrix , and the composition of the matrix itself . This interaction , which is mediated by a wide variety of electrical , mechanical and chemical signals , is only slowly becoming understood but it underlies the normal processes of development and growth and may be impaired in disease . Our research has the long-term aim of unravelling the relationships between the physical properties of the macromolecular constituents of the extracellular matrix and their supramolecular assemblies and the physiological functions of the tissue . This information is , we believe , important in relating the wealth of descriptive data that has accumulated on changes in extracellular matrix biochemistry that occur in disease to the actual disease process . Current projects include : Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of elasticity in elastic proteins .

38	"Apple and the Environment Frequently Asked Questions Q : How does Apple review the company's progress and status regarding its environmental impact ? A : Apple's Executive Team is responsible for setting and implementing environmental policies . This group of the company's most senior executives is advised by teams from across Apple , including environmental engineering , product development , operations , facilities , and supplier responsibility . Apple's climate change strategy is built into all facilities development plans and plays an important role in the product development process . In 2009 , at the direction of the Executive Team , Apple became the first company in the electronics industry to report its entire carbon footprint including the impact of its products on the environment through consumer use . In addition to providing consumers with an unprecedented level of detail and transparency on which to base their purchasing decisions , measuring the company's carbon footprint helps the company identify areas where it can make the most significant reductions . We understand that the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions ( up to 98 percent ) come from the product life cycle , which is why decisions about the environmental attributes of our products are an integral aspect of all decisions related to the design and manufacture of those products . The same is true of all the environmental decisions for our facilities . Our integrated approach means that decisions about environmental issues are reviewed at the highest levels of the company . This structure has been an important factor in Apple's success , particularly in the area of environmental responsibility . Executive Team members regularly review each new product during its development , focusing on material and design choices , the supply chain , packaging , and product energy efficiency . Each of these areas has a direct impact on our environmental footprint . This strategy , which we 've been using for well over two decades , has yielded the most environmentally forward-looking product designs in our industry . Every product we offer meets the ENERGY STAR guidelines for energy efficiency , is free of harmful toxins , and is made of highly recyclable materials . Our facilities and operations teams also regularly review our programs and investments to reduce carbon emissions with Executive Team members . The results of these reviews include increased use of green power , new technology investments , commute programs , and conservation . The efforts of this team have produced the highest product recycling rate in our industry . Apple delivers important environmental attributes across all the company's products and product families . Not only does Apple deliver where others have only promised to do so in the future , Apple has delivered where it 's most meaningful . The Apple Executive Team is committed to our environmental strategy : to reduce our carbon footprint , to remove toxins , and to report on the environmental impact of every product we make so that our customers can measure our progress . We are also committed to reporting our global corporate emissions annually and to reporting at the product level with each new product introduction . Q : What is Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) ? A : LCA is a process of evaluating the effects that a product has on the environment throughout its life cycle . The objective of completing a full life cycle analysis is to improve resource efficiency while reducing the environmental impact of all activities required to manufacture , distribute , use , and dispose of a product . Cradle-to-grave life cycle assessments , for instance , begin with the extraction of raw materials from the earth , their transformation into finished materials , the manufacturing of materials into parts and products , transportation to end users , the energy consumed during use , and ultimately recycling . During each of these phases , activities occur that use materials and energy , generating waste and emissions . Life cycle assessment is the process used to accurately measure the emissions associated with each phase of these activities . LCA results are often categorized in several ways , including global warming potential , acidification , eutrophication , tropospheric ozone creation , and stratospheric ozone depletion . The procedures followed for life cycle assessment are defined as part of the internationally recognized ISO 14000 environmental management standards : in ISO 14040 : 2006 and 14044 : 2006 . Successful implementations of LCAs have been achieved in many industries , including automobile , airline , and consumer goods companies . For complex products and processes composed of several thousand materials , the analysis requires dedicated software applications designed to accurately capture the environmental impact of very specific processes . Software tools provide an efficient and objective assessment of the environmental impacts a company measures by using third-party databases created and updated by independent industrial engineers who are experts in specific manufacturing processes . Apple has found that a combination of data collected directly from our internal and supplier processes as well as independent third-party data sets achieves the most accurate results . Q : How does Apple use LCA ? A : Apple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA : 1 . Data collection starts with measuring the power consumed by a product while it is running under a simulated use scenario . Different scenarios are used for different product lines . For example , we assume a four-year average use period for Mac computers . To be conservative , we also assume an office scenario use pattern for every computer shipped and apply that use pattern to 365 days of use per year . For handheld products , such as iPod and iPhone , we assume a three-year use period . For these products , charging patterns are defined according to a "" power user , "" which we define as intense daily use over the three-year period . More information on our product power modes is provided in our Product Environmental Reports . 2 . The second step is a part-by-part measurement of the entire product . This helps us accurately measure the size and weight of the components and materials in the product . Since a single product can contain several hundred parts , this step is supported by double-checking individual part details with the product's bill of materials . We include material and component yield loss during production as part of this process . We also account for the transportation of materials between manufacturing sites . Production emissions for external accessories , such as keyboards and mice , and packaging are also included in this step . 3 . The third step assesses emissions from transportation of finished products to sales regions . Data is collected on single units and multipack units of product shipments as they are transported over land , by sea , and by air . The majority of the product transportation emissions are associated with getting the products from Asia to sales distribution hubs in Europe , Asia , and the Americas . The final leg of transport between regional hubs and individual customers is accounted for using an overall adjustment factor . 4 . The last step of the product life cycle measurement is the collection and recycling of the product when it reaches the end of its useful life . Transportation between customers and recycling plants along with the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal , plastic , and glass material streams are all accounted for in this calculation . Subsequent processing and smelting steps are not included as these are considered stages of production and not end-of-life processing . 5 . After we collect all the data , the final step is to run the product data model in our LCA tool and compile detailed results for GHG emissions as they relate to the product . The data and life cycle model used in the tool are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany . Q : Does Apple index its environmental performance data using Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines ( G3 ) ? A : Yes . Environmental performance data covering energy and water consumption , greenhouse gas emissions , and waste production is provided in the 2009 Facilities Report ( PDF ) . Q : What is ISO 14001 , and is Apple ISO 14001 certified ? A : ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard that establishes the requirements for an organization's environmental management system ( EMS ) . The ISO 14001 standard helps a company manage the environmental impact of its operations in a systematic way that is integrated with overall business management processes . Apple first achieved ISO 14001 certification for a manufacturing site in 1996 . Q : Does Apple ban environmentally sensitive substances ? A : Yes . Apple's Regulated Substances Specification details a broad range of substances that are restricted or banned from use in Apple products , packaging , and manufacturing . Q : Do Apple products contain lead ? A : Apple is in compliance with the European RoHS Directive , which restricts the use of lead and other substances . As a result of our precautionary approach to substances , Apple phased out lead in plastic parts , paint , and packaging material long before the RoHS Directive came into effect . Q : What are Apple's restrictions on brominated flame retardant-free ( BFR-free ) and polyvinyl chloride-free ( PVC-free ) products ? A : Apple defines a material as BFR-free and PVC-free if it contains less than 900 parts per million ( ppm ) of bromine and chlorine . The 900-ppm limit is one of the strictest in the electronics industry and a concentration lower than the ban on lead in the European RoHS Directive . Since BFRs and PVC need to be present in much higher quantities to be effective , most materials that contain less than 900-ppm bromine and chlorine do not have any detectable levels of bromine or chlorine present . Q : Which products are covered by Apple's BFR-free and PVC-free transition ? A : Apple's phaseout of BFRs and PVC covers all parts of new Apple product designs manufactured after December 31 , 2008 . The iPod nano , iPod classic , and iPod touch are examples of products that are BFR-free and PVC-free . While Apple's phaseout will cover the vast majority of products and components , older product designs , replacement parts , and accessories for older product designs may not be fully BFR-free and PVC-free . Q : What is REACH , and how is Apple complying with the REACH regulation ? A : The Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation EC 1907 / 2007 , commonly referred to as REACH , is a European regulation on chemicals and their safe use . With the publication of the candidate list for authorization on October 28 , 2008 , the European Chemicals Agency identified a set of substances of very high concern ( SVHC ) that manufacturers must disclose to customers if used in their products above 0.1 percent . Based on the current version of the candidate list for authorization , Apple products do not contain SVHC above 0.1 percent , with the exception of AC power cords . AC power cords used in Apple notebooks , desktops , servers , displays , Apple TV , AirPort Extreme , Time Capsule , and power adapters are made of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) that contains the SVHC bis 2-ethyl ( hexyl ) phthalate , also known as DEHP . Apple is in the final stages of developing and certifying PVC-free AC power cords that will also be free of DEHP . Q : Does Apple use ozone-depleting substances ? A : No ozone-depleting substances ( ODCs ) are used in any processes to manufacture components , materials , or product packaging materials used by Apple , as stipulated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer . Q : Does Apple have an Environmental Health and Safety Policy ? A : Apple is committed to protecting the environment , health , and safety of our employees , customers , and the global communities in which we operate . For more information , read our Environmental Health and Safety Policy statement ( PDF ) . Q : What happens to computers when they are recycled ? A : When you recycle with Apple , your used equipment is disassembled , and key components that can be reused are removed . Glass and metal can be reprocessed for use in new products . A majority of the plastics can be pelletized into a raw secondary material . With materials reprocessing and component reuse , Apple often achieves a 90 percent recovery rate by weight of the original product . Learn more about the Apple Recycling Program"	Promotion	Promotion
1595	- Tom Presland to send Leonard Cheshire policy re . sex to Tuppy - Discuss ways of targeting ' tops ' of organisations ( professional bodies , trusts / organisations ) to give permission for sex to be included on the disability agenda . Lorna and Tuppy to draft document for this . - Lorna has not contacted RNIB as yet . She will contact Wayne to find out who has replaced Christine Thomas and find out any progress that has been made in adding sex to the daily living section of the RNIB website . - Katie was unable to approach Peter White at the College of Occupational Therapists Conference in June . She will try and contact him via the BBC . - Victoria has circulated background information to SHADA members regarding policies around mental capacity / consent from her work in NYC . If anyone would like a copy , please contact Katie or Victoria ( tormc3@yahoo.com ) . Victoria will ask for permission for a summary of this policy to be posted on the Outsiders website . - Helena will arrange to meet John Blandford , who presented at this meeting for further discussion - Tuppy sent the number of a stripper – Solitaire - to Helena , following which Kate organised an event for 2 strippers to entertain residents ( who had chosen to attend ) at Chaseley Trust . The event went very well and Helena recommended Solitaire for anyone considering booking a stripper for their disabled clients . Although Chaseley Trust solicitors had suggested a music and dance license may have been required for this event , John Blandford disagreed and said a license was not necessary for such a one-off event . - Tuppy does not have a copy of Davina McColl's sex education in schools program – Lorna will try and get hold of a copy and circulate it . Background : Treloar College ( www.treloar.org.uk ) is a residential specialist college for physically and / or learning disabled young people , aged between 17 and 22 years old . Given this age range , the focus of the college is transition to adulthood . There are 175 students at the college , mostly residential . The College is funded by the Learning and Skills Council . Graham reported that the students enrolling at the College are presenting with increasingly complex needs . For example around 20 % have life-limiting conditions , and there are an increasing number of technologically-dependent students . Around 80 % are wheelchair users . In addition to physical disabilities , the young people at Treloar can also present with additional sensory impairments , epilepsy and overt mental health issues . Graham reported difficulties in accessing CAMHS services for students who had physical disabilities in addition to their mental health needs . There are 370 staff at the College including teams of therapists ( occupational therapists , physiotherapists and speech and language therapists ) as well as a health centre and links with local hospices . Many of the students at Treloar have been in mainstream education previously , and make a positive choice to come to Treloar as the College is able to take care of their disability needs , freeing them to focus on other things . Graham started working at Treloar in 1995 , with a background as a mental health social worker . At that time , there were two issues at the College – sexuality was not discussed , and there was a policy in place prohibiting intimate sexual contact within the grounds as well as a policy that students had to dress formally . As principal of the College at that time , Graham was approached by both students ( regarding lack of privacy ) and staff ( who felt exposed and unsure of their boundaries regarding student needs to express their sexuality ) . However as sexual expression and exploration were recognised as a key part of adolescence , Graham gathered a group of staff , students and parents , giving them the task of coming up with policies and procedures for students to express their sexuality . The policy was to be inclusive , covering gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender . The policy took a year to develop – it was called the SAFE policy . A barrister was then consulted regarding the issue of informed consent . The guidelines regarding implementation of the policy were very specific . Staff were able to opt out , but had to be neutral in doing so . Posters are placed around the College to promote the SAFE policy and student rights regarding sexual expression , and there is a supportive team in place . The SAFE policy is also in the student handbook and all parents / guardians are made aware of its existence when sending a child to the College . In a nutshell , if students are over 16 and are able to consent , they can engage in whatever they want to , as long as it is legal . Choices and risks are discussed with students , and teaching given on safe sex , but the final choice is left up to individual students . Students are encouraged to organise their own activities to develop their independence , including planning trips out of College . For example , one student organised his own visit to a massage parlour in Oxford . Graham has had no negative attitudes towards the SAFE policy recently , though some staff left when the policy was first introduced 8 years ago . Regarding issues of power between service users and staff , College staff can facilitate , support and enable but staff will not be involved in actually stimulating someone . Staff can position a person and support someone to get pornographic material or sex aids ( if they are over 18 ) , but have to make it clear to the individual that this material is strictly not to be seen by anyone under 18 years old . Staff also have to be very clear about boundaries . As yet , the College have not had any sex workers on site , due to legal concerns and concerns about repercussions . Graham sees having the chance to experiment with sex as part of the transition to adulthood . However the situation for young people with disabilities is different to those without disabilities . The relationship between parent and child is often skewed , with no secrecy allowed for the young person . Paradoxically , many young people may have had to make big decisions about their life such as operations , at a young age though are excluded from some roles such as having a Saturday job . At some point , parents have to address their child's emerging sexuality though many do not know how to approach this , and are grateful to the College for addressing the subject . In order to protect students , there are also guidelines for recognising when someone is being manipulated or harassed by other students . In addition , there are legislative safeguards including Protection of Children and Protection of Vulnerable Adults . In general , the SAFE policy has been a success and is a positive example of what can be done to enable sexual expression for young people with disabilities . - Contrary to Graham's positive comments from parents , others have experienced complaints from family members regarding enabling sex for older adults . Many disabled people had not been offered a chance for sexual expression before and relatives are reluctant to change the status quo . - Tuppy said most people join Outsiders when they are 30 years plus . This is perhaps because teenagers have other mainstream avenues to meet friends / partners . However Simone reported that Stars in the Sky have many young members who have not been successful in mainstream venues . - Consensus of opinion that permission to discuss sex needs to come from the ' top ' for this topic to be successfully embraced and addressed by staff , such as Graham as principal of Treloar College . For example , healthcare professionals need permission to discuss sex-related issues with clients , as this often has not been covered on their training . These professionals need the support of their governing body such as the Health Professions Council , etc. - Criminal law is much less of a threat to health care professionals than their governing body ... - No particular health professional who is responsible for addressing sex – usually relies on one person who is interested in this area to push the agenda , but no lasting effect . - Problem is that many health professionals do n't want to address sex ... Helena got a poor reception when she mentioned sex as part of recreation at the recent European Platform of Rehabilitation Services . - Possibly difficult for a non-disabled person to run training on sex and disability , as all disabled people have individual needs , and different areas of disability need different approaches . You ca n't necessarily clump together people with one disability and list the sexual problems that they all share , because they may not share the same problems . - George has set up an interest group re . sex and learning disabilities over the internet and has got a good response . - Can use sex workers to enable couples to have sex . Disabled people used to having someone else around so not as intrusive as it might seem . - Leonard Cheshire have policies regarding sex but they do n't seem to be used in practice . - We need a set of core values so people can use these to base their work around . ACTION Presentation : Ariana Chevalier – ' Sex Worker of the Year ' Ariana gave a very interesting presentation covering : Health benefits of a sexual outlet Ariana also spoke about her work generally including some of the more specialist areas she have developed , including Sensual Awakening / Tantra sessions , Holistic Sex Coaching ( sexual confidence and skill building ) and Practice Partner ( Relationship Development Skills ) . Please see handouts for further information . Discussion arising from presentation : - How to find a male sex worker : more difficult to find a straight male sex worker as most work with men . Regular search engines are not reliable – best to use TLC website – www.tlc-trust.org.uk The contents of this informative talk are covered in a paper , prepared by John that will accompany these minutes . However , there was one point that came up several times that is worth highlighting : It is NOT and NEVER HAS BEEN an offence ( under English law ) to call a sex worker either for yourself OR ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE as long as the person consents . Discussion point from presentation : - Even though it is legal to call a sex worker , the popular belief is that it is illegal and this will be difficult to challenge . Need to find a way around this . - Tuppy suggested that we compile a short hand-out which John Blandford endorses , to give out to people who do n't believe the above . Any Other Business - We need to prepare a mission statement for SHADA , to send with a press release to professional bodies , etc. - The highly commended book - ' Sex at the Margins – Migration , Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry ' by Laura Maria Agustin ( Zed Books 1988 ) demonstrates how many migrants are happy working in the sex industry and the real problem are the ' do-gooders ' who try to rescue them . - Ideas for new books : Ø One with different chapters for each talk at SHADA . It could cover visual impairment , sex workers , the law , Treloar College as an example of good practice , and Pru's experience as a sex worker with a learning disabled client . Ø A guide for sex workers who see disabled clients – could cover general information that would be useful , as long as it is clear that disabled people have very individual needs ( like all of us ) . - Training and supervision for sex workers : Ariana suggested the following could be implemented in the sex industry , as part of her vision for the future ~ Ø First aid as part of training for sex workers Ø Code of Conduct for Sex Workers including health and safety , boundaries Ø Network of sex workers to support each other and offer supervision - Idea of topic for Autumn meeting is ' Sex and Spina Bifida ' Venue , Time , Focus and Date of Next Meeting Ø Developing a mission statement for SHADA Ø Discussion of how to persuade people at ' the top ' to take sex seriously and allow us to do as we wish .

271	The Science Park has announced that it will start construction early next spring on a new facility at its Queen's Island headquarters , Belfast . The four-story , 40,000 sq ft building will join the Innovation Centre , ECIT and a 20,000 sq ft building due to open in summer 2005 . The new facility will be known as White Star House in recognition of the shipping line which commissioned Harland & Wolff to build the Titanic at Queen's Island over 90 years ago . Project architects on the scheme are Ferguson McIlveen . Commenting on the announcement , Norman Apsley , CEO of the Science Park said : ' This is another landmark stage in the Science Park's development . With 75 % of the Innovation Centre already let or committed , White Star House is a logical progression in the workspace package we can offer . ' While the Innovation Centre has units available in multiples of 2,000 sq ft , White Star House will provide larger units - from c . 5,000 sq ft up to a maximum 35,000 sq ft - providing space for ventures which outgrow the Innovation Centre as well as larger businesses . ' As with all the facilities being developed by the Science Park , the emphasis is upon providing flexible and sustainable space that adapts easily to occupants' changing needs . According to John Beattie , the Science Park's Operations Manager and concept designer of the facility , White Star House represents advanced building design thinking . ' This is an intelligent building with several innovative features that will help White Star House meet the requirements of the Carbon Trust's ' Low Carbon Design ' initiative and make it one of the Province's most environmentally friendly facilities . ' We 're planning to make use of ground water with a constant temperature of around 12 ° C to cool the building in summer and pre-heat the air for ventilation during the winter . ' Raised floors will provide a generous service void and a flexible method of providing heating and ventilation throughout the work areas . The intentionally exposed underside of the floor slabs will enable occupants to customise their space with the minimum of disruption . ' John Beattie also believes that White Star House will give occupants and the wider Science Park an exciting built environment : ' Although this is very much a working building , extensive use of glass will make it an interesting experience for both those within and without . Apart from stunning views of the Thompson Graving Dock and Belfast Lough , the building's occupants will also appreciate internal reflections of changing weather conditions outside . ' It 's also anticipated that the external appearance of White Star will change throughout the day as the glass reacts to different light conditions . The external view will be further enhanced by the building's translucent design which will provide emerging views of the interior as night falls . ' Heritage Michael Graham , Director of Real Estate , emphasised that sustainability and heritage considerations also helped shape the plans : ' Although White Star House is n't going to save the planet , it does represent an environmentally friendly approach to building design which will hopefully become the norm rather than the exception . ' Despite this very modern approach , we 're also conscious of the site's historical legacy . To reinforce the Titanic memory , its entrance will be flanked by three exposed bow-shaped support pillars housing the building's elevators - each the same height as the bows of the Titanic and her sister ships , Britannic and Olympic . ' White Star Line will forever be associated with Belfast and the Olympic class ships built here . The building will be a permanent reminder of the technological excellence associated with Queen's Island and I 'm looking forward to it hosting a new generation of innovators when it opens in 2006 .

1624	Los Angeles TMJ pain relief a joint effort The joints at the back of the jaw are used in every oral activity . These joints slide from side to side to facilitate chewing and speaking . They open and close , and move forward and back to facilitate breathing as well . Under certain circumstances , such as tooth grinding or clenching , the temporomandibular joints , and the muscles that surround them , can become dysfunctional . For some , the symptoms of TMJ disorder are mild , and disappear within a few weeks . However , there are people for whom TMJ becomes chronic , often gradually worsening . We encourage our Los Angeles area patients to seek TMJ pain relief with a combination of self-care and professional treatment with a customized oral appliance . Steps that can be taken at home include : Applying both heat and ice , alternating between the two . Moist heat can alleviate pain and increase function of irritated joints and muscles . Periodic application of ice packs promotes decrease inflammation and slightly numbing sore muscles , while heat packs increase circulation and promotes healing . Neither heat nor ice should be applied directly to skin . Instead , wrap in a thin towel and keep it on for no more than 15 minutes at a time . Discomfort from TMJ disorder can be reduced with over the counter anti-inflammatory medication . These should not take the place of other remedies , which are aimed at relieving pressure and undue stress on affected joints . If symptoms do not improve with over the counter medication , it is best to contact our office for professional treatment . Learning to relax specific muscles . Part of the issue with TMJ disorder is tension . You can learn to relax the muscles of the face , neck , and shoulders to decrease symptoms and provide rest for the jaw . Specifically , train yourself to fall into a relaxed state where teeth are apart and lips are loose . Downtown Dental has the expertise and technology to treat TMJ disorder in a non-invasive manner .

1661	"Oscar De La Hoya vs. Manny Pacquiao , also billed as The Dream Match , was a professional boxing welterweight superfight . The bout took place on December 6 , 2008 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena , Las Vegas , Nevada , United States . Pacquiao defeated De La Hoya via technical knockout when De La Hoya decided not to continue with the fight before the start of the ninth round . The card was a co-production of Bob Arum ' s Top Rank Boxing and De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions and was aired live on pay-per-view ( PPV ) on HBO PPV . The fight is notable for propelling Manny Pacquiao to full-blown superstar status in much of the western world ( mostly in The United States ) , as Oscar De La Hoya symbolically "" passed the torch "" , so to speak , to Pacquiao . Despite no title belts being disputed , the bout received a lot of publicity since the two boxers were decorated , with Pacquiao being the current number one pound for pound boxer in the world as judged by The Ring , and a five-time world champion in five different weight divisions ( Pacquiao was the reigning WBC lightweight champion at the time of the bout ) . Meanwhile , De La Hoya was an Olympic gold medalist and past holder of 10 world titles in six weight divisions . Pacquiao had to step up two weight divisions ( from lightweight ) , and De La Hoya had to go down one weight division ( from light middleweight ) , to be eligible for the bout's welterweight division . The ideas of having De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight came from HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant talking with ESPN boxing analyst Dan Rafael . Larry then presented the idea to Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum . Bob presented the idea to Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach . It was even mentioned on the PPV broadcast that it was Larry's idea , even mentioning Dan Rafael by name . Freddie Roach since the De La Hoya - Mayweather fight has said in the media and in the De La Hoya / Pacquiao 24 / 7 series , press conferences , promos leading to the Dream Match that Oscar "" ca n't pull the trigger anymore . "" After De La Hoya's May 5 loss to Floyd Mayweather , Jr. in 2007 ( see De La Hoya-Mayweather boxing match ) , De La Hoya decided to close out his career with three fights in 2008 . The first would be a tune-up bout in May before finishing with two mega bouts in September and December respectively . De La Hoya defeated Stevie Forbes in the May tune-up bout in preparation for Mayweather . Due to Mayweather's unexpected retirement however , Ricky Hatton was the new potential candidate to fight De La Hoya on September 20 . However , Hatton rejected the offer because he felt the scheduled date was too close to his last bout . De La Hoya then decided to pass on a fight in September to set the stage for a showdown against either Manny Pacquiao or Miguel Cotto , should Cotto win his fight against Antonio Margarito in July . After Cotto was defeated by Margarito , it was announced that De La Hoya and Pound For Pound superstar Manny Pacquiao had agreed to fight December 6 , 2008 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas at the welterweight limit of 147 lbs. On August 28 , 2008 , a teleconference was held by Golden Boy Promotions to officially announce the fight . Presented by Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank , Inc. , the bout was scheduled as a 12-round , non-title fight contested at the 147-pound welterweight limit . Although Pacquiao went into the fight recognized as the leading pound-for-pound boxer in the world , some boxing pundits speculated that 147 pounds could be too far above his natural weight against the larger De La Hoya . Many boxing analysts believed the fight would favor Oscar . Boxing analysts stated that Oscar's size , reach , experience , and good chin made Manny the underdog in this mega fight . Training for the fight Oscar hired trainers Angelo Dundee , Ignacio "" Nacho "" Beristain , and young boxing talent Edwin Valero . Oscar told the news that his team is unbeatable , while Freddie Roach said , "" No one is going to be able to help Oscar pull the trigger when he faces Manny Pacquiao on Dec. 6 "" . Tickets reportedly sold out just hours after they went on sale . The total gate revenues were said to be nearly $ 17 million . That amount apparently gave the bout the second-largest gate revenue in boxing history ( after the De La Hoya-Mayweather Jr. fight on May 5 , 2007 which generated $ 18 . 4 million in gate revenue ) . Manny Pacquiao soundly defeated Oscar De La Hoya , surprising many pre-fight analysts who had predicted a victory by De La Hoya . The fight ended at the beginning of the 9th round after Oscar and his corner threw in the towel . On round 1 , De La Hoya's opening punches miss Pacquiao ; Pacquiao's own straight left followed by a combination connects . The boxers exchange punches , with another Pacquiao straight left to end the round . At the start of the second round , a double jab by De La Hoya persuades Pacquiao to retreat . Only the second of De La Hoya's two combinations hits Pacquiao . A combo from Pacquiao leaves De La Hoya's face reddened . A flurry of punches from Pacquiao ends the round . The third round is more of the same as De La Hoya becomes increasingly unable to answer Pacquiao's combos . Pacquiao unleashes a flurry of punches in round 5 ; De La Hoya saw it coming but was n't able to react fast enough . De La Hoya himself lands a body shot and a couple of hooks , but the two boxers exchange punches at the end of the round . The next round begins as the last ended , with the men exchanging jabs . Pacquiao appears winded as he misses a left hook , but the follow-up lands on target . Pacquiao lands a right , and a four-punch combo to end the round . In Round 7 , Pacquiao lands a jab as De La Hoya misses his ; Pacquiao unleashes another flurry of punches as De La Hoya's legs almost gave out , just as he ceased punching back . His uppercut misses Pacquiao as his opponent releases more jabs to end round 7 . Pacquiao pursues De La Hoya's body but is warned by referee Tony Weeks to "" keep them up "" ( keep punches above the belt ) . De La Hoya's right connects , but Pacquiao's combo pins De La Hoya in the corner . Another left by Pacquiao dazes the Mexican-American , as the Filipino follows up with another combination which wobbles De La Hoya . Pacquiao throws another combo as De La Hoya goes for the body . The Filipino unleashes a four-punch combo to end the round . The fight is stopped before the start of the ninth round and Pacquiao is awarded the victory . Pacquiao was ahead on all three judges' scorecards before the stoppage , with two judges scoring the fight at 80-71 ( Pacquiao won all rounds ) and one scoring it at 79 – 72 ( Pacquiao won 7 rounds and lost 1 ) . After the bout trainer Freddie Roach stated , "" We knew we had him after the first round . He had no legs , he was hesitant and he was shot . "" Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he 'd grown too old , De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach , "" You 're right Freddie . I do n't have it anymore . "" When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting , De La Hoya responded , "" My heart still wants to fight , that 's for sure . But when your physical does n't respond , what can you do ? I have to be smart and make sure I think about my future plans . "" On December 10 , 2008 , HBO announced that the fight generated 1.25 million PPV buys totalling more than $ 70 million in PPV revenue . This fight was only the fourth non-heavyweight bout to have more than one million buys at that time , along with De La Hoya – Mayweather Jr. ( 2 . 4 million buys ) in May 2007 , De La Hoya – Hopkins ( 1 million buys ) in 2004 , and De La Hoya – Trinidad ( 1 . 4 million buys ) in 1999 .

1651	"Sir Isaac Newton , ( born December 25 , 1642 , Woolsthorpe , Lincolnshire , England – died March 20 , 1727 , London ) , English physicist and mathematician , who was the culminating figure of the scientific revolution of the 17th century . In optics , his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics . In mechanics , his three laws of motion , the basic principles of modern physics , resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation . In mathematics , he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus . Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , 1687 ) was one of the most important single works in the history of modern science . Sir Isaac Newton's formulation of the law of universal gravitation . Isaac Newton , portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller , 1689 . Formative influences Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe , Newton was the only son of a local yeoman , also Isaac Newton , who had died three months before , and of Hannah Ayscough . That same year , at Arcetri near Florence , Galileo Galilei had died ; Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition . A tiny and weak baby , Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life , much less 84 years . Deprived of a father before birth , he soon lost his mother as well , for within two years she married a second time ; her husband , the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith , left young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters . For nine years , until the death of Barnabas Smith in 1653 , Isaac was effectively separated from his mother , and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this traumatic event . That he hated his stepfather we may be sure . When he examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand , he remembered "" Threatning my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them . "" The acute sense of insecurity that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be traced to his early years . After his mother was widowed a second time , she determined that her first-born son should manage her now considerable property . It quickly became apparent , however , that this would be a disaster , both for the estate and for Newton . He could not bring himself to concentrate on rural affairs – set to watch the cattle , he would curl up under a tree with a book . Fortunately , the mistake was recognized , and Newton was sent back to the grammar school in Grantham , where he had already studied , to prepare for the university . As with many of the leading scientists of the age , he left behind in Grantham anecdotes about his mechanical ability and his skill in building models of machines , such as clocks and windmills . At the school he apparently gained a firm command of Latin but probably received no more than a smattering of arithmetic . By June 1661 , he was ready to matriculate at Trinity College , Cambridge , somewhat older than the other undergraduates because of his interrupted education . Influence of the scientific revolution When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661 , the movement now known as the scientific revolution was well advanced , and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared . Astronomers from Copernicus to Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe . Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia . Led by Descartes , philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate , impersonal , and inert machine . Yet as far as the universities of Europe , including Cambridge , were concerned , all this might well have never happened . They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism , which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms . Like thousands of other undergraduates , Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle's work . Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum , it was in the air . Some time during his undergraduate career , Newton discovered the works of the French natural philosopher René Descartes and the other mechanical philosophers , who , in contrast to Aristotle , viewed physical reality as composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and who held that all the phenomena of nature result from their mechanical interaction . A new set of notes , which he entitled "" Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae "" ( "" Certain Philosophical Questions "" ) , begun sometime in 1664 , usurped the unused pages of a notebook intended for traditional scholastic exercises ; under the title he entered the slogan "" Amicus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis amica veritas "" ( "" Plato is my friend , Aristotle is my friend , but my best friend is truth "" ) . Newton's scientific career had begun . The "" Quaestiones "" reveal that Newton had discovered the new conception of nature that provided the framework of the scientific revolution . He had thoroughly mastered the works of Descartes and had also discovered that the French philosopher Pierre Gassendi had revived atomism , an alternative mechanical system to explain nature . The "" Quaestiones "" also reveal that Newton already was inclined to find the latter a more attractive philosophy than Cartesian natural philosophy , which rejected the existence of ultimate indivisible particles . The works of the 17th-century chemist Robert Boyle provided the foundation for Newton's considerable work in chemistry . Significantly , he had read Henry More , the Cambridge Platonist , and was thereby introduced to another intellectual world , the magical Hermetic tradition , which sought to explain natural phenomena in terms of alchemical and magical concepts . The two traditions of natural philosophy , the mechanical and the Hermetic , antithetical though they appear , continued to influence his thought and in their tension supplied the fundamental theme of his scientific career . Although he did not record it in the "" Quaestiones , "" Newton had also begun his mathematical studies . He again started with Descartes , from whose La Géometrie he branched out into the other literature of modern analysis with its application of algebraic techniques to problems of geometry . He then reached back for the support of classical geometry . Within little more than a year , he had mastered the literature ; and , pursuing his own line of analysis , he began to move into new territory . He discovered the binomial theorem , and he developed the calculus , a more powerful form of analysis that employs infinitesimal considerations in finding the slopes of curves and areas under curves . By 1669 Newton was ready to write a tract summarizing his progress , De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas ( "" On Analysis by Infinite Series "" ) , which circulated in manuscript through a limited circle and made his name known . During the next two years he revised it as De methodis serierum et fluxionum ( "" On the Methods of Series and Fluxions "" ) . The word fluxions , Newton's private rubric , indicates that the calculus had been born . Despite the fact that only a handful of savants were even aware of Newton's existence , he had arrived at the point where he had become the leading mathematician in Europe . Work during the plague years When Newton received the bachelor's degree in April 1665 , the most remarkable undergraduate career in the history of university education had passed unrecognized . On his own , without formal guidance , he had sought out the new philosophy and the new mathematics and made them his own , but he had confined the progress of his studies to his notebooks . Then , in 1665 , the plague closed the university , and for most of the following two years he was forced to stay at his home , contemplating at leisure what he had learned . During the plague years Newton laid the foundations of the calculus and extended an earlier insight into an essay , "" Of Colours , "" which contains most of the ideas elaborated in his Opticks . It was during this time that he examined the elements of circular motion and , applying his analysis to the Moon and the planets , derived the inverse square relation that the radially directed force acting on a planet decreases with the square of its distance from the Sun – which was later crucial to the law of universal gravitation . The world heard nothing of these discoveries . Career The optics Inaugural lectures at Trinity Newton was elected to a fellowship in Trinity College in 1667 , after the university reopened . Two years later , Isaac Barrow , Lucasian professor of mathematics , who had transmitted Newton's De Analysi to John Collins in London , resigned the chair to devote himself to divinity and recommended Newton to succeed him . The professorship exempted Newton from the necessity of tutoring but imposed the duty of delivering an annual course of lectures . He chose the work he had done in optics as the initial topic ; during the following three years ( 1670 – 72 ) , his lectures developed the essay "" Of Colours "" into a form which was later revised to become Book One of his Opticks . Title page from an edition of Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks . Beginning with Kepler's Paralipomena in 1604 , the study of optics had been a central activity of the scientific revolution . Descartes's statement of the sine law of refraction , relating the angles of incidence and emergence at interfaces of the media through which light passes , had added a new mathematical regularity to the science of light , supporting the conviction that the universe is constructed according to mathematical regularities . Descartes had also made light central to the mechanical philosophy of nature ; the reality of light , he argued , consists of motion transmitted through a material medium . Newton fully accepted the mechanical nature of light , although he chose the atomistic alternative and held that light consists of material corpuscles in motion . The corpuscular conception of light was always a speculative theory on the periphery of his optics , however . The core of Newton's contribution had to do with colours . An ancient theory extending back at least to Aristotle held that a certain class of colour phenomena , such as the rainbow , arises from the modification of light , which appears white in its pristine form . Descartes had generalized this theory for all colours and translated it into mechanical imagery . Through a series of experiments performed in 1665 and 1666 , in which the spectrum of a narrow beam was projected onto the wall of a darkened chamber , Newton denied the concept of modification and replaced it with that of analysis . Basically , he denied that light is simple and homogeneous – stating instead that it is complex and heterogeneous and that the phenomena of colours arise from the analysis of the heterogeneous mixture into its simple components . The ultimate source of Newton's conviction that light is corpuscular was his recognition that individual rays of light have immutable properties ; in his view , such properties imply immutable particles of matter . He held that individual rays ( that is , particles of given size ) excite sensations of individual colours when they strike the retina of the eye . He also concluded that rays refract at distinct angles – hence , the prismatic spectrum , a beam of heterogeneous rays , i.e. , alike incident on one face of a prism , separated or analyzed by the refraction into its component parts – and that phenomena such as the rainbow are produced by refractive analysis . Because he believed that chromatic aberration could never be eliminated from lenses , Newton turned to reflecting telescopes ; he constructed the first ever built . The heterogeneity of light has been the foundation of physical optics since his time . Sir Isaac Newton dispersing sunlight through a prism for a study of optics , engraving after a ... There is no evidence that the theory of colours , fully described by Newton in his inaugural lectures at Cambridge , made any impression , just as there is no evidence that aspects of his mathematics and the content of the Principia , also pronounced from the podium , made any impression . Rather , the theory of colours , like his later work , was transmitted to the world through the Royal Society of London , which had been organized in 1660 . When Newton was appointed Lucasian professor , his name was probably unknown in the Royal Society ; in 1671 , however , they heard of his reflecting telescope and asked to see it . Pleased by their enthusiastic reception of the telescope and by his election to the society , Newton volunteered a paper on light and colours early in 1672 . On the whole , the paper was also well received , although a few questions and some dissent were heard . Controversy Among the most important dissenters to Newton's paper was Robert Hooke , one of the leaders of the Royal Society who considered himself the master in optics and hence he wrote a condescending critique of the unknown parvenu . One can understand how the critique would have annoyed a normal man . The flaming rage it provoked , with the desire publicly to humiliate Hooke , however , bespoke the abnormal . Newton was unable rationally to confront criticism . Less than a year after submitting the paper , he was so unsettled by the give and take of honest discussion that he began to cut his ties , and he withdrew into virtual isolation . In 1675 , during a visit to London , Newton thought he heard Hooke accept his theory of colours . He was emboldened to bring forth a second paper , an examination of the colour phenomena in thin films , which was identical to most of Book Two as it later appeared in the Opticks . The purpose of the paper was to explain the colours of solid bodies by showing how light can be analyzed into its components by reflection as well as refraction . His explanation of the colours of bodies has not survived , but the paper was significant in demonstrating for the first time the existence of periodic optical phenomena . He discovered the concentric coloured rings in the thin film of air between a lens and a flat sheet of glass ; the distance between these concentric rings ( Newton's rings ) depends on the increasing thickness of the film of air . In 1704 Newton combined a revision of his optical lectures with the paper of 1675 and a small amount of additional material in his Opticks . A second piece which Newton had sent with the paper of 1675 provoked new controversy . Entitled "" An Hypothesis Explaining the Properties of Light , "" it was in fact a general system of nature . Hooke apparently claimed that Newton had stolen its content from him , and Newton boiled over again . The issue was quickly controlled , however , by an exchange of formal , excessively polite letters that fail to conceal the complete lack of warmth between the men . Newton was also engaged in another exchange on his theory of colours with a circle of English Jesuits in Liège , perhaps the most revealing exchange of all . Although their objections were shallow , their contention that his experiments were mistaken lashed him into a fury . The correspondence dragged on until 1678 , when a final shriek of rage from Newton , apparently accompanied by a complete nervous breakdown , was followed by silence . The death of his mother the following year completed his isolation . For six years he withdrew from intellectual commerce except when others initiated a correspondence , which he always broke off as quickly as possible . Influence of the Hermetic tradition During his time of isolation , Newton was greatly influenced by the Hermetic tradition with which he had been familiar since his undergraduate days . Newton , always somewhat interested in alchemy , now immersed himself in it , copying by hand treatise after treatise and collating them to interpret their arcane imagery . Under the influence of the Hermetic tradition , his conception of nature underwent a decisive change . Until that time , Newton had been a mechanical philosopher in the standard 17th-century style , explaining natural phenomena by the motions of particles of matter . Thus , he held that the physical reality of light is a stream of tiny corpuscles diverted from its course by the presence of denser or rarer media . He felt that the apparent attraction of tiny bits of paper to a piece of glass that has been rubbed with cloth results from an ethereal effluvium that streams out of the glass and carries the bits of paper back with it . This mechanical philosophy denied the possibility of action at a distance ; as with static electricity , it explained apparent attractions away by means of invisible ethereal mechanisms . Newton's "" Hypothesis of Light "" of 1675 , with its universal ether , was a standard mechanical system of nature . Some phenomena , such as the capacity of chemicals to react only with certain others , puzzled him , however , and he spoke of a "" secret principle "" by which substances are "" sociable "" or "" unsociable "" with others . About 1679 , Newton abandoned the ether and its invisible mechanisms and began to ascribe the puzzling phenomena – chemical affinities , the generation of heat in chemical reactions , surface tension in fluids , capillary action , the cohesion of bodies , and the like – to attractions and repulsions between particles of matter . More than 35 years later , in the second English edition of the Opticks , Newton accepted an ether again , although it was an ether that embodied the concept of action at a distance by positing a repulsion between its particles . The attractions and repulsions of Newton's speculations were direct transpositions of the occult sympathies and antipathies of Hermetic philosophy – as mechanical philosophers never ceased to protest . Newton , however , regarded them as a modification of the mechanical philosophy that rendered it subject to exact mathematical treatment . As he conceived of them , attractions were quantitatively defined , and they offered a bridge to unite the two basic themes of 17th-century science – the mechanical tradition , which had dealt primarily with verbal mechanical imagery , and the Pythagorean tradition , which insisted on the mathematical nature of reality . Newton's reconciliation through the concept of force was his ultimate contribution to science . The Principia Planetary motion Newton originally applied the idea of attractions and repulsions solely to the range of terrestrial phenomena mentioned in the preceding paragraph . But late in 1679 , not long after he had embraced the concept , another application was suggested in a letter from Hooke , who was seeking to renew correspondence . Hooke mentioned his analysis of planetary motion – in effect , the continuous diversion of a rectilinear motion by a central attraction . Newton bluntly refused to correspond but , nevertheless , went on to mention an experiment to demonstrate the rotation of Earth : let a body be dropped from a tower ; because the tangential velocity at the top of the tower is greater than that at the foot , the body should fall slightly to the east . He sketched the path of fall as part of a spiral ending at the centre of Earth . This was a mistake , as Hooke pointed out ; according to Hooke's theory of planetary motion , the path should be elliptical , so that if Earth were split and separated to allow the body to fall , it would rise again to its original location . Newton did not like being corrected , least of all by Hooke , but he had to accept the basic point ; he corrected Hooke's figure , however , using the assumption that gravity is constant . Hooke then countered by replying that , although Newton's figure was correct for constant gravity , his own assumption was that gravity decreases as the square of the distance . Several years later , this letter became the basis for Hooke's charge of plagiarism . He was mistaken in the charge . His knowledge of the inverse square relation rested only on intuitive grounds ; he did not derive it properly from the quantitative statement of centripetal force and Kepler's third law , which relates the periods of planets to the radii of their orbits . Moreover , unknown to him , Newton had so derived the relation more than 10 years earlier . Nevertheless , Newton later confessed that the correspondence with Hooke led him to demonstrate that an elliptical orbit entails an inverse square attraction to one focus – one of the two crucial propositions on which the law of universal gravitation would ultimately rest . What is more , Hooke's definition of orbital motion – in which the constant action of an attracting body continuously pulls a planet away from its inertial path – suggested a cosmic application for Newton's concept of force and an explanation of planetary paths employing it . In 1679 and 1680 , Newton dealt only with orbital dynamics ; he had not yet arrived at the concept of universal gravitation . Title page from Isaac Newton's De Philosophiae Naturalis Principia ... Courtesy of the Joseph Regenstein Library , The University of Chicago Universal gravitation Nearly five years later , in August 1684 , Newton was visited by the British astronomer Edmond Halley , who was also troubled by the problem of orbital dynamics . Upon learning that Newton had solved the problem , he extracted Newton's promise to send the demonstration . Three months later he received a short tract entitled De Motu ( "" On Motion "" ) . Already Newton was at work improving and expanding it . In two and a half years , the tract De Motu grew into Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica , which is not only Newton's masterpiece but also the fundamental work for the whole of modern science . Significantly , De Motu did not state the law of universal gravitation . For that matter , even though it was a treatise on planetary dynamics , it did not contain any of the three Newtonian laws of motion . Only when revising De Motu did Newton embrace the principle of inertia ( the first law ) and arrive at the second law of motion . The second law , the force law , proved to be a precise quantitative statement of the action of the forces between bodies that had become the central members of his system of nature . By quantifying the concept of force , the second law completed the exact quantitative mechanics that has been the paradigm of natural science ever since . The quantitative mechanics of the Principia is not to be confused with the mechanical philosophy . The latter was a philosophy of nature that attempted to explain natural phenomena by means of imagined mechanisms among invisible particles of matter . The mechanics of the Principia was an exact quantitative description of the motions of visible bodies . It rested on Newton's three laws of motion : ( 1 ) that a body remains in its state of rest unless it is compelled to change that state by a force impressed on it ; ( 2 ) that the change of motion ( the change of velocity times the mass of the body ) is proportional to the force impressed ; ( 3 ) that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . The analysis of circular motion in terms of these laws yielded a formula of the quantitative measure , in terms of a body's velocity and mass , of the centripetal force necessary to divert a body from its rectilinear path into a given circle . When Newton substituted this formula into Kepler's third law , he found that the centripetal force holding the planets in their given orbits about the Sun must decrease with the square of the planets' distances from the Sun . Because the satellites of Jupiter also obey Kepler's third law , an inverse square centripetal force must also attract them to the centre of their orbits . Newton was able to show that a similar relation holds between Earth and its Moon . The distance of the Moon is approximately 60 times the radius of Earth . Newton compared the distance by which the Moon , in its orbit of known size , is diverted from a tangential path in one second with the distance that a body at the surface of Earth falls from rest in one second . When the latter distance proved to be 3,600 ( 60 × 60 ) times as great as the former , he concluded that one and the same force , governed by a single quantitative law , is operative in all three cases , and from the correlation of the Moon's orbit with the measured acceleration of gravity on the surface of Earth , he applied the ancient Latin word gravitas ( literally , "" heaviness "" or "" weight "" ) to it . The law of universal gravitation , which he also confirmed from such further phenomena as the tides and the orbits of comets , states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres . When the Royal Society received the completed manuscript of Book I in 1686 , Hooke raised the cry of plagiarism , a charge that can not be sustained in any meaningful sense . On the other hand , Newton's response to it reveals much about him . Hooke would have been satisfied with a generous acknowledgment ; it would have been a graceful gesture to a sick man already well into his decline , and it would have cost Newton nothing . Newton , instead , went through his manuscript and eliminated nearly every reference to Hooke . Such was his fury that he refused either to publish his Opticks or to accept the presidency of the Royal Society until Hooke was dead . International prominence The Principia immediately raised Newton to international prominence . In their continuing loyalty to the mechanical ideal , Continental scientists rejected the idea of action at a distance for a generation , but even in their rejection they could not withhold their admiration for the technical expertise revealed by the work . Young British scientists spontaneously recognized him as their model . Within a generation the limited number of salaried positions for scientists in England , such as the chairs at Oxford , Cambridge , and Gresham College , were monopolized by the young Newtonians of the next generation . Newton , whose only close contacts with women were his unfulfilled relationship with his mother , who had seemed to abandon him , and his later guardianship of a niece , found satisfaction in the role of patron to the circle of young scientists . His friendship with Fatio de Duillier , a Swiss-born mathematician resident in London who shared Newton's interests , was the most profound experience of his adult life . Warden of the mint Almost immediately following the Principia ' s publication , Newton , a fervent if unorthodox Protestant , helped to lead the resistance of Cambridge to James II ' s attempt to Catholicize it . As a consequence , he was elected to represent the university in the convention that arranged the revolutionary settlement . In this capacity , he made the acquaintance of a broader group , including the philosopher John Locke . Newton tasted the excitement of London life in the aftermath of the Principia . The great bulk of his creative work had been completed . He was never again satisfied with the academic cloister , and his desire to change was whetted by Fatio's suggestion that he find a position in London . Seek a place he did , especially through the agency of his friend , the rising politician Charles Montague , later Lord Halifax . Finally , in 1696 , he was appointed warden of the mint . Although he did not resign his Cambridge appointments until 1701 , he moved to London and henceforth centred his life there . In the meantime , Newton's relations with Fatio had undergone a crisis . Fatio was taken seriously ill ; then family and financial problems threatened to call him home to Switzerland . Newton's distress knew no limits . In 1693 he suggested that Fatio move to Cambridge , where Newton would support him , but nothing came of the proposal . Through early 1693 the intensity of Newton's letters built almost palpably , and then , without surviving explanation , both the close relationship and the correspondence broke off . Four months later , without prior notice , Samuel Pepys and John Locke , both personal friends of Newton , received wild , accusatory letters . Pepys was informed that Newton would see him no more ; Locke was charged with trying to entangle him with women . Both men were alarmed for Newton's sanity ; and , in fact , Newton had suffered at least his second nervous breakdown . The crisis passed , and Newton recovered his stability . Only briefly did he ever return to sustained scientific work , however , and the move to London was the effective conclusion of his creative activity . As warden and then master of the mint , Newton drew a large income , as much as £ 2 , 000 per annum . Added to his personal estate , the income left him a rich man at his death . The position , regarded as a sinecure , was treated otherwise by Newton . During the great recoinage , there was need for him to be actively in command ; even afterward , however , he chose to exercise himself in the office . Above all , he was interested in counterfeiting . He became the terror of London counterfeiters , sending a goodly number to the gallows and finding in them a socially acceptable target on which to vent the rage that continued to well up within him . Interest in religion and theology Newton found time now to explore other interests , such as religion and theology . In the early 1690s he had sent Locke a copy of a manuscript attempting to prove that Trinitarian passages in the Bible were latter-day corruptions of the original text . When Locke made moves to publish it , Newton withdrew in fear that his anti-Trinitarian views would become known . In his later years , he devoted much time to the interpretation of the prophecies of Daniel and St. John , and to a closely related study of ancient chronology . Both works were published after his death . Leader of English science In London , Newton assumed the role of patriarch of English science . In 1703 he was elected President of the Royal Society . Four years earlier , the French Académie des Sciences ( Academy of Sciences ) had named him one of eight foreign associates . In 1705 Queen Anne knighted him , the first occasion on which a scientist was so honoured . Newton ruled the Royal Society magisterially . John Flamsteed , the Astronomer Royal , had occasion to feel that he ruled it tyrannically . In his years at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich , Flamsteed , who was a difficult man in his own right , had collected an unrivalled body of data . Newton had received needed information from him for the Principia , and in the 1690s , as he worked on the lunar theory , he again required Flamsteed's data . Annoyed when he could not get all the information he wanted as quickly as he wanted it , Newton assumed a domineering and condescending attitude toward Flamsteed . As president of the Royal Society , he used his influence with the government to be named as chairman of a body of "" visitors "" responsible for the Royal Observatory ; then he tried to force the immediate publication of Flamsteed's catalog of stars . The disgraceful episode continued for nearly 10 years . Newton would brook no objections . He broke agreements that he had made with Flamsteed . Flamsteed's observations , the fruit of a lifetime of work , were , in effect , seized despite his protests and prepared for the press by his mortal enemy , Edmond Halley . Flamsteed finally won his point and by court order had the printed catalog returned to him before it was generally distributed . He burned the printed sheets , and his assistants brought out an authorized version after his death . In this respect , and at considerable cost to himself , Flamsteed was one of the few men to best Newton . Newton sought his revenge by systematically eliminating references to Flamsteed's help in later editions of the Principia . Sir Isaac Newton in an engraving by Jacobus Houbraken , after an oil portrait by Sir Godfrey ... In Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , the German philosopher and mathematician , Newton met a contestant more of his own calibre . It is now well established that Newton developed the calculus before Leibniz seriously pursued mathematics . It is almost universally agreed that Leibniz later arrived at the calculus independently . There has never been any question that Newton did not publish his method of fluxions ; thus , it was Leibniz's paper in 1684 that first made the calculus a matter of public knowledge . In the Principia Newton hinted at his method , but he did not really publish it until he appended two papers to the Opticks in 1704 . By then the priority controversy was already smouldering . If , indeed , it mattered , it would be impossible finally to assess responsibility for the ensuing fracas . What began as mild innuendoes rapidly escalated into blunt charges of plagiarism on both sides . Egged on by followers anxious to win a reputation under his auspices , Newton allowed himself to be drawn into the centre of the fray ; and , once his temper was aroused by accusations of dishonesty , his anger was beyond constraint . Leibniz's conduct of the controversy was not pleasant , and yet it paled beside that of Newton . Although he never appeared in public , Newton wrote most of the pieces that appeared in his defense , publishing them under the names of his young men , who never demurred . As president of the Royal Society , he appointed an "" impartial "" committee to investigate the issue , secretly wrote the report officially published by the society , and reviewed it anonymously in the Philosophical Transactions . Even Leibniz's death could not allay Newton's wrath , and he continued to pursue the enemy beyond the grave . The battle with Leibniz , the irrepressible need to efface the charge of dishonesty , dominated the final 25 years of Newton's life . It obtruded itself continually upon his consciousness . Almost any paper on any subject from those years is apt to be interrupted by a furious paragraph against the German philosopher , as he honed the instruments of his fury ever more keenly . In the end , only Newton's death ended his wrath . Sir Isaac Newton , a portrait by John Vanderbank ; in the collection of the Royal Astronomical ... Final years During his final years Newton brought out further editions of his central works . After the first edition of the Opticks in 1704 , which merely published work done 30 years before , he published a Latin edition in 1706 and a second English edition in 1717 – 18 . In both , the central text was scarcely touched , but he did expand the "" Queries "" at the end into the final statement of his speculations on the nature of the universe . The second edition of the Principia , edited by Roger Cotes in 1713 , introduced extensive alterations . A third edition , edited by Henry Pemberton in 1726 , added little more . Until nearly the end , Newton presided at the Royal Society ( frequently dozing through the meetings ) and supervised the mint .

36	"Luke 1 Introduction 1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled [ a ] among us , 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word . 3 Therefore , since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning , it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus , 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught . The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold 5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah , who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah ; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron . 6 Both of them were upright in the sight of God , observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly . 7 But they had no children , because Elizabeth was barren ; and they were both well along in years . 8 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God , 9 he was chosen by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense . 10 And when the time for the burning of incense came , all the assembled worshipers were praying outside . 11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar of incense . 12 When Zechariah saw him , he was startled and was gripped with fear . 13 But the angel said to him : "" Do not be afraid , Zechariah ; your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you are to give him the name John . 14 He will be a joy and delight to you , and many will rejoice because of his birth , 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord . He is never to take wine or other fermented drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth . [ b ] 16 Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God . 17 And he will go on before the Lord , in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous – to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . "" 18 Zechariah asked the angel , "" How can I be sure of this ? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years . "" 19 The angel answered , "" I am Gabriel . I stand in the presence of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news . 20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens , because you did not believe my words , which will come true at their proper time . "" 21 Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple . 22 When he came out , he could not speak to them . They realized he had seen a vision in the temple , for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak . 23 When his time of service was completed , he returned home . 24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion . 25 "" The Lord has done this for me , "" she said . "" In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people . "" The Birth of Jesus Foretold 26 In the sixth month , God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth , a town in Galilee , 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph , a descendant of David . The virgin's name was Mary . 28 The angel went to her and said , "" Greetings , you who are highly favored ! The Lord is with you . "" 29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be . 30 But the angel said to her , "" Do not be afraid , Mary , you have found favor with God . 31 You will be with child and give birth to a son , and you are to give him the name Jesus . 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David , 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end . "" 34 "" How will this be , "" Mary asked the angel , "" since I am a virgin ? "" 35 The angel answered , "" The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . So the holy one to be born will be called [ c ] the Son of God . 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age , and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month . 37 For nothing is impossible with God . "" 38 "" I am the Lord's servant , "" Mary answered . "" May it be to me as you have said . "" Then the angel left her . Mary Visits Elizabeth 39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea , 40 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth . 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit . 42 In a loud voice she exclaimed : "" Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the child you will bear ! 43 But why am I so favored , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? 44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy . 45 Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished ! "" Mary's Song 46 And Mary said : "" My soul glorifies the Lord 47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior , 48 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant . From now on all generations will call me blessed , 49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me – holy is his name . 50 His mercy extends to those who fear him , from generation to generation . 51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm ; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts . 52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble . 53 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty . 54 He has helped his servant Israel , remembering to be merciful 55 to Abraham and his descendants forever , even as he said to our fathers . "" 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home . The Birth of John the Baptist 57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby , she gave birth to a son . 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy , and they shared her joy . 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah , 60 but his mother spoke up and said , "" No ! He is to be called John . "" 61 They said to her , "" There is no one among your relatives who has that name . "" 62 Then they made signs to his father , to find out what he would like to name the child . 63 He asked for a writing tablet , and to everyone's astonishment he wrote , "" His name is John . "" 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed , and he began to speak , praising God . 65 The neighbors were all filled with awe , and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things . 66 Everyone who heard this wondered about it , asking , "" What then is this child going to be ? "" For the Lord's hand was with him . Zechariah's Song 67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied : 68 "" Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , because he has come and has redeemed his people . 69 He has raised up a horn [ d ] of salvation for us in the house of his servant David 70 ( as he said through his holy prophets of long ago ) , 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us – 72 to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant , 73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham : 74 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies , and to enable us to serve him without fear 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days . 76 And you , my child , will be called a prophet of the Most High ; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him , 77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins , 78 because of the tender mercy of our God , by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven 79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the path of peace . "" 80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit ; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel . Luke 2 The Birth of Jesus 1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world . 2 ( This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria . ) 3 And everyone went to his own town to register . 4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea , to Bethlehem the town of David , because he belonged to the house and line of David . 5 He went there to register with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child . 6 While they were there , the time came for the baby to be born , 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn , a son . She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn . The Shepherds and the Angels 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby , keeping watch over their flocks at night . 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified . 10 But the angel said to them , "" Do not be afraid . I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people . 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you ; he is Christ [ a ] the Lord . 12 This will be a sign to you : You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . "" 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel , praising God and saying , 14 "" Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests . "" 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , "" Let 's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us about . "" 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby , who was lying in the manger . 17 When they had seen him , they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child , 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them . 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart . 20 The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , which were just as they had been told . Jesus Presented in the Temple 21 On the eighth day , when it was time to circumcise him , he was named Jesus , the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived . 22 When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed , Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 23 ( as it is written in the Law of the Lord , "" Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord "" [ b ] ) , 24 and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord : "" a pair of doves or two young pigeons . "" [ c ] 25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon , who was righteous and devout . He was waiting for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him . 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ . 27 Moved by the Spirit , he went into the temple courts . When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required , 28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God , saying : 29 "" Sovereign Lord , as you have promised , you now dismiss [ d ] your servant in peace . 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation , 31 which you have prepared in the sight of all people , 32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel . "" 33 The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him . 34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , his mother : "" This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel , and to be a sign that will be spoken against , 35 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed . And a sword will pierce your own soul too . "" 36 There was also a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old ; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage , 37 and then was a widow until she was eighty-four . [ e ] She never left the temple but worshiped night and day , fasting and praying . 38 Coming up to them at that very moment , she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem . 39 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth . 40 And the child grew and became strong ; he was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him . The Boy Jesus at the Temple 41 Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover . 42 When he was twelve years old , they went up to the Feast , according to the custom . 43 After the Feast was over , while his parents were returning home , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem , but they were unaware of it . 44 Thinking he was in their company , they traveled on for a day . Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends . 45 When they did not find him , they went back to Jerusalem to look for him . 46 After three days they found him in the temple courts , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions . 47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers . 48 When his parents saw him , they were astonished . His mother said to him , "" Son , why have you treated us like this ? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you . "" 49 "" Why were you searching for me ? "" he asked . "" Did n't you know I had to be in my Father's house ? "" 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them . 51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them . But his mother treasured all these things in her heart . 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men ."	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical

373	Booth's poverty notebooks For each of London's streets , Booth extracted information from the detailed record sheets kept by the small army of attendance officers employed by the London School Board . He and eight collaborators entered this information by hand ( mostly using pencil ) , in a total of 65 notebooks . The first 55 notebooks contain highly detailed family data , the remaining 10 notebooks contain less detailed street information . The family notebooks Early in the poverty survey , Booth began to collect information for every family in each street of London that had children . He and his collaborators entered this information into notebooks that Booth had specially printed for his inquiry . During the early part of the family survey , Booth actually had three different notebook layouts printed . As the example illustrated below reveals , the notebook entries include the street number , occupation of the head of household ( usually highly abbreviated ) , an indication of the wife's occupation ( especially if they were the household head ) , the number of childen in various age groups , the number of rooms occupied and rent paid ( often a single summary for an entire street ) , and notes on the social position of the household . Here is part of a page of the notebook recording informaiton for families in a street in Poplar : When the original information had been gathered from the attendance officers , Booth and his co-workers converted the head of household occupations into a ' section ' number , and gave each family that had children a letter ( A to H ) that indicated to which of seven social classes they belonged . Finally , each street was given a colour which indicated its general social condition . ( Booth devised a set of eight colours based largely on the social mix of street residents . ) These additional items of information can all be seen on the example notebook page above . Note how the employment section number is entered in the ' Rent ' column , and the family social class letter is written in the ' Wages' column . The street colour ( ' l bl ' for light blue ) is written alongside the street name . The street notebooks As the poverty survey progressed , Booth began to record information for entire streets ( or parts of streets ) , rather than for individual families . Again , he had notebooks specially designed and printed to record the information gathered from the School Board attendance officers . As the example illustrated below reveals , the notebook entry for individual streets includes comments on the character of the housing , the number of children of school-going age , general comments on the social character of the street , and the number of families in each social class . Because the street entries occupy a two-page spread of the notebook , the extract below is split into two sections . This is the left-hand side of the entry for five streets in Lambeth : Here is the right-hand side of the entry for the same five streets : Again , Booth assigned a colour to each street according to the social mix of its residents and its general condition . It is not entirely clear whether the street colour was assigned during discussions with the attendance officers , or following subsequent analysis of the summary data .

This open-access article has been published under a Creative Commons Attribution License , which allows unrestricted use , distribution and reproduction , in any form , as long as the original author and source have been credited . c b Creating Stylized Facts with Experiments Hirschman ( 2016 ) defines "" stylized facts "" as "" simple empirical regularities in need of explanation "" ( p. 606 ) . Although they might imply causal relationships , they are not "" causal claims [ but ] typically simple associations that have yet to be ' explained , ' either through more complicated analysis ... or through some appeal to underlying mechanisms , or through some inferential technique relying on experimental or quasi-experimental manipulations "" ( Hirschman 2016 : 607 ) . This suggests that the relationship between stylized facts and experimentation is unidirectional . In this conceptualization , scholars first produce stylized facts . They then conduct experiments to test whether the relationship described in the stylized fact is causal . For example , scholars might first note that voters tend to evaluate incumbent candidates based on economic conditions . They then might conduct experiments to test the causal claim implied in this stylized fact . 910 Crabtree and Fariss Robust Stylized Facts We argue , however , that the relationship between stylized facts and experimentation is frequently circular . In our conceptualization , scholars conducting experiments to test stylized facts can also contribute to the creation of new stylized facts . Continuing with the example above , this would mean that scholars conducting experiments to test whether changes in economic conditions cause changes in incumbent evaluations might also help produce new stylized facts about voting behavior . To further illustrate our point , we briefly discuss the growing experimental research program on racial bias in the United States . 1 Nearly all the studies in this program are ( implicitly or explicitly ) motivated by the stylized fact that racial minorities experience discrimination . This is a widely known empirical regularity based on decades of lived experiences , case studies , and correlational research . Until recently however , the causal effect of race on discrimination was largely unknown . In the last decade , researchers have tested this potential causal relationship with a staggering number of experiments across a dizzying range of contexts ( Butler and Crabtree 2015 ; Butler 2014 ; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004 ; Broockman 2014 ; Grose 2011 ; Gaddis and Ghoshal 2015 ; Pager and Western 2012 ; Pager , Western , and Bonikowski 2009 ; Yinger 1995 ) . The results from each experiment , in isolation , provide additional empirical support for the stylized fact that originally motivated them – racial minorities in America are discriminated against . Taken together , the results from this experimental research program also create an additional empirical regularity . The content of this new stylized fact is being a racial minority causes discrimination . This discussion suggests that stylized facts produced by experimentation differ from other stylized facts . The key difference is in regards to their limitations . Hirschman ( 2016 ) describes two limitations of stylized facts . One is that we rarely know whether the described relationship is causal . This is why Hirschman ( 2016 ) refers to stylized facts as "" claims of non-robust dependence "" ( Hirschman 2016 : 607 ) . A second is that we rarely know why the relationship described exists . Stylized facts are often "" explicitly agnostic as to why X is associated with Y "" ( Hirschman 2016 : 607 ) . Stylized facts then are associations that invite additional empirical examination as well as theoretical explanation . Both limitations , however , do not apply to stylized facts produced by experimentation . For that subset of facts , the question of causation is settled . Questions about theoretical mechanisms , however , often still remain ( Clark and Golder 2015 ) . In other words , stylized facts produced by experiments can tell us whether X causes Y but not why it does . An Expanded Conceptualization of Stylized Facts To account for this and other differences , we propose a new conceptualization of stylized facts . In this conceptualization , "" stylized facts "" are "" empirical regularities in search of theoretical , causal explanations "" ( Hirschman 2016 : 604 ) . These facts , as discussed above , do not make causal claims and are typically produced by correlational studies . As we discuss below , these facts are not necessarily supported by internally valid findings . "" Robust stylized facts , "" on the other hand , are empirical sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 911 October 2016 | Volume 3 Crabtree and Fariss Robust Stylized Facts Table 1 : Conceptualization of stylized facts . Definition Stylized Facts Empirical regularities in search of theoretical , causal explanations Robust Stylized Facts Empirical regularities in search of theoretical explanations No No No Yes Yes Yes Makes causal claims Produced by experimentation Based on internally valid findings regularities in search of theoretical explanations . These facts make causal claims , are produced by experimentation , and are supported by internally valid findings . Table 1 compares these two types of facts to each other . 2 One additional way of thinking about these two types of stylized facts is in terms of validity . When we call something a "" stylized fact , "" we assume that it has external validity . We believe this because we can generalize this relationship to other persons , settings , and times ( Trochim and Donnelly 2008 : 22 ) . As Hirschman ( 2016 ) points out , we usually do not know , however , if stylized facts possess internal validity . That is , we might have expectations that X causes Y , but we do not have robust evidence that this is so . The lack of evidence for one type of validity or another can be a problem because the "" validity types build on one another "" ( Trochim and Donnelly 2008 : 22 ) . If we do not know that the relationship between X and Y is causal , as is usually the case with "" stylized facts , "" then we might gain very little by knowing that the perceived relationship generalizes across different contexts . The fact that the relationship generalizes could suggest that it is a good candidate for additional investigation , but it does not increase our confidence that the relationship is not spurious . In the case of "" robust stylized facts , "" however , we have strong evidence that the relationship is not spurious . This means that the generalization tells us more about the real world . Why Does This Matter ? We consider it very important to distinguish between these two types of facts . When developing theory , researchers often treat stylized facts as either explanada or empirical inputs ( Most and Starr 1989 ) . This means that in many cases , theories are either motivated by or based on claims that "" are taken as empiricial truths without real demonstration "" ( Snidal 2008 : 330 ) . While this might be acceptable in the early stages of theory development , researchers should eventually pursue "" stylized facts that have more accurate empirical content "" ( Snidal 2008 : 331 ) . Robust stylized facts can provide this internally valid content . In this brief comment , we have clarified and extended Hirschman ( 2016 ) ' s discussion of stylized facts . We have shown how experiments can be used to produce stylized facts , highlighted the particular characteristics of these facts , and proposed a new conceptualization that distinguishes between stylized facts based sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 912 October 2016 | Volume 3 Crabtree and Fariss Robust Stylized Facts on correlational research and stylized facts produced by experimentation . This distinction matters : stylized facts provide evidence of external validity but not the internal validity obtained from an experiment or the deductive validity obtained from a logically rigorous theory . Robust stylized facts , however , provide additional evidence that the empirical relationship is an internally valid one . Overall the validity of any inference ( conclusion validity ) is enhanced when evidence for each of these types of validity ( external , internal , construct , and deductive ) is obtained . 3 We hope that our remarks provide a useful complement to Hirschman ( 2016 ) and encourage others to produce robust stylized facts . Notes 1 We focus on this experimental research program only because we have both contributed to it . Our general claims apply to a broad swath of experimental research programs . 2 See Houy , Fettke , and Loos ( 2015 ) for a detailed comparison of stylized facts to scientific laws . 3 For a discussion of enhancing the validity of observational studies , see Fariss and Jones ( 2015 ) .

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works . By contrast , the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users . We , the Free Software Foundation , use the GNU General Public License for most of our software ; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors . You can apply it to your programs , too . When we speak of free software , we are referring to freedom , not price . Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software ( and charge for them if you wish ) , that you receive source code or can get it if you want it , that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs , and that you know you can do these things . To protect your rights , we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights . Therefore , you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software , or if you modify it : responsibilities to respect the freedom of others . For example , if you distribute copies of such a program , whether gratis or for a fee , you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received . You must make sure that they , too , receive or can get the source code . And you must show them these terms so they know their rights . Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps : ( 1 ) assert copyright on the software , and ( 2 ) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy , distribute and / or modify it . For the developers ' and authors' protection , the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software . For both users ' and authors' sake , the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed , so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions . Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them , although the manufacturer can do so . This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software . The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use , which is precisely where it is most unacceptable . Therefore , we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products . If such problems arise substantially in other domains , we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL , as needed to protect the freedom of users . Finally , every program is threatened constantly by software patents . States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers , but in those that do , we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary .

To "" propagate "" a work means to do anything with it that , without permission , would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law , except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy . Propagation includes copying , distribution ( with or without modification ) , making available to the public , and in some countries other activities as well . To "" convey "" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies . Mere interaction with a user through a computer network , with no transfer of a copy , is not conveying . An interactive user interface displays "" Appropriate Legal Notices "" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that ( 1 ) displays an appropriate copyright notice , and ( 2 ) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work ( except to the extent that warranties are provided ) , that licensees may convey the work under this License , and how to view a copy of this License . If the interface presents a list of user commands or options , such as a menu , a prominent item in the list meets this criterion . 1 . Source Code . The "" source code "" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it . "" Object code "" means any non-source form of a work . A "" Standard Interface "" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body , or , in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language , one that is widely used among developers working in that language . The "" System Libraries "" of an executable work include anything , other than the work as a whole , that ( a ) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component , but which is not part of that Major Component , and ( b ) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component , or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form . A "" Major Component "" , in this context , means a major essential component ( kernel , window system , and so on ) of the specific operating system ( if any ) on which the executable work runs , or a compiler used to produce the work , or an object code interpreter used to run it . The "" Corresponding Source "" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate , install , and ( for an executable work ) run the object code and to modify the work , including scripts to control those activities . However , it does not include the work's System Libraries , or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work . For example , Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work , and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require , such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work . The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source . The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work . 2 . Basic Permissions . All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program , and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met . This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program . The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output , given its content , constitutes a covered work . This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent , as provided by copyright law . You may make , run and propagate covered works that you do not convey , without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force . You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you , or provide you with facilities for running those works , provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright . Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf , under your direction and control , on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you . Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below . Sublicensing is not allowed ; section 10 makes it unnecessary . 3 . Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law . No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996 , or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures . When you convey a covered work , you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work , and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing , against the work's users , your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures . 4 . Conveying Verbatim Copies . You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it , in any medium , provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice ; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code ; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty ; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program . You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey , and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee . 5 . Conveying Modified Source Versions . You may convey a work based on the Program , or the modifications to produce it from the Program , in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 , provided that you also meet all of these conditions : a ) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it , and giving a relevant date . b ) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7 . This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "" keep intact all notices "" . c ) You must license the entire work , as a whole , under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy . This License will therefore apply , along with any applicable section 7 additional terms , to the whole of the work , and all its parts , regardless of how they are packaged . This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way , but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it . d ) If the work has interactive user interfaces , each must display Appropriate Legal Notices ; however , if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices , your work need not make them do so . A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works , which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work , and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program , in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium , is called an "" aggregate "" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit . Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate . 6 . Conveying Non-Source Forms . You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 , provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License , in one of these ways : a ) Convey the object code in , or embodied in , a physical product ( including a physical distribution medium ) , accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange . b ) Convey the object code in , or embodied in , a physical product ( including a physical distribution medium ) , accompanied by a written offer , valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model , to give anyone who possesses the object code either ( 1 ) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License , on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange , for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source , or ( 2 ) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge . c ) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source . This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially , and only if you received the object code with such an offer , in accord with subsection 6b . d ) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place ( gratis or for a charge ) , and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge . You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code . If the place to copy the object code is a network server , the Corresponding Source may be on a different server ( operated by you or a third party ) that supports equivalent copying facilities , provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source . Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source , you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements . e ) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission , provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d . A separable portion of the object code , whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library , need not be included in conveying the object code work . A "" User Product "" is either ( 1 ) a "" consumer product "" , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal , family , or household purposes , or ( 2 ) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling . In determining whether a product is a consumer product , doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage . For a particular product received by a particular user , "" normally used "" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product , regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses , or expects or is expected to use , the product . A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial , industrial or non-consumer uses , unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product . "" Installation Information "" for a User Product means any methods , procedures , authorization keys , or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source . The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made . If you convey an object code work under this section in , or with , or specifically for use in , a User Product , and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term ( regardless of how the transaction is characterized ) , the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information . But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product ( for example , the work has been installed in ROM ) . The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service , warranty , or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient , or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed . Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network . Corresponding Source conveyed , and Installation Information provided , in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented ( and with an implementation available to the public in source code form ) , and must require no special password or key for unpacking , reading or copying . 7 . Additional Terms . "" Additional permissions "" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions . Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License , to the extent that they are valid under applicable law . If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program , that part may be used separately under those permissions , but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions . When you convey a copy of a covered work , you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy , or from any part of it . ( Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work . ) You may place additional permissions on material , added by you to a covered work , for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission . Notwithstanding any other provision of this License , for material you add to a covered work , you may ( if authorized by the copyright holders of that material ) supplement the terms of this License with terms : a ) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License ; or b ) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it ; or c ) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material , or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version ; or d ) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material ; or e ) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names , trademarks , or service marks ; or f ) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material ( or modified versions of it ) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient , for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors . All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "" further restrictions "" within the meaning of section 10 . If the Program as you received it , or any part of it , contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction , you may remove that term . If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License , you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document , provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying . If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section , you must place , in the relevant source files , a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files , or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms . Additional terms , permissive or non-permissive , may be stated in the form of a separately written license , or stated as exceptions ; the above requirements apply either way . 8 . Termination . You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License . Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void , and will automatically terminate your rights under this License ( including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11 ) . However , if you cease all violation of this License , then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated ( a ) provisionally , unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license , and ( b ) permanently , if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation . Moreover , your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means , this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License ( for any work ) from that copyright holder , and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice . Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License . If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated , you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10 . 9 . Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies . You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program . Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance . However , nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work . These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License . Therefore , by modifying or propagating a covered work , you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so . 10 . Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients . Each time you convey a covered work , the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors , to run , modify and propagate that work , subject to this License . You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License . An "" entity transaction "" is a transaction transferring control of an organization , or substantially all assets of one , or subdividing an organization , or merging organizations . If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction , each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph , plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest , if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts . You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License . For example , you may not impose a license fee , royalty , or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License , and you may not initiate litigation ( including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit ) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making , using , selling , offering for sale , or importing the Program or any portion of it . 11 . Patents . A "" contributor "" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based . The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "" contributor version "" . A contributor's "" essential patent claims "" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor , whether already acquired or hereafter acquired , that would be infringed by some manner , permitted by this License , of making , using , or selling its contributor version , but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version . For purposes of this definition , "" control "" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License . Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive , worldwide , royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims , to make , use , sell , offer for sale , import and otherwise run , modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version . In the following three paragraphs , a "" patent license "" is any express agreement or commitment , however denominated , not to enforce a patent ( such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement ) . To "" grant "" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party . If you convey a covered work , knowingly relying on a patent license , and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy , free of charge and under the terms of this License , through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means , then you must either ( 1 ) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available , or ( 2 ) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work , or ( 3 ) arrange , in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License , to extend the patent license to downstream recipients . "" Knowingly relying "" means you have actual knowledge that , but for the patent license , your conveying the covered work in a country , or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country , would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid . If , pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement , you convey , or propagate by procuring conveyance of , a covered work , and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use , propagate , modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work , then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it . A patent license is "" discriminatory "" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage , prohibits the exercise of , or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License . You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software , under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work , and under which the third party grants , to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you , a discriminatory patent license ( a ) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you ( or copies made from those copies ) , or ( b ) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work , unless you entered into that arrangement , or that patent license was granted , prior to 28 March 2007 . Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law . 12 . No Surrender of Others' Freedom . If conditions are imposed on you ( whether by court order , agreement or otherwise ) that contradict the conditions of this License , they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License . If you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations , then as a consequence you may not convey it at all . For example , if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program , the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program . 13 . Use with the GNU Affero General Public License . Notwithstanding any other provision of this License , you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work , and to convey the resulting work . The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work , but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License , section 13 , concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such . 14 . Revised Versions of this License . The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and / or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time . Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version , but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns . Each version is given a distinguishing version number . If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "" or any later version "" applies to it , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation . If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License , you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation . If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used , that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program . Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions . However , no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version . 15 . Disclaimer of Warranty . THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM , TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW . EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND / OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "" AS IS "" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND , EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING , BUT NOT LIMITED TO , THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE . THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU . SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE , YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING , REPAIR OR CORRECTION . 16 . Limitation of Liability . IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER , OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND / OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE , BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES , INCLUDING ANY GENERAL , SPECIAL , INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM ( INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS ) , EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES . 17 . Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16 . If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms , reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program , unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee .

808	Wind energy is abundant , inexhaustible , widely distributed , clean , and mitigates the greenhouse effect . It is estimated that 3 % of the energy from the Sun that hits the earth is converted into wind energy . This is about 50 to 100 times more energy than is converted into biomass by all the plants on Earth through photosynthesis . Most of this wind energy can be found at high altitudes , however there is still sufficiently high energy at ground levels to be useful . In 2005 , worldwide capacity of wind-powered generators was 58,982 MW , their production making up less than 1 % of worldwide electricity use . Although still a relatively minor source of electricity , wind power generation has more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2005 . Most modern wind power is generated in the form of electricity by converting the rotation of turbine blades into electrical current by means of an electrical generator . In more traditional windmills wind energy is used to turn mechanical machinery to do physical work , such as crushing grain or pumping water . Wind power is used in large-scale wind farms for national electrical grids as well as in small individual turbines for providing electricity in isolated locations . It is helpful to understand some background information about wind power as a renewable energy resource .	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

1337	"You gotta love the babies ! But milk supply is crucial to their survival . As if the anticipation of a newborn foal and a healthy delivery were n't stress enough , there is nothing scarier than questioning whether or not a foal has had enough colostrum within 12-24 hours of birth . And believe me , a mare that does n't seem to be producing sufficient milk afterwards , will make you question that very fact . First and Foremost : Colostrum is the life-giving substance which prepares a newborn foal for life . Since a brand new baby horse is totally and immunologically , vulnerable to the challenges of the outside world , colostrum deriving from the mare's teat immediately after birth is Mother Nature's way of delivering precious antibodies into a foal's system . A new foal must get enough colostrum through passive transfer , within 12-24 hours of birth . Therefore , if you find yourself in a situation where a mare is not producing enough milk several hours later , or the next morning , you must ascertain whether or not the foal received adequate colostrum . I can not stress this aspect enough . A mare without milk is almost the same situation as an orphan foal . You have to make wise decisions and fast . Determining colostrum intake is often done via a SNAP test or serum chemistry , to ensure antibody levels are adequate . Of Second Importance : The results of a SNAP test are obtained very quickly – in something like 7 minutes . If it is determined that plasma or frozen colostrum is necessary , it is still important to remember that the foal also needs nutrition for energy . There are a few equine replacement supplements on the market that can help to feed the foal . These include ; Equilac , Foalac or Kid Milk ( the latter primarily being used for cattle ) . But it 's important to note that milk replacers DO NOT substitute colostrum . Once a foal is is verified to have sufficient colostrum levels , providing adequate nutrition is the next big hurdle . Dr. Dennis Rach of Moore & Co. in Calgary , Alberta , gave me this helpful tip recently : Dextrose is used as an aid in the treatment of glucose deficiencies in cattle . When added to 2 % milk , it provides the nutrients a foal requires , plus , it helps to "" sweeten "" the milk slightly , to better simulate the taste of a mare's milk . If milk replacer is necessary , a foal needs to consume milk replacer every 2-4 hours . ( This makes life very difficult , but it needs to be done . ) And a foal must consume 16-18 % of its body weight in milk per day . For example , a 60 pound foal must consume 6 pounds of milk per day . It also possible to induce lactation . Certain treatment protocols have resulted in milk production ranging from 25 % to 82 % in success rates . However , induced lactation does not begin with a production of colostrum . Domperidone ( check it out at equitoxpharma.com ) has been used in recent years with good success , to increase endogenous prolactin secretion in mares ( either in advancing the onset of reproductive activity in early spring or to counter the ill effects of fescue toxicosis in pregnant mares at term . ) And of course , check out www.cyberfoal.com in you have an orphan foal , or have a mare suffering from agalactia ( non-production of milk ) . This website works !! It has proven to be a valuable tool for matching orphan foals with nurse mares . At CyberFoal.com , you can apply for a nurse mare or post your own mare up for a newborn foal adoption ( if she has lost her foal ) and help to benefit someone else who may have an orphan . You can also apply for colostrum or read listings as to where colostrum banks may be located . Altogether , CyberFoal.com is a brilliant , valuable website for owners in dire need of colostrum or nurse mare matches . Share this : Alright , I know Mother's day was this past weekend . And it 's not that I 'm trying to make up for not calling and visiting with my beloved Mother ( s ) and Grandmothers . ' Cause I did . My Mom has a very special place in my heart . She was a single mother who struggled , but somehow managed to raise two healthy , vibrant daughters . So although it 's belated , I thought I 'd share a couple of "" Mother Scenes "" out in our front pasture right now . Since I do n't yet have kids of my own , these are what my Mom proudly refers to as her "" Grand-fillies and colts . "" And on that note – why do we need one day to celebrate our Moms anyways ? They have been there for us 365 days a year since our lives began . We should be thanking God and commemorating everything they have done for us – every day . Our mothers have taken care of us . Nurtured and fed us , without question . They have stood by our sides , even when we may have been a little "" nerdy "" at times . Moms are always proud , no matter what we do . They protected us from danger . They taught us how to run and play . And how to survive . Share this : Okay , since this colt starting entry has spanned over several days , let 's go back to the beginning of Clay's first saddling concept . Yesterday , my husband desensitized Mercedes to the saddle pad . Now , he 's going to throw his colt starting saddle ( one that he does n't mind if it gets beat up a little bit ) , directly onto Mercedes' back . He does n't pause or creep up to her with the saddle – Clay simply throws it over like it 's no big deal . Of course , Mercedes is not sure what to make of the object but just the same , she allows it to remain on her back . Note the cinch is not done up at this point . Clay moves Mercedes around , so she feels the weight of the pad and the saddle on her back . Next , Clay drops the cinches on the near side and walks around to the horse's left side to do them up . Very carefully , Clay begins doing up the front cinch . Notice , he has moved Mercedes closer to the fence in case Clay needs to jump up on it quickly to get out of harm's way ... Then Clay slips the rope halter off Mercedes' head and places it around her neck instead . This is because Clay will now – carefully – do up the back cinch . And it 's likely that once the filly feels the back cinch for the first time she will be outta there ... Whew ! The lesson is n't done for today , Clay will continue to do some roundpen reasoning with Mercedes until she responds correctly to him , while still wearing the saddle . Then , he find a good note to end the lesson on . Clay will halter Mercedes and safely remove the saddle ( by undoing the back cinch first ) . And the filly will be allowed an extensive cool-down period , followed by a good grooming session . Finally , she is returned to her stall . In all , Mercedes has handled Clay's first saddling lessons extremely well . There was a little excitement , but nothing out of the ordinary . Neither Clay , nor Mercedes was hurt and a lot was accomplished in terms of the filly's training in a very short time . Please let me reiterate – Clay is a professional horse trainer . Therefore , he has a tonne of experience in the colt starting department . He also has specific roundpen equipment that he uses . The blog entries appearing in My Stable Life are by no means , a recipe for DIYers ... They are merely an inside view into the art of training young horses . I hope you enjoyed these sessions and we will be back with more "" Insider Training "" very soon . Cheers ! Share this : Clay intends to saddle Mercedes today , for the first time in her life . But for the purposes of breaking the concept up into easy-to understand portions , I will separate the steps into two more blog entries ( today and tomorrow ) . To get Mercedes used to the sensation of a front or back cinch ( since she has never worn one before ) , Clay tosses a lead rope around her barrel . Mercedes is not tied , she is allowed to move around the roundpen as she pleases . However , the goal is for Clay to apply light pressure to her barrel with the rope and when she yields , Clay releases the pressure . If at any time , Mercedes decides to run off , Clay releases his grip on the lead rope and lets her go . There 's no sense in either of them getting hurt or Mercedes becoming scared . In this case , Clay would simply re-catch Mercedes and try again . Today , Mercedes stays put and really puts a lot of effort into trying to comprehend what Clay is asking . Here , she investigates the rope and even tries relieving the pressure by biting it . Although biting is never desirable , Mercedes is clearly curious . Mercedes yields to the pressure and Clay releases the pressure by putting slack in the rope . Next , Clay will introduce the saddle pad to our filly . Note he has now put a rope halter on Mercedes . Clay presses the blanket to Mercedes' sides , an attempt to desensitize her to it . Then he quickly and assertively throws the blanket on her back . At this point , Clay always says "" Do n't mess around here . Just throw the blanket up there like she 's had it done numerous times . "" Otherwise , if Clay had tried throwing the pad on Mercedes in a fashion that implied she should be afraid of it , she probably would spook away . He lets the pad rest on Mercedes' back . Clay moves the pad all over Mercedes' body and desensitizes her to it . He wants her to realize she has nothing to fear in the saddle pad . Repeating the process over and over , Clay throws the pad over Mercedes' back until she is comfortable and relaxes with the concept . He will even move her around a bit and let Mercedes feel the pad on her back in motion . If it falls off , that 's okay . It simply gives Clay another chance to throw the pad on her again . When Mercedes relaxes her body and displays such body language as lowering her head , licking her lips and relaxing her tail , he is confident with her progress . This concludes the first portion of the first saddling lesson . Share this : In Mercedes' first roundpen lesson ( posted April 4 , 2010 ) , the young yearling filly was brought into our arena roundpen and taught the basics of human handling . While this filly is already halter broke , Clay basically wanted to teach her to have her attention on him at all times . The first session took approximately 25 minutes and when it was done , Mercedes willingly allowed Clay to approach her and touch her shoulders with his lariat . He did this using an "" Approach and Retreat "" philosophy . In this next lesson , Clay will put Mercedes through the same paces as in the first session , but the goal this time is to be able to touch her in several areas of the body without Mercedes retreating . Clay tests out what was learned in the first lesson . Mercedes is definitely unsure but she has not moved away from Clay's lariat yet . Clay was unable to really "" touch "" Mercedes , so he sends her around the roundpen to work . He wants the filly's heart , lungs and muscles to help explain to Mercedes that it would be a lot easier to just stand and allow Clay to touch her body . Still , Mercedes declines Clay's invitation to stand , so he sends her around to work again , taking great care to stand back from her hindquarters . Finally the filly thinks about it a little bit and turns to face Clay . He approaches her . Clay wants to be able to rub her all over , with the lariat .

Upon picking her up , we discovered a fungus-like patch extending from her right wither down to her right gaskin . The condition did not seem to be bothering her ( it was n't itchy ) , however if it was a fungus that could be transferred to another animal , this was a concern to us . Therefore , following several veterinarian examinations and various topical anti-fungal preparations , one of our vets suggested that we do a skin biopsy . This test produced accurate results . And while knowing what we were dealing with was a huge relief , we could n't help but feel slightly forlorn when we finally did get a proper diagnosis . Equine Linear Keratosis occurs as vertical linear areas of alopecia ( or near alopecia ) , scaling and crust formation on the sides of the horse's neck , or shoulder or chest . The condition is characterized by the gradual development of annular areas of alopecia , usually in a linear , vertically oriented configuration . In our mare's case , her shoulder looked as though someone had spilled a chemical down her body – a scenario we even considered for a while . The lesions are usually 2 to 10mm wide by a few cm to more than 1m in length . The lesions are neither painful nor pruritic . Our horse is n't itchy and the skin seems healthy otherwise . Linear keratosis accounts for 0.67 per cent of the equine dermatology cases seen at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine . Meaning , the condition is very rare . At the blue arrow , you can faintly see the change of coat color that occurs due to the linear keratosis . Since the diagnosis , we have learned that it is possibly a hereditary condition and it may never disappear . However , linear keratosis is not contagious and luckily , it can not pass from our mare to her stable mate or any other horses she may come into contact with . And aside from its blemish appearance , our mare's skin disorder really does n't affect her . She is not sore in that area and it had never affected her training .

367	World Usability Day at User Vision User Vision , November 2005 The User Vision office was a hive of activity on November 3rd as over 50 visitors tried to meet the challenges of User Vision's ' Usability Obstacle Course ' . Visitors from a wide variety of companies came to User Vision to learn about usability first hand by trying to meet some of the common usability challenges we face in our modern world . User Vision prepared a series of ' obstacles ' to reveal the design features that can make or break the user experience , and everyone had a chance to see if they could succeed in the tasks such as : Setting the VCR to record a TV programme Buying a product online from a website Changing the ring tone on a mobile phone Transferring a song to an MP3 player - and then playing it Guessing the icon functions on a printer Opening the plastic packaging on a product - without using their teeth ! The epic battle : Man vs. VCR Some of the results are worth noting : Only half the vistors could change the ringtone on a Nokia 6630 mobile phone and most gave it a rating of ' very difficult ' , whilst 92 % could perform the task on a Samsung D500 It took an average of 3.12 minutes to set the VCR ( the slowest was over 6 minutes , and there was notable ( and audible ) exasperation in front of the telly ! Opening the packaging of a plastic wrapped CD took nearly 1 minute on average with the record being set at 9 seconds ( and a few broken nails in the process ! ) In the battle of the MP3 Players , the iPOD won handily over Creative's Zen Micro , although previous familiarity with the popular pod no doubt helped some 9 % were unable to make an e-commerce purchase due to difficulties in using the site - something that many e-retailers should note Less than 60 % of people could figure out what the icons on our printer mean ( that 's why we 've had to stick little labels on them ! ) Printer icons - are these symbols supposed to MEAN something ? Now , there must be ringtones in here somewhere .. Many Eyes on Usability Testing - and Ears on Accessibility The other main event of the afternoon was a rolling programme of usability tests on a variety of sites , including e-government , finance , online travel and e-commerce . On one side of a one-way mirror in User Vision's Usability test lab a test subject worked through tasks and described their impressions to a User Vision consultant , whilst on the other side up to a dozen observers were riveted on their every move and comment . There were some moments of teeth-gnashing frustration from the observers , who thought they could see what would be the most logical next step , which often was not seen by the test subject . The value of usability testing was clearly demonstrated , and the subject's comments and actions clearly showed up some issues in the sites tested . In User Vision's focus group room a demonstration of screen readers used by blind and partially sighted web users was a compelling introduction to web accessibility . Many visitors took the opportunity to ' hear ' their sites as a blind user would , whilst User Vision consultants explained the accessibility features or shortcomings . Certainly the importance of creating accessible sites was highlighted after getting an insight to how many disabled people use the web . Overall , World Usability Day at User Vision proved to be very successful and enjoyable for everyone taking part in the event . Not only did it help to raise awareness of usability but it allowed people to have an understanding of some of the obstacles that consumers and end users have when faced with the task of using an everyday product , software or website .

1643	"Editor Picks is a list series for Britannica editors to provide opinions and commentary on topics of personal interest . With over 4,000 species of parasitic flowering plants in the world , there are a lot of incredible species out there . This list represents my picks as Britannica's plant editor for the five most-impressive parasitic plants . What do you think ? Frans Lanting / Corbis Rafflesia arnoldii , the world's largest individual flower , is kind of nasty . Found in the forests of Malaysia and Indonesia , its giant red-brown blossom is nearly 1 meter ( 3 . 3 feet ) in diameter and weighs up to 11 kg ( 24 pounds ) . It smells like rotting flesh to attract carrion-feeding flies as pollinators and its sticky fruit is spread by rodents . If you 've ever seen a picture of this "" corpse flower , "" you may have noticed its lack of leaves . This delightful organism is actually an obligate parasite and can not photosynthesize on its own . In fact , 100 % of its unpleasantness is fueled with nutrients it steals from the roots of neighboring Tetrastigma vines ! Rafflesia makes parasitism pay off in a big smelly way . On the opposite end of the size spectrum is the minute Pilostyles thurberi , or Thurber's stemsucker . Native to the deserts of southwestern North America , P. thurberi is an obligate parasite on the stems of shrubs in the pea family ( Fabaceae ) . Measuring only about 6 mm ( 0 . 25 inch ) long , the tiny plant lives entirely within the stem tissues of its hosts and lacks roots , leaves , or chlorophyll . Its presence is only made known when it breaks through the bark of its host to flower . Each individual plant produces only male or female flowers and scientists are still unsure what exactly pollinates these teeny-tiny flowers or how populations coordinate their flowering . Mysterious and adorable ? It gets a spot on my favorites list for sure . E.R. Degginger Dodder ( Cuscuta sp . ) is a fairly well known group of parasitic plants that form iconic masses of yellow , leafless vines over their hosts . Dodder plants are aggressive and use root-like organs called haustoria to penetrate the stems of their hosts and siphon off their water and nutrients , often to the point of host-death . Given that dodder species have little to no chlorophyll with which to make their own nutrients , it is crucial for young seedlings to find a host before they run out of the energy supplied by their seeds ( usually about 5-10 days ) . Studies have shown that these seedlings can use airborne volatile organic compounds to locate their host plants , almost like a plant-y sense of smell ! Cuscuta seedlings can even detect which of their neighboring plants are more suitable hosts and will actively grow towards them . Once a young plant successfully reaches a host , its embryonic root rots away and it becomes wholly dependent on its parasitism . The fact that this plant can sense its hosts makes it a candidate for a creepy plant-horror film and earns it a place amongst its esteemed parasitic brethren . S. Kenaley Not to be confused with their Christmas-y namesake ( which , incidentally , is also a parasite ) , dwarf mistletoe ( Arceuthobium ) species are found throughout the world and primarily parasitize conifer trees . Like dodder , dwarf mistletoes employ haustoria to exploit their hosts' vascular tissues and do little to no photosynthesis of their own . While many parasitic plants spread to new hosts with the help of animals or the wind , dwarf mistletoe spreads from treetop to treetop using high-velocity projectile seeds ! Yes , this plant actually explodes bullet-shaped seeds onto new hosts . Dwarf mistletoe fruits each house a single seed covered in a sticky substance . As the fruit matures , pressure builds up inside and causes the thick skin to rupture , shooting the seed away from the plant at speeds of up to 90 km / hr ( 56 mph ) ! The sticky covering helps the seed attach to the surface on which it landed , ideally the branch of a nearby conifer . Ballistic parasitic embryos . Enough said . W.H. Hodge A tall and beautiful flowering tree , the Australian Christmas tree ( Nuytsia floribunda ) is an elegant parasitic plant . Native to dry regions in southwest Australia , N. floribunda towers over the other plants in the landscape and flowers when many other species are dormant . Equipped with green leaves , the plant is able to photosynthesize and provide its own nutrition , but acts as facultative parasite and steals water from its neighbors as necessary ( which enables both its size and dry-season flowering ) . In fact , the tree maintains an extensive network of parasitic root connections with numerous other plants to exploit their various water supplies . Incredibly , the plant establishes these connections by severing the hosts' xylem vessels with haustoria equipped with a guillotine-like structure ! This mini-guillotine is so strong that it has mistakenly chopped through numerous underground power and fiber optic cables . Any plant with a guillotine gets brownie points in my book ."

46	"FATHER GORIOT To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire , a token of admiration for his works and genius . DE BALZAC . FATHER GORIOT Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) is an elderly person , who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel . Her house ( known in the neighborhood as the _Maison Vauquer_ ) receives men and women , old and young , and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment ; but , at the same time , it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years , and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest . In 1819 , however , the time when this drama opens , there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme . Vauquer's boarders . That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late ; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature ; but it must do service again here , not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word , but because some tears may perhaps be shed _intra et extra muros_ before it is over . Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it ? It is open to doubt . The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation , the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color , are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre , in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud , a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow ; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations , that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there . Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about , that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity ; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit , soon consumed . Civilization , like the car of Juggernaut , is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course ; this also is broken , and Civilization continues on her course triumphant . And you , too , will do the like ; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair , and say to yourself , "" Perhaps this may amuse me . "" You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes , and , dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite , will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer , and accuse him of exaggeration , of writing romances . Ah ! once for all , this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance ! _All is true_ , -- so true , that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house , perhaps in his own heart . The lodging-house is Mme . Vauquer's own property . It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l ' Arbalete , that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way , because it is so stony and steep . This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace , two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas . In that district the pavements are clean and dry , there is neither mud nor water in the gutters , grass grows in the chinks of the walls . The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation ; there is a grim look about the houses , a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls . A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness , old age lying down to die , and joyous youth condemned to drudgery . It is the ugliest quarter of Paris , and , it may be added , the least known . But , before all things , the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind can not be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images . Even so , step by step the daylight decreases , and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs . The comparison holds good ! Who shall say which is more ghastly , the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts ? The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road , and looks out upon a little garden , so that you see the side of the house in section , as it were , from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve . Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel , a fathom wide , paved with cobble-stones , and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots . Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door , above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read , and beneath , in rather smaller letters , "" _Lodgings for both sexes , etc. _ "" During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached . On the opposite wall , at the further end of the graveled walk , a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist , and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed ; a Parisian Cupid , so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals , and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism . The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art , for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777 : "" Whoe ' er thou art , thy master see ; He is , or was , or ought to be . "" At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door . The little garden is no wider than the front of the house ; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house . A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris , for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit , and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme . Vauquer and her lodgers ; every year the widow trembles for her vintage . A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it ; _line_-trees , as Mme . Vauquer persists in calling them , in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans , and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers . The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees , and surrounded by a border of lettuce , pot-herbs , and parsley . Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table , and hither , during the dog-days , such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure , though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade . The house itself is three stories high , without counting the attics under the roof . It is built of rough stone , and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris . There are five windows in each story in the front of the house ; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry , so that the lines are all at cross purposes . At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor , and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating . Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet , a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs , poultry , and rabbits ; the wood-shed is situated on the further side , and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe , just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams . The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water , under pain of pestilence . The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses . Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor , a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned . Another door opens out of it into the dining-room , which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase , the steps being constructed partly of wood , partly of tiles , which are colored and beeswaxed . Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting-room . The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes . There is a round table in the middle , with a purplish-red marble top , on which there stands , by way of ornament , the inevitable white china tea-service , covered with a half-effaced gilt network . The floor is sufficiently uneven , the wainscot rises to elbow height , and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper , on which the principal scenes from _Telemaque_ are depicted , the various classical personages being colored . The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses , displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders , and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them . The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions ; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades , on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste . The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language , and which should be called the _odeur de pension_ . The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it ; it has a stuffy , musty , and rancid quality ; it permeates your clothing ; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital . It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger , young or old . Yet , in spite of these stale horrors , the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir , when compared with the adjoining dining-room . The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color , now a matter of conjecture , for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit , which cover it with fantastic outlines . A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters , metal discs with a satin sheen on them , and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room . In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes , in which the lodgers' table napkins , more or less soiled and stained with wine , are kept . Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere , which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables . You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days ; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite , framed every one in a black varnished frame , with a gilt beading round it ; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case , inlaid with brass ; the green stove , the Argand lamps , covered with oil and dust , have met your eyes before . The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his name on the surface , using his thumb-nail as a style . The chairs are broken-down invalids ; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good ; and finally , the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks , hingeless , charred , broken away about the holes . It would be impossible to give an idea of the old , rotten , shaky , cranky , worm-eaten , halt , maimed , one-eyed , rickety , and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description , which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon . The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color . In short , there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here ; it is dire , parsimonious , concentrated , threadbare poverty ; as yet it has not sunk into the mire , it is only splashed by it , and though not in rags as yet , its clothing is ready to drop to pieces . This apartment is in all its glory at seven o ' clock in the morning , when Mme . Vauquer's cat appears , announcing the near approach of his mistress , and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls , each protected by a plate , while he purrs his morning greeting to the world . A moment later the widow shows her face ; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry , and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion . She is an oldish woman , with a bloated countenance , and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it ; her fat little hands ( she is as sleek as a church rat ) and her shapeless , slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune , where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes . Mme . Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it . Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn ; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark , suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills ; in short , she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house , as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress . You can no more imagine the one without the other , than you can think of a jail without a turnkey . The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads , just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital . The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown , with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material , is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room , the dining-room , and the little garden ; it discovers the cook , it foreshadows the lodgers--the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress . Mme . Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "" have seen a deal of trouble . "" She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood , who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services , but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru , if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed , or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot . Still , "" she is a good woman at bottom , "" said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her , and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves . What had M. Vauquer been ? The lady was never very explicit on this head . How had she lost her money ? "" Through trouble , "" was her answer . He had treated her badly , had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty , the house she lived in , and the privilege of pitying nobody , because , so she was wont to say , she herself had been through every possible misfortune . Sylvie , the stout cook , hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps , hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts . Beside those who lived in the house , Mme . Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals ; but these _externes_ usually only came to dinner , for which they paid thirty francs a month . At the time when this story begins , the lodging-house contained seven inmates . The best rooms in the house were on the first story , Mme . Vauquer herself occupying the least important , while the rest were let to a Mme . Couture , the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic . With her lived Victorine Taillefer , a schoolgirl , to whom she filled the place of mother . These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year . The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts , the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers , who gave out that he was a retired merchant , and was addressed as M. Vautrin . Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let--one to an elderly spinster , a Mlle . Michonneau , and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli , Italian paste and starch , who allowed the others to address him as "" Father Goriot . "" The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage , to impecunious students , who like "" Father Goriot "" and Mlle . Michonneau , could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging . Mme . Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort ; they ate too much bread , and she only took them in default of better . At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student , a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme , one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him . Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac , for that was his name , to work . He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them , and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career , subordinating their studies from the first to this end , carefully watching the indications of the course of events , calculating the probable turn that affairs will take , that they may be the first to profit by them . But for his observant curiosity , and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris , this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him , for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things , which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass . Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry , and a couple of attics . Christophe , the man-of-all-work , slept in one , and Sylvie , the stout cook , in the other . Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated , taking one year with another , some eight law or medical students dined in the house , as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood . There were usually eighteen people at dinner , and there was room , if need be , for twenty at Mme . Vauquer's table ; at breakfast , however , only the seven lodgers appeared . It was almost like a family party . Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers , and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before ; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence . These seven lodgers were Mme . Vauquer's spoiled children . Among them she distributed , with astronomical precision , the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board . One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance . The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month . Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere ; and , as might be expected , poverty , more or less apparent , weighed upon them all , Mme . Couture being the sole exception to the rule . The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house ; all were alike threadbare . The color of the men's coats were problematical ; such shoes , in more fashionable quarters , are only to be seen lying in the gutter ; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges ; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self . The women's dresses were faded , old-fashioned , dyed and re-dyed ; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear , much-mended lace , dingy ruffles , crumpled muslin fichus . So much for their clothing ; but , for the most part , their frames were solid enough ; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life ; their cold , hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation , but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips . Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these , not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas , but dumb dramas of life , frost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire , dramas that do not end with the actors' lives . Mlle . Michonneau , that elderly young lady , screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass , an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself . Her shawl , with its scanty , draggled fringe , might have covered a skeleton , so meagre and angular was the form beneath it . Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once . What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines ? Was it trouble , or vice , or greed ? Had she loved too well ? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer , a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses , or had she been merely a courtesan ? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by ? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you ; her shriveled face seemed like a menace . Her voice was like the shrill , thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand . She said that she had nursed an old gentleman , ill of catarrh of the bladder , and left to die by his children , who thought that he had nothing left . His bequest to her , a life annuity of a thousand francs , was periodically disputed by his heirs , who mingled slander with their persecutions . In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions , her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue , some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived . M. Poiret was a sort of automaton . He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes , on his head a shabby cap , a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers ; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure ; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs ; the thin , blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man ; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler 's ; altogether , his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien . What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him ? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance , which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature ? What had he been ? Well , perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice , a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts , -- so much for providing black veils for parricides , so much for sawdust , so much for pulleys and cord for the knife . Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house , or a sub-inspector of nuisances . Indeed , the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill ; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight ; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean ; one of those men , in short , at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that , "" After all , we can not do without them . "" Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering ; but , then , Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb . You may survey its surface and describe it ; but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea , there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths , caverns unknown , flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature . The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities . Two , however , of Mme . Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest . There was a sickly pallor , such as is often seen in anaemic girls , in Mlle . Victorine Taillefer's face ; and her unvarying expression of sadness , like her embarrassed manner and pinched look , was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve , which forms a background to this picture ; but her face was young , there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements . This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub , newly planted in an uncongenial soil , where its leaves have already begun to wither . The outlines of her figure , revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials , were also youthful . There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form , her faintly colored face and light-brown hair , that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes ; and a sweet expression , a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes . She was pretty by force of contrast ; if she had been happy , she would have been charming . Happiness is the poetry of woman , as the toilette is her tinsel . If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color ; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already ; if love had put light into the sad eyes , then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest ; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time--pretty dresses and love-letters . A book might have been made of her story . Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her , and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year ; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter , and had converted all his real estate into personalty , that he might leave it undivided to his son . Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme . Couture's house ; and the latter , who was a near relation , had taken charge of the little orphan . Unluckily , the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension , and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless , inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world . The good soul , therefore , took Victorine to mass every Sunday , and to confession once a fortnight , thinking that , in any case , she would bring up her ward to be devout . She was right ; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future . The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her . Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness , but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain ; her father was inexorable . Her brother , her only means of communication , had not come to see her for four years , and had sent her no assistance ; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart , and no accusations mingled with her prayers . Mme . Couture and Mme . Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse , and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct ; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire , Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove , and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain . Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type ; he had a fair complexion , blue eyes , black hair . In his figure , manner , and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family , or that , from his earliest childhood , he had been gently bred . If he was careful of his wardrobe , only taking last year's clothes into daily wear , still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion . Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat , the limp black cravat , untidily knotted , that students affect , trousers that matched the rest of his costume , and boots that had been resoled . Vautrin ( the man of forty with the dyed whiskers ) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others . He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark : "" He looks a jovial sort ! "" He had broad shoulders , a well-developed chest , muscular arms , and strong square-fisted hands ; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair . His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles ; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner . His bass voice was by no means unpleasant , and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter . He was always obliging , always in good spirits ; if anything went wrong with one of the locks , he would soon unscrew it , take it to pieces , file it , oil and clean and set it in order , and put it back in its place again ; "" I am an old hand at it , "" he used to say . Not only so , he knew all about ships , the sea , France , foreign countries , men , business , law , great houses and prisons , -- there was nothing that he did not know . If any one complained rather more than usual , he would offer his services at once . He had several times lent money to Mme . Vauquer , or to the boarders ; but , somehow , those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him ; a certain resolute look , sometimes seen on his face , inspired fear of him , for all his appearance of easy good-nature . In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position . His eyes , like those of a pitiless judge , seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions , to read all natures , all feelings and thoughts . His habit of life was very regular ; he usually went out after breakfast , returning in time for dinner , and disappeared for the rest of the evening , letting himself in about midnight with a latch key , a privilege that Mme . Vauquer accorded to no other boarder . But then he was on very good terms with the widow ; he used to call her "" mamma , "" and put his arm round her waist , a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full ! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat ; but , as a matter of fact , no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her . It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it , which he took after dinner . Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life , or old men , who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them , would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them . He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him ; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts , or to discover his occupation . He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature , his unfailing readiness to oblige , and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them , but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character . He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue , to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency , in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal , as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him , as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life . Mlle . Taillefer felt attracted , perhaps unconsciously , by the strength of the one man , and the good looks of the other ; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them ; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her , although some day a chance might alter her position , and she would be a wealthy heiress . For that matter , there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes , real or imaginary , related by the rest . Each one regarded the others with indifference , tempered by suspicion ; it was a natural result of their relative positions . Practical assistance not one could give , this they all knew , and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances . They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other . The routine of existence kept them in contact , but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil . There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street , not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune , not one who did not see in death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others . The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme . Vauquer , who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions . For her , the little garden , which silence , and cold , and rain , and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_ , was a pleasant shaded nook ; the gaunt yellow house , the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her , and for her alone . Those cells belonged to her . She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life , and her authority was recognized among them . Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them , and rooms which they were at liberty to make , if not exactly elegant or comfortable , at any rate clean and healthy ? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice , the victim would have borne it in silence . Such a gathering contained , as might have been expected , the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed . And , as in a school , as in the world itself , there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature , despised by all the others , condemned to be the butt of all their jokes . At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth , this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come . This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli-merchant , Father Goriot , upon whose face a painter , like the historian , would have concentrated all the light in his picture . How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt ? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution , in which there was mingled some pity , but no respect for his misfortunes ? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity , which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects ? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice . Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering , whether by reason of its genuine humility , or indifference , or sheer helplessness . Do we not , one and all , like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something ? The poorest sample of humanity , the street arab , will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather , and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument . In the year 1813 , at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts , "" Father Goriot "" had sold his business and retired--to Mme . Vauquer's boarding house . When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme . Couture ; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle . For him Mme . Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use , in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance , so it was said , for the miserable furniture , that is to say , for some yellow cotton curtains , a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet , several wretched colored prints in frames , and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained . Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life ( they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then ) that gave Mme . Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities ; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned . Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe , the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing . Mme . Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts , the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond , and connected by a short chain , an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front . He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue ; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat , and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse . When his hostess accused him of being "" a bit of a beau , "" he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified . His cupboards ( _ormoires_ , as he called them in the popular dialect ) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him . The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles , table-spoons , forks , cruet-stands , tureens , dishes , and breakfast services--all of silver , which were duly arranged upon shelves , besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate , all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces ; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals . "" This was my wife 's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day , "" he said to Mme . Vauquer , as he put away a little silver posset dish , with two turtle-doves billing on the cover . "" Poor dear ! she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married . Do you know , I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living , madame , than part with that . But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days , thank the Lord ! I am not to be pitied . There 's not much fear of my starving for some time to come . "" Finally , Mme . Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds , and , after a rough calculation , was disposed to credit Goriot ( worthy man ) with something like ten thousand francs a year . From that day forward Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) , who , as a matter of fact , had seen forty-eight summers , though she would only own to thirty-nine of them--Mme . Vauquer had her own ideas . Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets , though they were weak and watery , owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually , she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man . Moreover , the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose , indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature . This , in all probability , was a strongly-build animal , whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection . His hair , worn in _ailes de pigeon_ , and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique , described five points on his low forehead , and made an elegant setting to his face . Though his manners were somewhat boorish , he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way , like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy , so that when Mme . Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation , her heart , like a larded partridge , sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot . She would marry again , sell her boarding-house , give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship , become a lady of consequence in the quarter , and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes ; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy , Soissy , Gentilly ; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked , instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her , in July ; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme . Vauquer in her dreams . Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs , accumulated _sou by sou_ , that was her secret ; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match . "" And in other respects , I am quite his equal , "" she said to herself , turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning . For three months from that day Mme . Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur , and went to some expense over her toilette , expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence . She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers , announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select . If a stranger presented himself , she let him know that M. Goriot , one of the best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris , had singled out her boarding-house for a residence . She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER , in which it was asserted that hers was "" _one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter_ . "" "" From the windows of the house , "" thus ran the prospectus , "" there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins ( so there is--from the third floor ) , and a _beautiful_ garden , _extending_ down to _an avenue of lindens_ at the further end . "" Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation . It was this prospectus that attracted Mme . la Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil , a widow of six and thirty , who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs , and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died "" on the field of battle . "" On this Mme . Vauquer saw to her table , lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months , and kept the promise of her prospectus , even going to some expense to do so . And the Countess , on her side , addressed Mme . Vauquer as "" my dear , "" and promised her two more boarders , the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel , the late Comte de Picquoisie , who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais , where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer . Both these ladies , moreover , would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities . "" But Government departments are always so dilatory , "" the lady added . After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme . Vauquer's room , and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house . Mme . Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil ; it was a capital notion , which for that matter she had guessed from the very first ; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man . "" Ah ! my dear lady , such a well-preserved man of his age , as sound as my eyesight--a man who might make a woman happy ! "" said the widow . The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme . Vauquer's dress , which was not in harmony with her projects . "" You must put yourself on a war footing , "" said she . After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together--they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal , and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette , where they chose a dress and a scarf . Thus equipped for the campaign , the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop ; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement , as she considered it , in her appearance , that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess ; and , though by no means open-handed , she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs . The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot ; the countess must sing her praises in his ears . Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre , began her operations , and succeeded in obtaining a private interview ; but the overtures that she made , with a view to securing him for herself , were received with embarrassment , not to say a repulse . She left him , revolted by his coarseness . "" My angel , "" said she to her dear friend , "" you will make nothing of that man yonder . He is absurdly suspicious , and he is a mean curmudgeon , an idiot , a fool ; you would never be happy with him . "" After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil , the Countess would no longer live under the same roof . She left the next day , forgot to pay for six months' board , and left behind her wardrobe , cast-off clothing to the value of five francs . Eagerly and persistently as Mme . Vauquer sought her quondam lodger , the Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris . The widow often talked of this deplorable business , and regretted her own too confiding disposition . As a matter of fact , she was as suspicious as a cat ; but she was like many other people , who can not trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon , whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart . Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live ; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates , and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged , and that they deserve to be judged severely ; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear , or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess , in the eyes of a new audience , the qualities which they have not , hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day . Or , once more , there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them , while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love . Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them ; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance , and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits . Mme . Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean , false , and execrable classes . "" If I had been there at the time , "" Vautrin would say at the end of the story , "" I would have shown her up , and that misfortune would not have befallen you . I know that kind of phiz ! "" Like all narrow natures , Mme . Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events , and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about ; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people , so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune . It had opened her eyes , so she said , with regard to him . As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain , and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away , she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference . It became plain to her at once that there was _some other attraction_ , to use her own expression . In short , it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion , and that she would "" never make anything out of that man yonder , "" in the Countess' forcible phrase . The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character . Mme . Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship , for her hatred was not in proportion to her love , but to her disappointed expectations . The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection , but we seldom stop in the steep , downward slope of hatred . Still , M. Goriot was a lodger , and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath ; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent , she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment , and to gulp down her craving for revenge . Little minds find gratification for their feelings , benevolent or otherwise , by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity . The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution . She began by a course of retrenchment--various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more . "" No more gherkins , no more anchovies ; they have made a fool of me ! "" she said to Sylvie one morning , and they returned to the old bill of fare . The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot . Soup , boiled beef , and a dish of vegetables had been , and always would be , the dinner he liked best , so Mme . Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple . He was proof against her malice , and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers , who began to amuse themselves at his expense , and so gratified her desire for revenge . Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres , the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress , should be living in her house . Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses ? Until the first year was nearly at an end , Goriot had dined out once or twice every week , but these occasions came less frequently , and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice a month . It was hardly expected that Mme . Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency , when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest . She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess . It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness . Unluckily , towards the end of the second year , M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him . He asked Mme . Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor , and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges . Apparently , such strict economy was called for , that he did without a fire all through the winter . Mme . Vauquer asked to be paid in advance , an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented , and thenceforward she spoke of him as "" Father Goriot . "" What had brought about this decline and fall ? Conjecture was keen , but investigation was difficult . Father Goriot was not communicative ; in the sham countess' phrase he was "" a curmudgeon . "" Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them , naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about ; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel , and the late beau was an old rogue . Opinion fluctuated . Sometimes , according to Vautrin , who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer , Father Goriot was a man who went on ' Change and _dabbled_ ( to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange ) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation . Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs . A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time , but Vautrin urged that "" Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort . "" There were yet other solutions ; Father Goriot was a skinflint , a shark of a money-lender , a man who lived by selling lottery tickets . He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery ; yet , however vile his life might be , the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society--he paid his way . Besides , Goriot had his uses , every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him ; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words . The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely ; this was Mme . Vauquer's view . According to her , the man so well preserved at his time of life , as sound as her eyesight , with whom a woman might be very happy , was a libertine who had strange tastes . These are the facts upon which Mme . Vauquer's slanders were based . Early one morning , some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense , Mme . Vauquer ( not yet dressed ) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair ; some one was going to Goriot's room . He seemed to expect the visit , for his door stood ajar . The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest , "" dressed like a goddess , "" and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots , had glided in from the street like a snake , had found the kitchen , and asked for M. Goriot's room . Mme . Vauquer and the cook , listening , overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit , which lasted for some time . When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady , the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple , under pretext of going to do her marketing . "" M. Goriot must be awfully rich , all the same , madame , "" she reported on her return , "" to keep her in such style . Just imagine it ! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l ' Estrapade , and _she_ got into it . "" While they were at dinner that evening , Mme . Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain , as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes . "" You are beloved of fair ladies , M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out , "" she said , alluding to his visitor . "" _Peste ! _ you have good taste ; she was very pretty . "" "" That was my daughter , "" he said , with a kind of pride in his voice , and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances . A month after this visit M. Goriot received another . The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner , this time in evening dress . The boarders , in deep discussion in the dining-room , caught a glimpse of a lovely , fair-haired woman , slender , graceful , and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's . "" Two of them ! "" cried the portly Sylvie , who did not recognize the lady of the first visit . A few days later , and another young lady--a tall , well-moulded brunette , with dark hair and bright eyes--came to ask for M. Goriot . "" Three of them ! "" said Sylvie . Then the second daughter , who had first come in the morning to see her father , came shortly afterwards in the evening . She wore a ball dress , and came in a carriage . "" Four of them ! "" commented Mme . Vauquer and her plump handmaid . Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit . At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady , and Mme . Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses ; nay , she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters . She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line , or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer ; yet , inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her , she went so far ( at the end of the second year ) as to speak of him as an "" ugly old wretch . "" When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year , she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be , after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs . Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter . "" So you have two or three dozen daughters , have you ? "" said Mme . Vauquer sharply . "" I have only two , "" her boarder answered meekly , like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune . Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further ; he went up to the third story , and now paid forty-five francs a month . He did without snuff , told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services , and gave up wearing powder . When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition , an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy olive gray . He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble ; among all the faces round the table , his was the most woe-begone . There was no longer any doubt . Goriot was an elderly libertine , whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health . The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career . The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him . When his outfit was worn out , he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_ the ell . His diamonds , his gold snuff-box , watch-chain and trinkets , disappeared one by one . He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue coat , and was sumptuously arrayed , summer as well as winter , in a coarse chestnut-brown coat , a plush waistcoat , and doeskin breeches . He grew thinner and thinner ; his legs were shrunken , his cheeks , once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity , were covered with wrinkles , and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible ; there were deep furrows in his forehead . In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self . The hale vermicelli manufacturer , sixty-two years of age , who had looked scarce forty , the stout , comfortable , prosperous tradesman , with an almost bucolic air , and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him ; the man with something boyish in his smile , had suddenly sunk into his dotage , and had become a feeble , vacillating septuagenarian . The keen , bright blue eyes had grown dull , and faded to a steel-gray color ; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood . He excited feelings of repulsion in some , and of pity in others . The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle ; and , after teasing him for some time to no purpose , they declared that cretinism was setting in . One evening after dinner Mme . Vauquer said half banteringly to him , "" So those daughters of yours do n't come to see you any more , eh ? "" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity ; but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point . "" They come sometimes , "" he said in a tremulous voice . "" Aha ! you still see them sometimes ? "" cried the students . "" Bravo , Father Goriot ! "" The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words ; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor , due to his lack of intelligence . If they had only known , they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition ; but few problems were more obscure . It was easy , of course , to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer ; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable ; but the old people , who were most inquisitive as to his concerns , never went beyond the limits of the Quarter , and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock . As for the rest , the current of life in Paris daily awaited them , and swept them away with it ; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , they forgot the existence of the old man , their butt at dinner . For those narrow souls , or for careless youth , the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence . As for the creatures whom he called his daughters , all Mme . Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion . With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances , she was wont to reason thus : "" If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be , he would not be lodging in my house , on the third floor , at forty-five francs a month ; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man . "" No objection could be raised to these inferences . So by the end of the month of November 1819 , at the time when the curtain rises on this drama , every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man . He had never had either wife or daughter ; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition ; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe , so one of the dinner contingent , an _employe_ at the Museum , who had a pretty wit of his own . Poiret was an eagle , a gentleman , compared with Goriot . Poiret would join the talk , argue , answer when he was spoken to ; as a matter of fact , his talk , arguments , and responses contributed nothing to the conversation , for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words ; still , he did join in the talk ; he was alive , and seemed capable of feeling ; while Father Goriot ( to quote the Museum official again ) was invariably at zero degrees--Reaumur . Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers , and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position , that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level . Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements . A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre , and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris . To know its customs ; to learn the language , and become familiar with the amusements of the capital , he must explore its recesses , good and bad , follow the studies that please him best , and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums . At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance . He has his hero , his great man , a professor at the College de France , paid to talk down to the level of his audience . He adjusts his cravat , and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera-Comique . As he passes through all these successive initiations , and breaks out of his sheath , the horizons of life widen around him , and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed . If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees , he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners . Unconsciously , Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law . The illusions of childhood had vanished , so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces ; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed , with loftier ambitions , and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house . His father and mother , his two brothers and two sisters , with an aged aunt , whose whole fortune consisted in annuities , lived on the little estate of Rastignac . The whole property brought in about three thousand francs ; and though the amount varied with the season ( as must always be the case in a vine-growing district ) , they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him . He saw how constantly the poverty , which they had generously hidden from him , weighed upon them ; he could not help comparing the sisters , who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes , with women in Paris , who had realized the beauty of his dreams . The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him . It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house , nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing ; a multitude of small things , which it is useless to speak of in detail here , made him burn to distinguish himself , and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold . He meant , like all great souls , that his success should be owing entirely to his merits ; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament , the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea , uncertain how to spend its energies , whither to steer its course , how to adapt its sails to the winds . At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work , but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections ; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life , and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there . Surely a clever and high-spirited young man , whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination , need not despair of finding a protectress . These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters , whom he had once joined so gaily . The girls thought him very much changed . His aunt , Mme . de Marcillac , had been presented at court , and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region . Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers , which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces , the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit . He began to ask his aunt about those relations ; some of the old ties might still hold good . After much shaking of the branches of the family tree , the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse . To this lady , therefore , she wrote in the old-fashioned style , recommending Eugene to her ; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme . de Beauseant , the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations . A few days after his return to Paris , therefore , Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme . de Beauseant . The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening . This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819 . A few days later , after Mme . de Beauseant's ball , Eugene came in at two o ' clock in the morning . The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight . It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter . The spell of a factitious energy was upon him ; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world . He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer ; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance , as he had done sometimes on former occasions , after a fete at the Prado , or a ball at the Odeon , splashing his silk stockings thereby , and ruining his pumps . It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door ; and Rastignac , coming in at that moment , could go up to his room without making any noise , followed by Christophe , who made a great deal . Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers , kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel , and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs . Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books . He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion , that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . And not only so , she was , by right of her fortune , and the name she bore , one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world . Thanks to the aunt , thanks to Mme . de Marcillac's letter of introduction , the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him . It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons ; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris , and now all doors were open for him . Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly , and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse ; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities , one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy . The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made ; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris . Imagine a pair of great dark eyes , a magnificently moulded hand , a shapely foot . There was a fiery energy in her movements ; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "" a thoroughbred , "" "" a pure pedigree , "" these figures of speech have replaced the "" heavenly angel "" and Ossianic nomenclature ; the old mythology of love is extinct , doomed to perish by modern dandyism . But for Rastignac , Mme . Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed . He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan , and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille . "" Where shall I meet you again , Madame ? "" he asked abruptly , and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well . "" Oh , everywhere ! "" said she , "" in the Bois , at the Bouffons , in my own house . "" With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper , he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess , making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him . When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme . de Beauseant's , the Countess , whom he took for a great lady , asked him to call at her house , and after her parting smile , Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit . He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance , a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period ; the coterie of Maulincourts , Maximes de Trailles , de Marsays , Ronquerolles , Ajuda-Pintos , and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris--Lady Brandon , the Duchesse de Langeais , the Comtesse de Kergarouet , Mme . de Serizy , the Duchesse de Carigliano , the Comtesse Ferraud , Mme . de Lanty , the Marquise d ' Aiglemont , Mme . Firmiani , the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d ' Espard , the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus . Luckily , therefore , for him , the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau , the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais , a general as simple as a child ; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder . Ah , what it is to be young , eager to see the world , greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams , and behold two houses open their doors to you ! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d ' Antin ; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms , conscious that , possessing sufficient good looks , you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart ! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible , and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles . He sat there with his thoughts for a while , Law on the one hand , and Poverty on the other , beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull , smouldering fire . Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing ? who would not have pictured it full of success ? His wondering thoughts took wings ; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future ; he was sitting by Mme . de Restaud's side , when a sort of sigh , like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph , broke the silence of the night . It vibrated through the student , who took the sound for a death groan . He opened his door noiselessly , went out upon the landing , and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door . Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill ; he went over and looked through the keyhole ; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries . The table was upturned , and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them ; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape ; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots . "" _Peste ! _ what a man ! "" said Rastignac , as he watched Goriot's muscular arms ; there was not a sound in the room while the old man , with the aid of the rope , was kneading the silver like dough . "" Was he then , indeed , a thief , or a receiver of stolen goods , who affected imbecility and decrepitude , and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely ? "" Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions , then he looked again through the keyhole . Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope ; he had covered the table with a blanket , and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar , an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity . "" Why , he must be as strong as Augustus , King of Poland ! "" said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished . Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork , tears fell from his eyes , he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver , and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again . "" He is mad , "" thought the student . "" _Poor child ! _ "" Father Goriot said aloud . Rastignac , hearing those words , concluded to keep silence ; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor . He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears ; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers . Eugene listened ; two men there certainly were , he could hear their breathing . Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door , no footsteps in the passage . Suddenly , too , he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story ; it came from M. Vautrin's room . "" There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house ! "" he said to himself . He went part of the way downstairs and listened again . The rattle of gold reached his ears . In another moment the light was put out , and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men , but no sound of a door being opened or shut . The two men went downstairs , the faint sounds growing fainter as they went . "" Who is there ? "" cried Mme . Vauquer out of her bedroom window . "" I , Mme . Vauquer , "" answered Vautrin's deep bass voice . "" I am coming in . "" "" That is odd ! Christophe drew the bolts , "" said Eugene , going back to his room . "" You have to sit up at night , it seems , if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris . "" These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams ; he betook himself to his work , but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation ; Mme . de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future ; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists . When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night , the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning . Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty . The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time ; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather , and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o ' clock . On this morning it was half-past nine , and Mme . Vauquer still lay abed . Christophe was late , Sylvie was late , but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual . It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own , and to boil the remainder for some time , so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction . "" Sylvie , "" said Christophe , as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee , "" M. Vautrin , who is not such a bad sort , all the same , had two people come to see him again last night . If madame says anything , mind you say nothing about it . "" "" Has he given you something ? "" "" He gave me a five-franc piece this month , which is as good as saying , ' Hold your tongue . ' "" "" Except him and Mme . Couture , who does n ' t look twice at every penny , there 's no one in the house that does n ' t try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year , "" said Sylvie . "" And , after all , "" said Christophe , "" what do they give you ? A miserable five-franc piece . There is Father Goriot , who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past . There is that old beggar Poiret , who goes without blacking altogether ; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots . Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student , who gives me a couple of francs . Two francs will not pay for my brushes , and he sells his old clothes , and gets more for them than they are worth . Oh ! they 're a shabby lot ! "" "" Pooh ! "" said Sylvie , sipping her coffee , "" our places are the best in the Quarter , that I know . But about that great big chap Vautrin , Christophe ; has any one told you anything about him ? "" "" Yes . I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago ; he said to me , ' There 's a gentleman in your place , is n't there ? a tall man that dyes his whiskers ? ' I told him , ' No , sir ; they are n ' t dyed . A gay fellow like him has n ' t the time to do it . ' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards , he said , ' Quite right , my boy . That is the way to answer them . There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known ; it might spoil many a match . ' "" "" Well , and for my part , "" said Sylvie , "" a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt . Such bosh ! There , "" she cried , interrupting herself , "" that 's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace , and not a soul stirring ! "" "" Pooh ! they are all gone out . Mme . Couture and the girl went out at eight o ' clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne . Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel , and the student wo n ' t be back from his lecture till ten o ' clock . I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs ; Father Goriot knocked up against me , and his parcel was as hard as iron . What is the old fellow up to , I wonder ? He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them ; they can never let him alone ; but he is a good man , all the same , and worth more than all of them put together . He does n ' t give you much himself , but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips ; they are dressed grandly , too . "" "" His daughters , as he calls them , eh ? There are a dozen of them . "" "" I have never been to more than two--the two who came here . "" "" There is madame moving overhead ; I shall have to go , or she will raise a fine racket . Just keep an eye on the milk , Christophe ; do n't let the cat get at it . "" Sylvie went up to her mistress' room . "" Sylvie ! How is this ? It 's nearly ten o ' clock , and you let me sleep like a dormouse ! Such a thing has never happened before . "" "" It 's the fog ; it is that thick , you could cut it with a knife . "" "" But how about breakfast ? "" "" Bah ! the boarders are possessed , I 'm sure . They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight . "" "" Do speak properly , Sylvie , "" Mme . Vauquer retorted ; "" say a blink of daylight . "" "" Ah , well , madame , whichever you please . Anyhow , you can have breakfast at ten o ' clock . La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred . There are only those two upstairs , and they are sleeping like the logs they are . "" "" But , Sylvie , you put their names together as if ---- "" "" As if what ? "" said Sylvie , bursting into a guffaw . "" The two of them make a pair . "" "" It is a strange thing , is n't it , Sylvie , how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door ? "" "" Not at all , madame . Christophe heard M. Vautrin , and went down and undid the door . And here are you imagining that ---- ? "" "" Give me my bodice , and be quick and get breakfast ready . Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes , and you can put the stewed pears on the table , those at five a penny . "" A few moments later Mme . Vauquer came down , just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk , and begin to lap in all haste . "" Mistigris ! "" she cried . The cat fled , but promptly returned to rub against her ankles . "" Oh ! yes , you can wheedle , you old hypocrite ! "" she said . "" Sylvie ! Sylvie ! "" "" Yes , madame ; what is it ? "" "" Just see what the cat has done ! "" "" It is all that stupid Christophe's fault . I told him to stop and lay the table . What has become of him ? Do n't you worry , madame ; Father Goriot shall have it . I will fill it up with water , and he wo n ' t know the difference ; he never notices anything , not even what he eats . "" "" I wonder where the old heathen can have gone ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , setting the plates round the table . "" Who knows ? He is up to all sorts of tricks . "" "" I have overslept myself , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" But madame looks as fresh as a rose , all the same . "" The door bell rang at that moment , and Vautrin came through the sitting-room , singing loudly : "" ' Tis the same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance .. "" Oh ! Mamma Vauquer ! good-morning ! "" he cried at the sight of his hostess , and he put his arm gaily round her waist . "" There ! have done ---- "" "" ' Impertinence ! ' Say it ! "" he answered . "" Come , say it ! Now , is n't that what you really mean ? Stop a bit , I will help you to set the table . Ah ! I am a nice man , am I not ? "" For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover ... "" Oh ! I have just seen something so funny ---- .... led by chance . "" "" What ? "" asked the widow . "" Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning . They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there , and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum . It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that 's not used to the trade . "" "" Really ? You do n't say so ? "" "" Yes . One of my friends is expatriating himself ; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer , and was coming back here . I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do ; it is a comical affair . He came back to this quarter of the world , to the Rue des Gres , and went into a money-lender's house ; everybody knows him , Gobseck , a stuck-up rascal , that would make dominoes out of his father's bones , a Turk , a heathen , an old Jew , a Greek ; it would be a difficult matter to rob _him_ , for he puts all his coin into the Bank . "" "" Then what was Father Goriot doing there ? "" "" Doing ? "" said Vautrin . "" Nothing ; he was bent on his own undoing . He is a simpleton , stupid enough to ruin himself by running after ---- "" "" There he is ! "" cried Sylvie . "" Christophe , "" cried Father Goriot's voice , "" come upstairs with me . "" Christophe went up , and shortly afterwards came down again . "" Where are you going ? "" Mme . Vauquer asked of her servant . "" Out on an errand for M. Goriot . "" "" What may that be ? "" said Vautrin , pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand . "" _Mme . la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud_ , "" he read . "" Where are you going with it ? "" he added , as he gave the letter back to Christophe . "" To the Rue du Helder . I have orders to give this into her hands myself . "" "" What is there inside it ? "" said Vautrin , holding the letter up to the light . "" A banknote ? No. "" He peered into the envelope . "" A receipted account ! "" he cried . "" My word ! ' tis a gallant old dotard . Off with you , old chap , "" he said , bringing down a hand on Christophe's head , and spinning the man round like a thimble ; "" you will have a famous tip . "" By this time the table was set . Sylvie was boiling the milk , Mme . Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin , who kept humming to himself : "" The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . "" When everything was ready , Mme . Couture and Mlle . Taillefer came in . "" Where have you been this morning , fair lady ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , turning to Mme . Couture . "" We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer . Poor little thing ! She is trembling like a leaf , "" Mme . Couture went on , as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze . "" Warm yourself , Victorine , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" It is quite right and proper , mademoiselle , to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart , "" said Vautrin , as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl ; "" but that is not enough . What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind ; a barbarian that has three millions ( so they say ) , and will not give you a dowry ; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays . "" "" Poor child ! "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" Never mind , my pet , your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself . "" Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words , and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme . Couture . "" If we could only see him ! "" said the Commissary-General's widow ; "" if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter ! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post ; he knew my handwriting ---- "" "" ' Oh woman , persecuted and injured innocent ! ' "" exclaimed Vautrin , breaking in upon her . "" So that is how you are , is it ? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs , and it will be all right , you shall see . "" "" Oh ! sir , "" said Victorine , with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin , who showed no sign of being touched by it , "" if you know of any way of communicating with my father , please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world . If you can induce him to relent a little towards me , I will pray to God for you . You may be sure of my gratitude ---- "" "" _The same old story everywhere_ , "" sang Vautrin , with a satirical intonation . At this juncture , Goriot , Mlle . Michonneau , and Poiret came downstairs together ; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast . The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning , and took their places at the table ; the clock struck ten , and the student's footstep was heard outside . "" Ah ! here you are , M. Eugene , "" said Sylvie ; "" every one is breakfasting at home to-day . "" The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers , and sat down beside Goriot . "" I have just met with a queer adventure , "" he said , as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton , and cut a slice of bread , which Mme . Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual . "" An adventure ? "" queried Poiret . "" Well , and what is there to astonish you in that , old boy ? "" Vautrin asked of Poiret . "" M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing . "" Mlle . Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student . "" Tell us about your adventure ! "" demanded M. Vautrin . "" Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant . She has a magnificent house ; the rooms are hung with silk--in short , it was a splendid affair , and I was as happy as a king --- "" "" Fisher , "" put in Vautrin , interrupting . "" What do you mean , sir ? "" said Eugene sharply . "" I said ' fisher , ' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings . "" "" Quite true ; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king , "" said Poiret the ditto-ist , "" because ---- "" "" In fact "" -- the law-student cut him short -- "" I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room , a charming countess , the most exquisite creature I have ever seen . There was peach blossom in her hair , and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers , that scented the air----but there ! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance . You ought to have seen her ! Well , and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o ' clock , on foot in the Rue de Gres . Oh ! how my heart beat ! I began to think ---- "" "" That she was coming here , "" said Vautrin , with a keen look at the student . "" I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck , a money-lender . If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart , you will find the money-lender first , and the lover afterwards . Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud , and she lives in the Rue du Helder . "" The student stared hard at Vautrin . Father Goriot raised his head at the words , and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment . "" Then Christophe was too late , and she must have gone to him ! "" cried Goriot , with anguish in his voice . "" It is just as I guessed , "" said Vautrin , leaning over to whisper in Mme . Vauquer's ear . Goriot went on with his breakfast , but seemed unconscious of what he was doing . He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment . "" Who the devil could have told you her name , M. Vautrin ? "" asked Eugene . "" Aha ! there you are ! "" answered Vautrin . "" Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well ! and why should I not know it too ? "" "" M. Goriot ? "" the student cried . "" What is it ? "" asked the old man . "" So she was very beautiful , was she , yesterday night ? "" "" Who ? "" "" Mme . de Restaud . "" "" Look at the old wretch , "" said Mme . Vauquer , speaking to Vautrin ; "" how his eyes light up ! "" "" Then does he really keep her ? "" said Mlle . Michonneau , in a whisper to the student . "" Oh ! yes , she was tremendously pretty , "" Eugene answered . Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes . "" If Mme . de Beauseant had not been there , my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball ; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else . I was the twelfth on her list , and she danced every quadrille . The other women were furious . She must have enjoyed herself , if ever creature did ! It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail , a galloping horse , or a woman dancing . "" "" So the wheel turns , "" said Vautrin ; "" yesterday night at a duchess' ball , this morning in a money-lender's office , on the lowest rung of the ladder--just like a Parisienne ! If their husbands can not afford to pay for their frantic extravagance , they will sell themselves . Or if they can not do that , they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor . They will turn the world upside down . Just a Parisienne through and through ! "" Father Goriot's face , which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day , clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's . "" Well , "" said Mme . Vauquer , "" but where is your adventure ? Did you speak to her ? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law ? "" "" She did not see me , "" said Eugene . "" But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o ' clock ! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o ' clock this morning . Was n ' t it queer ? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures . "" "" Pshaw ! much funnier things than _that_ happen here ! "" exclaimed Vautrin . Mlle . Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk , she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make . Mme . Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress ; the two ladies went out , and Father Goriot followed their example . "" Well , did you see ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle . "" He is ruining himself for those women , that is plain . "" "" Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot , "" cried the student . "" Well , and if you do n't , "" broke in Vautrin , "" we are not set on convincing you . You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet ; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion ---- "" Mlle . Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words . They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse . "" Aha ! "" said Vautrin , stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance , "" so we have had our little experiences , have we ? "" The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue . "" Well , "" he went on , "" when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads , they can not drop it . They must drink the water from some particular spring--it is stagnant as often as not ; but they will sell their wives and families , they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it . For some this spring is play , or the stock-exchange , or music , or a collection of pictures or insects ; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like . You might offer these last all the women on earth--they would turn up their noses ; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion . It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all , and treats them cruelly ; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear ; but no matter , the fools are never tired of it ; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker 's to give their last five-franc piece to her . Father Goriot here is one of that sort . He is discreet , so the Countess exploits him--just the way of the gay world . The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else . In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal ; but get him on that subject , and his eyes sparkle like diamonds . That secret is not difficult to guess . He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot , and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres . And now , mark what follows--he came back here , and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe , who showed us the address ; there was a receipted bill inside it . It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender . Father Goriot has financed her handsomely . There is no need to tack a tale together ; the thing is self-evident . So that shows you , sir student , that all the time your Countess was smiling , dancing , flirting , swaying her peach-flower crowned head , with her gown gathered into her hand , her slippers were pinching her , as they say ; she was thinking of her protested bills , or her lover's protested bills . "" "" You have made me wild to know the truth , "" cried Eugene ; "" I will go to call on Mme . de Restaud to-morrow . "" "" Yes , "" echoed Poiret ; "" you must go and call on Mme . de Restaud . "" "" And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there , who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered . "" Eugene looked disgusted . "" Why , then , this Paris of yours is a slough . "" "" And an uncommonly queer slough , too , "" replied Vautrin . "" The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage--you are a respectable person ; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a scoundrel . You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else , and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice ; you steal a million , and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue . And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice , for the maintenance of law and order ! A pretty slate of things it is ! "" "" What , "" cried Mme . Vauquer , "" has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish ? "" "" There were two turtle-doves on the lid , were there not ? "" asked Eugene . "" Yes , that there were . "" "" Then , was he fond of it ? "" said Eugene . "" He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate . I happened to see him by accident . "" "" It was dear to him as his own life , "" answered the widow . "" There ! you see how infatuated the old fellow is ! "" cried Vautrin . "" The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him . "" The student went up to his room . Vautrin went out , and a few moments later Mme . Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them . Poiret gave his arm to Mlle . Michonneau , and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes . "" Well , those two are as good as married , "" was the portly Sylvie's comment . "" They are going out together to-day for the first time . They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel . "" "" Keep clear of Mlle . Michonneau's shawl , then , "" said Mme . Vauquer , laughing ; "" it would flare up like tinder . "" At four o ' clock that evening , when Goriot came in , he saw , by the light of two smoky lamps , that Victorine's eyes were red . Mme . Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer ; it had been made in vain . Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend ; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them . "" My dear lady , "" said Mme . Couture , addressing Mme . Vauquer , "" just imagine it ; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down , she was standing the whole time . He said to me quite coolly , without putting himself in a passion , that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there ; that the young lady ( he would not call her his daughter ) was injuring her cause by importuning him ( _importuning ! _ once a year , the wretch ! ) ; that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her , Victorine ought not to expect anything from him ; in fact , he said the most cruel things , that made the poor child burst out crying . The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely ; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake ; that she would obey him without a murmur , but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter . She took it up and gave it to him , saying the most beautiful things in the world , most beautifully expressed ; I do not know where she learned them ; God must have put them into her head , for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk . And what do you think the monster was doing all the time ? Cutting his nails ! He took the letter that poor Mme . Taillefer had soaked with tears , and flung it on to the chimney-piece . ' That is all right , ' he said . He held out his hands to raise his daughter , but she covered them with kisses , and he drew them away again . Scandalous , is n't it ? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister . "" "" What inhuman wretches they must be ! "" said Father Goriot . "" And then they both went out of the room , "" Mme . Couture went on , without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation ; "" father and son bowed to me , and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business ! That is the history of our call . Well , he has seen his daughter at any rate . How he can refuse to acknowledge her I can not think , for they are as alike as two peas . "" The boarders dropped in one after another , interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty . Dulness is their prevailing ingredient , and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture . This kind of argot is always changing . The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event , an incident in the police courts , a street song , or a bit of burlesque at some theatre , and forgotten in a month . Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas . The diorama , a recent invention , which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas , had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with _rama_ . The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders . "" Well , Monsieur-r-r Poiret , "" said the _employe_ from the Museum , "" how is your health-orama ? "" Then , without waiting for an answer , he turned to Mme . Couture and Victorine with a "" Ladies , you seem melancholy . "" "" Is dinner ready ? "" cried Horace Bianchon , a medical student , and a friend of Rastignac's ; "" my stomach is sinking _usque ad talones_ . "" "" There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside , "" said Vautrin . "" Make room there , Father Goriot ! Confound it , your foot covers the whole front of the stove . "" "" Illustrious M. Vautrin , "" put in Bianchon , "" why do you say _frozerama_ ? It is incorrect ; it should be _frozenrama_ . "" "" No , it should n ' t , "" said the official from the Museum ; "" _frozerama_ is right by the same rule that you say ' My feet are _froze_ . ' "" "" Ah ! ah ! "" "" Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac , Doctor of the Law of Contraries , "" cried Bianchon , seizing Eugene by the throat , and almost throttling him . "" Hallo there ! hallo ! "" Mlle . Michonneau came noiselessly in , bowed to the rest of the party , and took her place beside the three women without saying a word . "" That old bat always makes me shudder , "" said Bianchon in a low voice , indicating Mlle . Michonneau to Vautrin . "" I have studied Gall's system , and I am sure she has the bump of Judas . "" "" Then you have seen a case before ? "" said Vautrin . "" Who has not ? "" answered Bianchon . "" Upon my word , that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through , give them time enough . "" "" That is the way , young man , "" returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers : "" The rose has lived the life of a rose -- A morning's space . "" "" Aha ! here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_ , "" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed . "" I beg your pardon , sir , "" said Mme . Vauquer ; "" it is _soupe aux choux_ . "" All the young men roared with laughter . "" Had you there , Poiret ! "" "" Poir-r-r-rette ! she had you there ! "" "" Score two points to Mamma Vauquer , "" said Vautrin . "" Did any of you notice the fog this morning ? "" asked the official . "" It was a frantic fog , "" said Bianchon , "" a fog unparalleled , doleful , melancholy , sea-green , asthmatical--a Goriot of a fog ! "" "" A Goriorama , "" said the art student , "" because you could n ' t see a thing in it . "" "" Hey ! Milord Gaoriotte , they air talking about yoo-o-ou ! "" Father Goriot , seated at the lower end of the table , close to the door through which the servant entered , raised his face ; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin , an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity , that still showed itself at times . "" Well , "" Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones , that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices , "" and is there anything the matter with the bread ? "" "" Nothing whatever , madame , "" he answered ; "" on the contrary , it is made of the best quality of corn ; flour from Etampes . "" "" How could you tell ? "" asked Eugene . "" By the color , by the flavor . "" "" You knew the flavor by the smell , I suppose , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" You have grown so economical , you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last . "" "" Take out a patent for it , then , "" cried the Museum official ; "" you would make a handsome fortune . "" "" Never mind him , "" said the artist ; "" he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker . "" "" Your nose is a corn-sampler , it appears ? "" inquired the official . "" Corn _what_ ? "" asked Bianchon . "" Corn-el . "" "" Corn-et . "" "" Corn-elian . "" "" Corn-ice . "" "" Corn-ucopia . "" "" Corn-crake . "" "" Corn-cockle . "" "" Corn-orama . "" The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room , and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look , like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand . "" Corn ? ... "" he said , turning to Vautrin , his next neighbor . "" Corn on your foot , old man ! "" said Vautrin , and he drove Father Goriot's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown . The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything . Christophe carried off his plate , thinking that he had finished his soup , so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table . Every one burst out laughing . "" You are a disagreeable joker , sir , "" said the old man , "" and if you take any further liberties with me ---- "" "" Well , what then , old boy ? "" Vautrin interrupted . "" Well , then , you shall pay dearly for it some day ---- "" "" Down below , eh ? "" said the artist , "" in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys . "" "" Well , mademoiselle , "" Vautrin said , turning to Victorine , "" you are eating nothing . So papa was refractory , was he ? "" "" A monster ! "" said Mme . Couture . "" Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit ; she is not eating anything . Eh ! eh ! just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle . Victorine . "" The old man had forgotten his dinner , he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl ; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable , -- the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her . "" We are mistaken about Father Goriot , my dear boy , "" said Eugene in a low voice . "" He is not an idiot , nor wanting in energy . Try your Gall system on him , and let me know what you think . I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax ; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now , to judge by his face . His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying . Oh ! you may laugh , Bianchon ; I am not joking . "" "" The man is a subject , is he ? "" said Bianchon ; "" all right ! I will dissect him , if he will give me the chance . "" "" No ; feel his bumps . "" "" Hm ! -- his stupidity might perhaps be contagious . """	Prose/Lyrical	Information/Explanation

The next year I swam a mile ( that was really tough ) and then when I was 10 I did a 5-mile Triangle : I canoed 5 miles , cycled 5 miles and then walked 5 miles !

I currently have a lot of work on , I 'm slowly clearing my list of things to do but there 's still a lot there . I currently contract for a company in Cardiff and I feel really bad that I 've not been working my full hours for them . They provide and will continue to provide a lot of work to me whilst I develop web based systems for them and also one of my closest friends works there , who got me the job , and I really do n't want to cause her or anyone else issues . I also decided to redevelop a major site of a client 's , my exboss to be accurate , and I 'd hoped to get it all finished off in March , however due to other various work I 've not even started it which has really upset me . So I spent yesterday evening in Dave's arms upset and highly stressed not really knowing what to do . I know it 's just because I 've let it all get on top of me and get too much , right now there 's very little light at the end of the tunnel , but once this clears I definitely wo n't let it happen again .

102	"I 'm going to take you on a journey very quickly . To explain the wish , I 'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people have n ' t been , and that 's around the world . When I was about 24 years old , Kate Store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work . Not only about responding to natural disasters , but involved in systemic issues . We believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce , innovative , sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives . So this all began my -- I started my life as an architect , or training as an architect , and I was always interested in socially responsible design , and how you can really make an impact . But when I went to architectural school , it seemed that I was the black sheep in the family . Many architects seemed to think that when you design , you design a jewel , and it 's a jewel that you try and crave for . Whereas I felt that when you design , you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you 're designing in . So you 're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it , but for the community as a whole . And in 1999 , we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo and I did n't know what I was doing , like I say , mid-20s , and I 'm the , I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website . We put a call out there , and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world . That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas . Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa , responding to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . That -- that led to 550 entries from 53 countries . We also have designers from around the world that participate . And we had an exhibit of work that followed that . 2004 was the tipping point for us . We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran and Bam , also following up on our work in Africa . Working within the United States , most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner , but go live -- I live in Bozeman , Montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations , or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre-Katrina , and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries I 've been to . So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere . And then also I will go into some more projects . 2005 Mother Nature kicked our arse . I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters . And because of the Internet , and because of connections to blogs and so forth , within literally hours of the tsunami , we were already raising funds , getting involved , working with people on the ground . We run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days , I had 4,000 emails from people needing help . So we began to get involved in projects there , and I 'll talk about some others . And then of course , this year we 've been responding to Katrina , as well as following up on our reconstruction works . This is a brief overview . In 2004 , I really could n ' t manage the number of people who wanted to help , or the number of requests that I was getting . It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone . So we decided to embrace an open -- basically an open source model of business , that anyone , anywhere in the world , could start a local chapter , and they can get involved in local problems . Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia . All problems are local . All solutions are local . So , and that means , you know , somebody who is based in , in Mississippi , knows more about Mississippi than I do . So what happened is , we used MeetUp and all these other kind of Internet tools , and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up , thousands of architects in 104 countries . So the , the bullet point -- sorry , I never do a suit , so I knew that I was going to take this off . OK , because I 'm going to do it very quick . So in the past seven years , this is n't just about nonprofit . What it showed me is that there 's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller , and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility , but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change . ( Laughter ) I 'm adding that to my time . So what you do n't know is , we 've got these thousands of designers working around the world , connected basically by a website , and we have a staff of three . By doing something , the fact that nobody told us we could n ' t do it , we did it . And so there 's something to be said about naivete . So seven years later , we 've developed so that we 've got advocacy , instigation and implementation . We advocate for good design , not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums , op-eds , we have a book on humanitarian work , but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy . We can talk about FEMA , but that 's another talk . Instigation , developing ideas with communities and NGOs doing open-source design competitions . Referring , matchmaking with communities and then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work , because when you invent , it 's never a reality until it 's built . So it 's really important that if we 're designing and trying to create change , we build that change . So here 's a select number of projects . Kosovo . This is Kosovo in ' 99 . We did an open design competition , like I said . It led to a whole variety of ideas , and this was n ' t about emergency shelter , but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years , that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in , and that they would rebuild their own home . This was n ' t imposing an architecture on a community , this was giving them the tools and , and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to . We have from the sublime to the ridiculous , but they worked . This is an inflatable hemp house . It was built ; it works . This is a shipping container . Built and works . And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building , but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks . So we 've engaged not just designers , but also , you know , a whole variety of technology-based professionals . Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes . Using strawbale construction , creating heat walls . And then something remarkable happened in ' 99 . We went to Africa , originally to look at the housing issue . Within three days , we realized the problem was not housing ; it was the growing pandemic of HIV / AIDS . And it was n ' t doctors telling us this ; it was actual villagers that we were staying with . And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10 , 15 kilometers to see doctors , you get the doctors to the people . And we started engaging the the medical community . And I thought , you know , we thought we were real bright , you know , sparks -- we 've come up with this great idea , mobile health clinics that can -- widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa . And the community , the medical community there said , "" We 've said this for the last decade . We know this . We just do n't know how to show this . "" So in a way , we had taken a pre-existing need and shown solutions . And so again , we had a whole variety of ideas that came in . This one I personally love , because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions , but about raising awareness . This is a kenaf clinic . You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land , and then once -- and it grows 14 feet in a month . And on the fourth week , the doctors come and they mow out an area , put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers , you cut down the clinic and you eat it . It 's an Eat Your Own Clinic . ( Laughter ) So it 's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS , you also need to have nutrition rates , and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti-retrovirals out there . So you know , this is a serious solution . This one I love . The idea is it 's not just a clinic -- it 's a community center . This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community , so it can be a self-sustaining project . Every one of these projects is sustainable . That 's not because I 'm a tree-hugging green person . It 's because when you live on four dollars a day , you 're living on survival and you have to be sustainable . You have to know where your energy is coming from . You have to know where your resource is coming from . And you have to keep the maintenance down . So this is about getting an economic engine , and then at night it turns into a movie theater . So it 's not an AIDS clinic . It 's a community center . So you can see ideas . And these ideas developed into prototypes , and they were eventually built . And currently as of this year , there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya . From that we also developed Siyathemba , which was a project -- the community came to us and said , the problem is that the girls do n't have education . And we 're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV / AIDS rate . And that 's not because they 're promiscuous , it 's because there 's no knowledge . And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV / AIDS outreach center , and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors . So that there would be a very slow way of developing kind of confidence in health care . And we picked nine finalists , and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region , and then the community picked their design . They said , this is our design , because it 's not only about engaging a community , it 's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process . So the winning design is here , and then of course , we actually go and work with the community and the clients . So this is the designer . He 's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in Kwa-Zulu Natal , Siyathemba , and they can tell it better . Video : Well , my name is Sisi , because I work at the African center . I 'm a consultant and I 'm also the national football player for South Africa , Bafana Bafana , and I also play in the Vodacom League for the team called Tembisa , which has now changed to Siyathemba . This is our home ground . Cameron Sinclair : So I 'm going to show that later because I 'm running out of time . I can see Chris looking at me slyly . This was a connection , just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center , in Tanzania . And we met , literally , a couple of months ago . We 've already developed a design , and the team is over there , working in partnership . This was a matchmaking , thanks to a couple of TEDsters : [ unclear ] Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli , who connected me with this amazing African woman . And we start construction in June , and it will be opened by TEDGlobal . So when you come to TEDGlobal , you can check it out . But what we 're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development , and we 've been involved in a lot of issues , such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina . This is a 370 dollar shelter that can be easily assembled . This is a community design . A community-designed community center . And what that means is we actually live and work with the community , and they 're part of the design process . The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the community center should be , and then eventually , the community is actually , through skills training , end up building the building with us . Here is another school . This is what the U. N. gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps . This was in August . This was the replacement , and it 's supposed to last for two years . When the rain comes down , you ca n ' t hear a thing , and in the summer it 's about 140 degrees inside . So we said , if the rain 's coming down , let 's get fresh water . So every one of our schools have rain water collection systems , very low cost . A class , three classrooms and rainwater collection is five thousand dollars . This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta . It 's built by the parents of the kids . The kids are out there on-site , building the buildings . And it opened a couple of weeks ago , and there 's 600 kids that are now using the schools . ( Applause ) So , disaster hits home . We 've see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that , but we do n't see the good stories . Here is a community that got together and they said no to wait , to waiting . They formed a partnership , a diverse partnership of players to actually map out East Biloxi , to figure out who is getting involved . We 've had 1,500 volunteers rebuilding , rehabbing homes . Figuring out what FEMA regulations are , not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild . Working with residents , getting out -- them out of their homes , so they do n't get ill . This is what they 're cleaning up on their own . Designing housing . This house is going to go in , in a couple of weeks . This is a rehabbed home , done in four days . This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker . She 's 70 years old . This is what FEMA gave her . 600 bucks , happened two days ago . We put together very quickly a washroom . It 's built , it 's running and she just started a business today , where she 's washing other peoples clothes . This is Shandra and the Calhouns . They 're photographers who have documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years . That was their home , and these are the photographs they took . And we 're helping , working with them to create a new building . Projects we 've done . Projects we 've been a part of , support . Why do n't aid agencies do this ? This is the U. N. tent . This is the new U. N. tent , just introduced this year . Quick to assemble . It 's got a flap , that 's the invention . It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field . I was 12 years old . There 's a problem here . Luckily , we 're not alone . There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work . More hemp houses -- it 's a theme in Japan apparently . I 'm not sure what they 're smoking . This is a grip clip designed by somebody who said , all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams . This guy , designed for NASA -- is now doing housing . I 'm going to whip through this quickly , because I know I 've got only a couple of minutes . So this is all done in the last two years . I showed you something that took 20 years to do . And this is just a selection of things that got happened in -- that were built in the last couple of years . From Brazil to India , Mexico , Alabama , China , Israel , Palestine , Vietnam . The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 -- that 's how old I am . So it 's a young -- I just have to stop here , because Arup is in the room and this is the best-designed toilet in the world . If you 're ever , ever in India , go use this toilet . ( Laughter ) Chris Luebkeman will tell you why . I 'm sure that 's how he wanted to spend the party , but -- but the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York , but this . And when you look at this , you see crisis . What I see is many , many inventors . One billion people live in abject poverty . We hear about them all the time . Four billion live in growing but fragile economies . One in seven live in unplanned settlements . If we do nothing about the housing crisis that 's about to happen , in 20 years , one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp . Look left , look right : one of you will be there . How do we improve the living standards of five billion people ? With 10 million solutions . So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone . Chris Anderson : Wait a second . Wait a second . That 's your wish ? CS : That 's my wish . CA : That 's his wish ! ( Applause ) We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website . So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000 dollars . So why not this many people ? Open-source architecture is the way to go . You have a diverse community of participants -- and we 're not just talking about inventors and designers , but we 're talking about the funding model . My role is not as a designer ; it 's a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world . And what we need is something that replicates me globally , because I have n ' t slept in seven years . ( Laughter ) Secondly , what will this thing be ? Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis , but they do n't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it . So Creative Commons has developed the developing nations license . And what that means that a designer can -- the Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it . As soon as that is built , anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free . ( Applause ) So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this , but still protecting their rights , here ? We want to have a community where you can upload ideas , and those ideas can be tested in earthquake , in flood , in all sorts of austere environments . The reason that 's important is I do n't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works . That 's too late . We need to do it now . So doing that globally . And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually . When you look at the face of an architect , most people think a gray-haired white guy . I do n't see that . I see the face of the world . So I want everyone from all over the planet , to be able to be a part of this design and development . The idea of needs-based competitions -- X-Prize for the other 98 percent , if you want to call it that . We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together . And the idea of integrating manufacturers -- fab labs in every country . When I hear about the 100 dollar laptop and it 's going to educate every child , educate every designer in the world . Put one in every favela , every slum settlement , because you know what , innovation will happen . And I need to know that . It 's called the leap-back . We talk about leapfrog technologies . I write with Worldchanging , and the one thing we 've been talking about is , I learn more on the ground than I 've ever learned here . So let 's take those ideas , adapt them and we can use them . These ideas are supposed to have adaptable , they 're allowed to be -- they should have the potential for evolution , they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world . What will it take ? There should be a sheet . I do n't have time to read this , because I 'm going to be yanked off . CA : Just leave it up there for a sec . CS : Well , what will it take ? You guys are smart . So it 's going to take a lot of computing power , because I want this to -- I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs , but utilize the designs . Also , a process of reviewing the designs . I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we 're doing stuff that 's standing , because those guys are the best in the world . Plug . And so you know , I want these -- and I just should note , I have two laptops and one of them there , is there and that has 3000 designs on it . If I drop that laptop , what happens ? So it 's important to have these proven ideas put up there , easy to use , easy to get ahold of . My mom once said , there 's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers . ( Laughing ) I 'm fed up of talking about making change . You only make it by doing it . We 've changed FEMA guidelines . We 've changed public policy . We 've changed international response -- based on building things . So for me , it 's important that we create a real conduit for innovation , and that it 's free innovation . Think of free culture -- this is free innovation . Somebody said this a couple of years back . I will give points for those who know it , I think the man was maybe 25 years too early , so let 's do it . Thank you . ( Applause )"	Opinion/Argumentation	Information/Explanation
190	"Distr . 19 September 2003 Original : ENGLISH Opening address Ms. Heli Jeskanen-Sundström , Director General , Statistics Finland Construction of an information society is the strategic goal of many countries . The building of an information society is not a detached process , but is tied to other social policy . Social change - especially when it is rapid - presents constant new challenges to decision-makers . There is a need for knowledge about the present status quo and its background and for relevant , reliable facts about the development trends in society . Capacity for continuous renewal and ability to adapt to changing customer needs are the prerequisites for staying competitive in business . New capabilities and ways of acting are also demanded of members of society . It is no longer enough to view change from the national perspective ; the effects of globalisation extend to the public sector , business enterprises , non-governmental organisations and ordinary citizens in every country . Countries want to compare their own development with that of others and seek for best practices . In this work , official statistics play an important role . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) started systematic development of statistics on the information society in the 1990s , although the first pilot statistics on the phenomenon were already produced in the 1980s , that is , two decades ago . The development of statistics on the information society has progressed in steps - initially through clarification of concepts and definitions , then by exploitation of existing statistical data and eventually by designing statistics requiring new data collections . The OECD's exhaustive publication Monitoring the Information Economy 2002 contains scores of quantitative indicators for the monitoring of the state of the information society in different countries . In Europe , the eEurope 2002 indicators of the Commission of the European Union are used to monitor the progress towards the information society in the Member States . Besides quantitative monitoring , qualitative measuring is also applied to the eEurope programme . Thus , examples of follow-up systems already exist for a world-wide monitoring mechanism . Many countries already produce regular statistics depicting the information society , but the capability to compile them varies considerably from country to country . Some international recommendations are already available on the instruments - framework , concepts , definitions and classifications - that are needed in the compilation of these statistics but work on then is not finalised . Experience has shown that the development of a new statistical system takes several years . As an example of this , the first draft of the Handbook of Environmental Accounting that has just been completed was produced as far back as the early 1990s . The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics approved by the United Nation ( UN ) in 1994 offer a good foundation on which statistical organisations throughout the world can build their activity . These principles state as follows : "" Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society , serving the government , the economy and the public with data about the economic , demographic , social and environmental situation . To this end , official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens' entitlement to public information . "" The UN's statement emphasises that official statistics must be compiled according to scientific methods and internationally recognised classifications and definitions . Protection of suppliers' data must be unconditional . The statement further stresses the importance of co-ordination and co-operation . These fundamental principles of the UN are the preconditions without which production and functioning of official statistics can not even be started . Statistics describing the information society must also be developed in compliance with these principles . In its Declaration of Principles document , the World Summit on the Information Society will most probably adopt the key principles relating to the establishment of a sustainable information society . These will form the cornerstones on which the Summit's action plan and monitoring system will be built . The Declaration ( Draft , July 2003 ) sets out targets on the following areas : Information and communication infrastructure Access to information and knowledge The role of governments , the business sector and civil society in the promotion of ICTs for development Capacity building : human resources development , education and training Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs Enabling environment Promotion of development-oriented ICT-applications for all Cultural identity and linguistic diversity , local content and media development Ethical dimensions of the Information Society International and regional co-operation The declaration emphasises the need of an adequate information and communication ( IC ) infrastructure and the necessity to raise people's skills and competence , opportunities for the exploitation of ICT applications in all areas of life , and support of cultural diversity and creativity . These goals also serve as pointers for the statistical system that is needed to monitor their achievement . The importance of education and competence can not be emphasised enough when we speak about the development of the information society . From the perspective of a producer of official statistics it is satisfying to note that a Plan of Action , putting emphasis on the role of statistics in the monitoring process is also being drafted in support of the goals set in the declaration . Realisation of the goals of the information society will almost certainly be chiefly measured with qualitative instruments . Achievement of the targets relating to the legal environment or removal of constraints will probably be easiest to monitor with country-specific status reports and lists of actions . Monitoring of the attainment of the set goals also needs quantitative measures . Fortunately these do not have to be produced from scratch . International organisations already today produce a host of statistical information that can also be exploited for the monitoring of this declaration . The declaration concerning the development of the information society is not the first or only programme targeted at globally equitable human development . The UN's Millennium Development Goals were adopted by the UN Millennium Summit held in 2000 . Monitoring of the attainment of these goals has already started and several indicators used in it are also relevant for the monitoring of the declaration on the information society . International organisations should ensure that the indicators and statistics used in the monitoring of the other global programmes can also be exploited in the monitoring process that is about to be initiated now . The workload of national statistical offices should be minimised by maximising co-ordination between the statistical systems of international organisations . Systematic statistical monitoring requires organisation , co-ordination and division of responsibilities among international bodies . The system has to be efficient , and overlapping should be avoided . It would be prudent to draw up an inventory of the information international organisations already possess and of the recommendations that have been issued . For instance , the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and the UN already collect statistical data that can be utilised . Successful selection of the essential ones , or so-called core indicators , of all the possible available measures is a major challenge to the monitoring of information society development . International organisations must also make sure that national statistical offices have at their disposal uniform and relevant concept definitions and other standards that support the compilation of statistics . Several examples of this already exist . Literacy of citizens is the decisive condition to the development of the information society . UNESCO conducts extensive collections of data on people's educational levels and participation rates in education in different countries . The ITU , for its part , follows the development and penetration of the telecommunications infrastructure in many countries . Existing mass communication and cultural statistics can provide data on printed media , and on digital content production and use in different countries . Besides providing classifications and methodological recommendations , international organisations already also offer tangible data collection instruments for statistical offices . The UN and the OECD , for instance , have published recommendations on how the information sector should be defined . The OECD has also reached unanimity about the definition of electronic commerce . Model questionnaires have been developed and approved within the OECD for inquiry surveys measuring the use of information and communication technologies . The purpose of these recommendations is to support the work of national statistical offices and ensure the availability of internationally comparable data . Unfortunately , monitoring of the progress of the information society can not be based on mere average figures for different countries . Besides producing data on literacy , diffusion of equipment stock or spread of Internet use , we should also know to what extent disparities in these occur between regions , or by socio-economic group or gender . Diverse national and international digital divide index calculation exercises have already been made . It is also necessary to monitor the impact of the taken measures on bridging this divide . There is also much international interest in statistics that can be utilised to analyse the coping of women and girls as exploiters of information technology . Over the past few years , the UN's city group - the Voorburg Group - which focuses on the development of statistics on service industries has been giving consideration to the development of statistics depicting the information society . The members of the group , thus far mainly statistical offices of developed countries , have had the opportunity to exchange information about their experiences and about best practices . The UN's Statistics Commission has discussed the establishment of a new forum for less developed countries . It might be defensible to suggest that while a monitoring system is being devised for the WSIS process , such a contact group be established within the framework of some subdivision of the UN . It would also be important to include the future users of the data in the development process at the international level . It is equally justified to wonder how international organisations could give assistance to less advanced countries in the development and compilation of basic statistics and indicators describing the information society . If support is given to the projects that are launched to implement the declaration , it would also be logical to support the development of the statistics that are needed in its monitoring . Commercial research institutes and private consulting companies produce a great deal of information about the penetration and use of information technology in different countries . The data are collected at the commission of customers who also pay for them , so demand for this kind of information quite obviously exists , and some of it is even available free of charge on the Internet . Why could the World Summit monitoring system not be based on this ? Use of statistics produced by commercial research institutes and consulting companies , as well as country-specific comparisons must be approached with certain reservations . The main concern relates to transparency of the used methods , which are often not publicly disclosed . Present research extends to a limited number of countries , mostly only those with the greatest economic influence . Data on developing countries are rarely available . The examined branches of industry or levels of education may deviate from those of official classifications , so the basic information otherwise available on them can not be used . Commercial research institutes generally only produce information that sells , which is fairly understandable . However , there is no commercial demand for many measures , such as those concerning equality between regions and genders , that are vital in the monitoring of information society development . When the World Summit adopts the Plan of Action , it entails initiation of an implementation and monitoring activity that will span over several years at both national and international levels . The information society perspective will become integrated into national policies . It also implicates that statistical offices will become bound by and committed to the development of statistics that serve the monitoring . Official statistics are expected , first and foremost , to give an accurate account of what is going on in society . Statistical offices must be able to provide relevant , reliable and up-to-date numerical information and support to decision-makers . Fulfilling this task is a major challenge to statistical offices at a time when society keeps changing fast and their resources are quite limited . The best foundation for statistics on the information society is a good infrastructure of official statistics . New data can often be effectively produced by reclassifying the data from household inquiries or statistics on manufacturing or foreign trade , or by attaching supplementary questions to existing survey inquiries . The cost of developing a new statistical system can be minimised by the exploitation of existing systems . Statistical monitoring of the information society has to be adapted to the other work and operating frameworks of statistical offices . At its next meeting in two year's time , the World Summit on the Information Society expects a follow-up report on the principles adopted at this meeting . This means that we have to be able to describe the present status quo and the development over the coming years . When new statistics are being developed it is good to bear in mind that the targets of statistical monitoring can not change from one year to the next , but time series are needed . The development work takes several years and requires close co-operation with the suppliers and users of data . When national information society programmes are being drawn up it is good if statistical offices can contribute to the work right from the beginning . A programme for the monitoring of strategies and action plans is vital , how else could their compilers obtain follow-up data on the present development that are impartial and independent , and comply with the ethical rules of statistics and research . As an example from my own country , Finland , I can quote that , keen to monitor progress , the Finnish Government charged Statistics Finland , in its first national Information Society Strategy in 1995 , with the responsibility to provide reports at regular intervals and to conduct occasional studies on the programme's impacts in society . Giving out a strategy means that we should be able to measure the development towards the given targets . Ever since then , Statistics Finland has participated closely in the national work on the development of the information society , and this work has also borne good fruit . Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of the United Nations , writes in the foreword of the UNCTAD E-Commerce and Development Report 2002 : "" If the world is serious about achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015 , ICT must figure prominently in the effort . Everyone - governments , civil society , private sector businesses - has a vital stake in fostering digital opportunity and putting ICT at the service of development . "" Extensive adoption of ICT and raising of skills levels are global challenges of the information society . There are intermediate steps and clear milestones in the achievement of these targets . The WSIS requires monitoring of the key principles of the declaration . How capable is the international statistical community of responding to the challenge thrown at it ? How the task should be organised and the work of international organisations co-ordinated is a major challenge . Successful and relevant outlining of the frame of reference into which the indicators derived from the declaration can be placed is crucially important . Naturally , concepts and definitions need universal approval and introduction . All this must be well on the way by the Summit in Tunis in two years' time . Producing globally exhaustive statistics on the development of society would be an ambitious goal even with a longer timetable than this . I believe , however , that national statistical offices are keen to take up the challenge , provided the procedures and guidelines are agreed upon ."	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

379	The meeting opened with Paul Davis ( PD ) outlining the structure of the agenda , stating that the evening would be segregated into defined sectors to address the following issues ; Andrew Hounsell : Précis of the content of the recent meeting held between Bob Holt and recognised supporters' group Paul Davis : T he current situation and events leading up to it . Mike Wilks : T he way forward - what can we do ? Open Forum : T he fan 's opportunity to reflect on , and comment on the situation . Andrew Hounsell ( AH ) AH reported on the meeting of fans' groups ( TrustSTFC , Supporters' Club , Disabled Supporters' Group , Loud and Proud ) with the club on Monday 25th September 2006 called by STFC , who were represented by Bob Holt , Ben Lambert , Martin Starnes , Sandy Gray's husband and Sarah Mildenhall . It was agreed that Bill Power ( Bill Power ) had made capital outlay to the club to the tune of £ 1,120,00.00 . The clubs view of this investment was that it fell into two categories : £ 1,000,000 as a share issue £ 120,000 as a loan Bill Power has disputed this and states that the full amount was made as a loan and is requiring repayment . BH stated as a separate issue that Mark Devlin ( Mark Devlin ) still had a role to fulfill within the club , and also assured those present that the door was left open for Bill Power to return to the club in the future . BH confirmed that , although a clause in the manager's contract exists that would enable him to speak to a higher level club , no approach has been made . It was also confirmed that Mike Diamandis ( Mike Diamandis ) had instigated the approach for the current management team and brought them in to the club . BH said that club accounts are prepared and are ready to issue to the shareholders . However he said a £ 700,000 overspend had occurred , although it was then further clarified that that was an overspend even taking into account the improved gates , so against budget it would more likely be over £ 1 million . BH said Linda Birrell ( LB Club Secretary ) had been made redundant as part of a cost cutting exercise , although she had not been required to work her month's notice . The board felt that LB's duties could be absorbed within the existing structure . This decision was taken without any consultation with the members of the existing structure that it affected , including Dennis Wise . Paul Davis ( PD ) PD gave a chronological summary of events that have developed with regard to Bill Power's involvement with the club dating back to late March / early April 2006 . In late March , the Trust were told in a meeting with Mark Devlin that Bill Power was going to be coming on board , and that he would put in an initial investment of c £ 1million . He and Mark Devlin were going to effectively run the ' football ' side of the business , leaving Mike Diamandis free to withdraw from that area of the club and concentrate on the ground redevelopment and his other business interests . A few weeks later , after a meeting with Mike Diamandis , he himself restated that this was to be the way things would operate and expressed his considerable relief at being able to withdraw from the day-to-day running of the club . So there was a clear understanding that Bill Power and Mark Devlin would run the football side of the club . It may have been a surprise then when Mike Diamandis brought in Dennis Wise and Gus Poyet ( and negotiated their pay structure ) , as this would clearly indicate Mike Diamandis was still very active in the ' football ' side of the business . That said , there is no indication that Bill Power or Mark Devlin were anything other than delighted to have Dennis and Gus on board . PD then referred to the official club statement issued on Monday which confirmed that a spending structure had been agreed for this season , which included a budget for the playing side , in a meeting during the close season between Sir Seton and James Wills , Mark Devlin and Bill Power . The statement made specific reference to the fact that Mike Diamandis was not present at that meeting but it was this meeting at which the spending plans for this current season were established . This is the agreement which was then rejected ( again according to the club's own statement ) at the board meeting three days before the start of the season - as spending and commitments on the basis of that plan must already have been undertaken ( it is ludicrous to suggest that Dennis Wise would not have been allowed to bring in backroom staff , players etc until a spending plan had been formally ratified a few days before the start of the season ) , this in essence amounts to a fundamental breakdown in the agreement reached during the close season . It is believed that this was the culmination of a series of ongoing disagreements throughout the close season between Bill Power and Mark Devlin on the one hand and Sandy Gray and Mike Diamandis , regarding how much freedom Bill Power was to have in the running of the football side of the business . And that the rejection of this agreement essentially marked a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the two parties . The meeting of the football club board then finished and immediately after the board of the holding company met and ( again as referred to in the club's official statement ) at the end of that meeting , Bill Power and his business partner Phil Emmel were offered the opportunity to buy the club outright if they did not like the way it was currently being run . Bill Power and Phil Emmel went away to consider their options . Sadly , shortly afterwards Bill and others were injured in the plane crash which obviously interrupted that consideration . In terms of there being a ' rift ' , it is significant that no member of the board visited the Bill Power or the club employees injured in the crash while they were in hospital , except Willie Carson , who visited Mark Devlin and Mike Sullivan to his credit . According to statements by Bob Holt at the meeting on Monday , this was because club officials were asked not to visit the injured parties . Both Bob Holt and Mike Diamandis have repeatedly stated that there was no rift between Mike Diamandis and Bill Power and asked ' How could there be when we 've not spoken to them since the accident ? ' . PD said that the fact that the man charged with securing inward investment in the club had not spoken to the club's first major external investor in 5 years , not even to pass on his best wishes , in itself spoke volumes . During this period of hospitalization the Paul Ince deal was being negotiated , if the board had misgivings about the deal then the signing should not have gone ahead . With regards to Linda Birrell it was widely recognized that she played a vital role within the club and that when she was made redundant she was given a month's pay in lieu of notice , which if the reason for her redundancy had genuinely been cost-cutting would have been vital to ensure a smooth transition . PD said that the departure of Linda is what effectively brought the whole situation to a head . The following Wednesday there was a meeting between the board of the club plus Mike Diamandis on the one hand ; and Bill Power's wife Terry and business partner Phil Emmel on the other . Bill Power had specifically requested that Mike Diamandis not attend , again further evidence of a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the two , but he did so apparently at the insistence of the Wills family . That meeting was the one ( again referred to in the club statement ) which resulted in Bill Power and Phil Emmel requesting the return of the money they had invested in the club and the well-documented disagreement as to whether that money was a purchase of share capital or a loan . Although PD believed that both parties would have been happy with the ' polite fiction ' of a statement saying Bill Power was withdrawing due to ill-health - no-one likes to wash their dirty linen in public - in the event a joint statement could not be agreed ( as Bill Power's side would not agree to a joint statement without resolution of the disputed shares / loan issue ) and the club decided , quite properly , to issue their own statement . No direct statement has yet been forthcoming from Bill Power due to legal complexities surrounding the investment issue . Mike Wilks ( MW ) MW introduced himself as a lifelong fan , former chair of the Supporters' Club , and current executive member of the club , and as someone who certainly had no axe to grind . He confirmed that he had no issues with Sir Seton Wills ( SSW ) , in fact quite the opposite and publicly thanked him for his continued support over the years , a point continually reiterated by all speakers MW explained he was a successful senior business executive and based on his substantial business experience said that basically the club as a business was technically worth virtually nothing , with a CVA in place , a 700,000 overspend and no accounts being filed . MW stated that the annual spend was £ 2.6 million and that was simply staggering for a league 2 club . MW would like to propose a consortium with the approval and support of the fans to replace the current ownership . The consortium primary role would be to secure financial investment to ensure the survival of the club . The investment would be conditional on the following points Linda Burrell be reinstated immediately Independent auditors to examine the affairs of the club over the previous 5 years All Dunwoody contracts to be immediately terminated and investigated A fans representative to be elected to the board . Mark Devlin to be retained as Chief Exec . MW stated that the level of finance required to undertake this action could be in the region of £ 2 - 3 million , although that would depend on whether a complete buy-out was necessary . MW also stated that Bill Power was aware of the views of the fans The floor was then thrown open to a general question and answer session . Votes from the meeting : Following the Q & A several motions were tabled and voted on : 1 ) To instigate active protests ( ie demonstrations etc ) against the non-football management of the club DEFEATED UNANIMOUSLY It was widely felt that this would be counter-productive at this stage and that no action should be taken which may have a negative impact on the players / football management 2 ) That the fans have lost confidence in the non-football management of the club and that the non-football management team should be replaced , but that this was not a criticism of the Wills family who continue to retain the utmost respect of the fans . CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY It was suggested during discussion of this motion that the admittedly awkward phrase ' non-football management of the club ' be replaced with ' board of the club ' ; this was rejected as it was pointed out that James Wills was on the board and the motion did not reflect any criticism of the Wills family . A rider was added to the motion expressing the respect of the fans to the Wills family . 3 ) That Mark Devlin should be allowed to resume his position as Chief Executive as soon as he is well enough and should be retained in that post ; and that the board should resolve the uncertainty over his future as soon as possible CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY 4 ) That Mike Wilks and TrustSTFC have a mandate to actively seek out investment from third parties and / or explore alternative ownership models for the club in order to secure the club's future CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY 5 ) That fans were united in their desire to see Bill Power re-engage with the football club and that Mike Wilks and TrustSTFC should attempt to enter into discussions with him to achieve this	News	News

801	Sound modelling is an important part of the analysis-synthesis process since it combines sound processing and algorithmic synthesis within the same formalism . Its aim is to make sound simulators by synthesis methods based on signal models or physical models , the parameters of which are directly extracted from the analysis of natural sounds . In this article the successive steps for making such systems are described . These are numerical synthesis and sound generation methods , analysis of natural sounds , particularly time-frequency and time-scale ( wavelet ) representations , extraction of pertinent parameters , and the determination of the correspondence between these parameters and those corresponding to the synthesis models . Additive synthesis , nonlinear synthesis , and waveguide synthesis are discussed .	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
1191	Whether you 're an amateur fighter with your sights set on the professional world or simply someone who 'd like to prepare for the worst , there are training fundamentals that will help any fighter get in gear . You 'll need to learn everything from the best training workouts , to what kind of food you 'll need to eat , as well as different martial art forms . Commit to a rigorous workout regimen . Professional fighters train for months before so much as entering a ring ; amateur fighters should try to do the same to not only reach their peak physical condition , but also perfect basic techniques . Three critical areas in which to focus your training are cardiovascular fitness , core strength , and muscle mass : Do cardio . This is the lifeblood of fight conditioning : fighters need to not only have excellent endurance , but also be able to summon a quick burst of power at a key moment in a fight . Fatigued fighters , on the other hand , tend to drop their arms , leave their critical hit points exposed , and fail to maintain a strong attack during the later rounds of a fight . To simulate the physical demands of fighting , do interval training . Do core exercises . Try performing exercises that involve many muscle groups . Lift weights . Eat foods that develop muscle . In addition to watching your intake of vitamins , minerals , electrolytes , and water to combat workout fatigue and the buildup of metabolic waste , emphasize healthy proteins to build bulk . Learn how to throw a punch . Start with a basic punch , making sure to practice with both the dominant and weak hand . Once you master the basic punching technique , try more advanced methods .

1565	The normal thing is for internet marketing specialists to take charge on their own on-page SEO and to outsource the link building aspect . This makes sense as they have specialist knowledge with conversion optimization and may constantly tweak landing pages . Having knowledge of both conversion optimization and SEO enables an internet marketer to build a high converting and well optimized landing page . The majority focus would be on the sales conversion aspect while good basic on-site SEO would enable each landing page to have a decent organic SEO ranking . Working with a company with specialist knowledge of internet marketing SEO can further improve potential returns . This is due to them having expert staff members able to deal with both aspects of performing SEO and optimizing landing pages for sales conversion . As more and more people turn to the internet to buy goods and services , it is becoming more important to rank highly on search engines to get found . Competition is fierce and will continue to grow in the next few years . This could mean a profitable internet marketer doing everything themselves quickly falls behind and struggles to survive . If they had outsourced the work beforehand when the times were good it would be easier for them to remain profitable as they would have a much more diverse product range to offer consumers .

1224	"Southern claims 96 % of conductors ' signed up ' for new role Southern wants drivers , rather than conductors , to operate carriage doors at certain times Nearly all conductors have signed up for a controversial new on-board supervisor role on Southern trains from January , the rail company has said . The conductors had until last Friday to respond to Southern's deadline , and 215 - 96 % of those required - have done so . The change to the role has caused a bitter dispute with the unions and has led to a series of walkouts . Mick Cash , RMT general secretary , said nothing had changed , members remained "" rock solid "" and the "" fight goes on "" . The latest 48-hour strike ended at midnight on Saturday and further stoppages are planned . Angie Doll , Southern's passenger services director , said : "" We 've now got over 200 conductors signed up ... disproving the union's claims that support is rock solid . "" RMT general secretary Mick cash responded : "" Nothing has changed in terms of the core issues at the heart of this dispute . It 's about basic rail safety and access to transport services for all members of our community . "" That ground has not shifted an inch thanks to the sheer pig-headed attitude of Southern Rail and their government pay masters . "" Our members remain rock solid ... and will not be bribed , bullied or beaten . That fight goes on . "" ' Spiteful act ' The new on-board supervisor roles will focus on "" customer service "" and move the operation of closing doors to the driver . A further 222 people will remain in their existing roles as conductors on certain services , Southern said . It is also planning to recruit a further 100 on-board supervisors to work across Southern and Gatwick Express services . Southern said the union leadership had "" stooped to a new low "" by calling a strike over Christmas , calling it a "" selfish , shameful and spiteful act "" . GTR , Southern's parent company , said its offer to the RMT to settle the dispute had now been formally withdrawn . Meanwhile , Aslef , the UK's biggest rail union , has suspended a strike ballot among its Southern members , because of "" technical difficulties "" .

493	"Thursday , 8 August , 2002 , 15 : 53 GMT 16 : 53 UK Turkmen leader to rename calendar Niyazov spends lavishly on spectacular palaces Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov has announced his intention to officially rename all 12 months of the year in commemoration of the country's heroes and most potent national symbols . It seems like he lives on another planet Turkmen man Mr Niyazov proposes to rename January Turkmenbashi after his official name , which means Head of all the Turkmen . Other months will be renamed to honour famous Turkmen poets and writers . He also wants the seven days of the week to be renamed , with uplifting phrases such as Young Day for Tuesday and Spirituality Day for Saturday . Mr Niyazov , who was attending Turkmenistan's annual People's Council , also said he wants to call the month of April "" Mother "" . In response , a speaker at the council suggested calling the month by the full name of the president's deceased mother , Gurbansoltan , which the president said he would consider . Public opinion Mr Niyazov already has several schools , cities , airports and even a meteorite named after him . Niyazov has ruled Turkmenistan unchallenged since 1985 Many people on the streets of Turkmenistan seemed unperturbed , but others were bitter regarding their leader's latest plans . "" This is a joke , the entire civilized world lives by the same calendar but Niyazov decides to set us apart once again , "" one man told the AFP news agency . "" It seems like he lives on another planet . "" Cult of personality The People's Council also called on Thursday for the eccentric leader to remain in power until his death , rejecting Mr Niyazov's proposal to step down and hold elections in 2010 , Reuters news agency reported . He was made president for life in 1999 . Mr Niyazov has ruled the country since he was appointed Communist Party chief in 1985 when it was still part of the Soviet Union . He quickly developed a cult of personality surrounding himself , suppressing legitimate political opposition . He has spent vast sums of money on lavish palaces and statues of himself , despite the country's increasing poverty . Much of the cash for such grandiose projects is thought to stem from deals involving Turkmenistan's rich oil and gas reserves ."	News	News
1521	"The Goldilocks Principle – Definition The Goldilocks Principle describes a situation that is "" just right "" rather than too much or not enough . This ideology is derived from the popular children's story and has been applied to many disciplines , including astronomy , biology , psychology , economics , and more . In astronomy , a Goldilocks Planet is one that is just the right distance from a star to be able to sustain life on the planet . In ecomonics , a Goldilocks Economy is one which sustains moderate growth and low inflation . In cognitive science or education , the Goldilocks Principle is observed when a task is neither too simple nor too complex for the learner to grasp . In medicine , The Goldilocks Principle is the ideal dosage of a drug for a particular patient based on their physiological needs . In each of these examples , optimal balance is reached within certain margins rather than reaching for extremes . In "" The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears "" each item in the cottage symbolizes a situation in Goldilocks's life that is out of balance . As she finds "" just right "" with the item , she discovers a state of "" just right "" within herself . Symbolically , the item serves as the medicine for a particular physical or energetic ailment in her life . The porridge provides physical nourishment . The chairs provide a sense of self as she "" takes her seat . "" The beds provide both physical rest and sleep as well as a sense of peace . Just as a doctor is considered on some levels a healer , the food , home , and energy of the bears in the cottage of this adaptation of the story is what heals Goldilocks of her ailments by bringing her to a state of equilibrium akin to The Goldilocks Principle . In this simple example , Goldilocks's encounter in the bears' cottage serves to bring "" just right "" to her root chakra ( food nourishment ) , her core chakra ( taking her seat in her Self ) , and her crown chakra ( sleep and dreaming in spirit world ) ."
