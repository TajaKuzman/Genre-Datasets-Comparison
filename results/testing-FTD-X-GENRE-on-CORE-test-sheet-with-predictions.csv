Great looking fish in the water, I would like to hook one even on a spin stick, to get one on fly would be awsome, they look like very fast fish . Paul Cunningham I nailed a monster out at NW reef of Exmouth a few years ago. We were working around birds and had them chase down a clouser at full pace. It pulled the scales down to 8kg which is a bit bigger than the usual suspects. I will see if I can find a photo and chuck it up. crasny1 a fairly uncommon catch, and probably not targetable. If they are there, go for it, if not, well go for something else. Paul that one off yours is ""massive"" compared to the 2 I have caught years ago off the Murion Islands trolling on a charter. They were immediately rigged by the deckies as ""Marlin Lollies"" but no joy on that front. The 2 I had was half that size mate, and I had a fight on a trolling broom stick, ie poor buggers didnt stand a chance. Would love to hook one light, then dance the merry dance, whether spin or fly. I think not, but they are very seriola looking. Are they family off Sambo's, Ambo's and YTK's?? Help Glenn or other knowledgables. I have to start work so to lazy googling!!!! soupster51 I wouldn't say I've caught them regularly but I caught a few. The things I've learnt: They seem to like structure either reef, FADs, log, etc. They school up in massive numbers so if you get one as by-catch and you want more they are generally there for the taking if you want them. Most effective lure for me is the small fly-like skirted lures that we use for smaller tuna species. "	Forum	Opinion/Argumentation

That's what I found out too, I couldn't use the recovery partition any longer after installing Windows 8 CP. Fortunately, and I learned this the hard, painful way 3 years ago, was to backup before making any major changes. And also to make a backup when the computer is new, after all crapware is removed, system updated & favorite apps installed. This way, I can go back to a ""fresh install"" anytime that I wish to. Every month, I backup my computers, prior to Update Tuesday. I do it before, so that if an update screws up my system, I have a fallback option. There are several free backup software options to use, such as Macrium, Todo 4 (which also does file backups) & Paragon has a freebie too, but haven't used that one. There's no excuse not to backup, given all of the options that we have. As far as a backup drive goes, it doesn't have to be fancy (or expensive). Many of us has upgraded our hard drives to increase capacity, these lower capacity drives makes for good backup drives. Enclosures for hard drives (make sure that the right kind is selected) can be found at Newegg for a reasonable price. USB3 enclosures will cost a bit more than USB2, but the speed will be there. I have both a USB2 enclosure (Vantec brand) & a USB3 Ineo docking station. 2.5 & 3.5 SATA drives will fit in the docking station. Neither cost more than $30, with free shipping.

7171	"Almost a quarter of Republicans think Obama 'may be the Antichrist' as 14 states sue over healthcare reforms Americans who suggest Barack Obama should rot in hell are apparently deadly serious. Nearly a quarter of Republicans believe the Democrat president 'may be the Antichrist', according to a survey. An even greater number compared him to Hitler. Just another boys' club: Barack Obama, centre on the phone, is surrounded by male aides at the White House as they plot healthcare reform this week in a new image released today. The President has been compared to the Antichrist Mr Obama was jubilant this week after securing his 626billion healthcare reform plan. But his triumph seems only to have inflamed his critics among the evangelical Christians from America's heartland who kept George Bush in power for eight years and have demonised his successor. More than half of the Republicans quizzed by Harris Poll, 57 per cent, believed the president was secretly Muslim, something he has consistently denied. And 67 per cent of Republicans who responded believed Obama was a socialist, despite his central leanings. The startling results came as lawyers representing 14 U.S. states filed lawsuits yesterday challenging an overhaul of the country's $2.5trillion healthcare system, minutes after President Barack Obama signed the landmark legislation. One joint lawsuit by a dozen Republican attorneys general and a Democrat claims the sweeping reforms violate state-government rights in the U.S. Constitution and will force massive new spending on hard-pressed state governments. Virginia went to court separately, while Missouri Republican Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said he would like to join the suit. The joint suit, led by Florida, was filed with a federal court in Pensacola, according to the office of Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum. In addition to McCollum, the Republican attorneys general from Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington joined the suit. The lawsuit says the law - which expands government health plans for the poor, imposes new taxes on the wealthy and requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions - violates the Constitution's commerce clause by requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance. Mr McCollum said: 'It forces people to do something - in the sense of buying a healthcare policy or paying a penalty, a tax or a fine - that simply the Constitution does not allow Congress to do.' Mr McCollum, who is seeking the Republican nomination to run for Florida governor, said the healthcare reforms would add $1.6billion to Florida's spending on the Medicaid health program for the poor. The Justice Department, which is responsible for defending U.S. law in court, pledged to vigorously fight any challenges to the new healthcare law. 'We are confident that this statute is constitutional and we will prevail,' said Justice spokesman Charles Miller. The White House agreed the suits would fail. 'There have been hearings about the constitutionality of the law, and I think there's pretty much widespread agreement that it is constitutional,' Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, said. 'I think we have governors who might be aiming for higher office who are starting to just send a message.' The suits were filed just moments after Mr Obama signed the healthcare reforms into law. But on the most historic occasion of his presidency so far, vice-president Joe Biden managed to put his foot in it. Gaffe-prone Mr Biden inadvertently broadcast the F-word to America after he introduced the President to sign his much vaunted health reform bill into law yesterday. After hugging Mr Obama at a a ceremony in the White House, Mr Biden leaned in and whispered in the President's ear: 'This is a big f****** deal.' The remark was caught on microphones recording the event that was shown live across the country. By last night, the clip was being replayed all over the internet. White House aides seemed to be unembarrassed, with press secretary Robert Gibbs later tweeting: 'Yes, Mr Vice-President, you're right.' Comments ( 315 ) Re: I feel sorry for those who called yourself ""allies"" ... this guy is pro-terrorists, pro-abortion (by the way, now I am going to pay for YOUR abortions, all you have to do is come to the US!!!) . This guy is anti-american, he is a traitor. - Ana, Boston, MA, 24/3/2010 5:34 Such harsh words for a president who hasn't screwed up this country half as much as W Bush, crazy that he even had a second chance to do such a crappy job. Sure Obama is not a saint, but he is far from a traitor or the ant-christ or hitler (hmmm has he killed hordes of people under the guise of religion?!) blah blah blah. People grow up, he is trying to work with a broken system that failed the masses...at least someone was grown enough to actually tackle this ""healthcare"" system that has allowed many Americans to die for absolutely no reason. ""center leanings""???? Are you out of your mind?!?!?! Obama is the left most president in HISTORY!!!! What are you smoking!?!?!?!!? Obama is an unabashed socialist. He is NOT a centrist in ANY definition of the word. He is roundly HATED in the U.S. by the productive component of the population. Sure, the leeches LOVE him - why wouldn't they? But those of us who produce, own businesses, work hard, we all HATE the evil little punk. 1861 Obama also killed America's Space Program.....Soviets wanted to do this for decades..... This will put the U.S.A. in debt of up to 9 Trillions Dollars....wonder how much taxes are going to be raised??? Barry Soetero brings this on himself: 1. Changed his name inexplicably to Barak Hussein Obama; 2. Full birth records are sealed and over $1M spent to prevent disclosure; 3. College records likewise under lock and key, so no way of knowing if he truly attended Occidental, Harvard, or whereever else he wants us to believe he attended; 4. Travelled to Pakistan during a time when Americans were not permitted to do so, subjecting him to relinquishment of passport rights; 5. Claims to be a ""Christian"" but will never say exactly what makes him one; 6. Attended a white-hating, angry, anti-American church; 7. Studied Islam during his formative years; 8. Bows to Arab (Islamic) royalty; 9. Can recite Islamic prayers perfectly; 10. Kneels in prayer in a Mosque; 11. He lies. Frequently. 12. Came to power in the US Senate by eliminating his opponents rather than beating them at the polls; 13. Surrounds himself with similar ethically-challenged people and appoints immoral degenerates. Obama is a Marxist. Nancy Pelosi is a far left-winger, so absorbed in controlling the populace, that she would sell her soul to the devil. The pieces for the anti-christ's appearance are not in place yet, though Obama has set himself up as the Messah--not just here, but around the world. Obama has stated in one interview that he is a Muslim first----when a man says that he's Muslim, one doesn't have to ""think"" it. The American people have given a terrorist the keys to the White House-and he is destroying America. I have to wonder why no one has stopped him. ""And 67 per cent of Republicans who responded believed Obama was a socialist, despite his central leanings."" Despite his central leanings? What idiot wrote that piece of twaddle? Name a single ""central leaning"" the man has demonstrated. All we have are his words, his actions, and his unverifiable history. And those are all hard left. There's nothing ""center"" about Barry Soetoro in his past, present, or the future he's inflicting on America. Alright, I'm not into religion and I'm not an evangelist...however, I say God bless McCullum! Obama is a socialist and is destroying America. Look at the polls...Americans do NOT want this legislation rammed down their throats! He doesn't seem to care, does he? However, how on earth can you call a man the Anti-Christ for wanting to extend healthcare to more people? Yes you may have to pay more in taxes but a little selflessness never did anyone any harm! I don't recall Democrats calling George Bush the Anti-Christ even when he was (illegally) blowing Iraq to smithereens. - Angee, Coventry, 24/3/2010 14:18 Since when is abortion healthcare? And why should God fearing people pay for the abortions or low lifes who use it like birth control? I think it kind of puts Obama and Bush side by side. George Bush couldn't think for himself...his staff ran the show he just acted in it...Obama is very smart, knows what he is talking about and believes in the changes he is calling for. AntiChrist might be a little overdramatic but its the exact opposite of God fearing. "	News	News
9960	"Showcase Main menu You are here The Gatekeeper Both those who were coming and those who were going had to cross the gatekeeper on their way. The passage he guarded was at the middle of a very long road, and he did not know of any other part of the road but his own. He used to ask travelers what lay farther down on either side, but they all said his was the only gate, and eventually he had come to believe them. Now he only asked them their names and gave them what they needed, depending on where they were going. The exchange was usually brief, because the gate itself was brief, and the travelers could not stop if they were ever going to get anywhere on such a long road. Most of them were already far away and had forgotten about the gatekeeper. Some even denied the rumors and said there was no gatekeeper. Still, the gatekeeper did not mind; he was used to being alone. There was a book the gatekeeper read from as he waited and he had been reading from this book for a long while when a traveler approached. The gatekeeper asked the man his name and the man was slow to answer. "" Death ?"" asked the gatekeeper. The man looked at him strangely and remained silent. ""Many have said in passing here that Death comes for everyone, but he has never come for me."" The gatekeeper closed his book and continued, ""They say only that he wears a watch, and that he always comes."" The man shook his head. He held out his arms and pushed up his sleeves, revealing his wrists; he wore no watch on either arm. The gatekeeper nodded and then he sighed. ""What is in the bag,"" he asked the man. ""Fortune, I hope."" The gatekeeper smiled. Then he narrowed his eyes. ""No clocks?"" ""I hope not."" The gatekeeper smiled again. He reopened his book because he kept his list in between two of the pages. He took it out and wrote a name down for the man. ""You will not want to come back,"" the gatekeeper cautioned. ""I hope not."" The gatekeeper slid the list back inside and closed the book. His eyebrows lifted slightly and he looked at the face of the man curiously. ""What makes you go?"" he asked. ""Fortune, I hope."" The gatekeeper smiled and shook his head as if at a boy he was fond of. He raised his arm up slowly and opened his large hand. ""Your bag please,"" he said. The man looked sad but he did as he was asked. ""Sorry,"" the gatekeeper said. ""You can't take anything with you."" There was a large pile of dusty bags to the side of the gate and the gatekeeper tossed this one on top. Then he handed the man a watch. ""Sorry,"" he said. The man looked disappointed but shrugged a smile. The gatekeeper opened the gate with his key. ""You may go now,"" he said. ""Good luck,"" called the man as he stepped forward. ""Not yet,"" said the gatekeeper as he turned back the time on his watch. *** There was a book the gatekeeper read from as he waited and he had been reading from this book for a long while when a traveler approached. The gatekeeper asked the man his name and the man was slow to answer. He examined his list and the eyes of the man rolled about as the gatekeeper scrolled. His fingers trembled up and down his sides and his legs seemed either about to flee or fall over. ""Here it is,"" the gatekeeper said. He looked up and smiled at the man. He had stopped moving. ""This way,"" the gatekeeper said. He opened the gate and stood aside for the man to pass. The man stood still where he was. ""Aren't I early?"" he asked. ""No, you must be on time."" The gatekeeper continued smiling and pointed to the man's watch. The man looked down at it and then back up at the gatekeeper. ""It's a mistake,"" he said. ""I must be early."" The gatekeeper shrugged and withdrew his hand. ""You may leave your bag over there,"" he said. ""Can't you check the list over,"" the man said. ""Isn't it possible there was a mistake? I couldn't have walked so quickly."" The gatekeeper shrugged again. ""There is no mistake I could have made,"" he said. ""If you walk on the road at all you will eventually arrive. And if you are here now, then now is the time you must have arrived."" ""I should have gone more slowly,"" the man said. He dropped his bag along one of the piles on his side of the gate. ""If I had stopped, I would have seen more."" ""If you had stopped, then you would not have gotten far enough to see anything."" ""But I am afraid,"" the man said. The gatekeeper shrugged again but now he did not bother answering. The man sunk his shoulders and dropped his face as he stepped onto the path beyond the gate. The gatekeeper took up his list and erased the man's name. *** There was a book the gatekeeper read from as he waited and he had been reading from this book for a long while when a traveler approached. The gatekeeper asked the man his name and the man was slow to answer. He wore a mask but it looked less like a mask and more like a missing face. "" Death ?"" asked the gatekeeper. ""I am an artist,"" said the man. Something about the man was smiling and the gatekeeper thought it might be the mask that was smiling. ""I must ask for your mask,"" he said. ""You know it is no mask."" The man pointed to the book in the gatekeeper's hands. ""I am an artist,"" he said. The gatekeeper waited a moment looking at the man. Then he closed his book. He raised his arm up slowly and opened his large hand. ""Only faces,"" he said. ""And so it is,"" the man answered. ""May I pass?"" The gatekeeper shook his head and held his arm where it was. ""You must have a face to be on that side of the road."" ""My face is on that side of the road,"" the man said. ""I am an artist."" ""Then count yourself lucky,"" the gatekeeper answered. ""None can take anything with them, and few can leave anything behind. But if you do leave something behind, then you cannot go back. For if you could go back, then you would not have left something behind."" ""I did not leave my name behind,"" the man said. ""None do. That is what allows you to start over on this side. A man with nothing is like a boy."" ""But the gatekeeper gives names,"" said the man. ""Perhaps you can write another for me on your list."" ""It would not be your name,"" said the gatekeeper. ""For your name was already given to you, and I cannot remember it."" There was no longer a smile about the man and the gatekeeper could not tell how long ago it disappeared; it seemed almost a different mask that the man was wearing. He took off the mask and turned around. *** There was a book the gatekeeper read from as he waited and he had been reading from this book for a long while when a traveler approached. The gatekeeper asked the man his name and the man was slow to answer. ""I am still only a boy,"" he said. The gatekeeper knew that they all wanted to be boys, that they all could think they were boys. He could understand this. ""I want to return home,"" said the boy. ""Is this the way?"" ""What home?"" asked the gatekeeper. All the travelers walked on the road to get somewhere, but none of them ever walked to get home. The gatekeeper could not understand this. ""You can't take anything with you,"" he said. The boy laughed as boys do and the gatekeeper wondered if he could understand where he was coming from. ""I am only a boy,"" he said. ""Boys have nothing."" The gatekeeper had to give boys their things. Sometimes he did not want to because sometimes he wanted to be boy. ""You want your home?"" the gatekeeper asked. The boy smiled. ""Take this."" The gatekeeper removed the list from the book and closed it. Then he raised it up and held it out for the boy. ""Here,"" he said. ""Take this."" ""What is it?"" asked the boy. ""It is a story,"" the gatekeeper said. ""I like stories."" ""An artist wrote it a very long time ago,"" the gatekeeper said. ""It was about his home. Maybe it can help you find yours if you do not know where to go."" The boy smiled and went through the gate. The gatekeeper hoped that sometime he would come back, though he did not think he would. *** All those who had been on the road had names, but few of them were remembered and only those names that were remembered could be on the gatekeeper's list. The list was very long, just as the road was very long, and the gatekeeper had been reading over this list when a traveler approached. He asked the man his name and the man was slow to answer. He pushed his sleeve up and revealed a watch around his wrist. He looked down at it and then he looked back at the gatekeeper. ""Sorry,"" said the man. "" Death ?"" asked the gatekeeper. The man shrugged a smile. ""Sorry,"" he said. He took his other hand out from his pocket and raised it up slowly before the gatekeeper. ""Your key,"" said the man. The gatekeeper took his key out from his pocket and dropped it into the man's hands. ""And your list."" The gatekeeper did the same with the list. ""Sorry,"" said the man. ""You have been a long time in coming,"" said the gatekeeper. ""So have you,"" said the man. He smiled and pointed to the gatekeeper's watch. ""You can keep that,"" he said. The gatekeeper looked down at his watch and nodded. Then he looked back up at the man. ""I am afraid,"" he said. ""I have not been on the road."" ""That is how it should be,"" said the man. ""Many are afraid of the gate, but crossing the gate is easy. It is the road that one should be afraid of, for it is only on the road that a traveler can fail to leave something behind."" He smiled again and the gatekeeper tried smiling with him. Then he opened the gate with the gatekeeper's key. ""Good luck,"" said the man, as he took his place before the gate. The gatekeeper sighed and then stepped away through the gate. The man wrote the gatekeeper's name down on the list and turned on his watch. Then he opened his book. He had been reading from this book for a long while when a traveler approached. "	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical
23790	"It is the Time to Remember The unfulfilled Promises In the wake of a democratic hiatus of 32 years, on 14 April 2003, and the third time in as many years that Somaliland had been given the opportunity to express their preferences at the ballot box. These bold steps towards the democratisation set Somaliland apart from the rest of Somalia Republic -- which has become by word a collapsed State since the downfall of Major General Mohamed Siyad Barre's tyrannical regime in 1991. The outgoing President of Somaliland, Riyale, had previously been a deputy President in late President Egal's administration until latter's death on May 3, 2002 -- and was hand picked by late President of Somaliland, Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal to supersede his predecessor, Mr. Abdurrahman Aw Ali Farah, who has been one of the highly respected of SNM high ranking officials -- and who hails from Awdal region. The elections held in the country, Riyale became the Somaliland's first democratically elected head of State, and his democratic election has gone into the history books -- something which is rare commodity in Africa, let alone in the Arab world. These democratic polls that materialised throughout Somaliland have been welcomed by the international observers and described them as free and fair and were in line with the internationally recognised electoral norms. As per their view, nothing that could have altered the outcome of the election was found out, but generally it was free and fair and peaceful. On the eve of the Presidential polls, Riyale as UDUB's candidature for Presidency -- had made a host of pledges and made it clear to the people of Somaliland that his campaign speeches would be fulfilled in order to live up to the people's expectations. But on the contrary, Riyale administration failed to keep its words and none of its promises had been implemented. However, we will here zero in on some of Riyale's unfulfilled campaign promises and will be discussed in detail. Judicial reforms In mid -- 2002, Riyale declared judicial reforms as one of his top priorities, and ordered a bold shake-up of the justice system. The initiative was unpopular with the sitting judges, but was warmly welcomed by a public exasperated by the judiciary's deterioration to state of ""an open market where justice is sold to the highest bidder."" As part of reform, Riyale appointed a new Chief Justice Saeed Farah Ahmed and established an advisory Committee on Judiciary, which six judges described as unconstitutional and subsequently resigned, Riyale then sacked the four remaining members to the Apex bench.  Therefore, in April 2003 when Supreme Court was called to hand down judgment on the National Election Commission's decision, there were justices on the bench, all of them appointed by Riyale. A recent report by a local research organisation found the judiciary to ""the most neglected and under-funded of the three orders of the government"" and described its application of a law as ""ad hoc, non -- uniform, and highly subjective."" And the judiciary remained mired in stagnation and corruption and failed to meet to the people's expectations. Corruption is Rife in the Country Corruption in Somaliland is rampant and the State fund is willfully embezzled by the Riyale administration. The most corrupt officials in the government of the day are the ministries who are the remnant of Siyad Barre military regime and his uneducated kitchen cabinet -- who are said to be the Riyale's main advisers and the President himself. It is not everybody's guest that the outgoing President of Somaliland and his Faqash remnant ministries misappropriated tents and thousands of US bucks and have stashed away in a foreign accounts, while Somaliland people are in a state of poverty and unemployment coupled with the prevailing basic amenities in the country. The taxpayers do not fall behind with the government's tax but they pay instantaneously as they are law biding citizens of the country, and are well aware of that the government cannot function without the tax. But the main problem is that the Somalilanders failed the government of the day be held accountable to what the tax levied from them -- have been done with -- and this lack of accountability on the party of the taxpayers since there is not a watchdog institution -- has led taxpayers' money to end up in the pockets of those corrupt ministries and other unpatriotic officials in the Riyale administration. And this has compounded the prevailing difficulties in which the common man was living in. Diplomatic Relations with Djibouti Shortly after Riyale had been sworn in as the interim President of Somaliland, he visited Djibouti instead of Somaliland's friend -- Ethiopia, claiming that he wanted to mend fences with the neighbouring client State of Djibouti and in the wake of his return to the country he told at a press conference that he normalised the strained diplomatic relations with Djibouti. Surprisingly, Djibouti did not refrain from its decentralised hate campaign against the Somaliland's independence despite Riyale's close relations with the Djibouti, and it defiantly continued its lobby against the Somaliland's existence. The Djibouti's decentralised hate crusade has invited angry reactions from Somaliland's different quarters living in and outside of the country; they launched into diatribes against the Riyale's stand on the Djibouti's deliberate campaign against the sovereignty of Somaliland. Reconstruction of Berbera Cement factory President Riyale continued his unfulfilled pledges even in the aftermath of his successful election. And wherever he went he promised the earth -- something which he was not going to do. In the recent past, he paid a deluge of visits to the coastal town of Berbera, and the Berbera inhabitants who overwhelmingly voted his ruling party -- UDUB to power gave him and his visiting delegation a chilly reception on account of his unfulfilled promises in which President Riyale made earlier. While he has been visiting there he laid a foundation stone at the Berber's forsaken Cement factory -- and has undertaken that its reconstruction will soon be implemented by his administration in order to alleviate the unemployment that bedeviled not only the people of Berbera but also the entire community of Somaliland in which 80 per cent are in a state of joblessness. On hearing this undertaking made by the Riyale administration -- the general public did not give any importance to it -- because it was not for the first time Riyale administration made such promises, which are only for vote bank politics -- something the people rose above. The prevalent unemployment in the country The unemployment prevailing in Somaliland is very much widespread, and the number of the youth being churned out by the growing universities in the country is skyrocketing year by year; with large number of Somaliland youth graduating from the overseas universities returning to the country -- are compounding the unemployment that already haunting the domestic graduates in the Somaliland. Be it the educated youth graduated from the overseas or those graduated from the universities in the country -- have now realised that the Riyale administration does not have job creation strategy for them nor it is in his radar to address the prevalent unemployment that the educated youth are encountering today. The educated youth go to the Arab world in quest of an employment, while others resorted to migrate to the Western world by endangering their dear lives through the desert between Sudan and Libya, and then the dangerous Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy in order to get better living standard. The youth are the only national asset we have and yet the Riyale administration willfully neglected and failed to utilize them. In his speeches, he had never mentioned whether he had a deliberate strategy towards the youth of the country -- who completely lost their confidence in which they reposed in his outgoing administration. Despite his administration's underachievement and his failure on every front, and with the lack of basic amenities in the country, Riyale and his henchmen are intentionally embezzling the state funds by lavishly travelling every corner and cranny of the world, without explaining the objectives behind their fruitless constant travels to the elected legislative council of Somaliland. His failure and regular lies being told to the general public -- would do a great disservice to his desire for his re-election in the forthcoming presidential polls. Berbera Port Forsaken Given that Berbera port is Somaliland's economic nerve centre on which the economic of the country is largely depends on -- and yet Riyale deliberately transferred the Somaliland's livestock to the port of the neighbouring Djibouti to be exported there -- and the reason why Riyale has been sabotaging the economy of Somaliland was that he wanted to show his allegiance to his counterpart of Djibouti, who is ironically against the Somaliland's sovereignty. But this move has angered the livestock traders on which their livelihoods were depended upon the trade of Somaliland's livestock. Also, this move has consistently been criticized by the opposition parties as well as the intellectual people of the country who described it as an act of high treason and unpatriotic and that the Riyale administration will be held accountable when the right time comes. And the Berbera port is almost deserted by the Somaliland traders and shifted to the neighbouring port of Bosaaso, where they are given concession and warm welcome. The Capital City lacks basic amenities The eight years Riyale administration has been in office are proven in many respects failure, initially, the people of Somaliland hailed Riyale as the Somaliland's new messiah, who would bring about a far-reaching change -- a change that every single body expected more or less prior to his election. But unfortunately the people's hopes were dashed due to his inconsistency and lack of visionary; the people of Somaliland started to be sniffy about his unfulfilled promises, which are meant for political gains. Riyale administration has done no improvement in the capital to speak of, let alone the other parts of the country which remained neglected; the capital city of Hargeisa lacks all sorts of basic amenities as well as the other necessary public infrastructure. Given the size of the population estimated to be one million or so is mounting day by day due to the ruralites migrating to the city and the city dwellers are extremely bedeviled by the prevailing scarcity of water caused by the mismanagement on the part of the Hargeisa water agency -- which is a stone's throw or walkable distance, where our outgoing  President of Somaliland who is entrusted with the responsibility of the running the entire country lives and he is yet to be unaware of what is happening there. And the common man is sharply complaining about the growing shortage of water and common man's grievances on the scarcity of water are fallen on deaf ears, and the Riyale administration dragged its feet to address the people's suffering. The other basic needs which is worth mentioning here is the lack of healthcare in the city, which every single facility had to be made available so as to the people in the country make use of it. There is only one hospital to speak of in the entire city that is run by the government. Similarly, in the other towns, there is only one public hospital. And the medicines donated by the humanitarian agencies operating in the country to cure the people who cannot afford to buy are on the market and are sold to the private clinics in the city to make out of money, and our dear President with whom we entrusted the entire responsibility of the country was sitting absentmindedly while these episodes were unfolding under his watchful eye. Riyale failed to secure Recognition Riyale extensively travelled to the West and many countries in Africa in his eight years in office claming he has been in quest of diplomatic recognition for Somaliland. And he became the most travelled President Somaliland ever had during its independence, and whenever he returned to the country he would tell to the people of Somaliland that Somaliland is on the brink of recognition and be granted its much sought recognition sooner or later by the countries visited by him. Most importantly, he failed to use his good offices to secure a diplomatic recognition from the neighbouring client State of Djibouti, which Riyale consistently reiterated that it is the Somaliland's best and sincere friend in the region. The Djibouti government has never been Somaliland's friend in the region and it widely campaigned how to undermine the Somaliland's effort to obtain recognition from the regional grouping and the West. Riyale's extensive travels have been for personal and were nothing to do with the national interest -- and security blanket was thrown around his visits by his administration yet his political shenanigans were exposed in the Somaliland media, which acts as a watchdog to protect the national interest of the country. The eight years Riyale has been in power he is said to have been busy amassing the national wealth and stashing away in foreign accounts and he willfully neglected his responsibility with which he had been entrusted as President of Somaliland yet he is shamelessly seeking fresh mandate from the same people whose their expectations were not lived up to by his administration. And the people are now consumed by anger and are bent on to topple his failed regime at the ballot box because it is the time to remember the unfulfilled promises made by the failed outgoing Riyale administration and no more fairy tale entertainments.

11452	A new coronavirus, should you care? I doubt you have missed the news but a new virus that infects (and has  so far killed one person) has just been discovered in the last few months. The virus in question is believed to be a new - never before seen in the wild - kind of virus (a new coronavirus to be more precise), so we really have little clues as to how it behaves as not much work has been done. Schematic of a coronavirus - this new virus probably looks a lot like this. From Biowiki. We only have two examples of human infections with this new virus to go on but despite this, the BBC and other media outlets have sparked confusion (and maybe panic) by comparing it to the 2002 SARS coronavirus (whose case fatality rate was around 10% of those over eight thousand or so people infected), which proved to be a much more deadly affair. What they probably should have compared it to is the common cold coronavirus, known as 229E - an equally valid example. But this misses the point, it is all speculation really at this minute in time. We should really wait for the hard facts to emerge. So what do we actually know? What's happened so far? We first became aware of this new virus (it doesn't have a name yet - nor is there any published material on it - that's how new it is) a few months back when the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands discovered the virus in a fatal case of lung disease from a Saudi national. A couple of weeks ago, it was spotted again, this time in a Qatari citizen travelling from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. So far this man has not died (he's in intensive care in the UK) but he was suffering from 'acute respiratory syndrome and renal failure' when he was airlifted to the UK and their Health Protection Agency identified the virus. By sequencing the virus's genome, the UK team confirmed it was highly similar to the Dutch sequenced one. However, this sequence has not yet been published so we don't know how this relates to the hundreds of thousands of other coronaviruses out there. As you can predict, with such a limited understanding of this virus there are many, many questions about it. These are important questions that ultimately impact on public health and no doubt these will be answered in the coming months. What is a coronavirus? These coronaviruses are rather large and encased within a fatty membrane and have a very, very large genome (around 30,000 nucleotides) made up of RNA with positive sense polarity. Encoded within this massive genome are ten genes that produce a lot more proteins due to some viral tricks. These proteins are what allow it to infect and enter cells (in this case human airway cells), replicate and make new virus particles. And of course combat the immune system at every step of the way. The genome of this new virus has yet to be published so we cant comment on how it's genes look and function. Where did it come from? We don't know where this virus came from nor why only now are we seeing it. There is also a chance that this virus could have always been in humans but that only due to sensitive lab tests like PCR and deep sequencing we were able to detect it. Although if it does turn out to only cause severe respiratory disease this is probably not the case. Of course the other theory is that this represents the first few infections of this virus into humans, probably emerging from an animal reservoir in the middle east. Sequencing of the virus and comparison of it's genome with other known animal coronaviruses (avian or bat?) may be able to pin point where, when and how it came to infect these two men. How dangerous is it? So far we know of only two cases of this virus infecting humans. N =2 is not much of a sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions. In both men, it is thought this virus caused serious episodes of respiratory disease but without understanding how many other people got infected and who presented with sub-clinical or only mild disease we can't comment on how dangerous it really is. The HPA are aware of a number of other cases of respiratory disease in the middle east but yet these aren;t confirmed to have have anything to do with this new virus. But so far, preliminary follow up studies on the contacts of these two men have yet to pick up any cases of significant disease despite these two men being well passed the viruses incubation period and peak of infectiousness. The ability to detect whether people have been infected in the past via antibody testing will surely clear this mystery up. What can we do about it? Not much. There's no vaccine or no cure but remember that despite this virus kicking around for at least months/weeks, only two cases have been discovered. But anybody returning from the Middle East should be aware of any respiratory symptoms as should anyone associating with people returning from these countries. The countries in question should also be keeping a close eye on clusters of disease and the origins of the virus. Currently the virus doesn't appear to be very infectious or it is highly infectious but causes little or no detectable symptoms. Both theories would fit in with the fact that we have seen no disease in the two men's contacts. So is it like SARS or is it more like 229E? Or something entirely different? As is often the case, only time and science will tell so lets focus on the facts and concentrate on doing important epidemiological, genetic and virology work done. 1 comment: For another take on this virus see Vincent Racaniello's post over at Virology Blog http://www.virology.ws/2012/09/25/a-new-\\...

33176	"Does Google Make Us Stupid? Respondents to the fourth ""Future of the Internet"" survey, conducted by the Pew Internet & American Life Project and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center, were asked to consider the future of the internet-connected world between now and 2020 and the likely innovation that will occur. The survey required them to assess 10 different ""tension pairs"" - each pair offering two different 2020 scenarios with the same overall theme and opposite outcomes - and to select the one most likely choice of two statements. Although a wide range of opinion from experts, organizations, and interested institutions was sought, this survey, fielded from Dec. 2, 2009 to Jan. 11, 2010, should not be taken as a representative canvassing of internet experts. By design, the survey was an ""opt in,"" self-selecting effort. Among the issues addressed in the survey was the provocative question raised by eminent tech scholar Nicholas Carr in a cover story for the Atlantic Monthly magazine in the summer of 2008 1 : ""Is Google Making us Stupid?"" Carr argued that the ease of online searching and distractions of browsing through the web were possibly limiting his capacity to concentrate. ""I'm not thinking the way I used to,"" he wrote, in part because he is becoming a skimming, browsing reader, rather than a deep and engaged reader. ""The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words but for the intellectual vibrations those words set off within our own minds. In the quiet spaces opened up by the sustained, undistracted reading of a book, or by any other act of contemplation, for that matter, we make our own associations, draw our own inferences and analogies, foster our own ideas.... If we lose those quiet spaces, or fill them up with 'content,' we will sacrifice something important not only in our selves but in our culture."" Jamais Cascio, an affiliate at the Institute for the Future and senior fellow at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, challenged Carr in a subsequent article in the Atlantic Monthly . Cascio made the case that the array of problems facing humanity - the end of the fossil-fuel era, the fragility of the global food web, growing population density, and the spread of pandemics, among others - will force us to get smarter if we are to survive. ""Most people don't realize that this process is already under way,"" he wrote. ""In fact, it's happening all around us, across the full spectrum of how we understand intelligence. It's visible in the hive mind of the Internet, in the powerful tools for simulation and visualization that are jump-starting new scientific disciplines, and in the development of drugs that some people (myself included) have discovered let them study harder, focus better, and stay awake longer with full clarity."" He argued that while the proliferation of technology and media can challenge humans' capacity to concentrate there were signs that we are developing ""fluid intelligence-the ability to find meaning in confusion and solve new problems, independent of acquired knowledge."" He also expressed hope that techies will develop tools to help people find and assess information smartly. With that as backdrop, respondents were asked to indicate which of two statements best reflected their view on Google's effect on intelligence. The chart shows the distribution of responses to the paired statements. The first column covers the answers of 371 longtime experts who have regularly participated in these surveys. The second column covers the answers of all the respondents, including the 524 who were recruited by other experts or by their association with the Pew Internet Project. As shown, 76% of the experts agreed with the statement, ""By 2020, people's use of the internet has enhanced human intelligence; as people are allowed unprecedented access to more information they become smarter and make better choices. Nicholas Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid."" Respondents were also asked to ""share your view of the internet's influence on the future of human intelligence in 2020 -- what is likely to stay the same and what will be different in the way human intellect evolves?"" What follows is a selection of the hundreds of written elaborations and some of the recurring themes in those answers: Nicholas Carr and Google staffers have their say:  ""I feel compelled to agree with myself. But I would add that the Net's effect on our intellectual lives will not be measured simply by average IQ scores. What the Net does is shift the emphasis of our intelligence, away from what might be called a meditative or contemplative intelligence and more toward what might be called a utilitarian intelligence. The price of zipping among lots of bits of information is a loss of depth in our thinking.""-- Nicholas Carr   ""My conclusion is that when the only information on a topic is a handful of essays or books, the best strategy is to read these works with total concentration. But when you have access to thousands of articles, blogs, videos, and people with expertise on the topic, a good strategy is to skim first to get an overview. Skimming and concentrating can and should coexist. I would also like to say that Carr has it mostly backwards when he says that Google is built on the principles of Taylorism [the institution of time-management and worker-activity standards in industrial settings]. Taylorism shifts responsibility from worker to management, institutes a standard method for each job, and selects workers with skills unique for a specific job. Google does the opposite, shifting responsibility from management to the worker, encouraging creativity in each job, and encouraging workers to shift among many different roles in their career....Carr is of course right that Google thrives on understanding data. But making sense of data (both for Google internally and for its users) is not like building the same artifact over and over on an assembly line; rather it requires creativity, a mix of broad and deep knowledge, and a host of connections to other people. That is what Google is trying to facilitate."" -- Peter Norvig, Google Research Director   ""Google will make us more informed. The smartest person in the world could well be behind a plow in China or India. Providing universal access to information will allow such people to realize their full potential, providing benefits to the entire world."" - Hal Varian, Google, chief economist The resources of the internet and search engines will shift cognitive capacities. We won't have to remember as much, but we'll have to think harder and have better critical thinking and analytical skills. Less time devoted to memorization gives people more time to master those new skills.   ""Google allows us to be more creative in approaching problems and more integrative in our thinking. We spend less time trying to recall and more time generating solutions."" -- Paul Jones, ibiblio, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill  ""Google will make us stupid and intelligent at the same time. In the future, we will live in a transparent 3D mobile media cloud that surrounds us everywhere. In this cloud, we will use intelligent machines, to whom we delegate both simple and complex tasks. Therefore, we will lose the skills we needed in the old days (e.g., reading paper maps while driving a car). But we will gain the skill to make better choices (e.g., knowing to choose the mortgage that is best for you instead of best for the bank). All in all, I think the gains outweigh the losses."" -- Marcel Bullinga, Dutch Futurist at futurecheck.com   ""I think that certain tasks will be 'offloaded' to Google or other Internet services rather than performed in the mind, especially remembering minor details. But really, that is a role that paper has taken over many centuries: did Gutenberg make us stupid? On the other hand, the Internet is likely to be front-and-centre in any developments related to improvements in neuroscience and human cognition research."" -- Dean Bubley, wireless industry consultant  ""What the internet (here subsumed tongue-in-cheek under ""Google"") does is to support SOME parts of human intelligence, such as analysis, by REPLACING other parts such as memory. Thus, people will be more intelligent about, say, the logistics of moving around a geography because ""Google"" will remember the facts and relationships of various locations on their behalf. People will be better able to compare the revolutions of 1848 and 1789 because ""Google"" will remind them of all the details as needed. This is the continuation ad infinitum of the process launched by abacuses and calculators: we have become more ""stupid"" by losing our arithmetic skills but more intelligent at evaluating numbers."" -- Andreas Kluth, writer, Economist magazine  ""It's a mistake to treat intelligence as an undifferentiated whole. No doubt we will become worse at doing some things ('more stupid') requiring rote memory of information that is now available though Google. But with this capacity freed, we may (and probably will) be capable of more advanced integration and evaluation of information ('more intelligent')."" -- Stephen Downes, National Research Council, Canada  ""The new learning system, more informal perhaps than formal, will eventually win since we must use technology to cause everyone to learn more, more economically and faster if everyone is to be economically productive and prosperous. Maintaining the status quo will only continue the existing win/lose society that we have with those who can learn in present school structure doing ok, while more and more students drop out, learn less, and fail to find a productive niche in the future."" -- Ed Lyell, former member of the Colorado State Board of Education and Telecommunication Advisory Commission  ""The question is flawed: Google will make intelligence different. As Carr himself suggests, Plato argued that reading and writing would make us stupid, and from the perspective of a preliterate, he was correct. Holding in your head information that is easily discoverable on Google will no longer be a mark of intelligence, but a side-show act. Being able to quickly and effectively discover information and solve problems, rather than do it ""in your head,"" will be the metric we use."" -- Alex Halavais, vice president, Association of Internet Researchers   ""What Google does do is simply to enable us to shift certain tasks to the network -- we no longer need to rote-learn certain seldomly-used facts (the periodic table, the post code of Ballarat) if they're only a search away, for example. That's problematic, of course -- we put an awful amount of trust in places such as Wikipedia where such information is stored, and in search engines like Google through which we retrieve it -- but it doesn't make us stupid, any more than having access to a library (or in fact, access to writing) makes us stupid. That said, I don't know that the reverse is true, either: Google and the Net also don't automatically make us smarter. By 2020, we will have even more access to even more information, using even more sophisticated search and retrieval tools -- but how smartly we can make use of this potential depends on whether our media literacies and capacities have caught up, too."" -- Axel Bruns, Associate Professor, Queensland University of Technology  ""My ability to do mental arithmetic is worse than my grandfather's because I grew up in an era with pervasive personal calculators.... I am not stupid compared to my grandfather, but I believe the development of my brain has been changed by the availability of technology. The same will happen (or is happening) as a result of the Googleization of knowledge. People are becoming used to bite sized chunks of information that are compiled and sorted by an algorithm. This must be having an impact on our brains, but it is too simplistic to say that we are becoming stupid as a result of Google."" -- Robert Acklund, Australian National University  ""We become adept at using useful tools, and hence perfect new skills. Other skills may diminish. I agree with Carr that we may on the average become less patient, less willing to read through a long, linear text, but we may also become more adept at dealing with multiple factors.... Note that I said 'less patient,' which is not the same as 'lower IQ.' I suspect that emotional and personality changes will probably more marked than 'intelligence' changes."" -- Larry Press, California State University, Dominguz Hills Technology isn't the problem here. It is people's inherent character traits. The internet and search engines just enable people to be more of what they already are. If they are motivated to learn and shrewd, they will use new tools to explore in exciting new ways. If they are lazy or incapable of concentrating, they will find new ways to be distracted and goof off.  ""The question is all about people's choices. If we value introspection as a road to insight, if we believe that long experience with issues contributes to good judgment on those issues, if we (in short) want knowledge that search engines don't give us, we'll maintain our depth of thinking and Google will only enhance it. There is a trend, of course, toward instant analysis and knee-jerk responses to events that degrades a lot of writing and discussion. We can't blame search engines for that.... What search engines do is provide more information, which we can use either to become dilettantes (Carr's worry) or to bolster our knowledge around the edges and do fact-checking while we rely mostly on information we've gained in more robust ways for our core analyses. Google frees the time we used to spend pulling together the last 10% of facts we need to complete our research. I read Carr's article when The Atlantic first published it, but I used a web search to pull it back up and review it before writing this response. Google is my friend."" -- Andy Oram, editor and blogger, O'Reilly Media   ""Google isn't making us stupid -- but it is making many of us intellectually lazy. This has already become a big problem in university classrooms. For my undergrad majors in Communication Studies, Google may take over the hard work involved in finding good source material for written assignments. Unless pushed in the right direction, students will opt for the top 10 or 15 hits as their research strategy. And it's the students most in need of research training who are the least likely to avail themselves of more sophisticated tools like Google Scholar. Like other major technologies, Google's search functionality won't push the human intellect in one predetermined direction. It will reinforce certain dispositions in the end-user: stronger intellects will use Google as a creative tool, while others will let Google do the thinking for them."" -- David Ellis, York University, Toronto   ""For people who are readers and who are willing to explore new sources and new arguments, we can only be made better by the kinds of searches we will be able to do. Of course, the kind of Googled future that I am concerned about is the one in which my every desire is anticipated, and my every fear avoided by my guardian Google. Even then, I might not be stupid, just not terribly interesting."" -- Oscar Gandy, emeritus professor, University of Pennsylvania  ""I don't think having access to information can ever make anyone stupider. I don't think an adult's IQ can be influenced much either way by reading anything and I would guess that smart people will use the Internet for smart things and stupid people will use it for stupid things in the same way that smart people read literature and stupid people read crap fiction. On the whole, having easy access to more information will make society as a group smarter though."" -- Sandra Kelly, market researcher, 3M Corporation   ""The story of humankind is that of work substitution and human enhancement. The Neolithic revolution brought the substitution of some human physical work by animal work. The Industrial revolution brought more substitution of human physical work by machine work. The Digital revolution is implying a significant substitution of human brain work by computers and ICTs in general. Whenever a substitution has taken place, men have been able to focus on more qualitative tasks, entering a virtuous cycle: the more qualitative the tasks, the more his intelligence develops; and the more intelligent he gets, more qualitative tasks he can perform.... As obesity might be the side-effect of physical work substitution by machines, mental laziness can become the watermark of mental work substitution by computers, thus having a negative effect instead of a positive one."" -- Ismael Pea-Lopez, lecturer at the Open University of Catalonia, School of Law and Political Science  ""Well, of course, it depends on what one means by 'stupid' -- I imagine that Google, and its as yet unimaginable new features and capabilities will both improve and decrease some of our human capabilities. Certainly it's much easier to find out stuff, including historical, accurate, and true stuff, as well as entertaining, ironic, and creative stuff. It's also making some folks lazier, less concerned about investing in the time and energy to arrive at conclusions, etc."" -- Ron Rice, University of California, Santa Barbara   ""Nick [Carr] says, 'Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.' Besides finding that a little hard to believe (I know Nick to be a deep diver, still), there is nothing about Google, or the Net, to keep anyone from diving -- and to depths that were not reachable before the Net came along.""-- Doc Searls, co-author of ""The Cluetrain Manifesto"" It's not Google's fault if users create stupid queries.   ""To be more precise, unthinking use of the Internet, and in particular untutored use of Google, has the ability to make us stupid, but that is not a foregone conclusion. More and more of us experience attention deficit, like Bruce Friedman in the Nicholas Carr article, but that alone does not stop us making good choices provided that the 'factoids' of information are sound that we use to make out decisions. The potential for stupidity comes where we rely on Google (or Yahoo, or Bing, or any engine) to provide relevant information in response to poorly constructed queries, frequently one-word queries, and then base decisions or conclusions on those returned items."" -- Peter Griffiths, former Head of Information at the Home Office within the Office of the Chief Information Officer, United Kingdom  ""The problem isn't Google; it's what Google helps us find. For some, Google will let them find useless content that does not challenge their minds. But for others, Google will lead them to expect answers to questions, to explore the world, to see and think for themselves."" -- Esther Dyson, longtime internet expert and investor   ""People are already using Google as an adjunct to their own memory. For example, I have a hunch about something, need facts to support, and Google comes through for me. Sometimes, I see I'm wrong, and I appreciate finding that out before I open my mouth."" -- Craig Newmark, founder Craig's List  ""Google is a data access tool. Not all of that data is useful or correct. I suspect the amount of misleading data is increasing faster than the amount of correct data. There should also be a distinction made between data and information. Data is meaningless in the absence of an organizing context. That means that different people looking at the same data are likely to come to different conclusions. There is a big difference with what a world class artist can do with a paint brush as opposed to a monkey. In other words, the value of Google will depend on what the user brings to the game. The value of data is highly dependent on the quality of the question being asked."" -- Robert Lunn, consultant, FocalPoint Analytics The big struggle is over what kind of information Google and other search engines kick back to users. In the age of social media where users can be their own content creators it might get harder and harder to separate high-quality material from junk.  ""Access to more information isn't enough -- the information needs to be correct, timely, and presented in a manner that enables the reader to learn from it. The current network is full of inaccurate, misleading, and biased information that often crowds out the valid information. People have not learned that 'popular' or 'available' information is not necessarily valid.""-- Gene Spafford, Purdue University CERIAS, Association for Computing Machinery U.S. Public Policy Council   ""If we take 'Google' to mean the complex social, economic and cultural phenomenon that is a massively interactive search and retrieval information system used by people and yet also using them to generate its data, I think Google will, at the very least, not make us smarter and probably will make us more stupid in the sense of being reliant on crude, generalised approximations of truth and information finding. Where the questions are easy, Google will therefore help; where the questions are complex, we will flounder."" -- Matt Allen, former president of the Association of Internet Researchers and associate professor of internet studies at Curtin University in Australia   ""The challenge is in separating that wheat from the chaff, as it always has been with any other source of mass information, which has been the case all the way back to ancient institutions like libraries. Those users (of Google, cable TV, or libraries) who can do so efficiently will beat the odds, becoming 'smarter' and making better choices. However, the unfortunately majority will continue to remain, as Carr says, stupid."" -- Christopher Saunders, managing editor, internetnews.com  ""The problem with Google that is lurking just under the clean design home page is the ""tragedy of the commons"": the link quality seems to go down every year. The link quality may actually not be going down but the signal to noise is getting worse as commercial schemes lead to more and more junk links."" -- Glen Edens, former senior vice president and director at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, chief scientist Hewlett Packard Literary intelligence is very much under threat.   ""If one defines -- or partially defines -- IQ as literary intelligence, the ability to sit with a piece of textual material and analyze it for complex meaning and retain derived knowledge, then we are indeed in trouble. Literary culture is in trouble.... We are spending less time reading books, but the amount of pure information that we produce as a civilization continues to expand exponentially. That these trends are linked, that the rise of the latter is causing the decline of the former, is not impossible.... One could draw reassurance from today's vibrant Web culture if the general surfing public, which is becoming more at home in this new medium, displayed a growing propensity for literate, critical thought. But take a careful look at the many blogs, post comments, Facebook pages, and online conversations that characterize today's Web 2.0 environment.... This type of content generation, this method of 'writing,' is not only sub-literate, it may actually undermine the literary impulse.... Hours spent texting and e-mailing, according to this view, do not translate into improved writing or reading skills."" -- Patrick Tucker, senior editor, The Futurist magazine New literacies will be required to function in this world. In fact, the internet might change the very notion of what it means to be smart. Retrieval of good information will be prized. Maybe a race of ""extreme Googlers"" will come into being.   ""The critical uncertainty here is whether people will learn and be taught the essential literacies necessary for thriving in the current infosphere: attention, participation, collaboration, crap detection, and network awareness are the ones I'm concentrating on. I have no reason to believe that people will be any less credulous, gullible, lazy, or prejudiced in ten years, and am not optimistic about the rate of change in our education systems, but it is clear to me that people are not going to be smarter without learning the ropes."" -- Howard Rheingold, author of several prominent books on technology, teacher at Stanford University and University of California-Berkeley   ""Google makes us simultaneously smarter and stupider. Got a question? With instant access to practically every piece of information ever known to humankind, we take for granted we're only a quick web search away from the answer. Of course, that doesn't mean we understand it. In the coming years we will have to continue to teach people to think critically so they can better understand the wealth of information available to them."" -- J eska Dzwigalski, Linden Lab   ""We might imagine that in ten years, our definition of intelligence will look very different. By then, we might agree on 'smart' as something like a 'networked' or 'distributed' intelligence where knowledge is our ability to piece together various and disparate bits of information into coherent and novel forms."" -- Christine Greenhow, educational researcher, University of Minnesota and Yale Information and Society Project   ""Human intellect will shift from the ability to retain knowledge towards the skills to discover the information i.e. a race of extreme Googlers (or whatever discovery tools come next). The world of information technology will be dominated by the algorithm designers and their librarian cohorts. Of course, the information they're searching has to be right in the first place. And who decides that?"" -- Sam Michel, founder Chinwag, community for digital media practitioners in the United Kingdom One new ""literacy"" that might help is the capacity to build and use social networks to help people solve problems.  ""There's no doubt that the internet is an extension of human intelligence, both individual and collective. But the extent to which it's able to augment intelligence depends on how much people are able to make it conform to their needs. Being able to look up who starred in the 2nd season of the Tracey Ullman show on Wikipedia is the lowest form of intelligence augmentation; being able to build social networks and interactive software that helps you answer specific questions or enrich your intellectual life is much more powerful. This will matter even more as the internet becomes more pervasive. Already my iPhone functions as the external, silicon lobe of my brain. For it to help me become even smarter, it will need to be even more effective and flexible than it already is. What worries me is that device manufacturers and internet developers are more concerned with lock-in than they are with making people smarter. That means it will be a constant struggle for individuals to reclaim their intelligence from the networks they increasingly depend upon."" -- Dylan Tweney, senior editor, Wired magazine Nothing can be bad that delivers more information to people, more efficiently. It might be that some people lose their way in this world, but overall, societies will be substantially smarter.   ""The Internet has facilitated orders of magnitude improvements in access to information. People now answer questions in a few moments that a couple of decades back they would not have bothered to ask, since getting the answer would have been impossibly difficult."" -- John Pike, Director, globalsecurity.org  ""Google is simply one step, albeit a major one, in the continuing continuum of how technology changes our generation and use of data, information, and knowledge that has been evolving for decades. As the data and information goes digital and new information is created, which is at an ever increasing rate, the resultant ability to evaluate, distill, coordinate, collaborate, problem solve only increases along a similar line. Where it may appear a 'dumbing down' has occurred on one hand, it is offset (I believe in multiples) by how we learn in new ways to learn, generate new knowledge, problem solve, and innovate."" -- Mario Morino, Chairman, Venture Philanthropy Partners Google itself and other search technologies will get better over time and that will help solve problems created by too-much-information and too-much-distraction.  ""I'm optimistic that Google will get smarter by 2020 or will be replaced by a utility that is far better than Google. That tool will allow queries to trigger chains of high-quality information -- much closer to knowledge than flood. Humans who are able to access these chains in high-speed, immersive ways will have more patters available to them that will aid decision-making. All of this optimism will only work out if the battle for the soul of the Internet is won by the right people -- the people who believe that open, fast, networks are good for all of us."" -- Susan Crawford, former member of President Obama's National Economic Council, now on the law faculty at the University of Michigan   ""If I am using Google to find an answer, it is very likely the answer I find will be on a message board in which other humans are collaboratively debating answers to questions. I will have to choose between the answer I like the best. Or it will force me to do more research to find more information. Google never breeds passivity or stupidity in me: It catalyzes me to explore further. And along the way I bump into more humans, more ideas and more answers."" -- Joshua Fouts, Senior Fellow for Digital Media & Public Policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency The more we use the internet and search, the more dependent on it we will become.   ""As the Internet gets more sophisticated it will enable a greater sense of empowerment among users. We will not be more stupid, but we will probably be more dependent upon it."" -- Bernie Hogan, Oxford Internet Institute Even in little ways, including in dinner table chitchat, Google can make people smarter.  ""[Family dinner conversations] have changed markedly because we can now look things up at will. That's just one small piece of evidence I see that having Google at hand is great for civilization."" -- Jerry Michalski, president, Sociate 'We know more than ever, and this makes us crazy.'  ""The answer is really: both. Google has already made us smarter, able to make faster choices from more information. Children, to say nothing of adults, scientists and professionals in virtually every field, can seek and discover knowledge in ways and with scope and scale that was unfathomable before Google. Google has undoubtedly expanded our access to knowledge that can be experienced on a screen, or even processed through algorithms, or mapped. Yet Google has also made us careless too, or stupid when, for instance, Google driving directions don't get us to the right place. It has confused and overwhelmed us with choices, and with sources that are not easily differentiated or verified. Perhaps it's even alienated us from the physical world itself -- from knowledge and intelligence that comes from seeing, touching, hearing, breathing and tasting life. From looking into someone's eyes and having them look back into ours. Perhaps it's made us impatient, or shortened our attention spans, or diminished our ability to understand long thoughts. It's enlightened anxiety. We know more than ever, and this makes us crazy."" -- Andrew Nachison, co-founder, We Media A final thought: Maybe Google won't make us more stupid, but it should make us more modest.   ""There is and will be lots more to think about, and a lot more are thinking.

44974	"Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey Employment Situation of Veterans Summary For release 10:00 a.m. (EDT) Tuesday, March 20, 2012 USDL-12-0493 Technical information: (202) 691-6378 * cpsinfo@bls.gov * www.bls.gov/cps Media contact: (202) 691-5902 * PressOffice@bls.gov EMPLOYMENT SITUATION OF VETERANS -- 2011 The unemployment rate for veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces at any time since September 2001--a group referred to as Gulf War-era II veterans--was 12.1 percent in 2011, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The jobless rate for all veterans was 8.3 percent. Twenty-six percent of Gulf War-era II veterans reported having a service-connected disability in August 2011, compared with about 14 percent of all veterans. This information was obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly sample survey of about 60,000 households that provides information on employment and unemployment in the United States. Data about veterans are collected monthly in the CPS; those monthly data are the source of the 2011 annual averages presented in this release. In August 2011, a supplement to the CPS collected additional information about veterans on topics such as service-connected disability. Information from the supplement is also presented in this release. The supplement was co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and by the U.S. Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service. For more information, see the Technical Note, which provides definitions of terms used in this release. Highlights from the 2011 data: -- The unemployment rate of veterans in 2011 (8.3 percent) was not statistically different from the rate in 2010 (8.7 percent). The rate for Gulf War-era II veterans also was little different from a year earlier. (See table A.) -- Young male veterans (those ages 18 to 24) who served during Gulf War era II had an unemployment rate of 29.1 percent in 2011, higher than that of young male nonveterans (17.6 percent). (See table 2B.) -- Among all veterans, those with a service-connected disability had an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent in August 2011, about the same as the rate for veterans with no disability (7.9 percent). (See table 6.) -- One in three employed veterans with a service-connected disability worked in the public sector in August 2011, compared with about 1 in 5 veterans with no disability. (See table 7.) -- Gulf War-era II veterans who were current or past members of the Reserve or National Guard had an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent in August 2011, little different than the rate for those veterans who had not been members (11.0 percent). (See table 8.) -- Gulf War-era II veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, or both had an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent in August 2011. (See table 9.) The Veteran Population In 2011, 21.6 million men and women in the civilian noninstitutional population ages 18 and over were veterans. (See table 1.) In the survey, veterans are defined as men and women who have previously served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and who were civilians at the time of the survey. Veterans are more likely to be men and older than nonveterans. In part, this reflects the characteristics of veterans who served during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam era. Veterans who served during these wartime periods account for about one-half (10.4 million) of the total veteran population. A total of 5.3 million veterans served during Gulf War era I (August 1990 to August 2001) or Gulf War era II (September 2001 forward). Another 5.9 million served outside these designated wartime periods. Because age and other demographic differences affect labor force status, the next sections focus on veterans by period of service. Gulf War-era II Veterans In 2011, about 2.4 million of the nation's veterans had served during Gulf War era II. About 17 percent of these veterans were women, compared with 3 percent of veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam era. About half of all Gulf War-era II veterans were between the ages of 25 and 34. (See tables 1 and 2A.) Among Gulf War-era II veterans, the unemployment rate for men was 12.0 percent in 2011, little different from the rate for women (12.4 percent). (See table 1.) The unemployment rate for male Gulf War-era II veterans age 18 to 24, at 29.1 percent, was higher than that for nonveterans of the same age group (17.6 percent). The rate for male veterans age 25 to 34 also was higher than the rate for their nonveteran counterparts (13.4 and 9.5 percent, respectively). For those age 35 and over, the unemployment rates of male veterans and nonveterans generally were little different. (See table 2B.) Veterans of Gulf War era II and nonveterans had similar occupational profiles in 2011 after accounting for gender. About one-third of the employed men in both groups worked in management and professional occupations, a higher proportion than in any other major occupational group. Among employed women, about 49 percent of Gulf War-era II veterans and 41 percent of nonveterans worked in management and professional occupations. (See table 4.) Gulf War-era II veterans were about twice as likely to work in the public sector in 2011 as were nonveterans--27 percent and 14 percent, respectively. About 14 percent of employed veterans of the era worked for the federal government, compared with about 2 percent of employed nonveterans. (See table 5.) In August 2011, approximately 38 percent of Gulf War-era II veterans reported that they had served in Iraq, Afghanistan, or both. (Some veterans did not report their location of service.) These veterans had an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, not statistically different from Gulf War-era II veterans who served elsewhere (8.6 percent). (See table 9.) Gulf War-era I Veterans For the 2.9 million veterans who served during Gulf War era I (August 1990 to August 2001), the proportion that were women (16 percent in 2011) was similar to that of Gulf War-era II veterans. About 87 percent of the era's veterans were age 35 and over, compared with 36 percent of Gulf War-era II veterans. (See tables 1 and 2A.) The labor force participation rate of male veterans from Gulf War era I was 85.7 percent in 2011, little different than the rate for male Gulf War-era II veterans (83.5 percent). The unemployment rate for male Gulf War-era I veterans (7.1 percent) was lower than the rate for Gulf War-era II veterans (12.0 percent). This difference in the unemployment rate reflects, at least in part, the older age profile of veterans who served during Gulf War era I. Unemployment rates of Gulf War-era I veterans were not statistically different from those of nonveterans of the same gender and age group. Veterans of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam Era In August 2011, about 10.4 million veterans responded that they had served during World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam era. Nearly all of these veterans were at least 55 years old, and more than half were at least 65 years old. Nearly all (97 percent) of these veterans were men. In 2011, just over one-third of male veterans of these wartime periods were in the labor force, and their unemployment rate was 7.6 percent. Male veterans of these wartime periods had lower labor force participation rates compared with male nonveterans in the same age categories. (See tables 1 and 2B.) Veterans of Other Service Periods In 2011, about 5.9 million veterans had served on active duty during ""other service periods,"" mainly between the Korean War and the Vietnam era, and between the Vietnam era and Gulf War era I. Because these veterans served between the major wartime periods, which span several decades, this group is concentrated in two age ranges. About 43 percent of these veterans were 45 to 54 years old, and another 38 percent were 65 years and over. (See tables 1 and 2A.) Nine in 10 veterans of other service periods were men. Among most age groups, male veterans of service periods between the designated wartime periods had labor force participation rates and unemployment rates that were not statistically different than those of male nonveterans. Veterans with a Service-connected Disability In August 2011, about 3.0 million veterans, or 14 percent of the total, reported having a service-connected disability. (Some veterans did not report whether they had a service-connected disability.) Veterans with a service-connected disability are assigned a disability rating by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or the U.S. Department of Defense. Ratings range from 0 to 100 percent, in increments of 10 percentage points, depending on the severity of the condition. (See table 6.) Among veterans with a service-connected disability, about 4 in 10 reported a disability rating of less than 30 percent, while about 3 in 10 had a rating of 60 percent or higher. In August 2011, 60.3 percent of veterans with a service-connected disability rating of less than 30 percent were in the labor force, compared with 26.6 percent for those with a rating of 60 percent or higher. Among veterans who served in Gulf War-era II, about 1 in 4 (633,000) reported having a service-connected disability. Of these, 80.0 percent were in the labor force in August 2011, compared with 83.7 percent of veterans from this period with no service-connected disability. Among Gulf War-era II veterans, the unemployment rate of those with a disability was 12.1 percent, not statistically different from those with no disability (9.5 percent). In August 2011, 19.5 percent (586,000) of veterans who served during Gulf War era I reported a service-connected disability. Their labor force participation rate (69.6 percent) was lower than the rate for veterans from the era who did not have a disability (88.2 percent). Unemployment rates for Gulf War-era I veterans with and without service-connected disabilities were little different (7.1 and 6.9 percent, respectively). Among the 1.2 million veterans with a service-connected disability from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam era, 20.9 percent were in the labor force in August 2011, compared with 35.5 percent of veterans from these periods who did not have a service-connected disability. The unemployment rate of veterans with a disability from these wartime periods was 3.1 percent, below the rate for their counterparts with no disability (8.2 percent). Veterans with a service-connected disability from other service periods had a labor force participation rate of 53.1 percent in August 2011, compared with 56.8 percent for veterans with no disability from these periods. Among veterans from other service periods, the unemployment rates of veterans with and without service-connected disabilities were not statistically different--9.4 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Regardless of period of service, many veterans with a service-connected disability worked in the public sector. In August 2011, 34 percent of employed veterans with a disability worked in federal, state, or local government, compared with 19 percent of veterans with no disability and 14 percent of nonveterans. About 18 percent of employed veterans with a disability worked for the federal government, compared with 6 percent of veterans with no disability and 2 percent of nonveterans. (See table 7.) Reserve and National Guard Membership About 30 percent of both Gulf War-era I and Gulf War-era II veterans were reported to be current or past members of the Reserve or National Guard. Among Gulf War-era II veterans, those who were current or past members of the Reserve or National Guard had an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent in August 2011, little different from those who had never been members (11.0 percent). Gulf War-era II veterans who were current or past members of the Reserve or National Guard had a higher labor force participation rate than those who had never been members. For veterans of Gulf War-era I, labor force participation rates as well as unemployment rates were similar for members and nonmembers. (See table 8.) "	News	Information/Explanation
23764	"If the shoe fits, wear it Meaning If a description applies to you, then accept it. This expression is often used when something derogatory is said about a person who then complains to a third party. The third party, if they agree with the original negative comment, might suggest ""If the shoe fits, then wear it"". An example of that might be: Origin 'If the shoe fits, wear it' is often shortened to 'If the shoe fits...', leaving the listener to fill in the blank. The expression is the American version of the earlier British phrase 'If the cap fits, wear it', which is also still in general use. Daniel Defoe used the earlier phrase in the satirical poem The Dyet of Poland . Defoe had the work printed in London in 1705 but, as it was a rather vehement critique of the English parliament, Defoe used the flimsy pretence that it had been printed in Dantzig and was the work of 'Angliopoloski of Lithuania'. Defoe's point in the poem was that readers are responsible for their own opinions; he (or rather Angliopoloski) may have written the poem but that any conclusions drawn from it were owned by the reader, not him: Gentlemen, and if the Cap fits any Body let 'em wear it. 'If the cap fits' is itself a version of a yet earlier phrase 'if the cloak sitteth fit', that is, 'if the cloak fits well'. This expression dates from the 16th century and was used in print by Richard Hooker in Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie, 1593: Which cloake sitteth no lesse fit on the backe of their cause, then of the Anabaptists. The 'cloak' version of the phrase does suggest that the later 'cap' was a variant of 'cape'. As to 'if the shoe fits', that began being used in the late 18th century. The earliest example that I have found in print is from the US newspaper the New York Gazette & Weekly Mercury , May 1773: Why should Mr. Vanderbeck apply a general comparison to himself? Let those whom the shoe fits wear it. The change from cap to shoe may well have been influenced by the Cinderella story, which has a snug-fitting slipper as the primary plot device. Versions of the tale that include the 'lost slipper' scenario were well known in the USA and Europe by 1773. In 1634, Giambattista Basile, published Il Pentamerone , a popular collection of Italian folk tales. One of the stories, Cenerentola , is the basis of the Cinderella story as we now know it, complete with wicked stepmother, ugly sisters and a missing slipper. Many expressions, for example, ' toe the line ', ' get off your high horse ' etc., were first used literally and their metaphorical meaning came later. 'If the shoe fits' is a rarity in that it has gone the other way - having been used for centuries in a figurative sense, its most common usage now is in shoe shop advertising slogans. Since writing the above piece I've had many reminders from US readers about the shaggy dog story concerning the mythical Foo bird, the droppings of which were supposed to be lucky and shouldn't be washed off. There are as many variants of this old joke as there are tellers of it; the only common element being the punch line ""If the Foo shits, wear it"". "	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
46036	"Chasing A Dream Its funny to think that for as long as I can remember I have always wanted to be a rapper; to make music and connect with people from a wide range of backgrounds. I started rapping at the age of 12 and at first I didn't have anyone's support; people thought I was going through a phase that would be over in a month. I kept at it and as I became better the desire to become a rapper got stronger and stronger, until I finally realized at the age of 15 that I wanted to take it seriously. I didn't tell anyone at the time as I didn't want to be laughed at -- heck, my dad and my brother would laugh at me when I was making music. Though this hurt my feelings and was very discouraging, my mum was always there to support me. I told my mum from early on that it was my dream to become a rapper but at the time we were living in Papua New Guinea. Being a 3rd world country there were not many opportunities so my dream would remain just that for the time being -- a dream. That all changed in early 2010 when I was shipped over to Mount Albert Grammar School boarding house, here in Auckland, New Zealand. I was scared yet excited, as I only knew about nine people in Auckland. I met the twins, Victor and Daley, who were also at the boarding school and had a drive and passion for music, like me. Music was the glue that got me stuck with these two boys; after discovering our common interest in making music and rapping, we would practice for hours on end in the dorm room, making beats, recording, rapping, listening to music, playing instruments and so forth. Eventually through all the practice and making of music, I had my first big break through a track titled "" Blue and Yellow "" where I was fortunate to meet award winning video director Damien Caine . We quickly became good friends over a short time and I told him I wanted to take rap seriously: I wanted to be a rapper and it was my dream to play in front of crowds and connect with people through music. After months of talking back and forth he said he was starting a new label, Black Platinum Sound , and asked if I wanted to be the first artist on the label. Which brings me here today... I'm about to seal the deal, signing my first label deal with Black Platinum Sound and it feels surreal, like it hasn't hit me yet. It's always been a dream and my first major goal as a rapper to be signed. Being here and having the opportunities that I've been given, I feel truly blessed. It's been a long road and there's still a very long way to go but I move forward, crossing out one goal at a time, forever chasing a dream -- chasing my dream.

5956	"While I don't usually talk about politics because my non-profit status prohibits it, it seems to me that the re-election of Obama marks a watershed in the American culture. I can't help but notice the historical precedent. Alexander Tyler wrote about the Athenian Empire nearly 2500 years ago, A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse (generous gifts) from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been two hundred years._? No civilization has ever escaped from or reversed this trend once the tipping point is reached. I believe that we have reached the tipping point.

13370	On upholstery and carpets, use the absorbent powder treatment, followed by a shampoo with liquid detergent, such as a Carpet/Rug Shampoo, a good quality laundry liquid or Quilt/Wool Wash. Avoid wetting backing of carpet or fabric, or discoloration occurs. Do not use grease solvents, e.g. dry cleaning fluid, on carpets or fabrics with rubberised backing. On wallpaper, scrape off as much as possible, then use warm iron and absorbent paper. Treat remaining stain with paste of cornflour and a grease solvent. Allow to dry, brush off, and repeat if necessary. Candle wax and chewing gum can be effectively removed by placing the object that has been stained into a freezer until the staining agent is quite hard, and brittle, then the material can be literally shattered off the object that has been stained. ...then treat any residue as follows: place the stain between clean, white blotters and press with a warm iron, changing the blotter as it becomes soiled. Then sponge with dry cleaning fluid or a laundry pre-soak (spot stain remover). In the case of coloured wax there may still be a colour stain. Sponge with a liquid made by adding ? c of methylated spirits (wood alcohol) to ? c water. First scrape off as much as possible with a dull knife. Hot soapy water will then remove fresh stains from washable articles. If a brown stain remains, soak in a solution of a diaper wash/sanitiser container sodium percarbonate followed by a good rinse in warm water. For unwashable materials, sponge with dry cleaning fluid. Allow to dry. Repeat as necessary with a clean portion of pad beneath. If any mark remains, sponge with equal quantities of methylated spirits (wood alcohol) and household ammonia (test on colours first). Follow with warm water. A spray-on dry cleaner may be used. Fresh cod liver oil stains can be removed successfully, but old stains set by washing and ironing are almost impossible to remove, even with bleach. Wash very fresh stains in warm water and a good quality laundry liquid or any one of the concentrated Laundry Powders available, applying a little neat liquid detergent to the stain. Stubborn stains on all fabrics respond to soaking in a diaper wash/sanitiser container sodium percarbonate. Wash as usual. Remove fresh stains from cotton and linen materials by first rinsing in warm water then pouring boiling water from a height of 2 - 3 feet onto the stain. Follow by washing in soapy water. If a trace remains, bleach in the sun, or with a diaper wash/sanitiser container sodium percarbonate. Tea stains on cottons and linens can also be removed by soaking in borax and water (1 Tbsp. borax in 1 c of warm water). Stains on wool and silk or any fabric may be sponged with lukewarm water, then apply glycerine, rubbing lightly between the hands. Let stand for half an hour. Rinse with warm water. If a grease spot remains from cream, sponge with dry cleaning fluid. Purchase some Spray & Wipe from your supermarket, and use concentrated on the stain. Most Spray & Wipe formula?s contain a solvent which will dissolve the liquid paper. OR Try a little gasoline on the stain, with some good absorbent paper or old cloth behind it. Then use some dishwash liquid or a good quality laundry liquid to wash out the gasoline. OR Purchase some xylene, or toluene, these are some of the solvents used in making the stuff. Use as if using the gasoline. These are stocked by gasoline companies and you may be able to request a small sample. Always test an inconspicuous piece of material before proceeding.

45026	"NOVA's Ice Mummies, an extraordinary trio of one-hour shows on ancient frozen corpses, which aired last fall, offers a judicious balance of academic commentary and excavation shots that make for some of the most riveting of recent archaeological programming. ""Frozen in Heaven,"" the most interesting and moving, investigates evidence for the Inka rite of capac cocha, the sacrifice of children to the mountain gods. Andean villagers still believe that the great mountains have supernatural power, especially over the weather and that they must be placated. According to early European chroniclers, this was achieved by child sacrifice, and the discovery in recent decades of several well-preserved children's bodies from this period, recovered at high elevation, seems to bear this out. We are shown three of the best-known examples: a seven-year-old boy found in 1985 on Mt. Aconcagua in northeast Argentina who seems to have been fed just before death a red liquid, which still coats his teeth and clothing (the liquid may have provoked vomiting); the famous Juanita, found in 1995 on Mt. Ampato in southern Peru, who was shown by CAT scans to have died from a blow to the head; and the amazingly well preserved El Plomo boy found in Chile in the 1950s wearing magnificent textiles and footwear. The second show, ""Siberian Ice Maiden,"" concerns the now-famous 1993 excavation of a frozen tomb on the Ukok Plateau in the Siberian Altai by Russian archaeologist Natalya Polosmak. The tomb contained the bodies of six fairly old horses, sacrificed with blows to the head to accompany the deceased, a practice still common in the region earlier this century. We see Polosmak and her team open the long, larch-log coffin and melt the solid white ice inside with cups of hot water. In it is the body of a 25-year-old woman who died about 2,400 years ago. Her head has lost its flesh, but some wonderful swirling tattooed figures of mythical beasts can be seen on her arms and hands. About 5'6"" tall, she was carefully embalmed: the brain and internal organs were removed and the body was packed with fur, wool, and natural preservatives such as bark and peat. Her eyes were also cut out and the sockets stuffed with fur. The third program, ""Return of the Iceman,"" deals briefly with the now well-known tale of the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse in the Italian Alps in 1991, focusing on the latest findings and bringing the story up to date with the Iceman's transportation to, and installation in, the new museum in Bolzano, Italy (see "" tzi's New Home ,"" January/February 1999). In some ways this is the most informative of the three shows because the Iceman, unlike the Andean children or the Ice Maiden, died on the mountain while going about his daily routine, and his clothing and equipment provide us with a glimpse of life in this region 5,300 years ago. These exceptionally informative shows stand as important documents in their own right and will be invaluable teaching aids for years to come. "	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
5002	"Thursday, September 6, 2012 There are certain common conceptions about sexism and gender as they relate to gaming. Influenced by the recent influx of gender and sex-related video game discussions within the community, I was interested in finding out how much of these are actually true and how much they affect gamers -- both male and female -- as well as the gaming community. For this reason, I designed a twenty-question survey to find out more. I am well aware that sexism isn't just an issue of men versus women, and I wanted my study to reflect that. My survey was aimed at gamers of all genders in order to see who sexism affects in the gaming community, who is perpetuating sexism, and to what extent the things that we think we already know about sexism in the community are true or false. This survey was created online and distributed to various gaming communities online as well as through social media such as twitter and facebook. The survey remained open for participation for approximately one week and garnered 874 responses -- almost a third of which were accompanied by additional comments, examples, and clarifications. I also received nearly 200 comments on the purpose or topic of the research itself. Some of these comments were as telling as the hard data, and some are included in the report below. Is Sexism Prevalent in Gaming Community Immediately following the demographic questions, participants were asked ""Do you feel that sexism is prominent in the gaming community?"" The response was overwhelmingly ""yes."" 79.3% of all participants believe that sexism is prominent in the gaming community. 7.1% responded ""no,"" and 13.6% of respondents were not sure if sexism is prominent in the community. A ""yes"" response was 7% more likely to come from a female gamer than from a male gamer. Male gamers were almost twice as likely to respond ""no"" than were female gamers -- a telling response when one considers how perspective affects opinion. Men and women who were not sure about the prominence of sexism in the gaming community showed a difference in percentage that is within the margin of error. When asked if they had ever been the subject of ""sex-based taunting, harassment, or threats while playing video games online,"" 35.2% of participants said yes and 61.3% of participants said no. Women were four times more likely than men to have experienced taunting or harassment , with 63.3% of all female participants responding that they had. The stories that these women told me regarding their experiences are similar to what one might think of regarding this topic. ""Cunt,"" ""bitch,"" ""slut,"" and ""whore"" were common slurs. The threats were largely of sexual assault. Much of the harassment was based around asking for or demanding sexual favors or comments that revolved around the traditional gender role and stereotyped behavior for women in Western society. Many of the insults were based on the subject's weight or physical appearance. 15.7% of men also reported that they had experienced sex-based taunting, harassment, or threats while playing video games. While this is in the minority, it is still of concern as sexism. The comments directed at these gamers, however, are different from those directed at women in some very telling ways. Most of the men who provided additional information on their ""yes"" response to this question experienced comments that revolved around them not fitting a masculine gender role. These men were often called ""fags"" and compared to or told that they were women and labeled with stereotypically feminine words. For those who identified as intersexed, identified with a sex that was not listed, or did not identify with any sex, the sexual harassment that was experienced largely related to not fitting into any norm. Those participants in these demographics had almost all experienced intentional misgendering from other players. For women, the sexism experienced is about being female. For men, it is about not fitting a standard of masculinity. In short, this sexism is always about ""male"" being the normative sex and ""not male"" or ""not sufficiently male"" being reason for insults, shaming, and bullying. This means that men who fit (or present) a masculine, normative standard are those who are most unlikely to be the victim of sexism. The responses to the question ""Have you ever received an unsolicited proposition while playing video games online?"" shows that this happens in much the same ratio between men and women as does general sexism, but that propositioning is slightly less common than sexual threats, taunting, and harassment. 32.0% of all participants said that they had experienced an unsolicited proposition while playing video games. 59.7% of women and 12.2% of men. The difference here, as found in the comments and clarifications that I was sent by some participants, is largely in the tone of the proposition and the reception therein. Both sexes reported receiving propositions with the exchange of money, goods, and in-game assistance as a deal. However, men were more often offered sexual favors if they would pay for them (""I'll send nudes for gold"" was a provided example.), and women were more often offered payment if they would perform sexual favors (""Show me your tits and I'll help you,"" quoted one female participant.). In addition to this, more women described the propositions that they received as ""gross,"" ""dirty,"" ""vulgar,"" or ""inappropriate"" than did men. From the clarifications I received, when men were approached with an offer of sex they were more likely to accept the offer than women were. A further distancing between men and women in terms of experienced sexism is apparent when reviewing the data that the survey received in response to the question ""Have you ever experienced sex-based harassment that began while playing a video game and continued outside of the game?"" Only 9.8% of all participants reported that they had experienced this sort of harassment. However, women were nearly 7 times more likely to experience this than men were (at 19.5% for women and 3.0% for men). This suggests that those who harass women are motivated to pursue the subject of their harassment once the game is finished in order to continue to harass them. Those who harass men don't experience this motivation to the same extent, and so women are more likely to experience sustained sexism than men are. Similar numbers were reported in response to the question ""Have you ever felt unsafe because of sex-based harassment while playing a video game?"" 9.6% of all participants answered ""yes."" 19.4% of women and 2.2% of men experienced this. This means that women are nine times more likely than men to feel unsafe in this situation. A handful of women commented further on this, and all of them expressed that their fears were rape or sexual-assault related, which is unsurprising considering that some studies report that as many as 1 in 4 college-aged women is sexually assaulted. Where rape is a real, common occurrence for women in the average gaming age group, it is not surprising that threats of rape made while gaming causes more concern for women than for men. Women were also much more likely to quit playing a game because of sex-based harassment than were men. 35.8% of women reported having quit playing temporarily because of sexism , and 9.6% reported that they quit playing a certain game permanently because of harassment. The numbers for men in the same areas were 11.7% and 2.6% respectively -- about a third of the percentage for women in each case. Another polarizing question was ""Have you ever obscured or lied about your sex while playing video games to avoid unwanted attention or harassment?"" 67.5% of women said that they had obscured their sex . Only 5.8% of men said the same. That means that women are nearly 12 times as likely to feel the need to conceal their sex while playing video games as men are. Two men sent clarifications to me regarding why they conceal their sex sometimes when they play video games. Both prefer to play with female avatars, and both have previously been harassed because they identify as male but play female characters. Again, they are being harassed because they don't conform to normative masculinity. When asked if they had ever avoided playing on a public server to avoid being a target of sexism, 50.6% of female respondents and 10.3% of male respondents said that they had. Beyond this, many women clarified by saying that they don't play video games online at all in order to avoid sex-based harassment either that they had previously experienced playing online or that they thought they might experience. While women are five times more likely to avoid playing on a public server to keep away from sexism, there is another difference between when men and women choose to do this. Many men sent clarifications about this question to say that they avoid specific servers that they know to foster a sexist community whereas many women said that they avoid all public servers and play only in environments they know that they will be comfortable in. When asked ""Have you ever been the subject of sex-based comments, taunting, harassment, or threats in the gaming community while not playing a video game?"" 45.5% of women said that they had -- almost 5 times the percentage of men who said the same. Similarly, when asked if they had ever had their gaming taste, ability, or skill questioned because of their gender, 77.8% of women said that they had (compared to 6.4% of men). Those men who said that they had been the subject of these comments and judgments related that they were often judged for liking games that were ""for girls."" One man said that he had been called a ""faggot"" when he said he didn't like playing violent games. Yet again, the sexism against men is not because they are men but because they aren't ""male enough."" Occasionally, women in gaming are labeled as something like ""attention whores."" The woman who plays video games for attention or uses her sex for special treatment while playing is a common stereotype in the gaming community. The response to ""Have you ever intentionally used your sex as leverage when asking for favors, goods, or attention while playing video games?"" shows that this stereotype is only true in the vast minority. 9.9% of female respondents said that they had done this at least once. What is perhaps more interesting is that when asked ""Have you ever lied about your sex in order to receive favors, goods, or attention while playing a video game?"" 12.9% of male respondents said that they had. The comments and data from these two questions point to an interesting conclusion: Some male gamers use the stereotype of a female ""attention whore"" to their benefit by pretending to be female in order to garner special benefits. Many of these men even kept images of women that they found on the internet in order to supply those gamers who helped them with nude photos and proof that they were female. In essence, an individual using femaleness to attain special favors and gifts from others while playing video games is more likely to be a self-identified male posing as a woman than to actually be female. When they were asked if they had ever participated in sexist behavior and comments, only 9.4% of participants said ""yes,"" with 10.6% of men and 7.3% of women giving this answer. Men were only 3.3% more likely to exhibit sexism -- a number within the margin of error. This means that men and women are exhibiting sexism at very similar rates. Comments sent in by these people to clarify their answers also show that individuals who exhibit sexism do not only do so to people of the opposite sex. Men are perpetrating sexism against other men, and women are doing the same to other women. When asked if they had ever intervened in a conversation to stop sexist comments and behavior, 53.2% of participants (54.6% of women and 51.9% of men) said that they had. Both men and women sent in comments regarding why they had trepidation about defending others from sexism while gaming. Both were afraid of having the negative attention turned toward themselves -- men often concerned with the label ""White Knight"" (which relates to a man who defends a woman in the hope of sexual favors) and women were concerned with the same sexual harassment that was being received by the person they might have defended. Sexism Study Demographics: Who took the Survey The survey opened with some general demographic questions. When asked ""What sex do you identify as?"" 499 (57.1%) of the respondents were male and 356 (40.7%) were female. These numbers -- particularly the ratio of men to women in gaming - are similar to those which have been reported by other studies . They support the idea that the majority of the members of the gaming community are male, but perhaps some might be surprised that the number of female members comes even close to that of the male majority. 32.4% of all participants were between the ages of 20 and 23. Only one participant, a male, was under 13, and only one participant, who identified with no sex, was over 51. 77.7% of all participants were between the ages of 16 and 27. The average male participant was between 20 and 23, as was the average female. There was no statistically significant difference in the ages of male and female participants -- the distribution across age ranges was roughly the same for both groups. Participants were asked which genre of video games they play. The most popular genre was ""RPG,"" which garnered 14.8% of all responses. The least popular genre was ""Simulator"" with 6.0% of all responses. The difference between the percentage of men playing a particular genre and women playing that same genre was never greater than 3.2 (12.6% of men and 9.4% of women played ""Shooters""), which falls within the margin of error for this study. This suggests that men and women have roughly the same taste in video games. This information is interesting in light of arguments posed in response to other studies. Some of these arguments suggest that the population of women in gaming (41%) is only so high because there is no differentiation between ""casual"" and ""serious"" gamers -- that people who play only casual games should not be considered gamers and that making the distinction would lower the number of female gamers as reported by such studies. This study shows that this is not the case. In fact, no women who responded to this survey played only casual games. Women were 2.0% more likely to play casual games than were men (again, a number within the margin of error), but these same women also enjoyed other game genres. Similar data ranges were apparent in response to the question ""What devices do you use to play video games?"" The most popular device for gaming is the PC, which garnered 24.9% of all responses. The least popular device for gaming is the Mac, with 3.4% of the responses. The difference in the percentage of men and the percentage of women playing video games on a given device were statistically negligible. The largest difference was between men and women playing the Nintendo Wii; women were 1.1% more likely to play this console than men were. While this is a number well within the margin of error, it is the only difference between men and women as far as consoles and devices are concerned that was over 1.0%. The rest of the responses were only different by a fraction of a percent. It is clear that there is no real difference in the gaming devices selected by men and those selected by women. 49.4% of gamers who participated in this survey play video games for a few hours a day. Women were 4.6% more likely to play video games a few hours a week than were men, whereas men were 6.2% more likely to play video games a few hours a day than were women. The percentages of men and women who play video games more than four hours a day were only 0.8% different from one another -- with 16% of women and 15.2% of men playing at this frequency. The average male gamer and the average female gamer both play video games for a few hours a week. Sexism Survey Comments and Community's Reaction According to this study, most gamers recognize sexism as a prominent force in the gaming community. While it is mostly directed at women, some men experience it as well. Only a minority of gamers say that they've perpetuated sexism, and a majority say that they've stepped in to stop it. These numbers are heartening for anyone who, like me, is concerned about how the gamers, and people in general, treat one another. I myself received some interesting reactions and treatment when I opened this survey up to the public. For the sake of statistics and simplification, I counted the comments that I received that were directed at the purpose of the survey (as opposed to those that were in direct response to survey questions) and then categorized them as either: Definitely Positive, Definitely Negative, and Non-Definite. Encouragingly, those comments which were distinctly positive outnumbered the comments which were negative. The majority of these were methods of solidarity and encouragement -- praise directed at myself for undertaking the project or support for the project itself. Comments such as ""I'm proud of you."" and ""You're doing a great thing."" were common. Perhaps the most encouraging were the handful of comments -- 9, in total -- that came from people whose outlooks were changed because of the survey. One individual said that he was surprised about the topic. He hadn't previously considered that sexism occurred in gaming. After having taken the survey, he spoke with his wife (who is also a gamer) , asking her if she had ever experienced sexism while playing a video game. After she said that she had, the man became more conscientious of what he and other players were saying and how they were behaving while playing games online, and he decided to start speaking out against sexism when he saw it. While these responses were quite encouraging (as I personally like to see a community aware of its biases and discrimination), there were plenty of comments to provide a counterbalance to the positivity. I received 34 comments that I would classify as ""negative"" - just over half the number of positive responses. These negative responses were largely comments directed at me personally as opposed to the purpose of the research, and most of them were vile, sexual, and entirely profane. An even dozen of the negative comments that I received addressed the topic in a way that showed negative opinion while remaining what I see as professional in tone. The 22 remaining negative responses were consisted of or contained personal, profane attacks against myself. All of these comments came from men, and they all contained gender and sex-based insults. Eight of these comments featured sexual content -- descriptions of what should be done to me. One of them was four paragraphs long and particularly vivid. These eight are not anything that I would deem acceptable to reproduce here. This comment is fairly representative of those made by these 22 men: ""Yoru[sic] survey is retarded and so are you. There's no sexism in the video game community, you stupid cunt. All you bitches play cause you like the attention that nerds give you. You can't get it anywhere else cause you're fat disgusting whales. You ruin video games. Shut the fuck up, tits or gtfo, and make me a sandwich. I'd say I hope you get raped, but you're such a slut you'd like it."" What was most surprising, and slightly disheartening, were many of the 87 comments that fit into neither the positive nor negative categories. A number of these comments did not involve personal opinion on the subject matter in the study. These were things like ""I'd like to see the results of this."" or ""This is an interesting survey."" Such comments composed approximately a third of the non-definite responses. The remaining two-thirds, however, might be represented by this comment: ""I really do feel for the people who are discriminated against when they play video games. I know that a lot of women get harassed just because they're female. But I don't see what we can do about it. Is sexism a problem? Yes. Is is bad? Yes. Does it happen in the community? Yes. But there's no fix for that. There are always going to be bigots, so what's the point in fighting it?"" While I can understand this opinion, to me it represents a sort of conciliatory perspective. It's a recognition of the problem, but an unwillingness to stand up against it. The people who made such comments -- both men and women -- are those who have either given up or never tried. In some ways, too, I feel that these individuals misunderstand the ways in which sexism can be fought and in which gains can be made for gamers who want to see a community free of sexism. I can't argue that eliminating sexist opinion from every individual in the community is realistic, and it's not one of the goals that I personally hold when arguing against sexism. What I do think is achievable, however, is eliminating the normalization of sexism in the community. When people stand up in sufficient numbers against those who harass players because of their sex or gender -- when we stop laughing, joining in, or letting it slide and start handing out bans, saying ""That's not okay,"" and refusing to play with bigots -- then eventually there is a standard that even those with sexist leanings will begin to conform to. Surely not every bigoted person will be swayed by public opinion enough to stop expressing their sexist thoughts, but there's going to be a number of them (how big that number is I can't be sure) who will consider being judged, scolded, ostracized, or made to look foolish when they use sexist slurs and insults to be enough of a deterrent to stop using them in mixed company. When sexism is less expressed, it becomes less normalized for those entering the community as well. When new gamers see that calling a woman a cunt or taunting a man for being beaten by a woman is frowned upon, they are more likely to learn not to do it. It's a change that will take time, but it's one that I and others believe is worth working toward. 26 comments: Of all the places I expected to see sexism discussion... well, let's just say I didn't expect it to be here! Either way, I'm really glad that this post has made its way to the site (and my view). Reading about sexism in games is often difficult for me, as I have experienced it myself as have many of my friends, but I'm compelled to hear more all the same. One reason I am such a fan of this post is because it gives hard statistical, indisputable facts. Whenever someone writes a ""personal"" opinion piece about sexism there's always comments about how it's just them or something. This shows everyone that there are certain trends in our community and sexism is definitely one of them. I also appreciate you speaking about men being harassed mostly due to not living up to some sort of ""male ideal"". This is incredibly true and easy to see if you listen in on multiplayer games. Thanks again for your post! I've tweeted it and hope all my friends see. Thank you for publishing this study and calling for gamers to de-normalize sexism. I am a woman and I've received harassment for simply pointing out sexism in games before. Would've loved to participate in this study! :) Please give actual examples of what and where you are seeing sexism in video games so that I can be sure you actually understand what the word means, because I doubt you do. Sexy female characters is not ""sexism"". Neither are most of the other things you're going to say are. And neither is saying something mean to a girl. Saying, for example, that a woman can't design a game as well as a man, simply because she's a woman, however *IS* sexist. But you're probably just talking more about idiotic misuse of the word like ""durp durp that box cover is sexist because the female character has a nice set of breasts"". Unless you can CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORD MEANS, you can't claim to have ""been a victim of it"". Also, where's the article about racism in gaming? How about homophobia? How about xenophobia? Why are we only ever engaging in constant navel-gazing about gender? Where's the data to support the conclusion about men posing as women to gain favors in video games? That seems unsupported and entirely out of place. Also, if less than 10% is a ""vast minority"" in regards to females who do ask for favors in games at least once by utilizing their gender, why is it not also a ""vast minority"" when less than 10% felt unsafe or had continued harassment outside the game? Beware of wording and bias if you want to be taken seriously. Epcyclopedia - see the data sheet for download at the bottom. The question posed that supported that men pose as women to gain favors was worded as ""Have you ever lied about your sex in order to receive favors, goods, or attention when playing a video game?"" 12.2% of the male participants answered ""yes"" to that question. ""Where's the data to support the conclusion about men posing as women to gain favors in video games? That seems unsupported and entirely out of place."" At the end of the same paragraph: ""[...]""Have you ever lied about your sex in order to receive favors, goods, or attention while playing a video game?"" 12.9% of male respondents said that they had."" Given the the absolute numbers being 499 to 356 that means that around 35 women ""have intentionally used their sex as leverage when asking for favors, goods, or attention while playing video games"" and 63 men ""have lied about their sex in order to receive favors, goods, or attention while playing a video game"". I'm curious as to how many people alter their gaming behaviour to avoid the hostile environment in general, not for fear of being a target. I couldn't give a damn whether a bunch of self-important nitwits want to attack ME on a superficial basis. However, watching insecure individuals gang up against ""outsiders"" or turn against each other doesn't feel like a productive use of ""me time"". I don't have the energy to fight the global behaviour when the medium's anonymity precludes real responsibility, and curating safe spaces requires too much energy for my personal tastes, and paints a bullseye on your back for griefers. I question this, only because as a man, I often play female characters, with female names. I have never, in my 10+ years of MMO playing ever seen someone directly attack my female nature. I even did an experiment and created a reddit account with a very strong female name, and posted for 3 months straight, always being sure I never revealed my sex. I wanted to see if sexism would happen due solely to my name / typing. I have yet to find a single sexist comment. I am not saying it happens, but I think women mis-interpret a lot of it. When a guy online calls someone a ""little pussy ass bitch"", that is not targeted at your gender, that is a generic comment that gets said many times over to men and women alike. My guess is women tend to personalize the insults. To back that up, I will use the data in this study. Look at how many women feel they are no longer safe after getting a comment. I mean, this is the internet, the odds of someone finding your address, traveling to your place, to rape you is so extremely unlikely, yet the culture given to women is that men do this. I cannot for any reason, see how an anonymous environment would cause someone to feel scared. The only way I can think of why this would happen, is that women tend to personalize insults. Yeah, nothing sexist AT ALL about calling someone a ""little pussy ass bitch."". Perfect example you've provided, so thanks for your case in point. The slam is precisely targeting the feminine as weak, lesser, and the lowest of states. Either learn to see that for what it is--which is very sexist--or ""man up"" like I do and admit, ""yeah, I completely use sexism in my insults."". Cause sometimes I do. But the ultimate respect I have for gamers is for those who are cunning, and strength in gaming and life isn't the ultimate characteristic, and a lot of other traits or combos of traits will trump that. Reasonable people know that. And if you are able to overcome my skill sets, I must just resort to calling you a little pussy ass bitch but I'd probably be much more creative than that. Wow, even here, so many comments from my fellow dudes mansplaining to women how they should feel about sexism. ""I'm a man and I totes get to define sexism even though I as a man will NEVER EXPERIENCE SEXISM and women need to just stop being such whiny VICTIMS I am such an expert on what it is like to be a female gamer hurr hurr"". And before anyone cries ""misandry"" or ""reverse sexism"" JUST STOP. STOP. http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/\\... Us guys have absolutely no place in discussing what constitutes ""sexism"" because we will will never experience it---our job as men who want to be a good human beings is to LISTEN to women's lived experiences and trust that they know what it's like to experience sexist micro-aggressions. The OP says she received horrifying rape threats in response to simply posting a fucking survey. There. That's all the fucking evidence you need. A note: Men can experience sexism. No, it will not be the same brand of sexism, nor probably as harsh, that women face but there is still something there. The weird thing is how men tend to not ""care"" outwardly about their own biased presentations and treatment - such as media defining men as macho but with the all the brain function and experience of a 14 year old (man-children, man-caves, man-everything). Men ""cannot"" define themselves as anything ""feminine"", which is also pointed out in the study. Anyway, to the commentor who plays with a female avatar... You are lucky to not have seen or interpreted acts of other people as sexist toward you. Perhaps you just didn't feel it was out of place, or you were simply never targeted. That in no way invalidates how other women feel in the gaming community. Some women do not experience trouble while gaming, but many do. You did not, and that is great, but it doesn't mean that no one does. In regards to it being highly unlikely for a man to find your address and rape you, yes, it would probably not escalate that far. However, I have seen my fair share of women bloggers online who have been harassed day in and day out by people because they dared say anything negative about games or game culture. They have had calls they have had things delivered to their door they could have much more. I doubt most casual gamers are experiencing this but you don't know how bad things can get. I think your audiences that said no, do not know what sexual harassment is, or do not play online, because I am nearly certain that you are 100% guaranteed to be called a ""fag"" if you plan to play online. I do not, but I do not go through a day when someone does not throw slurs as such. Also, from my experience, females tend to be more prone to call people ""faggots"" while men tend to go with insults toward moms. Food for thought. IF you want to discuss, I'm more than open to talk about it, as I do take this to be a very serious matter and I do not condone unsportsmanlike conduct in gaming. --- OH, another reason for people to say no is that the MMORPG community tends to be much better. There's not really a reason to insult or harass each other (beyond PVP) in a grind kind of game. But the general rule of thumb in those types of games are that all females avatars are male. (There's a reason for that) To the ""pussy ass bitch"" being sexist debate, it both is and isn't. The words themselves are very sexist assuming aren't referring to a hybrid of a cat, a donkey, and a dog. But many of those using them (especially the young) don't even register the fact, it's just an unfortunate prerecorded response for a given situation. I myself exclaim ""God damn"" and ""Jesus Christ"" in spite of not following a belief system involving either of those entities. It's a language pattern that was created out of sexism and needs to be purged from the language. Also the idea that only the victim can decide what is harassment is flawed, especially since the victims themselves often don't agree within their own ""group"". That said, the vast majority of -ist comments of all varieties are harassment, and often victims don't even register it because they've been inured to it. Personally, if I'm in someone else's ""space"", and this behavior occurs, I leave, and may or may not confront the perp or discuss with the owner based on my relationship with said individuals. If I'm in a ""space"" of my own, I'll come down on the perp with a righteous fury. That shit pisses me off. =P Thank you for the survey. It's always great to see hard numbers like this. Well, depressing. But it somehow feels nice to know I'm not the only one who absolutely refuses to play certain multiplayer games (and the public servers of the ones I do play) solely because of harassment. I'm glad you asked about genre preferences. I hadn't seen any numbers on it before, and the results surprised me. I was sure simulators would be significantly more popular with female gamers than with male gamers. I agree that self-selection bias might be a problem (i.e. people who have been affected by sexism might be more likely to respond), but I don't think there's any other way to get these data. Given the fairly large response though (the sample size is large enough to allow generalisation to a population of around 50,000-100,000 using standard parameters) I find it pretty shocking though that the OP got threats simply for posting a request to fill in a survey. An interesting study and one that would be worth repeating once a year or so. I'd like to make some suggestions to perhaps help improve the above. 1) I think it would make your charts much easier to understand at a glance if you included the %s in the bars. Right now I have to look to the left and see the axis to get an idea about the numbers I might be seeing, and even then it's a guess. 2) When asking which gender people identify with, it looks like you've used the traditional binary approach (i.e. male / female). If you'd like a more sensitive scale, there is a seven-point masculine to feminine scale that is used where gender may be a sensitive topic that might give you a bit more granularity in your results. 3) For me, the statement, ""This suggests that men and women have roughly the same taste in video games"" is arguably one of the most important points raised in this article. It provides some weight against the idea that women don't play 'real' games, which is a bedrock for the kind of implicit sexism this topic is often greeted with. Thank you so much for conducting the survey, for posting your results AND data set, as well as for having the courage to engage in this research in the first place. Reading your findings and the comments above, the topic clearly remains a lightning rod for both serious debate and over-the-top-trolling, and I hope you are able to see the latter as additional fodder for your analysis and discussion. I also hope you continue on with the project... as suggested in some of the comments above, the research is timely and compelling, and it could indeed easily be expanded into a longitudinal and/or cross-cultural study.

26922	"Ron Morris is a columnist at The State in South Carolina and has become Spurrier's nemesis. Last October, Spurrier called out Morris for something he wrote in the spring regarding then-basketball player Bruce Ellington and how Spurrier persuaded Ellington to play football. Shaw should not have started, or maybe even played, against UAB. It was an opponent USC could easily have beaten with Thompson at quarterback. The risk of Shaw re-injuring his shoulder was much greater than that of USC losing to UAB. Before you claim this to be second-guessing or Wednesday-morning quarterbacking, understand that I believed it was a poor decision when Shaw first ran on the field Saturday. I also am quite confident I was not alone in thinking Shaw was better served with another week of rest. [...] Maybe I missed where USC physicians invented a new cure over the weekend for deep bruises and/or fractures to the shoulder. Or, maybe Shaw is an incredibly quick healer the second time around. Or, maybe Shaw goes into Saturday's game with the same questions surrounding his running and throwing abilities as he did against UAB. My guess is the latter. My guess also is that, because of Spurrier's poor decision to play Shaw against UAB, USC will be dealing with the quarterback's sore shoulder for most of the remainder of the season So, instead of just talking to Morris man-to-man, Spurrier tried the passive aggressive approach, penalized all of the media for two days before finally talking during his Tuesday press conference. Morris and Spurrier are enemies, we get that, but why penalize the entire media contingent? And why over this? Yes, Morris questions whether Shaw should have played in that game, but I think a lot of people were doing the same. Shaw looked pretty miserable during the bulk of the Vanderbilt game. He sat out the East Carolina game and many thought he should sit out UAB to be ready for the grueling SEC season. In the end, Shaw's shoulder proved not to be a big deal against Missouri as he completed 20 consecutive passes in a dominating 31-10 win. So, I guess it's kind of a ""See, I was right all along"" kinda thing to Morris, but still just another example of childish behavior by a coach toward the media, which seems to be happening far more often this year than in the past. 113 comments I don't know of any ""real"" player that wants to sit out a game. Most media folk have nothing better to do than 2nd guess decisions of coaches. What Mr. Morris should have done before penning his story was to have a discussion with the USC trainer to get his take on whether Shaw could play - then write your story. Trainers clear injured players - not coaches. All coaches want their best players on the field if cleared to play and not suspended by SEC commish for making a tackle. F off b atch. You have no clue what is going on down here. Morris tells lies. Morris also compared Spurrier to Sandusky. Because morris is certain there is a cover up regarding Shaw. Get all your facts together before you start bumping your gums. We don't like you, we don't like morris. We LOVE Spurrier. I'm a UK football fan/a crazy person, I would trade a winning coach that ticks off the media over a losing coach who is polite any day. I'm a UK fan and I am defending Spurrier... Dark times we live in. Another misuse of the media...........when will somebody write that morris's opinions are not news and maybe he should just shut up... His only claim to fame is his dispute with spurrier, thus morris wont let it go as he seeks the spotlight, what a jerk I do not blame Spurrier at all when it comes to Morris . Many times the media will twist a coachs words , or try to look like they know more than the coach when it comes to decisions about a player , or a game . If Morris compared Spurrier to Sandusky , he should be fired without question for even comparing the two . Sadly , this never happens to a reporter because the media quickly jumps up with the second amendment . Morals should come up when a statement like Morris made is printed , just let the Sandusky matter stay in Pennsylvania where it belongs . I'm personally sick of Morris. Spurrier has called him out directly in the past, yet Morris continues to be a moaning b**ch about the program, and not only football. Just about every article he writes, he belittles USC athletics, not just football. It's always easy being an arm chair QB when you're a ""journalist."" And I quote journalist, because that Morris is not. As for Spurrier ""penalizing the entire media contingent"", really? Does the question ""How do you feel about Shaw's performance?"" do anything to enlighten readers? No! So before you chime in please do more research and understand this isn't just a couple of times it's happened. Maybe you should call out your fellow journalists for being so poor in reporting. While I understand Dr Saturday is an opinion article, those of us that need answers, want answers, or want to be entertained by Carolina articles, well we know where to find them. And thank you, Watson, for writing yet a 3rd article on our football program in a matter of days. Glad to see we've turned that media corner. :) Go Gamecocks!! you know coaches dont HAVE to let media do anything. Its funny when the media writes about this stuff. I'd never give them the time of day. And articles like this of course try to make the media look like they're innocent. Because most media/sports writers are more about selling a non-story. I wish more sports coaches/players would only talk to media that prints good/truthful information. Media can embellish stories and hid behind we don't have to give our sources. So, basically they can lie on anything. Most sports writers never played a sport, so who cares what they think. So, yeah, all media should pay the price when one of their own is a jerk. Eventually, that writer will be run out of town because the rest won't have a story. "	News	News
38412	"This is not really something I've done before. Or expected to do. Okay, so there was that time that I spent the better part of a summer finishing a novel before promptly abandoning it because it wasn't the right way to tell the story I was trying to tell and I'd really just spent too much time envying Creative Writers who could tell everything in a poem or a short story and didn't feel limited, or rather intimidated, by that. And it's funny how if you think about an idea too hard, for too long, it gets warped, like it's been sitting in the sun, in the rain, the snow, and you can't really tell what shape it was originally supposed to be. I'm a chronic overthinker, so quite a lot of my life looks like that quite a lot of the time, actually. But mostly I am not what you could call a Novelist. Not with a capital N, anyway. When someone asks me what I write, I have a love-hate relationship with my standard answer, which is something vague that ends with a sigh and a shrug as if to say, see? you can't pigeon-hole ME! I often say (and write!) things like, ""oh, I wish I was a novelist, because it would be so much easier ,"" and of course I never, or almost never, mean it. But anyhow I am writing a novel, now. And I'm enjoying it. I'm doing it because it's National Novel Writing Month . They call it nanowrimo. And yes, I hate the name. And no I will not say it out loud (unless, maybe, you buy me a drink, in which case I will say it out loud very reluctantly and very quietly). And yes, it's a gimmick. And no, I don't really have time for this. And no, neither does anybody else. But it doesn't matter. After the first thousand words it stopped really being a choice. Like Alice, I fell down the rabbit-hole of curiosity and now I'm wandering round Wonderland sipping potions. Growing, shrinking. Running just to stay in place. And it makes me deliriously happy. 2. It Looks Like This What this means is that I come home from work and I go for a swim, and then halfway through my swim I start thinking about the book and by the time I get home I desperately need to pull the laptop out and start typing. It's like foreplay, but for writing. Then I spend the next five hours typing as fast as I can. Which is great for me and not so great for the Man, who has to do the cooking and the cleaning and the entertaining himself all on his own, and then as a reward gets a grumpy/happy (grumpy because I need to sleep, happy because I'm SO TIRED and I finally get to sleep) me crawling into bed with my fingers still twitching. On the nights when he isn't around to provide for me I eventually realise that I'm hungry and look in the fridge and discover an open tin of baked beans and half an avocado and think, PERFECT! And make a meal of it, along with an entire bottle of Marlborough Sauvignon. (That counts as fruit, right?) And obviously I don't clean up after myself, because that would cut into the time I could be spending on the couch making shit up. This is straining our relationship (not actually, by the way, but after we've snapped at each other about something really banal like the fact that I left the bread on the cutting board and now it's harder than the iceberg that sunk the Titanic, we joke about it, a bit.). But I'm not writing this novel in a FRENZY! sort of way; I genuinely enjoy it. If I could, I would spend all of my time like this. The other day I caught myself being grumpy because WE HAD TO GO HAVE DINNER WITH SOME REALLY GOOD FRIENDS BUT I COULD BE SPENDING THAT TIME WRITING, and, well, that's probably overkill, and I mean, I do like a bit of socialising sometimes (and we had a wicked time and I didn't really regret not spending those few hours writing). But I would probably be pretty happy to spend the majority of each day holed up in my study typing and reading and watching the neighbours' bushy black cat climb the naked cherry tree in the garden. That's the other way you can tell I'm working on a project: all the books come off the shelves and there are strategic piles placed in every room. Our house is a mess because the Man can't clean up faster than I can take books of a shelf. Also, I haven't washed any of my clothes all month and I'm running out of relatively clean things to wear which you'd think would be fun -- all the old stuff comes out of the drawers, you discover some amazing old vintage dress. But I had really bad taste as a college student so mostly it means I wear schlubby things; the other day I wore a hoody from Abercrombie & Fitch. Let me say that again: A HOODY, from ABERCROMBIE & FITCH. It was awful; I felt disgusting (I'm a total snob and also I'm not an ugg-boots-and-denim-skirt wearing Brookes undergraduate although when I was 15 I INVENTED THAT LOOK, but that's another story) and then I discovered it was so tight (I used to like really tight sweatshirts, I guess) that I couldn't easily get it off, and I ran from room to room with my arms above my head pulling on the sleeves and the hood and for a few seconds I just thought, oh my god. I am trapped in my own sweatshirt. This is The End. 3. It Gives Me Joy But the point is it isn't really the pressure of having to write my 50,000 words by the end of the month (and also, I'm not that disgusting, I still shower regularly -- or as regularly as I ever did). It's more the giddiness of being this happy about something I'm doing. Why on earth don't more people try to write novels in a month? I keep reading these sort of pep-talky things. You know: writing isn't fun. It's actually really difficult, if it was easy everyone would be a writer! Even though everyone thinks it's so easy until they try! But this month is all about completing a project, NO MATTER HOW TOUGH YOU'RE FINDING IT, and ya just gotta keep on truckin' cause it's gonna be SO WORTH IT OMG! Actually some of these pep-talky things are very funny, or poignant, or just plain good, or indeed all three. But I have a fundamental disagreement with most of them, or at least, with parts of most of them. Because it is fun! In a sort of pleasure-pain way, sometimes; like biting your lip when you have a cold sore (or is that just me?). But fun nonetheless. I don't mean ""fun"" like wheeeee, we're on a rollercoaster isn't this so much FUN fun. (Although, I hate rollercoasters. But I do recognise -- see how good I am at being empathetic? at imagining other people's lives? -- that there are some for whom a rollercoaster is the epitome of fun.). Or, fun like a party, fun like a new dress, fun like binging on popcorn at the cinema, fun like ""hey, guys, this is SO. MUCH. FUN."" I just mean, it's like eating a really good meal. You have to eat anyway. And then you get the perfect steak. That's fun, but it's deeper than fun. It's enjoying the act of surviving. What better thing could there possibly be to enjoy? It's a serious rush. That's what I mean this is. It's the rush of enjoying the act of surviving. ALL. THE. TIME. I'm not kidding or exaggerating (I do kid and exaggerate sometimes; now is not one of those times). I don't mean it's easy, and I don't mean I'm just sitting there and everything is appearing on the screen, perfectly formed. And I don't even mean that I'm grinning wildly like a maniac all of the time (although I am grinning wildly like a maniac quite an awful lot of the time). I just mean that this is not really a struggle for me. I can write 50,000, maybe even 60,000 or 70,000 words in a month because most of the time I am actually stopping myself from writing. Because it is not practical to act all the time in the way that I've acted this month. I do need to wash my socks sometimes, and socialise more regularly, less urgently (Exhibit A: Friday night, I'm several ciders into the evening, in the same converse, skinny jeans, and black jumper I've been wearing all week, in the middle of a mostly-empty dance floor, DANCING, hi, have you ever met me, let me say that again, DANCING, like a complete fool), and cook dinner, and actually be in a relationship (these things need maintaining, you know: you don't just say, ""let's be together!"" and that's it). But probably, if I didn't have to do all of those things, if I didn't want to be a human, I would just sit there at my computer writing all the time. And sometimes, shopping for shoes online. Because occasionally the brain needs a rest. And the ego needs a hot pair of heels. I guess I should clarify though that when I say ""writing"", I don't just mean the actual act of putting words together. I sort of mean the whole ""process"", but of course ""process"" makes it sound wanky, and it isn't really wanky. All I mean is: the thinking (which involves, or can involve, things like a swim or a run or a walk or a bath or, sometimes , hanging up the laundry). And the reading. And the going back and obsessively changing one tiny detail because 20,000 words later you've decided that you should have ended that totally arbitrary sentence with this and not that . The discovery of previously unseen connections between things (a Wodehouse quote and Bryan Magee's Popper , say). The joy, the real joy, is always in these discoveries. To me this is the greatest thing that writing anything -- a novel, an essay, a dissertation, a poem -- offers. Finding the overlaps between texts (where a text is not just a book but maybe a piece of artwork, an equation, an idea, an experience), the overlaps between your text and someone else's, sometimes. Finding quotes that suddenly make sense in the context of what you're writing, ideas that suddenly mean something else because they've been enhanced by other ideas. So all of that, as much as the typing and the actual sentences, is writing. Is it really all happy, all the time? Of course not. Readers, meet My Self Doubt. My Self Doubt, meet -- oh hell, I probably don't have any readers anyway (JUST KIDDING! SEE WHAT I DID THERE?!). She likes to eat my brains for lunch and then piss all over me. But hey-ho, as they say. And also, yes there are times when there just isn't another sentence. JUST ISN'T. Except sit there long enough, read a poem, eat a piece of toast, and suddenly there is. It's like coming to a fence and sitting there for awhile going, gee whiz, I didn't see THAT coming, I'm not a bird, I don't have wings, OH WAIT, I CAN CLIMB OVER IT, OKAY. On our way. So yes. Frustration, self-doubt, smelly socks. But that's just life. 4. I Want To Get It Right (and yes, there is a ""right"") Then there's also always the question, what's the point ? Of writing a novel in a month, I mean. Or indeed of writing a novel at all. Let's put it another way. Do I want to get this right? I mean, do I want each word to be deliberate, do I want the book itself to be edited, clear, to mean something? Yes. I do. And I want this because that's what I do, as a writer. I write things that I think could be published. I'm sorry, but it's true. I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who will write a whole book without thinking, even briefly and without deliberately doing so, of what would happen if the book got published. And who doesn't write with that thought in his mind, if even at the very, very back, where all of the stuff-you-can't-quite-be-bothered-to-thi\\... lives. This novel was not part of The Grand Plan. It isn't the book that I've been slaving and struggling over for two years now, or the book I planned to write after that, or the book I've secretly wanted to write for fifteen years now. But it is A Book. By Me. Which means something. Also, there is no Grand Plan, not really. This is not a science or even an art, it is just a life. Capital L. A Life, or rather My Life. With lots of books in it, some of which apparently cannot be predicted. Yes I am writing this like it will someday be Something, because maybe it will. Maybe it will not. But I don't write things thinking they Will Not and I don't think very many other people do, either, or at least I'd like to think not very many other people do either because I'd like not to be alone in this. (And I know this is not at all what I said in this interview but that was before I'd started this project and before I'd actually really thought about it in the same way I have now). 5. Conclusion So yes. That is why I haven't written very many blog posts in November. 6 Responses YAY! I love this post -- it is laugh-out loud funny and at the same time wise and insightful and just plain brilliant. How do you do that? I look forward to reading this novel someday and all books by Miranda Ward. Loved this post. So glad you're having fun with the novel writing, although I'm sure the Man will be happy at the stroke of midnight when this month of is over! : ) I could totally relate with the 'strategic piles,' -- looking at several of them right now in my apartment. The sexuality in Beckett pile, the Arab adaptations of Shakespearean tragedy pile and the thesis pile. My man is OCD and there are only certain places I can put the book-piles without him going crazy and rearranging them...poor guy. He's been doing his fair share of dishes as well.

757	"Abstract This paper studies the problem of public opinion formation and concentrates on the interplays among three factors: individual attributes, environmental influences and information flow. We present a simple model to analyze the dynamics of four types of networks. Our simulations suggest that regular communities establish not only local consensus, but also global diversity in public opinions. However, when small world networks, random networks, or scale-free networks model social relationships, the results are sensitive to the elasticity coefficient of environmental influences and the average connectivity of the type of network. For example, a community with a higher average connectivity has a higher probability of consensus. Yet, it is misleading to predict results merely based on the characteristic path length of networks. In the process of changing environmental influences and average connectivity, sensitive areas are discovered in the system. By sensitive areas we mean that interior randomness emerges and we cannot predict unequivocally how many opinions will remain upon reaching equilibrium. We also investigate the role of authoritative individuals in information control. While enhancing average connectivity facilitates the diffusion of the authoritative opinion, it makes individuals subject to disturbance from non-authorities as well. Thus, a moderate average connectivity may be preferable because then the public will most likely form an opinion that is parallel with the authoritative one. In a community with a scale-free structure, the influence of authoritative individuals keeps constant with the change of the average connectivity. Provided that the influence of individuals is proportional to the number of their acquaintances, the smallest percentage of authorities is required for a controlled consensus in a scale free network. This study shows that the dynamics of public opinion varies from community to community due to the different degree of impressionability of people and the distinct social network structure of the community. Keywords: Public Opinion, Complex Network, Consensus, Agent-Based Model Introduction In recent years, a large number of agent-based models have been built in order to explore consensus and opinion dynamics. For example, the pioneering papers of Galam and Moscovici ( 1991a ; 1991b ) proposed the first consensus models based on Ising model. Axelrod ( 1997 ) built an agent-based adaptive model to study the dissemination of culture and revealed that local convergence could generate global polarization. The Snazdj model ( Stauffer 2001 ; Stauffer 2002a ; Stauffer 2002b ) and rumors model ( Galam 2003 ) can also be cited as seminal models in this area. In addition, the research on complex networks, driven by the groundwork of Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) and Barabsi and Albert ( 1999 ), has become a vibrant area in academia. Many physicists and social scientists apply networks theories and methodologies in a variety of social issues (e.g. Watts 2002 , Jones and Handcock 2003 , Stauffer and Meyer-Ortmanns 2003 , Galam 2002 , Amblard and Deffuant 2004 , and Tassier 2004 ). However, there are so far few agent-based models that formulate opinion dynamics by combining theories of complex networks. In this study we are primarily interested in how the dynamics of public opinion formation performs in the context of complex networks. For instance, our study is interested in determining whether: People choose to applaud to stand or just keep sitting at the end of a brilliant concert; senior undergraduates choose to get a job, or enroll in graduate school either at home or abroad; people do or do not jump on the bandwagon when a new fashion appears ( Leibenstein 1950 ). Although the opinion of an individual seems to be trivial, the aggregation of them (that is, the public opinion) is indeed worth being studied because new properties at a system level arise out of the interactions at an element level ( Holland 1998 ). We deem that figuring out the driving factors behind these decisions or choices may shed new light on understanding the mechanism of public opinion formation. Sociologists regard the formation of public opinion as the result of social interactions and communication ( Powel 1951 ). It is noted that public opinion formation is distinguished from collective decision making in many studies (e.g. Moscovici and Doise 1992 ). Therefore public opinion formation is not defined by either discussion or persuasion that attempts to achieve a consensus or the principle that the minority should subordinate to the majority. Instead, in public opinion formation, individuals' opinions only reflect the wills of themselves mainly because it is impractical for thousands of people widely spread in a vast (i.e. countrywide) area to come together to discuss specific issues. Based on this comparison, we summarize the common characteristics of public opinion formation and propose a simple model for public opinion formation without persuasion. It does not aim at an exact description of reality. Instead, by doing some crude approximations, the model focuses on highlighting essential features of an otherwise very complex phenomenon. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the factors affecting public opinion formation. In section 3, we give a basic description of our model and a detailed analysis of its simulations. We offer concluding comments in Section 4. Factors affecting public opinions In order to fully understand the complexity of factors that attribute to public opinion formation, we contextualize the discussion of the model by proposing a theoretical framework, in which the roles of individual attributes, environmental influences and information flow are examined. The framework serves as the underpinning of our model when constructing parameters and hypotheses. Individual attributes In any social system individuals are diverse and complex. We rely on Jager's ( 2000 ) definition of the micro-level driving factors of human and we assume that the following individual attributes affect the formation of individual opinions: Value orientation. The value orientation, defined as preference for a particular distribution of outcomes for oneself and others, is an important behavior-determining factor in social systems ( Messick and McClintock 1968 ; McClintock 1978 ). For instance, idiosyncratic preferences inculcated in each person by the culture, lead a person to be personally inclined to opt, for example, for a positive rather than a negative attitude ( Amaro de Matos 2004 ). Needs. People make decisions to meet their various needs: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity and freedom ( Max-Neef 1992 ). The combination of needs and the opportunity of fulfilling these needs results in a level of need satisfaction, which motivates individuals to pursue certain opportunities. Ability. People have physical, financial, and social resources that are governable to meet their needs. People's ability to use these resources determines their behavioral control over various opportunities. People consider their available resources comprehensively and make benefit-and-loss analysis with given limitations (of computation, of information, and so on). Emotion. People make choices not only by evaluating the consequences and their probability of occurring, but also and even sometimes primarily at a gut or emotional level ( Bechara 2004 ). At high emotional intensity, there are discontinuous ""jumps"" in the behavior ( Bosman et al 2006 ). Personality. Extraversion and agreeableness are personality factors affecting the behaviors of individual decision making ( Koole et al 2001 ). Other factors, like risk preference, are also important. A risk-taking individual may be adventurous in the process of making choices, while a risk-averse one is cautious when taking actions. Environmental influences Human existence cannot be separated from the environment where human beings live. In this study, we divide environmental influences into two levels: Macro-level environmental influences include technology, economy, demography (population), institutions and culture ( Vlek 1995 ) and thus affect individual behaviors. Even in a setting of no direct interaction between individuals, there is a chance that the individuals face significant and perhaps even coercive social pressure to conform ( Amaro de Matos 2004 ). A leader, a societal majority or other non-tangible factors, may influence the direction of everybody's attitude. For example, individuals may decide to buy Coca Cola rather than Pepsi Cola simply because they are big fans of one movie star who likes to drink Coca Cola. Global or top-down control is often used when building a multi-agents model. What we mean by top-down control ( Sanderson 2000 ) is not to manipulate the rules of individual behaviors, but instead use global information to govern. Alfred W. Hubler ( 2005 ) demonstrated the advantage of considering both patterns of information process -- bottom-up and top-down, in comprehending the emerging patterns and dynamics. Although he demonstrated his theory through a model of the competition of plant seedlings for sunlight and water, it remains applicable and relevant to how society functions. Micro-level environmental influences are defined as the interactions between neighbors or acquaintances at a local level. Neighborhood effects carry significant influences on many behavioral outcomes, such as criminal activity, drug and alcohol use, childbearing out of wedlock, schooling and church attendance ( Case and Katz 1991 ). Local interactions models in economics highlight how agents' preferences, information, choices or outcomes are directly affected by other agents' behavior and are not, as commonly believed, mediated primarily by markets ( Conley and Topa 2003 ).These local interplays are subject to individuals' expectations and from their long-term learning and adaptation ( Holland 1996 ). At this point, we do not think the issue of public opinion formation falls into the field of game theory, because traditional game theory often assumes that players have knowledge of the entire environmental structure and of other players' decision making process ( Sato et al. 2004 ). Information flow Flow is considered a fundamental concept in complex adaptive systems. Three types of flow are identified: material flow, energy flow and information flow. Nevertheless, not all flow presents simultaneously in a single system. For example, in Holland's echo model ( 1996 ), only material flow and information flow coexist. Since in the context of public opinion formation, few elements of material flow or energy flow are observed among individuals or between individuals and the environment, in our study, we merely take into account information flow. In order to fully imagine information flow, it is often depicted visually through its topological properties, which ultimately helps us understand the pattern of information flow. On the largest scale, the collectivity of individuals (e.g. a community, a city or a nation) can be viewed as a giant network; within this giant network, a ""link"" is the acquaintanceship between two persons. In fact, research shows that the topological properties of a social network considerably affect its function and overall organization ( Vazquez et al. 2004 ; Weisbuch et al. 2005 ). Small world networks can be highly clustered, like regular networks, yet they have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs ( Watts and Strogatz 1998 ). Scale-free networks differ from lattices by the inhomogeneity of connectivity and by their smaller diameters. In social networks, the characteristic path length refers to the total average length of shortest paths between two individuals. If the network structure of a community is parallel to a regular network, information transferring tends to be slow within the neighborhood; if it is parallel to a random network, information travels rapidly and widely; if it is analogous to a small world network or a scale free network -- such as the collaboration graph of film actors ( Watts and Strogatz 1998 ; Barabsi et al. 1999 ), information can also diffuse rapidly, yet most information diffusion takes place within a limited neighborhood. Furthermore, the information flow in public opinion formation should be distinguished from informational cascade that has been observed in a number of conformity models ( Bikhchandani et al 1992 ; Kawaguchi 2004 ). An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information ( Bikhchandani et al. 1992 ). The problem of utilizing informational cascade models to explain public opinion formation is three-fold. First, in public opinion formation decisions do not have to be made sequentially. Second, in public opinion formation, people do not ignore choices of those behind them. Third, people in public opinion formation can change their opinions every moment during the process. The model To visualize the problem of public opinion formation in a simple manner, we develop a simple computational model. It aims, by making crude approximations, to discover certain essential aspects of opinion dynamics. Our model is based on two hypotheses: The social environment is homogeneous for everyone. In other words, each agent shares the same macro-level environment. No discussion and persuasion are considered in the process of public opinion formation. By making this hypothesis, we distinguish our model from collective decision models. Basic descriptions We consider a population of N (For clarity, N=900) interacting agents. Many earlier models, such as the Ising model ( Galam and Moscovici 1991a ; Galam and Moscovici 1991b ), the Sznajd model ( Sznajd-Weron and Sznajd 2000 ), the compromise model ( Ben-Naim et al. 2003 ) and the constrained voter model ( Vazquez et al. 2003 ), focus on quantifying agents' evaluations on a given issue, using either a discrete or a continuous variable. Our study is concerned with the options agents choose rather than how agents evaluate possible options. For simplicity, we concentrate on a case of three options; three is the minimum number that gives non-trivial results and yet permits us to explore the dynamics of the model. Let s j,i be a Boolean variable to denote the choice of agent j upon option i (i = 1, 2, 3). For example, s 20,2 =1 means that agent No.20 is in favor of option 2, and s 20,1 and s 20,3 should necessarily be equal to 0. As discussed in Section 2, individuals have different private incentives. In a very large population, it is not feasible to describe the different individual incentives. Luckily, such manipulation is also unnecessary because our model aims to examine not only the interactions between individuals and the environment, but also the influence of different social network structures on model behaviors. Undue emphasis on detailed description of the diversity of agents does not help us to meet our primary objective, to explore the mechanism of the model. In this study, the distribution of private incentives is modeled by a probability density. We define a random variable t i , ranging from 0 to 1, and t i follows uniform distribution. Vector T = (t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) denotes the intrinsic evaluations on each option. Opinions of individuals in a heterogeneous society evolve under the influences of acquaintances. In previous models (e. g. Laguna et al. 2005 ), agents are distributed in a hierarchy of different authority levels. Here we equip each agent with a continuous variable v i , measuring the influence on other agents when its choice is i . We assume that v follows a uniform distribution in [0, 1] in small world and random networks. However, we consider two hypotheses -- uniform distribution or proportional distribution with respect to the distribution of v in scale free networks. We assume the influence parameter in small world and random works follows random distribution instead of proportional to the number of acquaintances for two reasons. First, a random distribution of the influence is inherent in the generating processes of small world and random works. Unlike the preferential choices in scale-free networks, agents establish their connections in a random way, and thus agents do not consider the influence of others when establishing a connection. Second, a well-connected agent may not be the person who has great influential power. For example, film stars know and are known by a lot of people; however, their acquaintances (e.g. their fans) may not agree with the opinions of these film stars on issues like health care reform or anti-terrorism. In this case, the connectivity of an agent has little to do with his or her influential power. In contrast, scale free networks distinguish themselves from other types of networks by the key feature of preferential attachment ( Barabsi and Albert 1999 ). Preferential attachment addresses the point that new vertices attach preferably to those who are already well connected. In reality, people are willing to be known by influential persons. The connections are established ""purposely"" rather than ""randomly"". As a result, those influential individuals are by and large also well-connected. Therefore, we model another scenario besides uniform distribution in which the influence parameter in scale free networks is proportional to the number of acquaintances. At the beginning of the simulation, agents initialize their choices based on the evaluation vector T. In other words, each agent goes for the option upon which he/she places the highest evaluation. In the following steps, agents interact with each other by exchanging information. Each agent receives decision signals from its acquaintances, and then calculates the weighted average value, which is used to formulate the influence of the environment. Let vector H = (h 1 , h 2 , h 3 ) denote the environment influence of every opinion. The mathematical expression of h is: (1) where agent j connects with agent i . Figure 1 presents an example to show how to compute the environment influence. Agents balance their desire to provide an honest signal of their intrinsic preferences against the pressure to conform, and then get the total utility function, U . U is the conclusive variable for agents to switch their choices within each simulation step. The expression of U is given by Cobb-Douglas function ( Cobb and Douglas 1928 ): (2) The indices ? and 1-? are elasticity coefficients of environment influence and intrinsic factors, respectively. To examine the dynamics under a variety of information diffusion structures, we consider four types of complex networks: regular, small world, random and scale-free. We use the method of Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) as a reference and we treat the collection of agents as a ring of n vertices, each connecting with k nearest neighbors, and then a regular network has been constructed. We choose a vertex and the edge that connects it to its nearest neighbors in a clockwise sense. With probability p ( p =0.3), we reconnect this edge to a vertex chosen uniformly at random over the entire ring, with duplicate edges forbidden; we continue this process, circulating around the ring and proceeding outward to more distant neighbors after each lap, until each edge in the original network has been considered once. We do this until we get a small world graph. Increasing p until p =1, all edges are rewired randomly and then the graph itself becomes a random graph. As for the construction of scale-free networks ( Aleksiejuk et al. 2002 ), we start with a full-connected network with m (m &lt; 30) vertices. Since m is far smaller than N, how the m vertices connect does not affect the topology of the whole network. Then, additional N- m nodes are added as follows: each new node is linked to k existing nodes, with a probability proportional to the number of connections that these existing nodes have. When the new link happens, it increases the number of connections by one for both nodes. The algorithms of network construction can be found in Appendix 1. Results Our model aims primarily at shedding light on two questions. First, what equilibrium characteristics does the system demonstrate as the network structure changes? Second, to what degree will the model dynamics be altered once we add some macro control to the model? In the first step (t=0), each agent initializes their opinions based upon interior evaluations. The evaluation is generated by a random number [0, 1]. They compare evaluations among three options and then exercise choices. Agents with the same choice form a group. The collectivity of agents who are in favor of one option is called the install base ( Gandal 2002 ) of this option. To minimize the disturbance of the install base on system dynamics, each option has roughly the same number of supporters in the initial state. We suppose that the influential factors of an agent follows uniform distribution in four types of networks as mentioned above. To minimize the disturbance from the initial states of agents, we run models using the same data in terms of influential factors and interior evaluations. Starting at the initial configuration, the model proceeds in a way as shown in Appendix 2. Computational modeling allows great flexibility in implementation of timing and process. To demonstrate how timing can be implemented, we consider two updating procedures: random and sequential. By sequential we mean agents update opinions in a serial order from No. 1 to No. 900. At first, we take it for granted that sequential updating is more likely leading to a consensus than random updating. By simulation, however, we find that in both cases, this conjecture cannot be validated for the differences of model dynamics are not sufficiently significant. The simulations under a regular network can be seen in figure 2. We varied network types and observed similar test results for 30 runs each case. Even in the case of sequential updating, agents consider both anterior and posterior information in terms of decision signals, which is the critical difference from the information cascade model ( Bikhchandani et al. 1992 ). Figure 2 . Comparison of two information updating mechanisms. Here, both simulations are run under the situation that the average connectivity is 30 and ? is 0.5 with a regular graph. The left two graphs are lattices in which the color of each cell represents the opinion of one agent. The right two graphs are the evolving curves of public opinion. In the rest of this section, all simulations are done in a way that agents update opinion states randomly. In regular graphs, we find that no matter how ? changes, there is always opinion fragmentation. Even if we increase the value of ? up to 1 -- that is, the behavior of agents is thoroughly subject to the environment influence, global consensus still fails to appear. We also remodeled the standing ovation problem ( Miller and Page 2004 ) using the Swarm platform, and got similar results: there is no global consensus in auditorium. This is because regular graphs have long characteristic path lengths, which narrow down the scope of information diffusion. Nevertheless, simulations associated with the three other types of networks report different results. We adjusted the value of ? as well as the average connectivity (AC) of the graph, and ran the model 30 times for each combination of ? and AC to compare outcomes under different scenarios (see Table 1, 2 and 3). CPL in the tables denotes the average of characteristic path length for 30 runs. The statistical data denote the average numbers of opinions (ANO) in stable states. The data within parentheses are the standard deviations of ANOs whereas no parenthesis means zero standard deviation. As shown in each table, a higher AC follows a smaller CPL, which promises a higher efficiency of information diffusion. Notice that under some combinations of AC and ?, ANO are not integers, indicating multiple outcomes for runs. For instance, when AC is 30 and ? is 0.7 within a small world graph, the number of opinions in a stable state can be equal to either one, two or three. Recall that the initial states of all agents have been predetermined for each run, so this uncertainty can be traceable to nonlinear factors endogenous in a deterministic system. In other words, the random process of network construction, ungoverned by exterior conditions, attributes to the multiform of results. For the combinations in which the standard deviations are not equal to zero, an unequivocal prediction of the number of opinions seems to be impossible. We refer to these combinations as sensitive areas. Two salient features are found in these tables: (1) as AC and ? increase, ANO decreases from 3 to 1. This suggests that systems with higher AC and ? are more likely to conform and reach a global consensus (It is worth to be noted that Amblard and Deffuant ( 2004 ) find the same phase transition with a different model and they further suggest that the consensus results more from the redundancy of links than from the average shortest path. However, the latter can also be considered as an indirect indicator of the redundancy). (2) Sensitive areas exist in all three networks. The difference among the three tables lies in that the average number of opinions in table 1 is equal to or larger than that in Table 2, and both of them are equal to or larger than that in table 3.Yet, the difference is not remarkable. It may be explained by the fact that one topological character may be shared by a small world, random and scale-free networks. All three networks have similar characteristic path lengths given the same average connectivity. However, a relatively small CPL does not necessarily follow a small ANO. Figure 3 shows us an example to the point in a random graph (?=0.7). When CPL equals to 2.65 with connection being 6, the result of ANO is 3; in contrast, when CPL equals to 2.65 with connection being 30, the result of ANO is 1. Based on this observation, we argue that it is sometimes problematic to use the characteristic path length as the single parameter to predict the number of opinions when reaching equilibrium. Figure 3 . Comparison of equilibrium between two connections with the same characteristic path length in a random network The control, handling, and possible manipulation of information are now major issues in social organizations including economy, politics, defense, and even in fashion and personal affairs ( Galam 2003 ). Hence, our model considers the role of authoritative individuals in the general public. We define authoritative individuals as agents with influential factors larger than a given threshold (for example, v i &gt; 0.85 in this model). Our purpose is to examine on what condition agents follow the opinions of authorities and which type of network facilitates an expected consensus most effectively. We designed the experiment as follows: based on the same initial state as above simulations (here ? = 0.7), we fix the opinions of agents with the highest influential factors as option A (blue-colored in Figure 2 and 3). Notice that even by doing this, option A still has an disadvantage in terms of the number of its supporters, compared with option B and C. Therefore, it is reasonable to claim that the positive network effect ( Katz and Shapiro 1994 ) of an installed base doesn't account for the success of option A provided that A dominates the public opinions at the end. Suppose that the influence of agents follows uniform distribution, we write down the minimum percentage of authorities (MPA, also an average for 30 runs) required to reach an equilibrium where all agents go for opinion A (Table 4). That is, the opinion of the general public is consistent with that of the authorities and thereby the result turns out to be exactly what has been expected. By comparing MPA of small world network and random network in table 4, we uncover some interesting results: (1) MPA in random networks is smaller than the counterpart in small world networks. That is , in order to reach a controlled consensus of opinion A, a social network with a random structure needs a relatively low proportion of authoritative individuals. On the other hand, in a small world structure agents in random networks can effectively exploit their authorities to impose their opinions on others, regardless of the actual value of their opinions. (2) As AC increases from 10 to 50, MPA in small world and random networks descends notably at first. After reaching a lowest point, however, AC goes up slowly. A possible explanation of this tendency might be that a relatively higher AC facilitates the diffusion of authoritative opinions. Nevertheless, when agents have too many connections with other ones, they are overwhelmed with information from both authoritative and non-authoritative individuals. As a consequence, the role of authoritative opinions is compromised due to the disturbance from non-authorities. This situation calls for a higher MPA for the purpose of generating the expected equilibrium. We have unfolded here the tendencies of the dynamics of public opinion, and not an exact quantitative determination of any data. In scale-free networks, we find that MPA refuses to fluctuate with AC. Because the probability of finding a highly connected vertex decreases exponentially with its connectivities ( Barabsi and Albert 1999 ), most authoritative agents by random selection are not in the position of hub nodes (hub nodes have the highest connectivity). Low connectivity of authorities frustrates the diffusion of their opinion, and hence, a higher MPA is required for a global consensus of opinion A in scale-free networks. Besides random distribution, we also run the simulations under the hypothesis that the influential factor of an agent in scale-free networks is proportional to its connectivity. The results of MPA are shown in the parentheses of table 2. Under this assumption, agents with the highest influential factors are exactly those with the highest connections. The opinion of authorities can be diffused to the largest extent. Consequently, a quite small percentage (1%) of authorities can sway the systemic equilibrium. Conclusions In this study, we summarize three factors affecting the formation of public opinion. They are individual attributes, environmental influences and information flows. We present an agent-based model where conforming behavior may lead to homogeneity or segregation into distinct groups. By exploring the dynamic characteristics of systemic equilibrium with different elasticity coefficients of the environmental influence, mechanisms of information updating as well as network topologies, we gain some important insights. In the regular geometry of social relationships, the system manifests itself by local consensus and global diversity. When the social relationship is modeled by small world networks, random networks or scale-free networks, however, the result is sensitive to elasticity coefficients of the environmental influence and the average connectivity of networks. Ultimately, the higher the average connectivity of the network is, the fewer opinions remain at the end. During the simulations for certain average connectivity, sensitive areas are discovered unexpectedly. The system in sensitive areas presents determinate randomness so that the number of opinions when reaching equilibrium remains uncertain. We also find that it might be misleading to predict the number of surviving opinions merely based on the characteristic path length of the network, since a short characteristic path length may possibly accompany with a low average connectivity, which determines the systemic dynamics more directly and essentially. We examine the role of information control, and find that few individuals with the highest influence, namely authorities in this paper, can sway the balance of outcomes. In a social structure of small world networks or random networks, increasing the average connectivity facilitates the diffusion of authorities' opinion. However, in the process of decision-making, people will be subject to disturbances from non-authorities. While a moderate average connectivity may be preferable for the public to form a specific opinion in small world or random networks, the role of authorities in a community with a scale-free structure remains immune to the change of the average connectivity. Provided that the influence of individuals is proportional to the number of their acquaintances in scale-free social networks, the smallest proportion of authorities is required to reach a controlled consensus. Our findings address the extent to which a community would reach a consensus on certain issues. The findings suggest that different communities exhibit different dynamics that is attributable to the different degree of impressionability of people and the distinct structure of the social network of community. To conclude, we have presented a simple model of opinion dynamics which is able to reproduce some of the complexities the social reality. The model may be generalized to a large spectrum of social, economical and political phenomena that involve conformity effects. But more thoughts and studies should be performed before getting to a clear proposal scheme. One limitation of this study is that we don't address the question how much the results are sensitive to the initial even distribution of intrinsic preference types. The preliminary results reported here suggest many avenues for future research. For example, in real life not every person is open-minded and ready to change opinions. Therefore, it would be interesting to introduce stubborn agents into the model. In addition, we can also take into account the scenario in which mutually connected agents share similar preference and form groups or strata.

38157	"Testament -- Alex Skolnick Testament are one of the pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene. After nine successful albums since the 80?s, the band are set to release their tenth studio album titled 'Dark Roots of Earth' in just a few days from now. A couple of weeks ago, Testament's guitarist Alex Skolnick had a chat to Metal Obsession about their new album, his departure from the band from 1993-2005 and Randy Blythe. Metal Obsession: Your tenth studio album 'Dark Roots of Earth' will be released very soon. I'd presume that you're excited for it? Alex Skolnick: I'm excited and relieved. Metal Obsession: Why relieved? Alex: Let me tell you straight out; a lot of work goes into these things. So it's just a huge relief to have it out. Metal Obsession: Do you feel that this album is your best work yet? Alex: I think so. I think it's the most diverse album, and I also think it has the least amount of repetition, and the most variety. Our new album should have something for everybody. Metal Obsession: The other guitarist, Eric Peterson stated in an interview that the band wanted to play more melodic rock. While the album remained more on the thrash side, you did get the chance to throw some melodic stuff in. Who was it that was more influenced by melodic rock? Alex: Well I guess that's a strange way to put it; 'melodic rock stuff' . I always want my music to be musically interesting. I like it to have a sense of harmony, and a sense of melody, so a little bit of sophistication. So if that qualifies as melodic rock stuff, then I suppose I'm guilty. *laughs* But I think that Chuck was also more interested in really using his voice and singing melodies. As you know, Chuck has a few different styles. He has his classic style, he has his 90?s death metal style. He's able to do both, and I think he wanted to rest the death metal vocals on this album, and explore more of the melodic range. Metal Obsession: That's what I was thinking. Because I could hear a lot more of the death metal vocals on your last album, The Formation of Damnation . I thought this album would be the same before I listened to it. Alex: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he wanted to do less of that. Metal Obsession: What's the current situation of the Testament drummer -- Is Gene Hoglan an official member of the band, or did he just help out with the new album and touring? Alex: I think things are different now than they used to be. I mean, album cycles last longer, bands in general don't release albums as often as they used to. Even the younger bands. So, this is no longer a younger band, AND it's just a period where albums don't happen as often as they used to. But you know, in the early 90?s, you could call someone a permanent member, then there'd be an album coming out every year or every two years with the same members. But now, this album will have came out... 3 years since the last one? Actually, 4 years ago. It came out in 2008. In the old days, even legendary bands wouldn't last that long. So for this album, yes; Gene Hoglan is the main drummer. He probably won't be at every show, because there will be occasional events on. He has some other commitments, especially Dethklok . But I know that most of the shows, he's going to be there. He's the first call guy. He's the guy on the album, the guy in the photographs, so he isn't so much the permanent drummer, but he's definitely the first call drummer. Metal Obsession: So you're at your tenth studio album now. How many more do you think you will do? Alex: It's really hard to say! When we did the reunion, it was unclear that we were going to do an album, and then it became clear, like ""Yeah okay, we'll do an album!"" Then with this album, it was talked about, it was reflected upon, then we decided that yes, we're going to do this album. But yeah, we really can't say. A couple of years ago, I don't think any of us would have predicted that there'd be two new studio albums. Metal Obsession: You took a 12 year break from Testament from 1993 to 2005. What was the reason behind leaving the band, and what made you want to come back? Alex: There were a lot of reasons, man. The main reason for me was that I consider myself a diverse musician. I spent just about all of my time out of the band building up my guitar techniques, and I appreciated many different styles of music. So I thought, why not do whatever I can do be a diverse musician? I had already been studying other styles of music, I knew I eventually wanted to do more jazz and funk music. It just got to the point where I really needed to focus on that full time. But to be completely honest, it was a little difficult to be in the band at that time. The original drummer also left the band shortly after I did. It's very rare for someone to last more than one record, other than the original line-up. But when I came back, I was ready to play metal again. Not just metal again, but... I knew eventually I was going to play metal again as well as continue my other styles. So I did, and I was trying to think of the right project. It was right around that time that I got a call from the guys from Testament, saying that they wanted to do this reunion. The reunion tour lead to an album, then that album lead to more tours, and it's been a nice little ride ever since. And now it's almost lasted longer than I was in the band the first time. Metal Obsession: Is there any chance of Testament making a festival appearance or doing a headline tour in Australia soon? Alex: Ah, I don't know about soon, we're pretty booked out with North American tours at the moment. But I think that next year is a very good chance of an Australian tour. I expect to see that in 2013. Metal Obsession: Do you have any favourite bands from down here in Australia? Alex: Yes I do. Obviously the big one would be AC/DC . But last time I was there, I got turned on to a lot of the bands from the scene that AC/DC came from, like Rose Tattoo , and some of these other bands that I really wasn't aware of. The whole 'pub rock' thing was really cool. I also don't know how well the band Wolfmother is thought of over there, supposedly some people think of them as hipster metal. But I think the direction is really good, I quite enjoy them. Metal Obsession: How about any thrash bands from Australia, do you know many? Alex: I remember some of the bands that have been on the bill when we played Australia, and they were really good. But yeah, I need to be turned onto more of them! Metal Obsession: How about your favourite band from the Bay Area, where you came from -- Whether it's just a local band or a big band that you've toured with over the years, who's your favourite? Alex: From the Bay Area? That's hard to say, but probably Death Angel . I think that they're a favourite of many of us. Metal Obsession: As I'm sure you're aware, the big news in the metal world today is Randy Blythe (Lamb of God) being arrested in another country, being charged with manslaughter. What is your view on all of the controversy over the past couple of weeks? Do you support the ""Free Randy Blythe"" cause? Alex: I'm honestly in shock about it, actually. Randy is a good friend, and I am very much in shock. He had to spend the night in jail, and for a start that's what it was. Then it turned into a weekend, then it turned into a week, now it's been two weeks, and I think it's outrageous! I think there will be a big backlash until this is resolved. I've been on Twitter trying to get the attention of politicians, media, and so far it's only been covered by local news in Randy's town. It really needs to be covered by the bigger media outlets. Somebody on Twitter made the point that Justin Bieber recently got a speeding ticket, and that was front page news. And here we have a grammy nominated musician arrested and charged with manslaughter in a different country, and there is no mention. Metal Obsession: I feel that they're only not covering the news for front page headlines being that he's a metal musician. It's quite unfair really. Alex: Yeah, I agree. And it's such a shame, because he's not just a metal musician, he's a very reflective and intelligent person. Nobody deserves this treatment, it's just horrifying. Metal Obsession: Is there anything else that you'd like to say? Alex: That's it I think. I'll say that I really appreciate all the support from Australia, I can't wait to go back there. I know we'll be seeing everyone from down under very soon!

28685	"Passenger UAVs may be the future, predicts unmanned systems technology company Athena Unmanned aircraft may be flying passengers within the next 10-20 years, says the head of UAV technology provider Athena Technologies. Dr David Vos made the prediction while introducing the company's two new superlight navigation and sensor systems at the show. The Micro INS and the Micro GuideStar include GPS Inertial Navigational Systems (INS),and air data sensor system (ADAHRS). The Micro GuideStar also includes full flight control capability. He said that technology similar to that provided in the cell phone-sized guidance systems, which weigh only 110g (4oz), will mean that in 10 years' time, UAVs will be common in commercial airspace. The affordability and compact weight of the systems enables UAV manufacturers to use multiple identical systems in each UAV, so that in the event of damage or malfunction to one part of the system, identical auxiliary cells can take over to maintain the same functionality. Micro systems already offer reliability at the level of triple and quadruple redundancy protection. ""Distributed high levels of extra redundancy on aircraft enable it to maintain functionality if damaged, adding dramatically to safety,"" Vos says. The Micros are able to navigate and autonomously control drones, missiles and general aviation aircraft, but it is in the UAV field that they will offer the biggest developments, Vos says. ""Anything you can think of that a manned aircraft will do today; UAVs will do in the future. In years to come, unmanned passenger aircraft may be viewed in a similar way to that which unmanned airport shuttle trains are viewed today,"" he says. ""The rate at which culture adopts new technology today is faster than ever. The young generation today are willing to adopt new developments at an incredibly fast rate, and this will speed up the rate at which this technology develops."" "	News	News
30883	"In physics , a force is said to do work when it acts on a body, and there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force. For example, when you lift a suitcase from the floor, the work done on the suitcase is the force it takes to lift it (its weight) times the height that it is lifted. The term work was introduced in 1826 by the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as ""weight lifted through a height"", which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines. The SI unit of work is the newton-metre or joule (J). The work done by a constant force of magnitude F on a point that moves a displacement (not distance) s in the direction of the force is the product, For example, if a force of 10 newtons ( F = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres ( s = 2 m), then it does the work W = (10 N)(2 m) = 20 N m = 20 J. This is approximately the work done lifting a 1 kg weight from ground to over a person's head against the force of gravity. Notice that the work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance. The SI unit of work is the joule (J), which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a distance of one metre . The dimensionally equivalent newton-metre (N·m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre, which is the measurement unit of torque . Usage of N·m is discouraged by the SI authority , since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of energy. [ 3 ] From Newton's second law , it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the velocity and rotation of that body, The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservative. Therefore work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field, without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to minus the change of potential energy of the object, These formulas demonstrate that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions , and units, of energy. The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work/energy principles. Constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system, constraining the object within a boundary (in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is stuck to the slope, when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter'). They eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint, thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force, due to this force. For example, the centripetal force exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle. This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball. Another example is a book on a table. If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table, then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards. The force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work. The magnetic force on a charged particle is F = q v × B , where q is the charge, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field . The result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so F ⊥ v . The dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work W = F · v = 0, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed. For moving objects, the quantity of work/time is calculated as distance/time, or velocity. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or watts ) is the scalar product of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power . Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the fundamental theorem of calculus , the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application. [ 4 ] Work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a distance. As the point moves, it follows a curve X , with a velocity v , at each instant. The small amount of work δW that occurs over an instant of time dt is calculated as where the F.v is the power over the instant dt . The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work, where C is the trajectory from x (t 1 ) to x (t 2 ). This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be path dependent . If the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is F , then this integral simplifies to where s is distance along the line. If F is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to where s is the distance travelled by the point along the line. This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle. In this case the dot product F ·d s = F cos θ ds, where θ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement, [ 4 ] that is In the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90 degrees from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a friction-less ideal centrifuge. Calculating the work as ""force times straight path segment"" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called scalar tangential component ( , where is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows: Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point. A torque results from equal, and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body. The sum of these forces cancel, but their effect on the body is the torque T . The work of the torque is calculated as where the T.ω is the power over the instant δ t . The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work, This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity ω that varies with time, and is therefore said to be path dependent . If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form, where φ is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector S . In this case, the work of the torque becomes, where C is the trajectory from φ(t 1 ) to φ(t 2 ) . This integral depends on the rotational trajectory φ(t) , and is therefore path-dependent. If the torque T is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that, and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form, [ 5 ] A force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever arm This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude F , being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance r , as shown in the figure. This force will act through the distance along the circular arc s=rφ , so the work done is Introduce the torque τ=Fr , to obtain as presented above. Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work. The scalar product of a force F and the velocity v of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time. Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, C = x (t), defines the work input to the system by the force. Therefore, the work done by a force F on an object that travels along a curve C is given by the line integral : where dx ( t ) defines the trajectory C and v' is the velocity along this trajectory. In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent. The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power, If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is, by the gradient theorem , the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. Such a force is said to be conservative . This means that there is a potential function U ( x ), that can be evaluated at the two points x (t 1 ) and x (t 2 ) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is The function U ( x ) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces. Because the potential U defines a force F at every point x in space, the set of forces is called a force field . The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity V of the body, that is Gravity exerts a constant downward force on every object. Near the surface of the earth the acceleration due to gravity is g=9.8 m.s −2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is F g = mg . It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object. If an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance y 2 - y 1 , the work W done on the object by its weight mg is: where F g is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δ y is the change in height y. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight. Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force F =(-kx, 0, 0) that is proportional to its deflection in the x direction independent of how a body moves. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space curve X (t) = ( x (t), y (t), z (t)), is calculated using its velocity, v =( v x , v y , v z ), to obtain For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at t=0, then the integral of the product of the distance x and the x-velocity, xv x , is (1/2)x 2 . The principle of work and kinetic energy (also known as the work-energy principle ) states that the work done by all forces acting on a particle (the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle. [ 7 ] The derivation of the work-energy principle begins with Newton's second law and the resultant force on a particle which includes forces applied to the particle and constraint forces imposed on its movement. Computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system. [ 8 ] Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force. This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power. The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration. The fact the work-energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies Lagrangian mechanics . [ 9 ] This section focusses on the work-energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics. In more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device, the heat energy in a thermal system, or the electrical energy in an electrical device. Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another. In the case the resultant force F is constant in both magnitude and direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the particle is moving with constant acceleration a along a straight line. [ 10 ] The relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation F = ma ( Newton's second law ), and the particle displacement s can be expressed by the equation The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement. Substituting the above equations, one obtains: In the general case of rectilinear motion, when the net force F is not constant in magnitude, but is constant in direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the work must be integrated along the path of the particle: For any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path, it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above. Some authors call this result work-energy principle , but it is more widely known as the work-energy theorem : The identity requires some algebra. From the identity and definition it follows . The remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case. In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of Newton's second law of motion . It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle. Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work-energy principle. To see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory X (t) with a force F acting on it. Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces R , then Newton's Law takes the form Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to F . The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define R , and we have For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so X =(d,0) and the velocity is V =(v, 0), then R.V =0, and F.V =F x v, where F x is the component of F along the X-axis, so Integration of both sides yields If F x is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where k is the coefficient of friction and W is the weight of the car. Then the force along the trajectory is F x =-kW. The velocity v of the car can be determined from the length s of the skid using the work-energy principle, Notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is m = W/g . Consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity V , of say 60 mph (88 fps). Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be less than if these forces are neglected. Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be X (t) which is a curve in three-dimensional space. The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity F =(0,0, W ), while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force R . Newton's second law yields, where V is the magnitude of V . The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because R . V =0, which means they do no work. Integrate both sides to obtain The weight force W is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore, Recall that V(t 1 )=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle. In order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road. This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled—for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal. Therefore, the distance s in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity V is at least The work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a resultant force and torque . To see this, let the forces F 1 , F 2 ... F n act on the points X 1 , X 2 ... X n in a rigid body. The trajectories of X i , i=1,...,n are defined by the movement of the rigid body. This movement is given by the set of rotations [A(t)] and the trajectory d (t) of a reference point in the body. Let the coordinates x i i=1,...,n define these points in the moving rigid body's reference frame M , so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame F are given by The velocity of the points X i along their trajectories are where ω is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix known as the angular velocity matrix. The small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements δ r i can be determined by approximating the displacement by δ r = v δt so "	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation

38176	How to build a cob oven -- step 1 I will now describe the first stages of how we built our cob oven; this process took us a few months as we needed to collect the materials first and we were determined to use as many recycled or free items as possible for this. There are many ways and shapes you can build your oven, and you can use different materials. We often hear TV chefs referring to these ovens as bread or pizza ovens....but you can do MUCH more than that in one of these! 'Cob' is an ancient building material, used the world over since the 11 th and 12 th centuries. Traditional 'English' cob was made by mixing a clay based soil with sand, straw and water. It is easy to learn how to make, fireproof and inexpensive, resistant to rain and cold. The big plus is that it is easy to form by hand and can be moulded into any shape you wish. We decided on a traditional rounded shape and as the first step is to make a very strong base so you can wide topped garden wall. A reinforced flat concrete base was needed on which to build. We had to purchase the cement and sand needed for this from a local builders yard, the cement and sand , of course, was purchased new...this was however our only main but necessary  expense . The materials for the cob used were local clay, sand and straw. To create the wall firebricks from old electric storage heater units were used. These have proved to be excellent as they retain the heat longer than normal bricks. Collecting enough firebricks was what took us so long to get started -- we got them from local Freecycle groups, recycling yards, house clearance ...in fact anywhere we could! Some were even brought down from holiday trips to the other side of the country once friends and family knew we were collecting them. Once we had sufficient a plan was sketched and measurements taken -- the door had to be wide enough to put in the heavy duty cast iron cookware and inside we needed it big enough to put two layers of cooking shelves. We also decided to have a chimney which was a little more difficult and not really necessary but well worth the effort. As each layer of bricks were laid the oven had to be left to dry out, so we continued to collect things we would need. A local wood yard has a skip of wood offcuts that can be had for free with permission from the owners, we had trees to lop, and often friends would donate their unwanted logs. Gradually a good supply of free fuel was collected and stored away in a dry place. Then there were the cooking implements to acquire! The heat in the oven would melt any normal cookware so I had to source some good th ick old fashioned cast iron pans. I found a couple of big casserole pots, some heavy cast frying pans and a baking tray. The frying pans had their wooden handles removed and are ideal for putting a roast of meat in. The tray is great for baked potatoes. The casserole dish is used for potatoes and vegetables or for a meaty casserole. I will put some of my recipes on my blog later. ALL my pots and pans are well cleaned up and are from either car boot sales or jumble sales; none cost more than 3.00. I keep them oiled up with a smear of Olive Oil to stop them rusting through and this also gives a slight non stick effect. Last but not least you need some good thick welding gloves to use to get your food out of the oven! 	Instruction	Promotion
38790	Our Latest News Get out of Bed Safely This article will explain a simple, effective way of getting out of bed for back pain sufferers. When you wake up, is your back stiff or sore? If so, spend a few moments breathing deeply and stretching your body long. While you are still lying on your back, bend your knees upward so that your feet are flat on the bed. Roll onto your side. As you do this, try to keep your spine moving as a unit, rather than twisting it. Imagine a steel rod running the length of your spine, starting from the shoulder area and moving down to the hip area. To achieve the rolling, let gravity help you. The key to this is to avoid intentional tightening of your back or abdominal muscles. Using both hands, push yourself up to sitting. As you are pushing yourself up, gently bend your legs at the hips and knees, remembering to keep your spine moving as one unit, rather than twisting it. Allow the weight of your legs to anchor your position, enabling you to push the rest of your body up. Go as slowly as you need to accomplish this movement safely and comfortably. Once you get to sitting, take a moment to rest. When you are ready, make sure you are sitting equally on both sides of your seat. Sit up tall and gently try to arch your lower back to help transition from many hours of lying down into standing. Place one leg in front of the other. Bend your trunk forward, from your hips, keeping your back straight. Straighten both legs at the same time. Bring the back foot forward to meet the front. You're up!

15773	"Note: the header pic isn't from yesterday's stoush, but it sure sets the scene. Israel precision strike takes out Hamas military leader Israel and Hamas appear to be at war and this is the footage that kinda sparked it off (you can argue that Hamas started it with their rockets into Israel... but then you could argue that it's a continuation of conflict that has been raging for 60 years). The footage shows the Israeli strike on Hamas' military commander, Ahmed Al-Jabari and his son as they drove along a city street yesterday. The war porn details an amazingly accurate missile strike that leaves the target a mere shell (below). Israel and Palestine's Hamas in 'Open War' Associated Press' Aron Heller gives us a concise account of just what is happening between Israel and Palestine. Heller points out that ground war is an option they're looking out for, meanwhile RT.com reports: ""An IDF spokesperson says 30,000 reserve soldiers could be called to participate in Gaza operation, Haaretz reports."" Naw, joy to the world! Twitter: Pillar of Defence Elliott Carver, James Bond's nemesis in 'Tomorrow Never Dies' (1997) who provoked war to sell newspapers, would be loving how events are unfolding in the Gaza strip. Not only did Israel launch Operation Pillar of Defence yesterday, but also they did so via Twitter. They've also been taunting Hamas: We recommend that no Hamas operatives, whether low level or senior leaders, show their faces above ground in the days ahead. Naturally, Hamas is using Twitter in a bid to control its side of the story. Check this tweet (WARNING: ACTUAL CHILD CORPSE IMAGE LINK): Shit is blowing my mind -- wartime propaganda is now delivered in real time. Of course, the Israeli campaign is a blend of new age and old school -- they've dropped leaflets for those Palestinians who don't have Internet access -- now that's thoughtful! Ultimately, Israel is going to win any propaganda war -- check this clip on the Guardian website. It illustrates the gulf between the two parties: Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu delivers his talk in English like he's just stepped out of a New York deli; Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhoum & leader Sami Abu Zuhri deliver their talks in Arabic. Unclear whether or not this is by Netanyahu, but it's certainly interesting. The tweet was deleted shortly after it was posted. The US openly supports Israel (Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation by the US), but, if it was real, the Guardian post suggests that the tweet was far more provocative than mere thanks. In response to their reactive attacks on Gaza, Hacktivist group Anonymous have attacked Israeli websites and, in at least one case, have posted a warning on an I.D.F. blog to Israel -- that they must cease fire. Furthermore, after the Israeli government threatened to cut off Internet access to Gaza (which to me demonstrates the absolute power they have over the region), Anonymous warned Israel to reconsider and followed up with this message to the folks in Palestine: Know that Anonymous stands with you in this fight. We will use all our resources to make certain you stay connected to the internet and remain able to transmit your experiences to the world. Okay, enough talk of death -- let's talk about New Zealand! Oh, actually... so, we all lose our shit now and then, but 13 year-old Jordan Nelson took his shit-loss a step too far. After 50 year-old Rosemaree Kurth took Jordan's Freeview TV receiver out of his room, Jordan loaded up a .22 calibre rifle, that Ms. Kurth's partner had taught him to use, and shot her in the back of the head as she worked on a jigsaw puzzle. But hang on Australia... didn't you just bend over backwards for America? Oh, I get it, you've got to balance relations between your wartime bum-chum and your peacetime cash cow, China. Obviously Asia is a big place, but when we think Asia and we trade with Asians , essentially China is whom we mean. Anyway, awkward Australia! Dear god (note: am not actually praying), how about I just post the link to the story and you can read it yourselves? Two priests slipping the same kid rufies on separate occasions? ONE LEMONADE; ONE FANTA? Using video games as the lead-in activity? Priest's name is RAPson? As an ex-Roman Catholic homosexual, I think I'm fully qualified to say -- the Catholic Church is absolutely fucked. Next/last story... Following Alan Jones' terrible remark that Julia Gillard's father ""died of shame,"" 2GB estimates that it incurred losses of ""up to $1.5 million"" as advertisers cancelled, deferred or moved their advertising spend.

11771	"10 Things Americans Do That Drive Brits Nuts American people are some of the loveliest you'll ever meet and make us expats feel all warm, cuddly and very welcome. But just occasionally they do or say something that we Brits find a tad... eccentric. 1. Saying ""I love your accent!"" Before I moved here, I never imagined that my dreary London burr made me sound smart or lovable. At first the compliments were nice, but then a New York tiger mom asked me to talk to her snoozing two-year-old in the hope that it would rub off. A bit much, I thought. 2. Putting last names first The fashion for inflicting quirky monikers on babies started with American parents giving their kids surnames as first names. Remember Sex and the City 's Smith? Absurd. Then last week at the launderette I got chatting to ""Anderson."" Could not take him seriously. 3. They take your plate away too soon Americans love to please, and nowhere is this more evident than in restaurants. If I want a side of pickled kitten lungs or a splash of spaniel milk in my coffee, then by God they'll make it happen. On the flip side, over-eager waiters will whip away an individual diner's plate the second it's empty. In my case, that's long before anyone else at the table has finished. And people are like, ""Seriously, did you even chew?"" No. No I did not. 4. The relentlessly sincere cheer If I'm having a bad day, or a good day -- make that any kind of day -- I do not want people in shops whom I've never met to swaddle me with their sticky, earnest, exaggerated niceness. In America, actual humans say things like ""Ma'am, you have been an awesome customer today,"" just because I bought a box of tampons from their store. 5. Their over-zealous patriotism We get it, you're proud to be an American. It's not like Brits are immune to nationalism, but perhaps we're better able to separate feeling glad (I was lucky enough to be born in a country with democracy and Kit Kats!) from feeling proud. Shouldn't the second one be reserved for my actual achievements? Oh, and to your average Brit, hanging a giant flag from your house is a tiny bit creepy. 6. They treat their pets like people Recently, at a flea market, I saw a woman pushing a buggy. Nothing strange about that, until I looked inside and noticed that her baby was a dog. One of those petulant micro-yappy types who thinks just because it's short you should love it. I've also seen twin pugs out for a winter walk dressed in a full-body knitted suits and ties. And a friend of a friend's cat is on Prozac. 7. Insisting that turkey is tasty There's a good reason why Brits only eat this galumphing fowl once a year, then bitch about it behind its carcass. No matter how many saltwater baths you give your bird, turkey meat is dry, insipid and stringy. Yet Americans put the powdery poultry in everything -- from burgers and chili to meatballs and lasagna -- and make it the culinary centerpiece of not one but two celebrations. 8. Spelling words the wrong way I might as well pry the letter ""u"" from my keyboard for all the good it does me in over here. (But you know which letter made it big in America? ""Z""! Only, they pronounce it wrong.) My point? Remembering to remove 'u's from words like ""colour"" and replace ""s""s with a more abrasive ""z"" is a headache and I resent it. So there. 9. Pretentious pronunciation. Americans, please note: saying ""erb"" instead of ""herb"" and pronouncing ""fillet"" without the ""t"" is not clever or sophisticated. You are not French. Make an actual socialist your president and then we'll talk. 10. Saying ""panties,"" ""fanny"" and ""bangs"" We're all aware from watching Americans onscreen that these are the words for knickers, a bottom and a fringe. But when you live here, occasionally you're forced to deploy these abominations in real life sentences. Only the other day, I said, ""Can you trim my bangs, please?"" I felt dirty afterwards. But ""panties"" is much worse, somehow infantilizing and over-sexualizing ladies' unmentionables. No word should do both these things. This is funny. When I lived in London I felt the exact same way, but reversed. At the pub way way too many guys tried to bait me by asking if I liked their accent (my reply was always: I live here, I'm over it), I thought attendants in stores were so rude and snobbish, and I was completely floored when I learned that no one hangs up a flag (even on St. George's Day!). On top of that I hated the way everything needed an extra ""u"" in it's spelling (and honestly, zed? Zed? What is that!?), I thought that English pronunciations were pretentious, and I almost had a heart attack every time I heard someone say they were going out for a ""fag break."" I think our countries will always have these little things to bicker over, but I absolutely love it! Jill Merrall Totally agree....Lived in England with my English husband for 2 1/2 years...you summed it up perfectly! Dee Robles You've said it all, so I'll just say thanks! Just recently found out what a nounce was, probably spelt it wrong, it's a perv. It just doesn't convey they same meaning when you say it. Perv works for me. lol Rory Er, a nonce is a paedophile. karen A nonce is not a perv or paedophile. A nonce is hmm a flowery chav. Means they are slightly feminine and stupid, is the best way i can describe. I TELL THEM ACRONYM Nonce is an acronym. Not On Normal Courtyard Exercise. So not just paedophiles, all manner of sex offenders that might get killed in prison. England Blows Balls is anyone else unimpressed by the bullshit this author posted? each and every one of these arguments is actually a point why england is shittier than America. Your spelling is old and outdated, get over yourself we have a more advanced language.... If youre not treating your pet like a person you should not own a pet you insensitive cunt. Now go back to your ugly ass women, crooked teeth, and tea with shit crumpets... Jen K Why are you at this website? Go away, you're horrible. Carruthers Wow, thats some advanced language you're using there. You should keep typing 'cunt' and subjecting everyone to your old and outdated stereotyping before they remove your diabetic limbs. I'll keep using mine to eat crumpets with my crooked teeth. Ash Hebdige is this guy for real? Just maybe a little over-reactive I'd say. Rochester To ""England Sucks"" and all the other thin-skinned sourpusses here who actually seem to take offense at this tongue-in-cheek article: Lighten up. There's quite a bit of silliness in both countries. ""Fablos"" article, Ms Margolis Brummie In answer to England Blows Balls our spelling is just fine if you want to spell words differently then go ahead but don't have the nerve to call it English be a good chap and call it American.... As to treating pets like persons why does the US have some of the highest cruelty rates towards domestic animals than most western countries and other half 40% of your population take great pleasure in running round the forest trying to kill anything that moves... Wow What is up with this? Why would someone write this article? The only thing any one of you have seen is on TV! I don't treat my dog like a person, I write how my teachers taught me, I hunt but only for overpopulated animals that would bring a harm to themselves and ecosystem. I also like tea and crumpets even though we call them cookies. Most of you believe more what's in movies and in the news. Stop being so narrow minded. I love my country but I also have been serving to protect it for 12 plus years now. Stop badgering us. We live in excess of 3500 miles away from each other, there's going to be vast differences. Do you want us to turn into you guys? I thought we won the war? SazzyMCH A crumpet IS NOT A COOKIE! Complete Agreement I agree with the person who used the moniker ""Wow"". I understand that this was supposed to be an attempt at humor but it came of as simply bitchy. I have relatives through marriage in Britain and also have relatives who were raised British citizens in other countries. My mother complains about things like spelling, but anyone who is even moderately acquainted with American history would understand patriotism. After all, according to you Brits, we were supposed to be a spectacular failure. Oh and BTW it would seem we HAVE elected a Socialist. More's the pity. I did manage a smile at some of the more ridiculous things mentioned, but I'm afraid things like treating pets as people and naming your children foolishly are world wide phenomena, not limited to the US. I think I have seen more than a few British cat ladies...and please let's not get started on the tasteless food. If not for the multitude of Indian restaurants in GB a person with taste buds could starve there. Jonah ""Stop being so narrow minded. I love my country but I also have been serving to protect it for 12 plus years now. Stop badgering us. We live in excess of 3500 miles away from each other, there's going to be vast differences."" In response to you, Mister.. ""Wow,"" as you put: We live in excess of 3500 miles of each other. Exactly. Get over it. This article is meant for a few playful laughs. I love my country too, and I think it's odd that Brits choose not to rig up flags, but who cares? I'm patriotic, and that's my own business. As you so clearly said, ""there are going to be vast differences."" Way to eat your own words on that one, slick. You are immature and narrow-minded. California Latina Here, here! Fantastic points! I'm American and I'm ashamed. :/ I was married to an English man for 5 years, dated for 2. And I LOVE British culture. I was born and raised in Southern California, and I do feel that Americans are over-zealous indeed. MikeB be gone before someone drops a house on you. Governor Odius How tired and ""gay"" is that remark. It's simpler just to drive back to Kansas. Ralph Malph Lovely attitude. Nothing like putting up the cliche ""ugly American"" bs on a British site. Chris K Magnusson Some of what the person is Sub/sub Culture even to us American's. Such as the ""Z"" thing.

Surely, ""writer"", ""across"", and ""phonies""? Please don't make your country's language any worse than it already is... California Latina Ah! Chris, please stop, you're digging an even deeper hole for yourself! And you are shaming Americans even more with your HORRIBLE spelling!! hahahaha Marianne Do what you like with the language, but please just call it American instead of murdering correct English. I must add though I am disgusted with the new generation of English who cannot string a proper sentence together. What are they learning in school. mis use of the personal pronoun is the most grating import from USA. Yes I live here and love it nevertheless. Brittany Marianne, that is just silly. First off, no doubt many of your fellow Brits would claim Americans were being arrogant and were too ""thick"" to come up with our own language if we tried to call what we speak ""American"", instead of ""English"". Secondly, why would we call the English we speak ""American"" just because we don't speak the same English you speak? We simply speak different dialects, not another language altogether. Should you stop calling the English you speak ""English"" because modern day Brits don't speak the language the same way in which it was originally spoken? The language has changed in Britain, too, you know. In fact, a lot of the things that Americans say that Brits consider ""Americanisms"" are actually just words or phrases that Brits don't use anymore. Example: the word ""gotten"". That's not an American word; it has just fallen out of use in Britain. If Brits have such a problem with Americans ""changing the language"", blame your ancestors for colonizing other countries and spreading ""your language"" all over the world. The British lost exclusive rights to English when it colonized other countries and made it THEIR native language, as well. karen Gotten has not fallen out of use in UK, thats for sure Robert It's not the British that have a problem with the way Americans talk. Of course Americans are going to inject their own personality into the way they speak and by enlarge the Brits appreciate the diversity and breath it gives the language. No what they object to is Americans telling the Brits that the way Americans use the language is better than the way the British do, That the English, who's language it is 'speak funny' because they don't talk with an Anerican accent. The Brits don't go round saying Americans talk funny because they can't pronous certain words properly or they call thing by a different name. No they accept that's the way Americans do it, just as the Australians have their way and the Canadians have theirs. The language varies up and down the length of the British isles, someone from the south of England sounds totally differant to someone from the north. Scots, the Irish and the Welsh sound totally different again. So the British are use to hearing different accents and terminologys it's the Americans that find it strange and weird and can't help commenting on it all the time. Elizabeth Oh my god, this is such bull. Not all Americans are like this at all. Thanks for the stereotyping. James C coincidence Damn, Robert. Your spelling and grammar is atrocious -- fellow Brit. Take it from me, this guy's a veritable thicko. Patricia From studyenglishtoday.net: ""There are some well-known spelling differences between British English and American English. Many of these spelling differences result from French influence on English. British English has a tendency to keep the spelling of many words of French origin. Americans try to spell words more closely to the way they sound phonetically and they tend to omit some letters. "" Therefore, we are not ""murdering"" English. We simply have a different way of spelling things. Yes, it should be specifically referred to as American English, at least in text form, as should British English be referred to as such. But neither of them are right or wrong. Remember, please, that when people were first learning to write, there was no definitive way to spell things. This was doubly so for America, where there was not access to as great a library of history. People had to spell things how they spelled them; and if you look back at old documents, even British ones, there are some very interesting spellings going as recently back as a hundred years ago. Spellings we would not in any form consider ""English"" today. So do not say we are murdering English. Our written English simply evolved differently from yours, as we were an ocean away from the rest of the world. It is the same way with accents. The general American accent -- so I have heard -- is actually closer to what an average Englishman would have sounded like back during the colonization of America. There are a lot of things on this list that bother me. I am aware of most of the differences in the cultures of England and America, and honestly, I believe they shouldn't make that much of a stir when it comes to dealings in every day life. Sure we're different, but we all come from common place, and even before everyone was in England, we were all somewhere else, ancestrally. Honestly. We need to get over ourselves. Everyone does. Accept other people's cultures for what they are and realize that we all come from the same place in the end, whether you believe in a creationist beginning or an evolutionary one. Get over yourselves. bimbola Very well said. Andy @England..balls: Seriously? You're actually THAT shallow? Rory The American capacity for taking a joke reaches new heights with you, doesn't it? Emma That's just rude. Seriously, you are the epitome of all things we hate about America. Go away, you're not welcome here. Brett shadow Basically this is a reply for the twat who wrote the comment headlined ENGLAND BLOWS BALLS. There are a few things that fuck me off with it. Now im not bothered about your saying america is better than england because you would say that but its the fact that you said YOUR language is more advanced, its called english because its from england you dont have a language so you took ours and changed it a bit because most americans are thick as fuck and cant spell or speak. The other things is the last few comments about the ugly women and shit. you have obviously never been here but its nothing like that in the slightest yeah we do eat crumpets and tea is the best thing ever but i would much rather be part of that awesome tradition than having a history thats about 300 years old, eat cheeseburgers and saying yeah man all the time and being know as the most obese county in the world. fuck off you are the real cunt america may be a bigger county and a bit more powerful but you have never had an empire, you have never owned us as we have you and you have nothing over us what so EVER! Brittany Brett, 1). America did not ""take"" English from England. English people emigrated to America and brought their language with them, hence the reason we speak it today. Is that not common sense? Also, we changed ""your"" language because we're ""thick""? I don't even want to know what type of logic you used to come up with that one. The language has changed in America for the same reason the language has changed in England. Are you speaking the same English that Shakespeare used to speak? English has evolved and changed in America in the same way English has evolved and changed in England. Furthermore, America is thousands of miles away from England. Do you honestly think it's realistic to expect that we would speak the same way as you? Also, before stating that more than 300 million Americans can't ""spell or speak"", you might want to check your own use of the English language. Clearly, being English does not guarantee that one will use the English language properly. Jennifer PH Well said. Thank you. Erica Wanted to add to this. A lot of Brits fail to realize that English spoken on the U.S. was changed due to other immigrants from different countries. The number one heritage in the U.S. is German, then Irish. Throw English, Scottish, and Scandinavian in there....plus of all the years of regional seclusion, and that is how you developed the American dialect. Listen to German, Scottish and Irish language and accents & you can hear a lot of similar tones, pitches, and emphasis more similar to American dialects than British dialects. To say to Americans that it is WRONG is purely arrogant. It isn't wrong, just different and people need to get over that. Brittany 2). A lot of Brits like to bring up the fact that America is a young country as an insult. However, it's actually something that we're proud of; to be such a young country, yet to also be the most powerful country the world has ever seen. Additionally, the UK sets no standards. Just because we don't have a history as long as the UK's doesn't mean we have no history or traditions at all. 3). Let's not get into stereotypes, especially regarding food. Typical British food is far from being healthy -- not to mention that the fact that many American chains are successful in the UK means you guys like a good cheeseburger yourselves. The US may be the fattest country in the world, but the UK is not far behind, as it's the fattest country in Europe and one of the fattest in the world. Let's not be hypocrites, now. 4). America is ""a bit"" more powerful than England? Now, I'm not one to boast about America, but I can't help but point out that this is a HUGE understatement. America is infinitely more powerful than the Britain. America is more powerful than Britain was even when Britain had an empire and ruled over 1/3 of the world's population. America has the world's largest economy and the world's most productive workforce. America spends more on its military than the other top 14 countries combined and it accounts for over 40% of the world's military spending. America has an amount of nuclear weapons matched only by Russia. America also has unmatched air and naval capabilities. There is a reason that, despite America's many controversial actions, no country has dared attack it or any of its allies since WWII. 5). Lastly, it's hypocritical of you and some of the other Brits here to attempt to combat ignorant comments by a couple of Americans here with even more ignorant comments and generalizations about more than 300 million Americans. You're just as bad. Brett shadow I have just read that and yeah its pretty much true what you are saying. Comments like crooked teeth or yellow teeth get my back. Every american I have ever spoken to says these stupid comments and its just not what Britain is about I mean you need to take a look at some of the outer edges of London I think you would be in for a shock of how not traditional British it is (not that I am saying it should all be like that). I just think its bad because in schools over here we learn all kinds of history whether its ours or others but America only ever seem to do about there's which basically three things 1. the Boston tea party 2. independence from the British 2. the civil war between the north and south. I think it just makes a lot of Americans unaware of what other countries are about and what they have done and things. I am not normally like this tbh just wanted to write a load of shit down because his comment pissed me off. just got to be proud of what county your from I guess. Also just so I can get this clear, this is not a surrender which I know is something that the Americans do not understand just being nice ha Robert 'America's a bit more powerfull than Britian' a bit of an under statement? Yes it is. America is the most powerfull country on Earth, well yes. It's got the an armed forces equal to the next eighteen countrys. Maybe. But who is it going to fight? Are eighteen plus countrys going to rise up as one and invade America? I don't think so. So why does it feel it needs such a large armed force? If it's armed forces are so superior why is it it's never won a war without aid from it's alies. Every conflict it enter alone as turned out a disaster. It's got the nuclear deterrent. So has a dozen other countrys around the world. Ar but America's got more than them. So? At the hight of the cold war it was estemated that the USA could distroy the world ten to thirty times over and that the USSR could just about equal that. Were as Britain the third largest nuclear power could only distroy the world once with a few missiles to spare. But how many time do you want or need to distroy the world? This vast massed armed force make America more powerfull that the British Empire ever was. Well yes if you want to distroy, but any nuclear power can cliam that. But the Empire wasn't about distroying, it was about building, uniting the world in trade. A trade that made Victorian Britian very rich. Yes. But the unity it formed lives on in the Commonwealth. Commonwealth countrys stand together unity, odd ones drop out now and then, or are expelled, but they are keen to rejoin again. Where's Americas commonwealth? Just about every country America try to subjugate hates America now and is either run by a corrupt dictater or the communist. If that's what it takes to be the most powerfull country you can keep that honour. Brett shadow Nice vent but a little over done. This is how people start on a path that leads to resentment. Yes, the guy had it coming. He was rude and disrespectful. But see now you have moved to attacking everyone in the country even if you didn't mean it and your comments lose their meaning. Yes we speak an American style of English, because that is the language of the people that started our country. Not unlike Australia, Canada, South Africa, and many other countries. But come on don't paint us all with a negative brush. James C coincidence Has it not occurred to anyone that the author of that post might be an Englishman? Even if not, no need to respond -- look where this thread is heading -- to the pits of a YouTube slanging match re. eg. national anthem or military video. Yes, just be a little more wary, ffs, and a little less reactive. It's like throwing a bone into the kennels! :/ James C coincidence Rory, you reactive prick -- get a hold of yourself and stop foaming, saddo... ChimmyChanga We do have a language... English. We speak with an accent, as do your neighboring Irish and Welsh. Do you act this way to Canadians, South Africans, and Australians? Hardly any of us act in the way you and your fellow haters describe. Really, and you think In ANY WAY YOUR POST is a shining example of what we are. I am ashamed of your post. You are rude, disrespectful and insulting. I hope they ban you from further post. I mean seriously. You piss me off. It was a good article and it was fun. The little differences are what make us unique. Try going to Australia, Canada, even South Africa. They all have their little differences and that makes them charming. And yes I am a 43 year old American male very proud of my country. And to her article I would say England needs more patriotism, they need to be proud of being British. Psage7 Psage7 Posted June 3, 2012 at 11:27 am to: England Blows Balls Really, and you think In ANY WAY YOUR POST is a shining example of what we are. I am ashamed of your post.

And to her article I would say England needs more patriotism, they need to be proud of being British Marion Wow you are having a bad day aren't you? I suggest you keep calm and carry on, sit down and have a nice cup of tea and have a crumpet........Asshole! richard At last, in print, the comments of someone with an IQ lower than that of my cat. Lighten up....... the world gets along without any help from you. lainey Are you the epitome of the Ugly American? What a nasty person you are. Ron Cunt! Betty OMG! Go with the humoUr flowing here, Buddy. Get over yerself. Richard Lewis This kind of comment is typical of how I see those Americans that have never left their neighborhood. Rednecks, racists, and Proud to be Ignorant. They fly their flags yet would never consider enlisting or serving their country in any way. They go to church on Sunday mornings and to the Liquour Store that afternoon. They swear, beat, and degrade their spouce but quite quick to deduct them on their taxes. Americans are not all assholes -- but this guy definetely is a Typical American Ass. Ta ta. Olivia Thank you so much for reinforcing the ""ugly American"" Stereotype. Please, don't tell others you're an American. It gives the rest of us a bad name. If you're asked, lie, say your French or something, everyone hates them anyway. LAKate your untrue and grossly offensive commentaty offends me and Im an american citizen. As for Tea & Crumptes nothing better than Earl Grey and little cakes with a bit of cream ete dicks What's been forgotten are: Too many TV ads spoiling any progamme Thinking they are the best Nation in the World Having a completly misunderstanding of their own history (ie the FRENCH won Independance for the 1/3 of Colonists who actually WANTED it) Thinking Empires are bad, whilst forming their own! etc etc etc ChimmyChanga The last time I checked, we are not invading anything. And we are pulling out of the Middle East in approx. 2 years. Please pull yourself into the news, we are not invading. I do not think that I live in the best nation, as our economy is slowly recovering from being shit, we have a terrible education system, and we have extremely high obesity rates. We are better than a few other countries in some respects, but not better in others. I don't watch TV. I listen to the NPR. Keith Hitchings I only hope you are not English. If you are then you are putting us english to shame. you should go back to the gutter where you belong. Human Being Arguing on the Internet is like the special Olympics....even if you win, you're still retarded. Jean I KNOW!!!! How about referring to the hood (or is it the trunk) of your car as the 'bonnet'. Worse is when I heard 'I'm going over to knock her up'. I've never gotten hot under the collar about our lingual differences but my British step-son-in-law has, rather than laugh about it all. I just about love all things British!!!! York You know it's because the two countrys are so similar, that we feel so at home in each others back yard as it were that we get so hung up on the differences. The Brits 'if only we could get a decent cup of tea' and the Americans 'if only they knew how to make coffee' attitude. What's it matter you're just as likely to get bad tea and coffee in both countrys. That 'I just lov your accent.' is meant as a compliment and by an large British visitors take it as such and are quite flattered by it. But if you've been in the country for sometime and you get it from every other person you meet it get's a little wearing. Putting surnames first; who cares, the person who wrote the above seams to but no body else. It's not as common but it accures in Britain as well. Over zealous waiting staff who clear away your plate before you've got the last spoon full in your mouth. Well I know some Americans who get upset at that. You go out for a quite meal and a chance of polite conversation. You don't want the waiting staff interrupting all the time hustling you through your meal. Sincer cheer, 'have a nice day' When Brits first came across it they were quite taken by it. 'Ho! what nice polite people.' but now they've got use to it. They see the smile is only in the lips not in the eyes. The person saying it no more means it than they'd give you a $100 bill. It's just something they say like do you want frys with that and to Brits that insincerty is worse than surly service. At least that's honest. Over zealous patriotism. There's numerous reasons why Brits are uneasy with that. One they're a little jealous, 'how can Americans be so proud when Britain is best' but they know that's elogical but it still's irritates. They see over zealous patriotism in them selves and fined it disturbing. To much over flag waving they see it as right wing politics, not right of centre but way out nazi right wing, and it disturbs them. They'd love to fly the flag for Britain more often but fear they'd look like fascist if they did and they can't help but be a little suspicious of people that do wave their countries flag at every opportunity. Memories of nineteenthirties Germany. Treating pets like people again it's something they feel guilty of when they do it and are embarrest about. A case of they do protest to much when they get the chance to have a go at others for it. Turkey don't know what the writers problem is. It's a personal taste. You can take it or leave it. Turkey's turkey the world over. Spelling. The British spell according to a words origins, Latin, Saxon, Norman ect and maintain with a degree of authority that they spell correctly. America is a large country and was settled fairly quickly. Civilisation had a job keeping up with the expantion west and education of early settlers children was somewhat of a made do method and some errors slipped in, spelling becoming more phonetic. Pronunciation. Brit tend to pronunce a word as one, the syllables running into one another with no gottle stops or pauses regardless of the length of the word. So they find it strange and a little disconcerting when certain states accests pronunce each syllable in a word as if it was a separate word and give each syllable equal tone. Say in Britain Birmingham is just that one word spoken as one word. Were as in Alabama Birmingham becomes Birm Ing Ham, three small words each said with equal stress which is how Brits teach children to spell but don't expect them to speak like that. That leads on to common thing we have different words for. They tend to be object that didn't excit before the revolotion. The Brits tended to be more traditional and looked to previous language that discribed object that fulfilled a similar function were as Americans discribed the function it surved. So in Britain a pavement being path made of flat stones, because in geology flat stones are know as pavements, and the walkway at the side of a road is made of flat stones also becomes the 'pavement'. But in America it's the walkway at the side of the road so it becomes the 'side walk'. Early stagecoaches the storage for luggage was known as the boot, so Brits call the luggage space on a car the boot. Early american cars didn't have a boot, they hung a cabin trunk on the back so Americans call the luggage space on a car the trunk and so on. Neithers right and neithers wrong . Pants to an American Pants are trousers, to a Brits Pants is short for underpants, Fanny to Americans Fanny is your ass, your backside, to a Brit if it's not a girls name it's a womans genitals so there is scope for unintended embassing confusion. But there's no course to get angry or upset about it, it's just what happens when you're devided, for two hundred years, by the Atlantic Ocean. With modern communications, cheap quick airflights, exchange of films and TV programs, the internet ect theses differances will fade and we'll all spell the same and talk the same, all with the same accent. Will that be a good or a bad thing? Shannon I think these articles are highly entertaining. @ York You hit the nail right on the head ( do we share that saying?) because of the similarities we nit pick the differences. As far as telling people to have a nice day, I do and I really truly mean it. Treating animals like children is creepy no matter what, and those people who do are usually scarred by some emotional trauma, or just nuts. Turkey? That was just funny. Overzealous patriotism is ridiculous no matter what country your from. The spelling is just plain funny, I get a kick out of those differences. I did spend a summer in England and I loved every minute of it. The people were friendly and made me feel welcome. A man started singing Chicago at a pub when he found out where I was from, I laughed along with everyone else. I loved the differences as well as the similarities. We watch a lot of British tv in our house and it is fun to learn all the slang and my daughter is developing skill with all the different dialects. People need to lighten up and not take this stuff so seriously. So what about the ten things Brits do that drive Americans crazy? demelzabunny Oy, people, the plural of ""country"" is ""countrIES,"" not ""countrYS,"" no matter if you're from the UK or the U.S. And that goes for ""terminologIES"" as well, from a previous post: when noun ends w/a ""y"" and is preceded by a consonant, the ""y"" changes to an ""i"" and you add ""es"" to make it plural. Did you all go to school when you were kids or what? And to the author of the article, I have news for you: adding a ""u"" in the words ""colour,"" ""behaviour"" and the like as the British do is FRENCH! So is calling the letter ""z"" ""zed."" As is the American pronunciation of ""herb"" and ""fillet."" So we're all doing froggy stuff. If you haven't had good turkey (it's a talent to know how to prepare it well), you must come join us for our Thanksgiving celebration: my aunt cooks a terrific roast turkey. As far as I know, many British treat their dogs as members of their families, just as many Americans do. It depends on the individual and has NOTHING to do w/nationality. And lastly, it is a well-established fact that British dentistry leaves much to be desired, and many British do have yucky teeth. I think that in as advanced a place as the UK, there ought to be a push/general education effort about the advantages of taking care of one's teeth. Poor dental habits and ignorance of the advantages of orthodontia can lead to many illnesses and diseases, not the least of which is heart disease, never mind put a damper on one's love life: yucky teeth can be a real turn-off. Counties_Gal As a Brit living over here for over 20 years I have to say none of these bother me. I do wish I had a dollar for every time someone says ""I love your accent""! The last name thing is no biggie, it happened a lot in school. I am over here because I want to be. I have adapted because I have chosen this to be my home. I do NOT expect America to BE England. If it bothered me I'd go back to England. I do miss certain British things (sadly mainly some foods!) but I also have embraced a lot of American ways. I feel blessed as I have the best of both worlds. I have not turned my back on England, it is still my country of birth, but America is now my home. There is only one thing that annoys me, when someone asks me if I am from Australia! I understand that is like asking a Canadian what part of America they are from! Richard Bravo, Erica! Who wants to hear some snobby, upper class Oxford accent mispronouncing all the time? We make fun of people in the USA who say Americ-er for America and Africk-er for Africa. Hey, we Yanks won our independence from you blokes lomg ago, then saved your bacon in two world wars so leave us in peace to spell and pronounce words correctly without giving us a superior upturn of the schnozz. Jackie When I first came to the USA in 1971 and heard Americans talk about their ""back yards"", I envisioned their properties to have pathetic bits of concrete behind their houses. To me a yard was paved, (courtyard, Scotland Yard, school yard). When the Americans asked me to described my home, I said it had a large, pretty garden. ""You have a garden?"", they would quip. ""What are you growing?"". ""Well, you know, trees and grass,"" I would reply with a querying look. I'm over it now, but the word 'yard' still doesn't sit well with me. I sell luxury real estate in Honolulu and choose my text carefully. SteveF Sadly, it has been pointed out to me that Brits and Yanks are two people separated by a common language. As an American I can assure you that english in any form is rarely spoken here at all. Jordy It was ""zed"" looong before it was ever ""zee""...so there Roger I am marrying an American, and moving to Tacoma next year. I may be British, but I agree with Erica. I like American patriotism and the ""service with a smile in stores. My fiancee still picks me up on my ""British"" pronuciation though! I do have to say, Turkey is not tasty! Clarissa @Roger: Small world! My husband's from the Midlands and we happen to live in Tacoma as well. There aren't very many of ya in this little section of the world, I have to say, but think you'll come to really like T-Town Toni Parkland library has some very nice staff from England. They are a little bit outside Tacoma city limits. As for Turkey the only way I'll eat it is in turkey noodle soup with enough pepper juice to drown the flavor. I eat it once or twice a year and then complain for the rest. Lisa My husbands from the West Midlands and I'm from the Kitsap Peninsula! But I'm a PLU alum, so regular visits to T-town are a must!! His favorite is the Red Hot on 6th Ave. I love Tacoma, I really miss living there. Nothing beats the PNW!! expat253 A very small world indeed. I am an Englishman, married to an American, that has lived in the '253? for the past 9 years. I love it, too. Although I can count on one hand the amount of other Brits in the area that I have met, despite constant rumor(see, I adapt!) that there are quite a few of us around. I don't like much red meat in my diet, so any recipe that would call for beef, I used ground turkey instead. I think it tastes just as good. I've been feeding that to my Brit husband for the last 8 years, and I haven't heard him complain yet! Milly After a two-week tour of the U.K., I must agree. Brits cannot cook. It was the worst food...but don't we all know that already. And I felt the Brits and Scots were sour in nature. Polite enough but they definitely seemed unhappy in general. What I enjoyed was less pressure to ""be"" anything, especially done up, made up, dressed up. Robert P'Due Please find your ""Caps lock"" key, press it and never touch it again. After 25 thanks-givings I'm so very tired of the bird. I do agree with you that if it's dry and stringy than it's just been overcooked. I agree with you about the creepy flag thing, though. And the smarmy fake cheer. And the humanizing of pets. I'm sorry, ""humanising"". I'm visiting the U.K. for the first time in the fall. Can't wait to find out if my accent (""Southern drawl"") is charming or annoying! Erika No worries, they LOVE the southern accent!! I have been over there twice, and hearing the word ""y'all"" was like I was coming from another planet!! Going over there was the complete opposite and I agree with Erica, but I am guilty of a couple of those things.. I mean, who doesn't like a good last name as first AND a good southern double name where they put ""Mary or Anna"" before the name like: ""Anna-Bradley or John-Davis""!! Gotta love the American/Southern way of life! Paul I think you meant Autumn, not fall claire blake fall=autumn Dan If your visiting London very few of the people there are British. Anna Have you actually been to anywhere in London outside the tourist spots? Very few people at Piccadilly Circus are British, it's true, but only someone who knew nothing about the place would claim that's true of the rest of the city. Unless you just have a very narrow definition of what constitutes 'British'? Tom Just a guess, but you recently lost your sense of humor. That's like the joke that if you want to meet NY'ers try Florida. david Just heard someone complain that they had to clean the fag butts outside their house. Well whatever floats your boat mate but I'd use a hose pipe, a wire brush and bleach if I was you. jsky2 David, I laughed at your above comment. It is about changes in language over time no matter which country one lives within. My last partner is Australian. As I visited 7 times the country -- not just as a tourist but wishing to see how people live differently (if so) from Americans? I mistakenly made a comment about *rooting* for a sport team. It brought out many laughs which at the time I had no idea what I said had been wrong ( to them). It is as many have said, one has to have a sense of humor or humour as they spell. It takes differences to make the world the unique thing we live in. Sydney My cat neurotically overgrooms herself until she's bald and bleeding in places. If Prozac helps her to quit hurting herself, let her be on Prozac. And ""fillay"" and ""erb"" are how the words are pronounced. It takes a special kind of arrogance to go ""I like this word you've got here, but the pronunciation doesn't match my drapes. I'll still *use* it, because my language hasn't got any words that quite fit the situation like yours does, but I'm going to change it around a bit. Finally, roast turkey is one of life's perfect foods. I don't mind that you don't like it; that means that there's more for me in the world. colin These French words have been in the English language for a thousand years (Norman-French) so of course they are going to change,are we supposed to pronounce all Greek words,Scandinavian,German,Dutch,Latin words all in their respective accents,also Americans are butchering English what could be more arrogant? Tom There are more Americans speaking English than Brits so since we are democracies the correct pronunciation is how we pronounce it. Sorry, but you lose. York As the English have spent two thousand years developing the Language and Americans have only been using it for just over two hundred years that's a bit like a toddler telling it's parents how to talk. America as contribute some to the language and in the future will contribute even more, as will Austalasia, Canada and other English speaking Peoples around the world. Given time it may become the language of the entire planet and nolonger be know as or reconised as English. But that day is not here yet. o.k. first.. if we are discussing forms of goverment, then actually the u.s. is older than jolly england. Let that sink in for a second. Now we mix saxon with norman french, we call this english.. it has been spoken for oh 700 years or so total. for nearly 500 years of that time frame it has been spoken in america. Now certain words are a further mixture of french and english. Proper spelling is a interesting thing. It has changed much in both areas, colour vs color.. this change occured here in the early 1900?s still hasnt in england, and may never, as long as common usage makes the spelling of a word prevelent, then it is correctly spelled. now who's right then, bloody well we both are. Common usage in each region allows us to have different forms in each. Another example.. Shakespheare is generally pronounced these days shakes pear, instead of shaks fear which is how it was most likely pronounced when he was around. Brittany Colin, the fact that those words have been in the English language for a long time doesn't change the fact that countless words in English are either bastardized versions of words from other languages or words that were taken in their entirety from other language and only the pronunciations changed. ""erb"" is the correct way to pronounce ""herb"", as it's a French word, not an English word. Same with ""LEFtenant"" instead of ""LEWtenant"" for ""lieutenant"". Also, Americans are butchering the language? Please don't try to pretend that everyone in England speaks the language properly and/or in the way that the language was originally spoken. Modern day English people are far from being modern day Shakespeares, and many of you speak broken English. Additionally, what you speak today is virtually unrecognizable as English as it was spoken in England hundreds of years ago. Robert You are partially right and partially very wrong but as you say english is a bastard language it's origins many and varied. All to often what was once universally thought to be the correct pronunciation of a word, because we thought it originated in one culture, turns out to be wrong when historians find evidence of it predating that influence. It as been found that some local dialects that we were brought up to dismiss as bad and slang and poor English are infact closer to the oridginal than modern speech. So we can't dismiss someone because they have an accent. They have an accent because that's how English evolved in their part of the world and some of their words and terms maybe closer to the oridginal than your's. Modern English or to give it it's title 'Received Speech English' is that that what was used by the BBC in the early days of broadcasting and is what we use as a reference point when we want to define the correct pronunciation of a word or the correct syntax of grammar. But that is only to make English more universally understandable and clear. It doesn't make someone who speaks with a New Castle, Birmingham, Yorkshire or West Country dialect a bad English speaker. Or for that matter an English man a better speaker than an American, Candian, Austrialia or anyone else but by the same token it doesn't mean Americans speak better that the English. American English is not more modern as British English is also evolving as well. You only have to listen to recording of speech in Britian in the forties, the fifties, sixties etc to hear how it's changed in one life time. It is however still the language of the English, they gave birth to it whatever the origins of indevidual words maybe, they strung them together and made them into a language. Xander Funny how I always hear Brits talk trash about Americans pronouncing Foyer like it's spelled, instead of Foy-ay. So much for that 'You're not French!' argument, eh? I can't speak for others, but I do try to pronounce foreign words the way they are said in the foreign language. Take, for example, the way Spanish has infiltrated American daily language. I don't pronounce 'quesadilla' as ""kway-sa-dill-a"", as it's phonetically spelled. I say 'kay-sa-di-ya' as it's mean to be said in Spanish. I think it shows respect for the origins of the words to say it properly as it would be said in the home country. Thus, I see no problem with saying 'fill-ay' instead of 'fil-let'. English has been evolving for hundreds of years, and the beauty of our shared language is the ability for it to adapt and add new words. As it was mentioned before, the English went out and colonized the world, and gave/brought the language to the locals. And now some are getting angry when those 'old colonies' have taken the language and it made it their own? I've got news for you folks that are angry over it: languages evolve. So move on and let's nitpick on other differences. Skip My wife, a northern Brit, tells me that"" you lot don't speak proper like what us does"". I must agree. Pretty Brit The time I heard an American taxi driver yell out to a dawdling pedestrian ""Hey lady -- d'ya wanna fender up yer fanny?"" I almost fainted. As for saying fanny pack in UK, well, forget it -- conversely belly bag or bum bag sounds weird to Americans -- hard to keep it all straight sometimes, or a straight face at least. Yesterday a friend at a picnic told me her uncle had brought cucumbers to a potluck. Cucumbers? I asked, intrigued. Yes, bread and butter, she responded. Bread and butter? I queried, more perplexed than ever. Yes, they were very tasty. Turns out she was talking about pickles ! Xander Pickles are what happens if you PICKLE cucumbers...Hence the name. JillA Gotta agree -- if you don't like roast turkey, you're making it wrong. And that's how we pronounce those words. Hey if there's an article on what drives Americans crazy, can we talk about the floors of buildings starting at 0? But I love ya, Britain. Can't wait to go back. MikeC Floors don't start with ""0? in the UK, they start with ""1?, but, yeah, Brits just don't like turkey, and it way overpriced there. Well seasoned and prepared (there's more to seasoning than salt, you have some great chefs, listen and learn). Besides turkey being a very American bird it has, pound-for-pound more protein than most any other meat, and its low in fat, so it's a very nutritious bird. I wrote a long bit on turkey when I was working in London once and the woman who edited my tiny, in-house newsletter had the same comment, ""Yes, but it's a very dry bird that needs a bit of mustard or something."" deanna one thing Brits do that drive Americans nuts.......tip poorly!!!!! Ian That's because we expect our service staff to be properly paid Cala Tipping is a good way of ensuring that the wait staff cares about your service. It is not much different than the idea of a commission -- you get paid proportionally for the job that you do. I have been in many establishments in the UK where the servers could have used some incentive to care a little more; and yes, I understand that plates aren't cleared as fast and that you need to be much more forceful about getting the attention of your server as they tend to leave you alone for the most part. Furthermore, the few times I've visited the UK, I've tried to familiarize myself with the tipping customs. I became aware that over-tipping could be considered as an insult as if you were stating that they don't make enough money. In that same vein, I would expect that when Brits come to the States, they would follow the our customs on tipping seeing as our waitstaff generally works on tips alone. Anna I understand that wait staff in the US are paid peanuts and that tips go to make up the difference, but find it hard to shake off the British idea that a tip should be a reward for good service, not 'a good way of ensuring that the wait staff cares about your service'. After all, isn't providing adequate service the bare minimum? Why should we pay more for that? (I should add that I really don't have any problem with giving a good tip when the service has been good, and in my experience so far in the US, it usually is far better and friendlier than in the UK. But when the person serving us is surly or tardy or just uninterested, I do resent being expected to leave 20% of the bill for that.) Britanie I've been a waitress here (in America). I made $2 an hour. So yes, you pretty much live on tips as a waitress. Otherwise I would only make $16 in an eight hour day. It was worse when I worked as a car hop at sonic because people don't generally tip at fast food places and yet I still only made $2 an hour because I was supposedly making tips. (I'm not sure if they have car hops at any places in England but a car hop is a waitress/waiter that roller skates out to your car with your food and Sonic is a fast food place.) Jen K Gosh, don't we know it? Those of us who have traveled (one L, I'm American, we did it on purpose to annoy you two hundred years ago, doi) really wish there was some kind of cafe culture here in the US but, because our servers work on tips, we can't manage it. So we came up with stupid Starbucks. Shut up, you love it too. And yes! Our family is notoriously bad at cooking turkey but any good restaurant or deli will make it juicy and delicious. You're definitely doing it wrong. MikeC I agree, Ian. It certainly is a different culture of eating out. Spend 2 hours on a proper night out in a restaurant, being served by someone serving 10 tables, seeing your server infrequently and then signalling him/her at the end for your bill before you leave, or being waited upon by someone who needs to act as your personal slave serving 3 tables, filling your glass every two minutes, asking you if you're enjoying your meal 15 seconds after you've received it, as well as a visit by his supervisor who goes table to table as a quality inspector for his underlings, snatching empty plates, all in hopes that you'll furnish him/her with 80% of her/his evening's wages. Its quite different, the way we two approach dining out. JenC Appalling service in U.K. Brits feel service is beneath them. Milly However, you are in the states -- a very different culture. Respect the cultural differences and tip according to custom. By the way, I had a British B&B owner chase me out to the car to make sure I had tipped her cleaning staff upon leaving. Clearly, her pay to staff was not enough. (I had tipped, by the way.) Gilly P I have been in the States nearly 20 years now and just love living here. I enjoy the expectation that you will do everything in your power to be happy and not remain, ""in your place"". I respect that nearly everyone I know is in school to improve themselves, to gain knowledge and self worth. I am frustrated that this is such an amazing country and so few Americans will take the time off work to vacation. We only get two weeks each year and a number of my co-workers do not even take that two measley weeks. I have taken every second of my vacation time and have travelled far and wide with it. The translation thing, I was initially amazed that we even thought we spoke the same language. ""fag breaks"", ""faggots and gravy"", ""chips and crisps""and what ever is an English muffin? Most alarming was the first time I was told a child was full of ""spunk"" and while I wanted to call child protection the mother was apparently pleased.... that was a confusing conversation. Coffee cake does not taste like coffee and I only drink tea at home since thats where my tea pot lives. Yet if we did not love the differences we would all stay home! MizzEm Coffee cake isn't supposed to taste like coffee, it was created to be consumed WITH coffee, for a breakfast treat or as a morning or afternoon snack. Your teacakes don't taste like tea, either -- and most bear little resemblance at all to any item USAians would call ""cake""! An English muffin is a small round, flat but thickish (maybe 3-5 cm depending on brand), yeast-raised bread that is cooked on a griddle so that it is browned on both sides. The batter has a high yeast and water content so there are many large holes inside, and is wet enough that it must be confined in a ring on the griddle. They are split and toasted (they are very nasty un-toasted, as the interior is quite mushy), and then can simply be eaten with butter, jam, honey and suchlike toppings, used as one would use toasted bread under things like Welsh rabbit/rarebit, or as the base for many sandwiches and snacks such as the infamous after-school snack ""English muffin pizza"" (in its most basic form, a toasted English muffin spread with tomato sauce and sprinkled with mozzarella, then baked or even microwaved to melt the cheese). It's a little bit like a crumpet, but less rich and cake-y, and the holes don't go all the way through. Wikipedia says that in some parts of Britain they are called ""bread muffins""? The object known simply as a ""muffin"" in the USA is a small round cake-like bread leavened with baking powder, similar to a cupcake but not as sweet. On the vacation issue... First, most USAians don't GET paid vacations, and can't afford to take unpaid time off unless there is no other way to avoid it. For those who are lucky enough to get paid vacation time, it's often quite difficult to get it scheduled with one's employer, especially in this period of intentional short-staffing -- ""you can't take two weeks -- or even one whole week -- off, this-this-and-this all need to be done and we need you here to do it"". Many employers would rather have the employees stay on the job and pay them the vacation time as a chunk of cash at the end of the year than have them out of the workplace. If there are multiple working people in the family, it can be a nightmare coordinating time off between the different employers, and if there are children in school, it's even worse. It is Greatly Frowned Upon to remove one's child from school for ""frivolous"" purposes (which is really anything but illness or funerals); parents are expected to do these things on the scheduled school breaks. Unfortunately, there are millions of other parents also trying to do the same thing at the same time (most schools schedule their week-long breaks within the same two-week blocks in February and April -- ditto with college students and their March break), which means that it's even more difficult to get the days off, desirable vacation destinations are swarming with people, prices have gone sky-high to burn the tourists, and travel becomes even more of a nightmare than it already is. In addition, many people have to use up their vacation time a day or half-day at a time for not-fun things like taking care of an ill child or family member, or even for their own sicknesses if they've used up their ""sick days"" allowance. If they're lucky enough to have it. Fewer and fewer jobs have even these minimal benefits, forget the good stuff like healthcare coverage, pensions, and so on. MizzEm I did actually put paragraph breaks in there, but they seem to have been eaten in the posting. My apologies for the single block of text. Casey Wow, you sound like a complete ass. I am sorry that I even read this article. If this is how you feel about the country that is about as close to being you as any other, I would hate to hear what you think about every other country. Lauren Really Casey? Get over yourself. You sound like you could be the poster-child of ""The Ugly American"". Please stay home. Tom Chill out, Casey! As an American I can see exactly how someone from Britain might feel that way. And they are definitely right about our over-zealous patriotism. America isn't exactly the most wonderful country in the world. Don't forget that it was Britain who stood alone against Hitler for a year while we whined about not wanting to get involved in Europe's problems. Marcia I am an American and guess what,,, America reminds me more and more each day as still the Wild West,,,, have to agree we are not too cultured here,,,, but then we are a HUGE country,,,some parts of the country like just seem like another country,,,,ever try to understand an American Southerner,,,,I do not like Republicans. And I am a Socialist 100 per cent,,, and there ARE way too many guns over here,,,. This is a very violent place to live,,,,,, not easy to survive here,.., I am. a second. Generation American. ,,,,Italy and Eastern Europe background and always did wonder how did I end up here. LOL,...but you gotta admit good ole USA bailed your British a$$e$ out big time in WW2 or did you forget and become ungrateful,... And geez where did all your POP CULTURE come from. In the last 50 years,,,, where was all this rock rooted from,,,,, ask Mick Jagger and by the way I can't help it how power hungry and millitristic we are. I am not.,,,,. By the way I treat my cat better than any human. I know. E It's Raymond And there are serious differences in sense of humo(u)r as well, apparently! I can claim to live in the mid-Atlantic, so I'm fairly neutral here. And I think the Scots invented the last name-first name syndrome -- Anderson, Campbell, Maxwell, Farquar, etc. And ""fall"" is an archaic English term from Devon/Cornwall which fell out of use in the 19th century. itledevill Ex pat living here (USA) for 30 yrs often thought about opening a restaurant and having a truly British meal.. Peas Pudding and Faggots followed by Spotted Dick and Custard and giving a free Fag after every meal Lisa To ITLEDEVILL, What a great idea, please open the restaurant in New Jersey. i will be your first customer MizzEm I saw Spotted Dick *in tins* in the supermarket just the other day, right next to boxes of Bird's custard mix. The stock clerk did not understand why I was laughing. (And I'd do any number of bad things for some decent bangers and finnan haddie and a meat pie...) davemorris What's wrong with pronouncing French words correctly? You Brits forget which country backed us in our war of independence. Richard The problem is that you are not spelling OR pronouncing this word correctly. The French spell this word ""herbe"" and when they speak it they drop the ""h"" and pronounce the rest of it something like ""airb"". You are not doing this. You are simply hacking off the ""h"" and pronouncing the rest of it something like ""urb"" as in ""curb"". This is an Americanism. People use it not because it's accurate but because they think they sound clever saying it. They don't, they just sound irritating. As Eddie Izzard said ""You say ""erb"" ... and we say ""herb"" .... because there's an effing ""h"" in it! sue Exactly! dw ""erb"" is actually the original British pronunciation. ""herb"" was like ""hour"" or ""heir"", beginning with a silent H. ANN HERB (ERB ) IS A SPICE..... HERB IS MY UNCLE spittingkitty Oh, okay. You say ""herb"" because there's an ""h"" in it? So you continue to spell words with a ""u"" that serves no purpose because... People don't pronounce it ""erb"" because they think they sound clever, you pompous dog's behind. They say it because that is how we are taught to say it. Paul I'd say that the American dropping of the h in herb has less to do with an attempt to render its pronunciation more faithfully to the original French word than with a general American tendency to drop the h in certain words. I think Americans are more likely to say an hotel than a hotel, for example. But British people, I think, say an historian -- at least that's how it's often pronounced on BBC radio and printed (with an as opposed to a) in British newspapers. And, after all, none of us pronounces the h in hour, another word from French. I know it's tongue in cheek but the argument against using z in the suffix -ise/-ize is incoherent. The s is voiced and thus pronounced as /z/, which is why Americans spell it the way they do, with the exception of the word exercise. On the subject of u, my Latin teacher never tired of telling the class that American omission of the letter kept the word more in line with the original Latin word from which it derived. Btw, the author should be aware that the Oxford dictionary now uses -ize as its default spelling, informing the reader in a parenthetical note that -ise is an Anglicism. JillA No, we're saying it that way because we're taught in school to pronounce it that way. And believe me, it makes no sense to us when we learn it, but that is our formal pronunciation. It has nothing to do with pretension, at least not this many generations later. Layla Ive lived in America all my life and most of my family lives in England and I'm from Tennessee and I agree saying y'all there is like being from another planet but saying all those things about us make britts look like asses when they're really not and if I had to choose who had the accent it would be the British they don't pronounce the whole word look Instead of saying hi how are you they say hi how ah' youw boom see Americans can say there r's Duane I'm an American and I live in Hawaii, the only state in the US that includes the Union Jack in our flag. Knowing something about tea culture, I understand how it may irritate some Brits when they ask for hot tea in an American restaurant and it comes served with lemon, instead of milk. Cobber I say never go to a country that doesnt enjoy vegemite or Coopers Sparkling Ale. I do not understand why you need to tip people it the US, particularly when their service is rude and they have a distinct lack of manners. Savannah It's because, since tips are expected, employers are able to get away with paying waiters less than minimum wage so they live off their tips. A normal tip is 15%. If the service is particularly bad, pay less. It better be pretty terrible for you not to tip at all, though. Tom Service rude in the US? You are joking right? The best service I ever had in Britain was still worse than the drunk cashier at McDonalds in Times Square. JenC You are right not to travel. It is not for you. Stay home and be happy. Michelle Lewis Ruth, great piece! T was right, you did make a funny. It made me laugh to read the comments from Americans who got defensive about turkey and flags and pronunciation. And somebody ALWAYS has to bring the French into it. Hope you guys are both well across the pond, I had a good trip to Philly last week, but was baffled by the sheer amount of choice in restaurants. Nothing like being a stranger in your own country. x Scott ""Two nations divided by a common language..."" As for ""Things that drive Americans nuts"" how about the fact that the Brits have accents on their speech that make them mutually unintelligible? I will never forget getting lost in London while looking for the American Express office. I asked a very kind woman in an apothecary shop for directions, and she brightly said, ""OW! Iss easy, luv. Ya gow dun 'ere pass sum poles, tike a lef', go trey blokes, tike anudder lef' an' iss rot dare!"" I ended up at the American Express CORPORATE offices, two blocks away from the customer services office, because I couldn't understand that ""sum poles"" was actually ""Saint Paul's"" -- so, instead of making a ""lef'"" at Saint Paul's Cathedral, I went an additional two blocks and turned ""lef"" at a large scaffold which I figured is what she meant by ""sum poles"". In ""the Colonies"" we have accents as well, but -- even in the deep South, or the most hard-core areas of South Boston -- they aren't so far removed from the common tongue as to be unintelligible. I'm originally from the State of Nebraska, where we have a flat (almost nasal) generic accent. Part of my family is from Bayou country in Louisiana, where the Cajun accent is thick enough to stop a bullet. But whichever part of the family I'm with, I still carry on a fully understandable conversation. In England, I couldn't make it from Piccadilly to Queen Anne's College without a translator! Gods help me when I took a weekender to Wales, where my maternal grandfather was born. Still, despite all the ""foreign"" languages in England, the month I spent there was wonderful. The only problem is that I'm an unconscious mimic. I came home to the States with an East-Ender's accent -- now imagine the fun my cousins in Louisiana had with THAT! Savannah I must object. My mom's family is also from the bayou and it took my dad *years* to figure out what they were saying with some confidence. sue Scott -- I see, or rather, hear, the accent thing in reverse. I'm from southern England. When I worked in a hospital in Georgia, I sometimes really couldn't understand the strong, southern accent some rural patients had, and needed to ask a local person to translate. On the other hand, and this I found incredulous at the time, some of the locals couldn't understand me! I realised that it's all about what you grew up with as your ""norm"". I've also worked with ""Geordies"" from Newcastle who speak what might as well be a foreign language to me! Each of us thinks it's everyone else who has the accent! claire LOL Carol Kayye lol I'm British born and an American citizen and I just love your comments Carol Kayye lol I'm British born and an American citizen and I just love your comments I also spent some time in Scotland near St Andrews and was very bemused thinking the local b and b landlord was talking about ducks when he was actually telling us about local pubs Sk Almost as funny as the one million things Brits have up their arises 36arbiter the classic ,deep American male voice,for example,Michael Ironside,james earl jones,is,it has to be said,the absolute bollocks.it is the sound of leadership,strength and courage.in stark contrast,American women seem to be desperately trying to see who can sound the most like an unmuffled 50cc two-stoke on tickover. The ""fanny"" definition is a funny bit of business. It brings to mind a summer visit from an 18 year old Brit friend. She sat on a leather car seat that had been backing in the sun and jumped up immediately. ""What's the matter, did you burn your fanny?"" asked my mother in all innocence. My friend turned 6 shades of red, and it wasn't from the car seat! I agree about the overzealous patriotism. We're fortunate to have been born here, or immigrated to this country. So Americans, be pleased and feel fortunate, but remember ""pride"" goes before a fall (and I don""t mean autumn). sarah Dave -- why do Americans insist on bringing up the war of independence all the time? living as a Brit in the US I am constantly subject to comments such as ""here come the red coats"" or "" i guess you dont participate in 4th July celebrations"". Are you guys not over it yet? May I remind you this was over two centuries ago and even then no one in Britain was bothered except for the king! please find some new insults, it's old.... 1783 old. but then I guess it could be something to do with your lack of your history. p.s I love your country, this is just one thing that drives me nuts! Brittany Lack of history? Just because our history is not as long as the UK's does not mean we don't have a history. How arrogant. Also, it's an event that stands out to us because it was when America became a nation. Naturally, it's a big deal to us. We don't care if you don't care. We do! If you're a Brit living here, it's just something you'll have to endure. demelzabunny Yes, don't forget the American War of Independence was a highly unpopular war w/the majority of the British populace, because is dangerously drained the gov't coffers. Jess Funniest thing I ever read. I live in Miami (if you can call Miami the USA) and enjoyed every one of the points on the list. Especially taking my plate away too soon! Vince Tucker I can't believe their backwards dates were not in the top ten ! demelzabunny Most countries of the world write their dates day/month/year; it is we Americans who are bucking the trend (just as we refuse to join the rest of the world using metric measurements). Yep! spelling words the wrong way makes a person look like they never got past the 4th gradeVERY annoying. apple The funny thing is if you click on the other link- 10 things that americans hate about brits, you will see that its written by the same BRITISH author . So its all heavily biased towards the brits (shocker) yet we are supposed to believe it is the counterattack to her first article. It is clear that she is yet another socialist european who is bitter towards americans because she is jealous. Im sorry, since when is CUSTOMER SERVICE considered a bad thing. In the UK there is zero service. In fact, I find myself having to kiss up TO the service if I even want a CHANCE of getting anything. No one will go out of their way to help you, unless you are at an american company. The other day a friend of mine was told by the manager of a restaurant in london ""this is not america, here the customer is always WRONG, we don't care if you are unhappy.. you can leave"" this is TYPICAL in the UK second, no one says fanny anymore.. you are clearly out of the loop third, americans are friendly fourth, brits like yourself are hypocritical and pretentious... ""get yourself a socialist president"" -- my response to that: a) we already have one b) its sickening how many brits like you are so quick to label, stereotype, and judge and then pretend yourself to be liberal and socially conscious etc... how does that mesh with the fact that, as you just admitted, you barely look at a stranger on the street- if they say hello to you you give them a look like you feel violated.... the average brit (much less the well-off brit) is classist and pretentious -- its ironic that you call out americans for being proud... isn't that better than being a snob and looking down on people who don't have as much money or didn't go to a fancy school? Do you know how many times since I have moved here I have heard the word ""working- class"" or ""elite"" used to describe a group of people? That would never happen in america. Get over it, you may have a kindg and queen but its 2012. Re: your comment about the service: Aside from the fact that it was ridiculous to pretend over service is better than crap service... how about the fact that over in England you treat anyone in a ""service"" capacity as if they are beneath you? Also something that makes me sick I could go on but Ill stop at that. next time try having an American to write the counter piece.... might help your credibility Robert Touched a nerve there. It's only a bit of fun, see if the stero types still fit anymore. Are the Brits still regarded as stand offish, proud of the empire, stiff upperlip elitis snobs and are the Americans still regarded as loud loutish, ignorant we won the war, the world owes us, slobs. No! but some stero types do persist and having fun with them, bursting the bubble of pomposity, help dispell them. Lighten up. roscoe three cheers or englaand Paul Wow! Having a bad day? The piece is meant to be humorous. Btw, if you think Obama is a socialist, then you've been watching way too much Fox for your own good! Tom Obama a socialist president? Ha ha! Obama is too far to the right to be a conservative in Britain. Dee Robles We don't have to leave the states to hear about our accents, from one state to another and your nailed. I'm from NYC, moved up state and forever hearing 'you're from the city aren't you?, I can tell by your accent. In the 80?s I was in California, ""oh, you're from NYC, I'm so sorry for you, no one LIVES there, they just exist"". This from people who'd pontificate endlessly every time I ordered white bread or sugar. Needless to say, they were sorry, NEW YORK CITY STYLE for trying to tell me what to eat! In Louisiana, I was a ""Yank"", so you don't have to cross the ""pond"" for accents, just cross a street. Love my Life:) Grant I agree with turkey not being appetizing. I don't agree that Americans are spelling/pronouncing words wrong. That's just false British hubris talking. Language is an ever-changing form, and ""original English"" would be Old English that no one even uses anymore. Much of the country in this scientific age still believes in the literate truth of Genesis 1, and equates Darwin with Satan. The pervasive self-promoted pseudo-authority; and general distrust of anything intellectual The preoccupation with race. Having a handgun to ""defend"" yourself from someone with another handgun, whose sole purpose is to kill your fellow man, is somehow considered a divine right. Meanwhile, a million Americans have died of shooting since 1962. And yet, meaningful discussion is nigh impossible. But there are a great number of things that are right. demelzabunny Right on all counts! SporkLover I didn't realize the UK was so ethnocentric. I consider these things (and the reverse for American observations of Brits) to be the fun differences to explore and observe.... Certainly not bothered by it though. Maybe this falls into the endless sincere cheer. If your turkey is crap then you're making it wrong. But not surprised a Brit that isn't Gordon Ramsay or Nigella Lawson wouldn't know how to cook a decent tasting turkey. This is how you do it: Get a pound of pancetta or bacon, chop it up fine in a food processor with some good full fat European style butter, sea salt, garlic and sage. Rub the concoction under the skin all over -- not just the breast, wrap it up tight, put it in the fridge and let it sit over night. Roast the turkey with nothing but an onion and some herbs in the cavity atop a mirepoix (pronounced meer-pwaa) -- carrots, leeks, celery. Baste with melted butter mixed with white wine. And for God sakes, don't overcook it...take it out for a rest when the temp hits 160-165. Now, as an American, I will agree with you on every other item you list besides turkey and....the whole silly name thing. Really? You Brits have no room to talk, just ask Peaches Geldof. England Sucks This article really just outlines what is so shitty about England. Adding 'u' to words, are you kidding me? We progressed, our language is more advanced end of story.... This is why America is better than your shitty royalty-centered shitstain of a country Lisa HEY you SUCK Dan Your funny -- as American you might have to learn english comedy to appreciate my comment there. Tex Don't hold back 'ENGLAND SUCKS' let it out, let the world know all your xenophobic prejudices, let the world laugh and confirm it's belief that Americans are small minded racists. Daws Not excusing what ENGLAND SUCKS said at the end there. But what the heck did racism and xenophobia have to do with anything he said? Unless you think ""British"" is it's own race... which of course would make you way more divisive than us, and thus sort of undoes your own statement. Carol Kayye wow you are really taking this to heart haha demelzabunny Nasty comment, to be sure, but I do personally agree that the royal family (whose really last name is Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Beck-Gluck\\... by the way; sound German?) are a bunch of overindulged parasites. And this is in no way meant to disparage those from among them who conduct themselves w/dignity (a minority, to be sure). j I would say that it is people like this that drive brits, and indeed the rest of the world, nuts. The only thing he forgot to add was his, no doubt, customary 'America Rulez'. Anyway, regarding the list. As a brit I do find the butchering of the english language a pet peeve. And the pronunciation of z as zee. Being english, running through our psyche we have this assumption that we are God's chosen people. Its quite harmless I assure you, but it leads to an instinctive assumption that we are...., for the lack of a better term, better than everyone else. Again, its not as bad as it sounds. But when our language is changed it leaves you with a feeling akin to somebody walking into your front room, putting on your slippers and sitting in your arm chair. I think we still have somewhat of an empire attitude. Regarding patriotism, we dont do it over here. Maybe its the fact that we have had more time as a nation to grow and mature and are more comfortable with our place in the world. Maybe it has to do with the self depreciation that runs through the british way of life. We love our country for sure, we realise how lucky we are living here and when we are gone we pine to return.., yet we love a good moan about this place. One of the quirks that makes us us i suppose. But i digress. Personally, every American i've ever met has been warm, friendly and utterly contrary to the picture painted of them in stereotype. One thing i find odd though is the need for melted cheese on so many different foods? Robert It's not that either the US or the UK way of doing things is the right or the wrong way or the better way of doing anything. It's the way you're brought up and what you're lead to beleave. You tend to beleave that the way you were taught from a child is the correct way and any other ways are strange and alian and open for mocking so what seams natural to you can appear weird to someone else. You can find differences in families. I've visited families that I thought had strange ways of doing things and visitors have point out things we do different to them. What's good is that we accept our differances and find friendly humour in the confusion that may arrise from them. 36arbiter wow! that's the spelling equivalent of the st.Valentines day massacre.I cant stop laughing.I would like to broach,if I may,two questions.will Disney ever concieve an original story?,and,will Fox ever report on a subject other than food?. Lee Crain Your comment: ""Their over-zealous patriotism"" My ancestors came from England, escaping the religious zealots and Bishop Wren. That was 1626. We haven't spelled color with a u since then. My other ancestors were already here, maybe as long as 10,000 years. I have no idea what they were running from. I have often mused that if those ancestors had been better armed, and had better communication, we might not be in the mess we're in today. Robert Lee Crain it's a common miss conception that the early settlers came to America to escape religious persecution when in fact the reverse was true. They left because they felt the state was getting to liberal and tolerant allowing tomany different ideas of religion. They wanted somewhere they could be isolated, to practice their beliefs, away from the corrupting influences of opposing ideologies. So if anyone was intolerant and zealot it was the early settlers not the country they left. Tom Absolutely true. Anyone who wasn't a Puritan found themselves kicked out. That is how Rhode Island ended up getting settled. The Puritans believed in freedom of religion only for themselves. rehabber We already have a socialist president that is trying to turn us into Europe. Enjoyed the article, thanks goodness for differences. Tom Turn us into Europe! If only we were that lucky. Daws Oh god....Brits, you can take this one. Please. Jayson I would have to admit that some of these items are legitimate, but some are either examples of extreme nit-picking, or they simply are not so, as is the case with the supposed 'fanny' usage (someone else noted this as well). I for one love British culture, though it must be said that the UK has changed dramatically from how most Americans think of it. One need only reference their less-than-freedom-loving laws, their embrace of multiculturalism and the riots of last summer, to name a few. And in reference to your number 9, we do indeed (I'm rather fond of the word actually) have a socialist president, or if you prefer, a Marxist. However, perhaps this is relative to what they are used to in the UK and Europe. Cizzarries Hell....Having differences is what makes the world interesting. There's already been a lot of changes in the way people dress so that theres a lot of commonality. It'd be a damn boring world if everyone started to look, sound, and act like so many of the movies and tv shows from the west. george God what pretension!! Get over yourself. You dont like last names first? How about your habit of ignoring first names and calling everyone by their last name. You dont like turkey? Every one with a brain knows turkey is just an excuse to eat gravy. And to top it off you have a lot of damn gall telling any country their food sucks. English food? There is an oxymoron for you. Friendly service? I have had all the surly assholes I need waiting on me on Britrail. They are more mean and nasty than the French. Patriotism? Well we did win the war against you. TWICE! And then we had to come over there and keep the Germans from invading. And last but not least your women are the uglyest on the planet. roscoe three cheers for england Cizzarries So I take it you're a writer for greeting cards right? Never been to England myself, but as an American trucker who get's all over the lower 48.....We don't have much room for pointing at other countries bad behavior.....We have the bad behavior market in aces..... Tom Your history of WWII is a little messed up. The British stood against Hitler for a year alone. It was the USSR that defeated Germany. Ever hear of Stalingrad? York Tom your a little out there. At the beginng of the war Hitler and Stalin had a none aggression packed which Hitler didn't break until Gorring lost the Battle of Britain. So from the fall of France until Operation Barbarrossa Britain stood alone, as the only combatant nation opossed to the Nazi's, for over a year. When Gorring lost the Battle of Britain Hitler ordered the invation of the USSR to distract Germans from the defeat they'd suffered against British and he took the Soviets tolally off gaurd and drove them back almost to Moscow but he didn't allow for the Russian winter, got bogged down in the snows, his troops weren't equipt for the cold and in the spring they were still bogged down in the mud of the thaw. This gave Britain and it's allies chance to ship in supplies to the Russian Army and for the Russian Industry to manufacture vast quanties of T34 Tanks so the Russians could mount a counter attack. Stalingrad was a side show. Stupidity on both sides. It served no purpose other than to waste lives and equipement on both sides. The main body of German advance went round and bypast it all to geather. It was Stalins vanity that he ordered the troops within the city to fight to the last man and the last bullet to protect the city that bore his name. Likewise when the tide of war changed and the Red Army came to take Stalingrad back Hitler gave the same order to his troops in the city. The main defeat the germans suffered and turned the war infavour of the soviets was the tank battle at Kirsk. The Soviets had rows and rows and even more rows of tanks going back miles across the Russian Steps. The Germans would fight through one line of tanks and there was another waiting for them and behind them another and behind and so on. It was, and probably still is, the largest tank battle ever fought. But Hitlers first defeat was against the British and Britain did stand alone, with aid from America and the Commonwealth in the form of liberty ships bring much appreciated supplies, for a year. demelzabunny The comparative form of ""mean"" is ""meanER,"" not ""more mean,"" and the comparative form of ""nasty"" is ""nastIER,"" not ""more nasty."" And the superlative form of ""ugly"" is ""uglIEST."" Learn to spell, I don't care where you're from!!! Matt I'm an American and 2, 4, and 6 drive me crazy too. However, there is a tradition in the south to give the first son the mother's maiden name as a first name. If that is the last name you use as a first name, you get a pass. dxtran I'm an American who has visited the UK three times, and some of the things that bother the author about the U.S. bother me, too, such as the chest-pounding patriotism and the use of surnames as first names (especially for girls -- when you call your daughter ""Taylor"" or ""McKenzie,"" does it mean that you really wanted a boy?), but there are things that bother me about the UK, too, such as the ridiculously high charges at laundromats. What's this with 2.85 to wash and 1 per 12 minutes to dry? At home I pay $1.25 to wash and $1.25 for 45 minutes of drying. The way your intercity trains are priced is as crazy as the way airlines price their tickets. London to Bath at 9 on a prepaid ticket and 46 on same-day fare? Oh, but do you know what really bothers me about my fellow Americans? The fact that so many of them toss around phrases and lame jokes that they hear on political talk radio without understanding what they mean. I see a couple of examples in this column. Suunto My wife is British; we've been married 17 years and still occasionally find ourselves chuckling about differences between British and American English. She likes turkey (locally farm-raised) and I like marmite; not to mention clotted cream and real ales. About every other year, we pop over to England to visit her family and have a great time. Carol Kayye ow can you like marmite or even bovril Tom I'd have to agree with the over pronunciation complaint. For example, ""Computers are my strong point or forte'"". This comes from a strong hope for Americans to sound so sophisticated and French that they are mispronouncing an old English word! The traditional pronounciation is ""fort"" like Fort Benning, or Fort Knox. It means strong position, like a....FORT! For any Francophiles out there, I'm told the French pronounce it with a silent 'e' as well. Please correct if I am wrong. Not all English pronunciation is perfect either. We pronounce ""school"" as ""skool"" and so do you. Why then is ""schedule"" pronounced ""shedule""? How about some English consistency? Either pronounce it ""shool"" or pronounce it ""skedule"". As for Turkey, I'm American, 52 and have had it cooked many ways, but 95% of the time it's pretty dry and tasteless. That's why God invented gravy! But then again, English cooking has never floated my boat either. Boiled pig's knuckles? Really? Other than fish and chips, what noteworthy food item has come from England? And your beer? Yes most American beer has been designed so that we can drink casks of the stuff and not feel full. This is due to the fact that most of our large cities sit at or below the latitude or Rome. American beer has been made to be an alcoholic version of lemonade. As for your beer or ale, your water is so rotten that you literally have to burn the hops just to get the yeast to ferment. What's left is a brew more akin to your peat bogs than to any libations from the Pilsner region of the Czech Republic (where modern beer was first brewed.) The one point that I will always love about England is the wry and yet crazy sense of humor. I was raised on Monte Python reruns on PBS. I rented the DVDs from whence my children learned. In my opinion, telling someone off in a way that leaves them thinking you just gave them a compliment is the height of good humor. It's also much more fun than ""Oh yah, so's your mother!"" Robert You're tap dancing on quick sand trying to fathom vagarys of the spelling within the English Language. What you have to remember is English is a mongrel language, it's origins are many, from the Ancient Britains, through latin from the Roman occupation, then the Norse and the Saxon to the Norman invation. Since then words taken from the French, the Dutch, the Spanish and the Germans. New words made by combining Latin and Greek. Then there's words imported from the Empire, India, Africa, China, aboriginal words from Australasia and yes even the Americas. English is almost as diverse as language it's self so rules of spelling don't work when so many words have different origins. Ho and by the way the abbreviation of mathematics is Maths (plural) not Math (singular) you can't do anything with one unit you need at least two. So to say 'I'm going to do my math homework' or 'Do the math' doesn't make sence. demelzabunny Oy, this is atrocious!!! Regardez: - ITS without an apostrophe for possession -""there ARE words"", not ""there'S words"" - ""it's self?"" Come on!!! ITSELF. You probably think there's a possessive pronoun spelled ""hisself!"" Jeepers!!! If the Grammar/Spelling Police every got a hold of you all, you'd all be hauled off to the Old Bailey. Dan I'm English and I pronounce it skedule, if English people don't they have picked it up from tv. York Tom Your comments on beer, you know not what you speak, as is the case of most Americans when they talk of beer. For a start American beer and German and French is not strictly beer. That is not a critisism it's a technicality. In beers the sediment floats on the surface and is skimed off before barrelling. American uses the German (as do the French) method of deep sedimentation where it's left at the bottom of the vat. These are know as Ales and when stored to age slightly are Largers. Now Ales and Largers are pasturised so they will keep but this means they are dead and fizzy but also means you can chill them for a refreshing hot summer drink. Beer on the other hand tends to be darker in colour, have a higher gravity and if traditional,(some modern beers are not) unpasturised, so doesn't keep as long or travel well, because it alive and as to be kept at a constant temprature which is cool but not cold. So American servicemen stationed in Britian and used to chilled American Ales moaned about warm British Beer. But they where just showing their ignorance. If they'd asked for a cold larger they'd have got something more like what were used to. But many dispite their ignorance and prejudice got a taste for British beer, some didn't. Ho! and the largest brewery in Britian is Bass at Burton on Trent and it's owned by Coors but theres still plenty of smaller british own breweries and there's hundreds of varieties of different beers each and everyone different. Daws Have to nitpick, what makes a beer is more than that, it's more about what they're made with and how, not what you do with it after. Lagers and Ales then are just subsets of beer. Of course it might just be a difference in how our cultures categorize things. Here, what you describe as a beer sounds like what we'd call a stout, maybe a porter? Which of course to us are just other subsets or kinds of beer. YORK Doesn't matter what you call it or caterories it as. What matters is there is a difference between beers brewed in different places according to the local custom and to judge one beer that you are not familiar with, by comparing it with one that you are, when the two are totally different beverages, shows a lact of understanding, an intolerance to the unfamiliar and a resitance to new experiences. You wouldn't compare a whisky to brandy yet they are both spirits. You may say you prefer one to the other or that one is not to your liking. You might even say you can't stand the taste of one. But you don't say that one is rubbish, shit, foal, discusting, when you know that many people would disagree and take offence. It's all a matter of taste and if it's to your taste so be it but you don't have to insult people to make your point. Butch Knouse As far as accents, Americans have a great variety among themselves. In WWII, there was a ship that was crewed by Louisiana Cajuns. They were assigned a Captain from Boston. They literally couldn't understand each other. Finally, they brought in an officer from Iowa, to translate between the Captain and the crew. Butch Knouse About half of the things on the list bug me too, and I'm American. New York was mentioned. A New Yorker opened a pizza parlor in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He said in an newspaper article that he expected his customers to eat his pizza ""New York style"", which is, fold the slice in half, with toppings inside, and then eat it. Sorry, I'd rather taste the toppings. New Yorkers are like that. If anything or anybody is big in NY, they assume that this is a nationwide trend. Anglofile You been waiting a long time to vent about that pizza hey? Hope you can breathe a little better now. Robert Interesting note about pizza. The Brits picked up the love of pizza from the Americans. The Americans adopted it from the Italians. However the best selling ready made pizza bases, in Italy, are imported frozen from England. Carol Kayye I thought pizza was swedish robert izza as we know it goes back to naples, italy. However without the poison fruit, from the americas it would be quite a different thing. YORK BUTCH KNOUSE says he can not taste the topping if he folds his New York style pizza. As he tried chewing it? demelzabunny I beg to differ, sir. ""New York Style"" pizza means that it has a relatively thin crust, as opposed to Chicago deep dish. I'm from New York and neither I nor the vast majority of New Yorkers I know eat their pizza the way you describe. Only ignorant prols eat their pizza that way! Humph! Why don't you actually ask the pizzeria owner what he means by New York style pizza instead of inventing your own ill-informed interpretations? Rich R America and Britain -- two countries separated by a common language! Emma As a Brit living in the U.S. I agree completely with everything on this list, had a good laugh at a lot of them. Quite agree with the language thing, if you want to change it fine, but don't bloody well call it English, drives me nuts. As for all the defensive, arrogant, American responses, its people like you that have me counting the days till I move back to Europe. This was meant as a joke, a few differences that Brits find annoying about Americans, LAUGH at it for goodness sake, and stop taking yourselves so seriously, no one else does! surrey I'm English through and through, though I've lived in the USA for 20 years. There's some truth in both sides of these arguments, from both sides of the pond. Folks need to keep a sense of humour! However ... Turkey is only dry if not cooked properly. I love it! I'm sick of hearing the US et al insulting British food. It irritates the hell out of me to be referred to as ""you guys"" in a restaurant, by a waiter less than half my age, however friendly and efficient that person is! (I will still tip well though... ) Have a nice day... demelzabunny I'm American, and I agree w/the ""you guys"" thing; it's pretty annoying. And: I actually like British food! Esp. the oatmeal, tea and jam. It may not be haute cuisine, but it's pretty darn good. Linda Today in Port Isaac, Cornwall, I saw a lady pushing a spaniel in a stroller. So much for Americans being the only ones to treat their dogs like babies. When I asked her politely if the dog were ill or hurt, she said that the dog was elderly and couldn't manage the ups and downs of the harbor. The dog had my sympathies. I was having trouble with the slopes myself! Tom Burns As a frequent listener to the venerable BBC 3, I am always amused how they pronounce the name of Debussy. Many Americans follow the French pronunciation. And I won't bring up what they do to the names of American jazz musicians and composers, but I am a loyal radio 3 listener and let music does the talking. Cheers spittingkitty Brits eat pancakes for dinner and steak & kidney pie and you're going to take issue with turkey? Robert Brits don't eat pancakes all that much, well not nearly as much as the Americans, they do have them on occasion yes at no specific time or meal, just as the mood takes them. It is however traditional to have them on Shrove Tuesday the last day before Lent. What's wrong with Steak and Kidney Pie? It tastes beautiful, Golden shortcrust pastry, cubes of succulent steak, pieces of kidney in rich thick gravy with potatoes and vegitables of choice. What's not to like? When you think of some of the things Americans call food. As for turkey; I love it, even when it is dry, Turkey at Chistmas, Thanksgiving, turkey and stuffin sandwiches, cold turkey salad, turkey curry........ Grits; now who thought that was food? demelzabunny I could eat pancakes for brekkie, lunch and dinner! Gayle Chawa While I respect the author's right to her opinion. and even agree with a couple of them, I just wanted to say that it is bad form to criticize someone when you are visiting their home. xinunus What an arrogant piece this is. Brits are idiots and whining babies and this piece proves it. I am boycotting the BBC. Anyone that thinks that having a Socialist President is a good thing is living in a hole in the ground. That is why the US economy is in the tank, WE HAVE A Socialist President you idiot, His name is Obama. 'THE BBC CAN GO TO HELL' it's already been and got the documentary footage, where was Fox News or Sky? demelzabunny If only our country were MORE socialist; there would be much less inequity in all spheres of life. Mary I totally agree with everything, how refreshing it is for somebody to be totally honest about how they feel. Some of the comments are good and bad but the one from England Blow Balls is disgusting language and this should be removed. I do wish they would not say ass, it's arse, get it right!! Rob S. Can't believe nobody (as far as I read) mentioned fried turkey. All of y'all are doing it wrong. I've spent a week in Glasgow and a day in London. Everybody my partner and I encountered were very nice. The shopkeepers in Glasgow were interested in where we were from and why we weren't staying longer. Would give anything to go back. BTW, it's SOCCER. Football comes on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the fall and winter. Rob S. Oh, I'm trying to work in ""Cheers!"" more and more. Jeremy Branham Some of these are funny to read. However, I disagree on some of these. There are two that stick out to me -- turkey and patriotism. If all you've ever eaten is dry turkey then whoever is serving it to you doesn't know how to cook it. Turkey is DELICIOUS!!!!!! I could eat one every day. Find someone who knows how to cook it and eat it when it is moist. YUMMY!!! I am not a flag waving American who flaunts my patriotism in the face of others. As a traveler, I like and respect other cultures and countries. There are many things that other countries do that I wish Americans would do. When traveling, I often shake my head at the behavior of some Americans. With that said, there is something about patriotism here that I don't think you get. We were a country that came from other nations. We've forged our own identity and have had to fight to establish who we are. Honestly, it's not an arrogance thing but there is something about being an American that is different in terms of our patriotism. It DOES NOT make us better than any other country. However, there is something about our patriotism that is hard to put into words. And honestly, I am quite the Anglophile. I watch British TV shows, long for the UK, and love so much of the culture. Yet I am still proud to be an American. I guess it's hard to explain unless you grew up here. 36arbiter America sucks,Britain blows.dream team. Joseph I agree with Jeremy, turkey is delicious (of course, when cooked properly). One thing that annoys me to no end is the overuse of ""cute"" Robert Joseph the over uses of ""cute"" is just a passing phase, like 'sweeet' 'sic' and 'cool' they'll go the way of ' rad' 'noway' and 'respec' @Seanjacko I don't usually post, and so long down the list, no one will see it anyway. BUT. Points 8 & 9 are at serious odds with one another. To complain about the ewe and the zed, and then reel about pretentious pronunciation displays a classic piece of misinformed British snobbery. I have tried stamping this out. I want the zed back in English English and I'm glad that it appears to be happening. It's only pointless snobbery keeping it out. We only started uses esses in the ealry 20th century becasue we fell out with America and wanted to be seen as more sophisticated and European, like the French, so bingo, esses instead of zeds, and a shit load of pointless Us inserted all over the shoppe. demelzabunny Here, here! 36arbiter There is something that I would like to point out to any Americans that are not familliar with the history of the British isles.the U.K. is made up of four nations.wales,scotland,northen ireland and england.the welsh and scots are the indigenous peoples of these islands,the true britons.our islands have been invaded many times over the centuries,the romans,the saxons,the engles(germanic tribes)and the normans,to name but a few.although the scots were never conquered,they have continued to suffer a slow strangulation by the the english.the welsh did not fair nearly so well.the english took our land,our sons,our religion,they tried, with unremitting cruelty,to eradicate every part of our culture,our history and our independence.even now,the english still consider themselves our masters.therefore, when we hear other countries,and even the english themselves,refer to britain as england,it makes our blood boil.America,of all countries should understand the importance of freedom.the english are the bastard sons of brutal conquest.they are the fat cuckoo in our nest. Angela ""America of all countries""??? If you feel bad when they refer to britain as england, we (south americans, central americans, canadians, etc) feel even worse when people from the US are called americans and even worse when 'they' refer to America as a country! Robert What a load of rubbish. The typical ranting of someone who's swallowed the propaganda put out by the idiots that want to break up the United Kingdom for their own selfish gain. The Scots are not the indiginous race of Scotland. When the Romans invaded Britain the Scots were tribes in Ireland. Scotland didn't excist. The land that became Scotland was home to the Pits, England was home the Angles (or Angels because of their blond hair; much prised for wigs by the Roman women) Angles that couldn't adapt to Roman rule feld west to form Wales. The Scots moved in when the Romans pulled out; as did the Saxon, the Vikings and various other Norse and Germanic tribs. The Scots drove the Pits North to the Hebradies, and only on a few northern islands can you find the true indigious naitives of what is now called Scotland. The Vikings and other Norse tribes settled England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales inter breeding with the people already there before them. So the whole of the British Isles became one big melting pot of peoples for all over northern and western Europe. Even Persian traders from the Mediterranean set up settlements. When the Romans were in Britain they brought soldiers, craftsmen, and merchants from all over the Empire and many of their desendants stayed when the army moved back to Rome. Scotland as not been slowly strangled as you put it by the English. For the most part England left Scotland to tend it own affairs and a very poor job the Scots did of it. Inter Clan conflicts were many and frequent and far more bloody and cruel than anything the English ever inflicted. Even when there was English interest in the out come of a Battle on Scotish soil the ones doing the fighting tended to be Scots on Scots just one side having allegiancies to the Crown. But should it be them that won it was seen as an English victory and the English blaimed for any atrocities comited. The armys on either side were made up of mainly Scots, some English, Irish, French, Dutch and mersanries from all over. It's just the ones that wore English Red Coats were better trained and disciplined and had an annoying habit of winning which tends to not go down well with the opposition who had an equally bad habit of bad mouthing those loyal to the crown and spreading anti English propaganda. The chances were none combatants got better treatment from the English forces than they did from the rebels. When both countries were ruled from Westminster, the anti English claimed it was unfare and the English are dictating how Scotland is run when in reality Scotish MPs out numbered English MPs and if anything it was the Scots, through Westminster, who were dictating how Britain was run. Even now with devolution, home rule for Scotland and Wales and the English having no say in their affairs, there is still a sizeable number of Scotish MPs in Westminster, representing Scotland in Britain but in doing so, influencing how England is governed. It's the old old story with the Scots always claiming they get second rate treatment to the English, when in fact they get more capita per head than the English, but no matter how much more they're given to shut them up they just keep on whining for more and blaming the English for everything wrong in Scotland. They'd blame the English for the weather if they thought there was a chance someone might believe them. demelzabunny Well aware of all of that history. That's why many of your fellow compatriots (the Irish, Scots, Welsh, etc.) immigrated to the U.S. in the 19th and 20th centuries. YORK Well the Irish left because the potatoes failed. The Scotish left because their Lairds closed the crofts and brought in sheep. The Welsh were just looking for something better than what they had at home as did the English and just about everyone else. Most people at sometime or another as dreamt of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and every now and then some will actually go looking for it especially if there is nothing to keep them where they are. Angela I don't usually post either, and I agree that with this long list no one will see, but Americans? ya'll still have the first world trauma. America is a continent! You are referring to the United States, therefore United Statians! I do agree with Turkey (is tasteless), flags, patriotism (super agree to what the author say) and the accent!! Pfff Bailey United Statians? Hmm, I love it! Lou I mean this with all due respect to you, Angela, but I have to disagree. I can see your logic, with the whole ""United statians"" thing. However, since the full name of the country is the ""United States of America"", it also makes logical sense to call us (the people of said country) ""Americans"". For example, when Germany was separated into East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany), the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany were not called Federal Republicans, they were called Germans (or West Germans, which ever). Other countries that come to mind are The Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Czech Republic, and the no-longer-a-country country of the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). Honestly, I thought the article was hilarious. Of course I just had to ruin it by reading the comments. (This next part is meant for the general public of both countries, and not to you, Angela) Come on, people, why do you need to harbor so much hatred? Not all Americans are stupid, pig-headed ego-manics. Some are, and they just happen to enjoy baiting any one who doesn't see eye to eye with them. So cool it. Dark Space I don't know, I went to London once. A drunk bum threw up all over my feet and cussed me out for staring at him in disbelief, and pretty much everyone was rude to me the entire trip. I still loved the gloomy weather (really), don't hold it against all the decent brits I've met since, and I even ride a British motorcycle. Filet was an odd word choice, given it's not English and the Americans are both pronouncing and spelling it correctly (the French way) and you are not. Also, Angela has a good point. One thing that I've heard drives you Brits nuts is ""Americans"" inability to distinguish between the UK, Britain, and England. I move that we call ourselves United Statians from here on out. Turkey is the worst meat ever. But, squirrel is some of the best meat ever and no one eats it. It's really perplexing. roscoe britian is a woderfullcountry they are eccentric very couargeous people did you know we americans are kin to the british people we have blood relation ship in londn and all over ireland scotland and wales three cheers for lodon we dot have a queen are a king as england does. enlish people are staunch people i once was teasing a man from england about tea he said shut the F up i stopped teasing him his name was rt garber we were good frinds after that yes only englad could produce a churchill three cheers for england. roscoe yes i live in merica but my heart is in good old england GODS coutryand the women in england are not ugly they are beatifull to me and there accent is wondertfull threecheers forengland demelzabunny I give up!!! roscoe england has produced great poets and actors i wish i lived in england but i cannot england produces men and women of the first caliber. Lisa HEY Ruth, Referring to number 5, my parents are from Hastins, i was born in New Jersey. we fly both the American flag and the Union flag on our flag pole in front of the house. and on St. George day we fly the St.George Cross flag. LOVE both countries and proud of it. demelzabunny It's called the Union Jack. Lisa HEY Ruth SORRY typing too fast. my parents are from HASTINGS. Lisa HEY Ruth i forgot to say. HAVE A NICE DAY. Annie Sir, you are cooking your turkey wrong. 36arbiter I meant in respect of the fact that America is the worlds greatest exponent of the principle. Boseph I agree with everything except the pronunciation and the spelling bit. That is simply a dialectic difference. To say there is one English language is sort of absurd. I'm from the western United States, listening to someone from the south (especially in the deep south like Louisiana and Florida) half the time I am convinced it is a different language. marcriedler t sitehis is good. Claudia Considering that there are 313 million Americans, this article makes some pretty sweeping assumptions. In reality, its a commentary on the group of Americans who the author knows or has had contact with -- and I'm guessing it's not 313 million. And, FYI, what is it with anti-American sentiment? The comment about American Patriotism alone is ridiculous -- no one talks more about the wonder of their country than the British. Additionally, I assure you that most Americans could care less about pleasing you...just like most Brits don't give a fig about pleasing Americans. First rule of Journalism -- get your facts correct. Dan FYI, any americans that read this, this is not saying what is wrong with America just what's annoys Britains. It could be either side that is wrong. If you don't agree then laugh. Marcia Just one comment,,... I bet there are no ""typical"" Americans or British,. By the way I have a sister in law British born in South Africa and I have to admit that she has more class then the rest of the loud mouths in our family,,,LOL,,,.my MUM just loves her and thinks she is the best and yes she is,, very understated and elegant..... It is like EVERYONE takes advantage of her and.no one appreciates. Her. Not even my brother the educated lawyer,,,, I never realized that she is the best one and got kicked to the curb.....Now I get it about loud and arrogant,,,,now I see,,, saw the light,,.. Though she is too too skinny but a beautiful girl,,,,,, way too nice for America. MUM's fav even over me...... Soul of Wit It amuses me that just as many Brits as Americans have failed to note the tongue-in-cheek nature of this article. Personally, I draw a clear distinction between patriotism (devotion to one's place of birth) and nationalism (a sense of superiority over other countries.) I consider myself a patriotic American, though I have never flown a flag on my home. As for calling myself an American, that is entirely appropriate. That is how people from the United States of America are properly addressed. I am fully aware the there are two continents with that name and that all of these are named after an Italian man. Anyone who can't grasp that British English and American English are different (but neither is ""wrong"") is a bit slow on the uptake. I still occasionally run across a British pronunciation that floors me. I would never think of suggesting that the speaker was incorrect. Love the article, but srsly...Herb is a guy's name. I don't want Herbs in my food, kthx. And omitting the 't' when pronouncing fillet is not pretentious if, for all intents and purposes, that's the only way you've heard it pronounced. It would be awkward to say it any other way. To put the shoe on the other foot, say out loud ""the University of Notre Dame"". James Williams Ruth, you're entitled to not like these things. You're also entitled to not bother coming to the USA. Pauldo Hey, Eddie, if you have to say the ""h"" in herb, how about the ""g"" in Magdalen, the ""w"" in Chiswick/Warwick/Greenwich, and most of the letters in Worcester or Chalmondeley? demelzabunny Greenwich, NY is pronounced ""Green-wich,"" and the local girls' sports teams are the ""Greenwich Witches."" occupant12 Wow, most of the commenters don't have much of a sense of humour. Note the ""u"" -- I'm a Canadian and therefore the cursed bastard child of both US and English imperialism -- so I put the u in ""-our"" words and use the ""z"" in ""-ize"" words. And as a Canadian I get to roll my eyes at all the stupid things both the Yanks and the Brits do, knowing full well that you folks think all Canadians are doofuses and wankers. Re: fillet and filet. I believe it is a fillet (""fill-it"") of fish, but a filet (""fee-lay"") of beef. Two different words. And to you yanks: ""zed"" is the standard pronunciation for the last letter of the alphabet in every English-speaking region of the world except the USA. So it's a case of American exceptionalism. Just sayin'. Hell, they even say it ""zed"" in French, and I know that because I'm Canadian and we all grow up reading French on cereal boxes so that's why we're superior and smug even when you Yanks and Brits call us bad names. Carol Kayye you are Canadian. Weird and you don't have a say just messing with you haha demelzabunny Too true! Tom S This coming from someone who no doubt says ""courgettes"" instead of zucchini or summer squash and ""aubergine"" instead of eggplant. demelzabunny I like ""rocket"" for arugula (which is Italian, or course!). EngineerScotty If you're going to complain about US pronounciation, then I must ask: Where the hell is the F in ""leuitenant""? demelzabunny Well-put! demelzabunny It's French, you do-do! 36arbiter The english voted Kerry catona british mother of the year.they also voted Amy winehouse british woman of the year.this was the same year Katherine jenkins arrived.the riots didn't spread to wales or scotland.give us our country back before you ruin it.cuckoo. Stewart 36ARBITER get back to the bogs of Ireland and leave Scotland to the Pits the true indigenous natives of scotland. Ho and give the bagpipes back to the Irish, the kilt and the tartan back to the English along with the haggis and the Highland Games. Ho and read some history books and stop reading SNP propaganda cause it's bol....... gregor Being neither from UK nor USA but having lived in USA for a very long time, I find this discussion quite humorous. The conflation of the British accent with brilliance is something the the Brits coming here should really enjoy, for they do not have to suffer the sort of little indignities that a non-white foreign born person has to endure in the US. Even those who are at heart open to foreigners put me off many times because of their seemingly patronizing behavior (one colleague on a 24th December: have a good whatever you celebrate). Take heart. The native born Americans are nasty to every one sometime or the other, though many do not really mean it. (As for UK, we still laugh at being directed to 'South Hole' by an immigrant in London when we asked for its whereabouts during our visit over ten years ago.) xpostfactoid Cute! But Americans aren't being pretentious when they drop the t in fillet or pronounce garage the French way. Most of us don't know that anyone pronounces those words differently! I wonder whether Brits anglicized their French words some centuries after they started settling on this continent? Clint First of all, this is classic British humo(u)r, not a petty criticism in seriousness. Get a sense of humor and get over it. Second of all, why all these articles about English visitors to the US? How about Scottish or Irish or Welsh visitors? When I visited the UK, to me England was very beautiful but I found the people difficult, whereas Scotland was both beautiful and congenial. Growing up in a Scots-Irish part of the country, with Scots-Irish roots, I felt right at home and enjoyed myself thoroughly. Robert In re #7, I quote Cassandra (William Connor), from the Daily Mirror in 1953: ""What a shocking fraud the turkey is. In life preposterous, insulting -- that foolish noise they make to scare you away! In death -- unpalatable. The turkey has practically no taste except a dry fibrous flavour reminiscent of a mixture of warmed-up plaster-of-Paris and horsehair. The texture is like wet sawdust and the whole vast feathered swindle has the piquancy of a boiled mattress."" Emily you should try an heirloom turkey the next time you have turkey -- it'll change your mind. seriously :0) John K If the clerks in shops are annoying with insincere wishes to have a good day (or that you're an 'awesome' customer?), come to my area of Central Florida where you won't get a thank-you for making a purchase. You'll be lucky if someone even bothered to wait on you and, by the surly look at the end of the transaction, you could drop dead right there. frank owen As a former Mancunian who has lived in the United States for twenty years not one of these things drives me ""nuts"". What does drive me ""nuts"" is pretentious Brits who whine like little bitches (that great British pastime) that everything in America isn't exactly the same as it is back home. It's another country, for chrissakes. American usage of the English language is bound to be somewhat different. Get over yourselves. mike I've noted what really irritates a lot of snobby Brits is that Americans are, for the most part, truly and authentically friendly. My personal experience in England was that the academics, the political class, and the wealthy looked down on us for precisely that reason. But the shop owners and ordinary people appreciated it and responded in kind. Trucknutz Fartsack The language was brought here while it was still pure, before nancy boy Charles Stuart poofed it up in France. And, please, the ultimate cat fetishist in the world are found where? UK, I believe. You must eat in some real dumps, because I've never had a server take a plate before asking me permission. And if your eating in a busy place, its impolite to hold the table hostage. And, that passport works both ways. You can use it to leave, too. Jeff Johnson As an American I totally agree on the over-zealous patriotism, the phony cheerfulness, and clearing plates to quickly (it makes one feel unwelcome, as if one's imminent departure is being strongly suggested). The late Christopher Hitchens wrote an amusing piece in Slate about the infuriating habit of servers to insinuate themselves into the dinner conversation to pour the wine all around the table. Regarding the pretentiousness of American pronunciation of ""herb"" or ""fillet"", it can't be pretentious because the typical American is totally unaware that these sounds could be taken that way; we just grow up saying them that way,just as we learn to say ""the"" or ""house"" or ""foot"". There is no attempt at feigning continental sophistication involved. Most Americans are totally unaware of the French origins of these words. What would sound pretentious to Americans would be to pronounce the 'h' or the 't' in these words, unless you have a British accent, in which case the foreign sounding pronunciation could be forgiven. When people speak it is the sound that counts, not the spelling or etymology. Otherwise their might be a lot of anxiety about pronouncing words containing ""gh"". Fillet is a French word that we got directly from the French in the late 19th, early 20th century, and which most USians learned from Julia Childs' series on French cooking. Of course we're going to pronounce it the French way; that's the way we learned it. Regarding ""herb"", I personally pronounce it with an 'h' as does everyone in my family and most everyone from central or west Texas, so that's really a regional accent thing. In general, if you listen you'll notice that most US accents don't aspirate their hs like the British accents do. That has led our h sounds to becoming softer and often totally silent, which is where the silent 'h' in 'herb' comes from in most US speakers. I'll also point out this it is pretty rich that you poke fun at us for our ""French"" pronunciations and our lack of the letter 'u' when the English 'u' is one of the most prominent artifacts of French influence in the language. Historical ignorance isn't very flattering and you should avoid it. As to turkey, if all the turkey you've ever eaten is dry and powdery, that's because you and the people you eat with don't know how to friggin cook. It ain't difficult to make a tasty Turkey; you've just got to cook it the right way. That doesn't necessarily mean brining it, though that's certainly a good way to start as it lets the salt and seasoning really get deep into the meat (that's what brining does btw, it doesn't keep the food ""juicy"" it lets the flavorings soak in). I'm not going to explain the proper procedures to you here but I will give you a hint. Alton Brown; look him up. This is overall a very hostile, anti-American article. I say this as someone with English friends and family that I love, and a very, very great fondness for the UK, English literature, British humor, and so much else. I'm quite familiar with irony. But there is a very vicious edge to the author's words that she attempts to cover up with all the ha-ha one-liners. It's a pity for her that she moved here -- it appears that she's going to have a miserable, continually scornful and hostile, time for herself. However, since she can regularly publish anti-American articles for an international audience from inside, well, I guess for her it's inside the belly of the beast, she'll always be able to make a living. Sandy This proud ""Show Me"" state American says Herb, loves watching the British sitcoms on PBS and came from English/Irish roots. I don't understand why so many have twisted knickers! Sue Cox I've read every one of these comments and enjoyed them all -- with the possible exception of the really nasty one half way through. It's easy to see though, why the original article (and its obverse) were written. brompo Interesting read. And I agree with some of what you say, especially the patriotism thing. But let's skip to the contentious bit. Are we Americans meant to take advice on the pronunciation of the word ""fillet"" from someone who doesn't pronounce the final ""t"" in ""trait""? Obviously our countries have differing opinions on how to pronounce certain vowel sounds. But look at which speakers leave out consonants and entire syllables of written words more frequently, and then let's talk about who pronounces the language incorrectly. Meg And here are ten right back at you from an American living in England: 1. Saying ""I see you still haven't lost your accent!"" Because your average Liverpudlian or Londoner just falls over himself trying to lose the accent if he moves to another city in the UK or, God forbid, the US. 2. Having entire conversations -- nay, ongoing relationships -- with people without once ever admitting to having a name. And ignoring friendly Americans who say ""By the way, my name is Meg."" Silence. 3. A pathetic belief that Caesar salad dressing and salad cream are the same thing. You've come a long way food-wise, but good heavens the Caesar salads and nachos are crimes against food. 4. The moaning. It's too rainy, too sunny, too warm, too cold. 5. The bizarre fascination with queuing and avalanche of self-congratulations on the ability to do it. So can the three year olds in my son's nursery, but I'm hoping they'll get over the whole ""so-proud-of-myself"" aspect by five. 6. The Eurovision song contest. Can you stop pretending you hate it? Because you watch it obsessively and report on it as though it's the most important thing in the world. 7. The obsession with the ""right"" way to spell words. Fact is that when our countries parted ways, spelling was so inconsistent that people frequently spelled their own names several different ways. We went one way, you the other -- get over it. 8. The obsession with the ""right"" vocabulary. See above. 9. What you lack in ""patriotism"" as Americans see it, you more than make up for with subtle superiority. 10. Documentaries about Abba. Could you please stop making them? And nostalgic ones where people I've never heard of reminisce about the 70s? Because my husband can't resist them and it's driving me mad. Thank you. That said, I love living in the UK -- and not least for the people here! Thanks for giving me an opportunity to vent on the ten little things that drive me up the wall... azel leese Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly. Who would have thought that a humoro(u)s artictle could generate such a fuss? My son was bought up in Wales and danced around to the songs on Sesame Street, so we understand ""Zee"" there is no Z in the Welsh alphabet. Erv Fillet? This honestly bugs you? The English use so many French words in daily life, making your comment completely invalid. Ge over it. Many things on your list are rather annoying, they also annoy plenty of people here as well. As for the relentlessly sincere cheer, I think you need to start leaving TGI Friday's to meet Americans. York Yer all getting hung up on this accent thing. 'You don't talk like I do there for you're dumb' attitude. Well that just shows how dumb you are; whatever side of the pound you come from. Have you never played 'Chinese Whispers'? I assum you know what that is but if you don't; it's a game played at kids parties where every one sits around in a semi circle and an adult whispers something to the first child in line, who then turns and whispers it to the next child and so on till it reaches the last child who stands up and says it out loud. Then there's fits of giggles when it's reveled what the oridginal whisper was. Because as each child convade the message to the next in line words get miss heard and replaced with what the listner thought they heard and so, depending on the length of the line,the message can get changed out of all recognition by the time it reaches the end of the line. For over two hundred years America as been playing Chinese Whispers with the English lanagauge, So have Austrailia, New Zealand, Canada, many other English speaking peoples around the world and that includes the British. It's not strange that we sometimes miss understand each other what is strange is that we can still understand each other at all. Lou I completely agree with that. It's funny about that game you were talking about, Chinese whispers; I always knew it as Telephone, here in the States. Brittany It's good to poke fun at each other and at ourselves every now and then, but the things the author chooses to take issue with are a little ridiculous. Employees at the stores are too friendly and the employees at the restaurants are too efficient? Getting upset over the fact that some people like turkey more than others, and holding people accountable for changes in language that happened long before they were born? What? ttp://www.pololamartina.net la martina polos Chanced upon your site. This post on the investing pitfalls for the year is very insightful. I agree especially for the china market, which i think is expanding too fast beyond its fundamentals. Mike Ahh! This article is so disappointing, and proves that the author really doesn't ""get us."" First, dangling the Stars and Stripes on your house (or vehicle, or person) is not about patriotism, it's about shaming your friends and neighbors who don't participate. (For the record, we are fully aware that true patriotism entails things like referring to our system of governance as a democratic republic instead of a democracy, knowing the names of our presidents, states and capitols, etc., but we don't engage in this trivial stuff.) Closer to the author's missing the point, what we cherish more than wearing patriotism on our sleeve is calling each other un-American. Doing this to someone else automatically elevates one's stature as an American. The best time to do this is when someone exercises freedom of speech. And to suggest that we don't do irony? Perhaps we deserve a closer look. That's something I never understood about this country. We claim to be a democratic country, with freedom of speech and ideas, but moment anyone exercises their right to free speech they're labled a commee and unamerican. Foreigners are regaurded as dangerous and/or weird because they do things differantly but when they have the nerve to point out thing we do differant to them we get indignant, 'how dare these foreigners criticize us?'. 36arbiter I was born in the land of my fathers.were you? WHY The above ten items are just a bit of fun, they don't really bother Brits that much, it's just something to provoke a reaction. But do you really want to know what does get our backs up, and not just the Brits but just about the rest of the world. It's the way Hollywood steals and abuses other countrys cultures, tails and exploits. It trawls through well known and not so well known, storys both fact and fiction, rewriting them and relocating them for an American audiences. From fairy storys to true life adventures, from fantasy to acts of real heroism, they all get the Hollywood make over. Take 'Winnie the Phoo' a classic childrens novel, been a much loved piece of English culture for over a hundred years. But now if we want to uses it, say for a childrens entertainment, we have to pay Disney royalties for the right. Peter Pan, J M Barry, who wrote it, left all rights to the royalties after his death to Saint Thomases Childrens Hospital London. Walt Disney took the Hospital to court to try and deprive them of those royalties. War films. History is rewriten so that campains of action that had nothing to do with any American forces are suddenly being won by gallant Americans. French Resistance are aided in the raids on the Germans by Americans that take charge and do all the heroic stuff. A British Comando Raid gets an American tagging alone who saves the day. American forces fight and win battles that in reality the Americans were nowhere near. Things that other countries did, like obtaining an Enigma Machine, are done by American special forces. The alies obtained 12 such machines throughout the war, none by the Americans. America was given one by the British. The first one was aquired, of a U boat, by the Canadians. Classic films, British, European, Japanese are remade and relocated to American settings with American characters played by American actors. Classic Novels get the same treatment, rewriten as American screen plays. Warner Brothers couldn't get the rights to relocate Harry Potter to America and had to make it in England but where did they build the theme park to this most British of Storys, not in Britain where it was writen and set, not where the landscape that you saw in the movies is, not where the technical experteie that created the movies is, No the theme park go up in America. The list goes on and on, half the stuff that comes out of Hollywood is lifted from some other country and 90% of it as been so rewriten to make it acceptable for an American audience, that it's now only bearly just about reconisable by audiences in the country from which it came. AZryan Holy cow, you're illiterate. (learn to spell some of the simple words you messed up, ok??). Milne, who created W. the Pooh, sold the rights to another guy for MONEY. Then 30 YEARS later, that guy sold the rights to Disney for MONEY. You're insane to complain about what the creator and following owners did with what ISN'T YOURS in any way!? Try making up your own thing if you're so offended. If you like W. the Pooh so much...well, DUH...that's WHY Disney bought it! Personally, I give Disney as little of my money as possible, but I don't say that can't do business. And Barrie donated the rights to Peter Pan to the Great Ormond Street children's hospital, NOT the one you mentioned!? They owned those rights for 70 YEARS, until it fell into the public domain in 2007. That's just the LAW. The dispute is 'IF' it remains under copyright in America (but not Europe) until 2023. The dispute was over one little book sequel by Hyperion (a Disney-owned publisher) written by two people who just wanted to make a story to make kids happy, and thought Peter Pan was in the public domain (because it appeared to BE). It was the hospital that got its lawyers to try to get all the profits from a work they had nothing to do with. But 'it's for the kids' you might say. Well...so was the book! Why does the law not matter to you?? Disney uses all kinds of Grimm Fairy Tales, but they don't own them (for that same PUBLIC DOMAIN LAW reason). So you're free to use them, too. But you won't. Because you're talentless. Do you actually believe that JK Rowling doesn't get to decide every single thing she wants with regards to Harry Potter??? She owns it 100%. You act like it was stolen from her by America!?! You're literally insane and everyone else should be warned about you. WHY Wondered who'd rise to that one. Guess it was a little over the top and yes my spelling is atrocious always as been and no that doesn't make me illiterate, I read fine, or stupid. Stupid is the idiot who judges someone by what they can't do and not by what they can. So happens I'm dyslexic so writing is a burdenous chore for me so I do it to strength what little skill I have for it. Its not that Disney bought or didn't buy the rights to any book or weather the copyright had lapsed into public domain or not it's that once Disney get hold of it they make it there's and copyright something about so that others can't use it. Take Snow White that is old enought to be public property and anyone can use it, Rewrite it, make a stage play you can do what you like with it. Except the seven dwarf, Disney copyrighted their names so no one can use the names he used in the film, but that's the names everyone knows them by. So if someone does a christmas pantomime of Snow White they either have to pay Disney vast sums of money to use the names every one knows or invent new ones and then the kids want to know where's Dopey? and don't understand when you try to explain to them Disney owns Dopey and all the other dwarfs they know so well. It may have been Great Ormond Street Hospital I would have thought that the more likely but I remembered it as St Thomas's for some reason. But Barry gave all royalities to which ever Childrens Hospital in perpetuity and every publisher honoured that bequest even when the copyright lapsed, Disney didn't. But these are just example and each can be argued for and against in turn it's not the indevidual case it's the shear number of them across all cultureal activities and even if everyone can be defended and justifide legally. Sharp lawers will always fined lopholes. It's the fact that it happens so often and so blatantly that it shows a disregaurd for other nations cultures and is insensitive to their feelings as they watch what was once theirs and what they loved and were so proud get swallowed up by Hollywood given a glossy American make over and sold back to them. Hollywood is loved the world over, it turns out fantastic films, but every month Brits, Europeans, Japanese or somesuch culture reads that Hollywood is going to make one of their much loved books, legends, history tales into a Hollywood movie and a cry of despear goes up 'no! not that can't they leave anything alone'. Story's that had nothing to do with America suddenly have an American protagonist, the location is changed to a convenient American location and all the terminology is made American friendly, God forbit Americans might have to look something up. The storys are sanitised and anything thought unamerican omitted. America is full of it's own culture and that's what Hollywood portrays best; very rarely when it does other countrys culture does it get it right and all to often it destroys that which it trys to imitate. Compare original Japanese films with Hollywood remakes. They are copied almost frame by frame, the Hollywood version is easier to watch if you don't speak Japanese but it loses the atmosphere the flavour of the original and it goes without saying the locations and the characters are Americanised. Could go on about French Art House, Ealing Comedys, Dickins Novels, and so on. All butcher when remade by Hollywood and there's no reason for them to do it American culture is so large and varied it's got enough of it's own, leave other countries culture to the country of origin. Tex Bit over arrogant there AZRYAN; just like a Bully, when they find out they've inadvertently upset someone instead of apologizing they get angry and abusive at the person they've upset. Proved the point Americans are insensitive to the feeling of others haven't you. BB I went to dinner with a British friend -- in Jersey City, NJ -- and he indeed got annoyed when the waitress took my plate away before he was finished. I was totally fine with it!! I actually don't like having a messy plate in front of me after I'm done eating -- it grosses me out. haha. I thought he was being over-sensitive and/or trying to impress me with his gentlemanners but I guess it's a British thing! Brit... What I don't understand is where do Americans get the idea that us Brit's have worse teeth than you? You have a substantially greater selection of sweets (candy) and fizzy drinks (soda) than us. And as far as I'm aware you have to pay for dental treatment, whereas we have a NHS (National Health Service). So if anyone should have worse teeth it'd be americans Tex It's not that the average man in the street weather he be Bristish or American as better dental health than his counter in the other country. No if anything Brits have slightly better access to dental care but not significantly more. What Americans are refering to when they claim to have better teeth than the British is the extent American celebraties go to, to have their teeth straightened, whitened, laminated, filed flat and even; till their smile looks like a grand piano with the lid open. Were as Brits are content with healthy teeth the way nature intended. Ivory not ceramic white, each tooth the length nature intended it to be in relation to it's neighbours not all filed the same length like piano keys. American audiences see their celebs plastic white smiles and think 'Ho what perfect teeth!' then they see British celebs, who've probility had as much dental care spent on their teeth but their teeth are more natural, they think, because they don't look so artificial, there not as good and therefore Brits don't care about their teeth. Brit... Well all that says to me is that more American's than Brits care more about being plastic and fake than finding happiness within themselves. It seems retarded (imo) that people spend so much time and money on becoming more ""perfect"" just because famous people look that way. Wanting to be like someone else is so uninventive. I couldn't live in a country where being popular because you look good is important. You should want to be popular because your a good, genuine person. mary I think it has to do with flouridated water In the US almost all tap water has had flouride added into it as preventative dental health measure This didn't happen with much testing on the government's part over how safe it is to actually ingest flouride regularly (recent reports indicate that it might be very bad for you indeed) From what I can tell, the ""potentially very bad for you indeed"" part is what has kept similar measures from being implemented in the UK (although I could be wrong) Anyway, while it is probably a poisonous carcinogen that is lowering the IQs of all well-hydrated American children, drinking flouridated water DOES have noticeable, statistically positive affects on dental health Frank What gets me about the English (the Scots don't do this) is their puzzling attitude to the letter R. They only pronounce it when it's not there e.g. ""Indiar is a malariar arear."" And who can cure malariar? A doctah. Tex They're don't pronouncing a none excistant r it's just the way well spoken people tail of the A when it comes at the end of the word so that it drifts into the next word make for a more melodic speech and not the hard fractured grunts of the uneducated. RyanH ""Remembering to remove 'u's from words like ""colour"" and replace ""s""s with a more abrasive ""z"" is a headache and I resent it."" At least you don't have to ""rezent"" it... ruby I am an American and I was afraid the 10 things would/could be much worse than those listed here. I am quite guilty of #1 ~ I do love your accents (most of the time ). Frankly, I don't know anyone who uses the words ""panties"" or ""fanny"". AZryan You love their accent. That part's fine, but do you actually tell people with a British accent that you love it? That's her 'complaint'. She's complaining about being complimented too much. That and being asked to talk to someone's kid so they develop the same accent, which you have to admit, is neither something that has often happened to this lady, nor something that most Americans do. ruby AZRYAN...Yes I do love their accents, and yes I believe I just told someone with one, that I love it by commenting on her post. I hope she's not too annoyed by it...... Dustin Well, first off, I must say that some of the comments on here are absolutely ridiculous. Clearly some people just can't differentiate between malice and dislike. I'm from the mid-south region of U.S.A and I've only recently taken such an interest in life outside our country. If I'm honest, it saddens me that we don't have a better understanding of one-another (speaking solely in regard to general public opinion and education). For the record, your accent is much more pleasing to the ears. R. Spencer Robinson Sorry if this is a duplicate. I didn't read all of the comments. With respect to #9, we did elect a socialist. His name is Barack Obama. And what's wrong with attempting to pronounce French words as the French do? I know our efforts will never satisfy the French, but I didn't expect Brits to call us on it. AZryan Only an idiot would think Obama's a Socialist. The most socialistic thing he did was to save the US car companies to save American jobs when the global economy imploded. How horrible!! And then he made them private companies again as fast as possible, because he never wanted them government run in the first place. You probably also think that 'Obamacare' is a government takeover of healthcare...when it's still 100% private insurance. It just makes everyone take responsibility for themselves and get affordable health insurance. Again, how horrible!! It was the REP plan when Clinton was President, and it's identical to Romneycare. Do you prefer moochers without insurance abusing emergency rooms? It was a GOP plan until it passed under Obama (who didn't write it). I hope you never collect Social Security or use a library (but I can tell you don't). You wouldn't want to be a fool or a hypocrite would you?? Do you hate NASA and the US highway system too?? AZryan I was expecting this list to be at least somewhat clever and/or amusing, but it wasn't either one. 1- Saying ""I love your accent!"" I could totally agree to this being annoying to hear over and over again, except then you didn't really say that was your actual 'point'. Also, people are complimenting you, so it's even more annoying to hear someone complain about being complimented. ""I hate everyone telling me how pretty I am!!"" ok. 2- Putting last names first. This one just seems shallow. You mentioned Smith and Anderson, but are you equally annoyed by names derived from other Countries? Do you even notice those? Do you hate that NEW York is named after old York? Does the most important city on Earth insult you with its name? Again, it's annoying to hear someone complain about Americans being influenced by British culture and some Brit, who isn't responsible for any of that culture herself, taking offense over it. If anything, just the fact of a rare/peculiar name being off-putting is the only real point you could make here, and that's more to do with your close-mindedness, than a American vs. British thing. 3- They take your plate away too soon I think it's FAR more a matter of what restaurant you're actually at, than an American/British difference. You also noted that you finish eating 'long' before everyone else, so maybe slow the hell down? The British aren't known for their cuisine, nor their refined eating habits, so maybe avoid blaming that on all of America? Also, why do you prefer to sit there with your plate of food scraps in front of you for some mental reason?? 5- Their over-zealous patriotism Yeah, I hate this too. Extreme Nationalism, Fascism, religion and xenophobic fear are all tied up together here. But guess where we got it from? I'll give you a hint...it's somewhere that still has a bloodline-flowing Monarchy, a National Church, and had a great big, world-spanning Empire where they liked to throw their flags up on everything all over the entire planet. And it rhymes with 'Shmitian'. 6- They treat their pets like people This one's silly. These people are goofy, but is this really unique to America? Maybe it is. It takes a wealthy nation to pull this off, but they're literally replacing having too many damn kids (in a world where that's a big problem) with taking care of pets. You'd have made a better point along these lines against America's obesity epidemic, though Britain has plenty of fat people too, and isn't any great symbol of health. 7- Insisting that turkey is tasty Hard to ignore your ignorance of Turkey being culturally important to America. From Thanksgiving Day and Ben Franklin suggesting it be our national bird. Also is the fact that turkey 'can' taste great if you cook it right, much healthier than beef or pork, and again...the British are known for having the worst cuisine of the industrialized world, so it might've been better to just avoid any talk of food. 8 & 9- Spelling words the wrong way and Pretentious pronunciation. These are both 'highly' debatable. You complain about us not pronouncing the 'h' in 'herb', after complaining that we don't 'add' a pointless 'u' to other words?? Please pick only 'one' side of an argument. You can't have both. We pronounce 'Z' 'zee', and you pronounce it 'zehd'. Being honest, which 'actually' seems more logical to you? The one that adds a pointless 'd' sound? Your other point about us replacing 's' with 'z' in words, is just a matter of creativity. Most often related to 'fun junk for kids'. That's just sort of knocking America for being innovative and creative. For trying something unconventional. The 'z' is largely useless, so we're making better use of it than you are. That's how 'progress' is made, and why America vastly overtook Britain in that regard long ago. You say 'fillet' should be 'fill-it', not 'fill-ay', because we're not French? Well, we're not British either. And we don't actually ever pronounce these words as if we're 'putting on airs' or trying to 'be fancy', so it's as silly as us telling you that you're being pretentious to add letters and syllables to say 'Al-u-min-i-um' or adding a useless 'u' to words that are better off without them. This actually shows far more how we do a lot of things slightly differently, yet all along the exact same lines of reasoning...or lack-there-of. Which also leads right to... 10- Saying ""panties,"" ""fanny"" and ""bangs"" Panties is a silly word, but knickers is every bit as silly. You can't possibly believe it sounds more 'mature/proper'? Also, you'll rarely ever hear an American say 'fanny' for any reason, and what the British use it for is not terribly defensible. Again...we have different slang/synonyms. Your annoyance at it didn't come off as comical, or clever, and we have just as much justification to make the exact same complaints (but we shouldn't). Some of our words are better, some are worse, and the same for you. 'Bonnet' and 'boot' are sillier than 'hood' and 'trunk'. If we added them all up, I wonder which Country would actually come out looking better? My guess is that it'd basically be a draw. Sandy I live in America and I loved this article! Especially #5: Overly zealous patriotism. I liked how you brought reality to this by saying, in essence, that it's ok to be glad that you were born in the country you live in, but to act as if there is some sort of pride as if you accomplished something IS absurd! When I hear people go on and on about how ""this is the best counrty in the world"", I roll my eyes and asked how many other countries they've lived in. It just seems immature as if they are speaking about high school rivalries. Tyler American..and had a good laugh..thanks ...I can laugh at everything on the list! Can appreciate why most of it is annoying ""Insisting that turkey is tasty"", ""They take your plate away too soon"", ""They treat their pets like people"" ....funny stuff Jelene As a true Anglophile, I love everything about England and her people. I adored reading this list, you really nailed Ruth, well done! Without question there were some VERY snarky comments from some of my fellow Yanks and for that, I appologize, we're not all like that, perhaps they shouldn't care enough to read your papers or watch your shows! (I guess they can't help themselves because your stuff is SO much better than ours!) I love the differences between our two countries, they are so vast and varied that it keeps me going back to England time and time again. Our world is becoming so homogenized that I celebrate in our cultural differences, it's what keeps travel so interesting. With everyones borders opening up like they are, we are losing the very things that seperate ourselves from each other. I perish the thought of America speaking Spanish AND English, we're America, we speak American English and that's what people expect when they come here. When I travel to France I expect to try and speak and listen in French, I prefer it that way since I paid all the money to fly over there and experience all that IS France. I say we all remain culturally true to ourselves, stop lambasting each other and our differnece and instead celebrate them, what good would travel be if we were all exactly the same? Cheers, from a true and hopeless Anglo & Francophile! Bob Sevenoaks I lived in Sevenoaks for a couple of years and thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the UK. A couple of thoughts on the article: 1. Thank you -- UK -- for the relationship our nations enjoy, and the hospitality whenever I've been in the UK. 2. I'm not a fan of turkey either, but you should really try it deep fried. It's the only tasty way. 3. I'm okay with the ""u"" thing except for ALUMIUM. I just can't pronounce it. 4. The only British-English problem I have is adding ""st"" at the end of perfectly fine words. (amongst) 5. Once in England an American trainer for our company came over to teach the Yorkshiremen how to use a new computer system. She told them she was there to ""teach them how to toss""... It brought the house down...:) 6. I'm originally from Chicago and live in Wisconsin with my Dallas-born wife. We've lived in the north for over ten years and her southern accent STILL gets comments from the locals. So, don't think you're alone on that one. What's kind of aggravating is that some ""northern"" Americans have to ask her to repeat herself cause they don't understand her... 7. When I was a kid, I NEVER thought Id have one brother-in-law named Bubba, and another that's a NASCAR fan... Take care, (oops, unnecessary cheer, sorry) Bob Sevenoaks GEEZ, I can't even spell ALUMINIUM... Gary I'm an American, who lives in Michigan. I think this list is hillarious and I agree with many of the things on the list! (It's all in good cheer -- or at least it should be)! I miss the days when American culture leaned more towards Britain & Canada; now it's just a race to see what record company can exploit & profit from our most dismal inner cities -- (no education; a cultural cesspool). Unfortunatly, this is smeared all over the world now...So truly sorry for the infestation! Jumping Wolf I don't believe this Brit has visited America in about ten or twelve years. 10 Things Brit Do to Drive Anyone Crazy 1) Foul breath. Teeth for that matter. 2) Constantly talking like they got gum in their mouth. 3) Not being able spell just about anything. 4) Purposely trying to sound as British as possible. Words. Accents! 5) Every local or so trying to be punk. 6) Claiming to be best? Ever heard of Euro rivalry? Every European country things they are better than the other. 7) Never smiling. I understand why, but it's quite a problem. Often depressing. 8) Always fighting over money. 9) Music stays the same. It's like going back in time. Not that British music isn't good. It's just too old and repetitive. 10) They're not funny. Trying too much to be witty to the point where they sound boring (however, they are funny to each other for some reason; British pride?). Their cleverness is overestimated. I loved this piece. It's fascinating to me how many different phrases we use. I love figuring out what a British term means. I watch LAW & ORDER:UK and enjoy getting meaning from context. I guess my fascination and study of Britain began with the Beatles. England was SO much cooler than America. As for the flag...well, that's how we are; and proud of it. Which, I remember, leads us to another thing the British don't like about us-our pride at being Americans. No apology there. But, I love Britain and enjoy discussions. We're more alike than different. In the entire world, Britain is our best friend. Glad there's no grudge held from 1776. I think there is a great link between British language and Southerners in the US. I have a friend in Cornwall; I love to hear her talk,and she loves to hear me talk. Robert Having pride in ones country is one thing. There's nothing wrong with that. One should be prood of your home. If your not there's something wrong. It's just the way Americans, when they do venture outside of the USA and visit other countrys they keep going on about how it's done back in America and how everything is so much better back home, the cars are bigger, the buildings taller, the streets are wider, this is so much cheeper but that's so much dearer. Back in the States we have this, Ho! do you have that here yet? Their like spoilt kids at a Birthday Party trying to sound superior and put the other kids Presents down. An you know what when you go round to that spoilt kids house his stuffs no better or no worse and any other kids on the block. York Tipping. Why are Brits such poor tipper's? It could be because they're tight. I somecases that maybe true but not in most. It's because they don't know how. What's hard about slipping a waiter a gratuity as an appreciation of good service? Nothing but howmuch is enough, how much is tomuch, is over tipping good or insulting. America as a culture of tipping and service staff become to rely on it to subsidize poor wages. Brits get that. But who's the ones that rely on tips and who gets paid well? In Britain you only tip in upper class establishments, ie you wouldn't tip in a greasy spoon (Dinner) whereas in restaurant you would. But some restaurant have a service charge ie the tips in the bill. Some places you tip your waiter and it's theirs to keep, other places it as to be past on to the establishment some of whom keep it and some pool it and divide equally between all the staff. It's bad enough trying to work out what system is in use back home in Britain. It's a nightmare when you go abroad, so you give up worrying about it and hope it'll become clear before you've upset to many service staff. In the war service man were shipped from country to country and when they did they were each given a little book telling them what to expect and more importantly what was expected of them when they got to which ever country it was they being station Carol Kayye I cannot believe everyone takes these comments so seriously. Recipes given for cooking turkey!! get real everyone who gives a d**n. Its all just a good laugh at life and differences and thank goodness for them or we would all be like the Stepford wives Bev I agree Carol, I mean what is this? Nursery School? Anger management comes to mind and I always wonder when seeing something like this whether people would be so rude when actually faced with a real person rather than typing anonymously. ANTONIO After going to Oxford U for my degree in law, most of these are understandable, except for one. As an American and a pet owner, I have on occasion treated my dog as human, but my dog never came with me on my honeymoon like Queen Elizabeth II. So just maybe the Brits are guilty of this too. MAC Hmmm.....I guess this does point out the fact that some Americans do not posess the ability to laugh at themselves. Being born and raised in the mid-west, I found this article very FUNNY and I actually chuckled out loud at a few of the items. I've been to England and found the folks there to be very kind and yes, a bit more reserved than we Americans. I fell in love with the place and the people to put it frankly. We all need laugh at ourselves a bit more and stop taking everything so seriously. Life is much more fun this way. To put it in ""American"" speak, LIGHTEN UP! Gwen As an American and an Anglophile, even I would like to add that pronouncing 'herb' as 'erb' or 'fillet' as 'fillay' is in no way pretentious; it is our dialect. I don't understand why everyone is having a fit on the pronounciation of 'herb' when it is in no way an exception. Is 'hour,' 'honest,' or 'honour' pronounced with an 'h'? The things we choose to nitpick are rather trivial and completely subjective. Even within the UK it can't be claimed that all dialects pronounce things in the same manner. Lizzy Hi, my name is Lizzy. I am 'American.' I lived in England when I was two, and then all over the world until five years ago when I moved back to the States. I love England... always have... as well as America, in that patriotic way. 1) I do like the way you speak. Is that bad? But I also find it dreadfully annoying when girls at my school tell the German exchange students to 'say something.' 2) I'll tell Anderson not to get his feelings hurt when he goes to England and everybody laughs at him, which, in your terms, is what will happen right? 3) I've never noticed this. But what's wrong with a clean table? 4) The first thing I would notice when I came Stateside as a kid, was that complete strangers would talk to you, in the friendliest fashion too. I loved it. Who doesn't like friendly people? Perhaps Ebenezer Scrooge? But on the other side, I have heard of foreigners, from the Middle East for example, talk about how they feel like they can't trust Americans because they throw their smiles everywhere. One never knows the measure of sincerity in a person's friendliness. And that makes sense -- if you look at it from that cultural perspective. But as an American I'm used to this attitude, and can tell the difference between fakeness and real friendship. So it's all just culture. Nothing to bicker about. 5) Patriotism is creepy? Please explain. 6) I love my dog to no end. When I look at him, I don't see a dog, I see Boomer (We got him in England. He's lived in Cyprus and Istanbul, Turkey since then). But at the same time, I know he's a dog, and a human life will always be more important. This does get to me in America: when people spend several thousands of dollars (just the tip of the ice-berg) on a dog or other pet, while there are very real issues of poverty and hunger in the rest of the world. So I agree with you. And I feel endlessly sorry for those small yappy dogs that are paraded around like clowns. But at least they're loved you know? 7) Turkey, with a generous glob of cranberry sauce... Mmm. Wash that down with elderflower cordial and seltzer water = happiness in your tummy. 8) I see you derive your humour from exaggeration. But I also prefer the traditional 'u,' and I don't resent us. So there. 9) I don't say 'erb. Never have. It's herb. I have never heard a person here say fillet without the 't.' That would make singing Life's A Happy Song rather difficult. ""Life's a fille' o' fish..."" no that doesn't work. 10) No comment. As funny and light-hearted as this article was intended, it ineludibly puts both our countries into boxes. People aren't meant to live in boxes. Otherwise we would all either feel the way you do, or the way the profane troll, otherwise known as 'England Blows Balls' does. Wouldn't that be simply unpleasant? There's plenty of Americans that annoy me to pieces, and plenty that I love to death. There will always be those who don't do anything to help those embarrassing stereotypes, but that's true on both sides. We all have quirks. It's your choice if they drive you nuts. Just don't put all Americans under that umbrella. In conclusion, I still love England. Congrats to the Queen on her Diamond Jubilee! Chris It's true. In America, English accents will get you places. We think it makes them sound smarter, and you should use it to your advantage. Of course, you'll get a few diabetic morons telling you ""we beat you in 1776, guhuh"". They think they personally fought in every American war since the Revolution, just smile and nod. They'll be dead soon. Chris ow did i get a soccer ball avatar? lol George Yer and that's the biggest myth of all. The rebels did not win the revolution. The American colonies were given independence because the British Prime Minister over slept. Parliament was devided fairly equally between the government who wanted to maintain the Empire and the opposition who wanted to get back to trading with the colonies and making money. There was going to be a vote as to: Keep fighting till the revolutionaries were defeated or End hostilaties and return to trading. The vote was one of the first on the agenda that day and the Prime Minister over slept and missed the vote and the opposition won the ballot by a small majority, thus giving the American colonies independance by default, but had the Prime Minister made it to the House he could have rounded up abstentionist and swung the vote the other way; the war would have continued and reinforcesments and supplies would have been sent. Who knows what the outcome would have been then. It was coincidental that the rebels won a major battle before word reached America that Hostilaties were to cease. The outcome of the battle had no bearing on the decision it had already been decided. John Well, speaking from an American point of view I have to say a few on the list I have never experienced...ever. On the flip-side I do love turkey in all its forms at any time of the year. Turkey burgers a fav. Have no idea why you insist on adding a ""u"" to color. Using a last name first is news to me. Now, I must say your accents are very interesting and I am sure you might agree all the accents here in America are interesting as well. Many restaurants do grab your plate away too soon, but we speak up and tell an over zealous waiter to leave it. Not once in all my days has anyone said anything close to ""You have been an awesome customer today"" so you must have found someone way out there. People do treat their pets like people, but I think that is something you will find in the UK as well. Come on....be honest. As for the erb/herb or fillet with or without the ""T"" it is simply the right way of saying the words. Consult your dictionary. Well aside from all the differences American's do hold a sincere affection for the those in the UK. We are close relations no matter what. I have yet to travel to the UK, but when I do I am sure I will have a lot of questions as well. One is the usage of crisps when the world knows they are chips and your chips are french fries. Sooo odd. lol Lisa I'm guilty, i LOVE the English accent. wish i had one. Midwestern Yankee The Brits are right. Turkey is a dry, stringy meat. There's much better meals with beef and pork. . . I have to admit, I am one of those people who love the British accent and usually tell them when I meet them. I will refrain in the future. John If your Turkey is dry and stringy you need to have it cooked right. Never had it dry or stringy. Love proper turkey! Surrey to Midwestern Yankee -- don't stop. I've lived here 20 years and still like having my English accent complimented! mario antoinette well , we're actually completly different cultureswho happen to share a language. Worse thing about america? Never ending, soul crushing, car dependant, culture free suburbs where the only thing to do is go to a Mall. Theres a reason why they are the way they are you know. mario antoinette Pretty clear Americans dont know their own history. The reasons for the differences in pronounciation are simple. English was the adopted language, but the incomers were from various places. Germany, France etc. Some 'foriegn' pronunciations became commonplace olly Hilarious thread this. Americans have no real sense of humour. The article was tongue in cheek but you take your country far too seriously. Thanks for reminding me why I'll never bother to go to the US. Zzzzzzzzzzzz On a day when I love everything British, Im sad that I have to comment on a devisive topic, but I do want to say that Brits do not understand that there is English and there is American English. We do not say H-erb any more than we say H-onor. Many words beginning with an H in the US do not sound the H. This reminds me of someone complaining because Americans do not say Al-u-MIN-e-um when we speak of the metal. Thats because our spelling does not have an i in the last syllable. Aluminum. As far as ""panties,"" I prefer to say ""underwear"" but ""knickers"" over here means a short pant worn by little boys or giant blowsy long underpants worn by our great-great grandmothers.We have a tremendous number of different words, pronunciations and spellings for the same thing here in the states, because we are a melting pot. I have a very strong British history in my family and am from the South. We still call the mid-day meal ""dinner"" and the evening meal ""supper"", something that drives a lot of my friends crazy and leads to a lot of missed meal dates. So it really is not our choice in the matter -- we have grown to be different from Britain and even different from each other. But its neither pretentious or an affectation. Its merely different. Brittney Jesus. Is it really necessary for everyone to become so bent out of shape about these things. We should be able to laugh at ourselves as Americans. I think we can all agree that there is plenty wrong with our country. Perhaps if people from the U.S. didn't take themselves so seriously, people from other countries would respect us more. Wow... British people are the nastiest people I've ever met on the internet. Wow. You guys are just plain mean. Tex Only inresponce to the nasty thing some of the Americas are saying. Hunter I honestly don't see why it is a problem that Americans and British pronounce and spell words differently. Really, nobody should have a problem with it. This article does make a good point about patriotism, though. Seriously, America. Get over yourself. Shayrul I laughed through the whole piece. I actually thought it was going to be a lot worse than this. The funny thing is some of the comments are things my Brit friends and I laugh and joke with each other about all the time. So I've started using an extra ""u"" here and there and my best Brit friend now says he's going to the ""store"" instead of the ""shop."" So it works out. I would like to say that, here in Georgia, we know the answer to dry turkey is, of course, gravy. Alec Vive La Difference I say. I'm an Englishman who has lived in the USA for over ten years. Life would be very dull if we all acted and spoke the same way. Let's celebrate our differences and focus on the real problems in the world. Poverty, starvation and war are way higher on my list of things to fix. jsky2 I hadnt planned to spend my evening reading the whole blog comments, yet how entertaining they all were. I love English tv comedies which are funny unlike most American ones. Also, most of the series (dramatic ones) on BBC America or on PBS are so well written that few of ours can compare. I am an American but we have our faults as many have pointed out here. I have lived in Japan and recently in Australia. If one wishes to see patriotism just look at both of these cultures. It is to appreciate what we have while also giving others the respect they deserve for how they live. Viva la differences all unique and yet the same. BTW why is BBC cancelling MI5??? I love it even searching most times on either BBC America or PBS or A&E to find it. GRRR for its loss. Nemi27 I'm surprised by how sensitive and sour most people are who've commented on this article. I found it hilarious and true (the neg. extreme things in America). As an American my favorite thing about traveling in Europe is being left alone to enjoy my meal or coffee! (Not every American appreciates or even likes some coddling waiter, hostess, etc. pretending to care). But, many of you are way too sensitive! Seriously! Who cares what some silly fool says -- it simply suggests their overall ignorance regarding many, many things. You do your self a favor by not reacting -- it's like the toddler throwing a fit (look away and don't feed into it!). The best thing about England: comedy, sci-fi, novels/writers, tea and crumpets! I find the humor witter and more refined than typical American fart jokes. Overall, though I'm open minded and can appreciate differences everywhere -- which is why I love to travel. As far as all the language comments on this site, no matter how ""pure"" we all like to pretend our language is or isn't, there is simply no such thing -- there is only the socially perceived ""correct"" way to speak/write/spell.... Language continuously changes (syntax, phonology, spelling, semantics, etc.) based on historical, political, economic, etc. factors... no need to fight over that! But, it is fun to talk about why these differences may have developed. Britanie Well reading all of the comments was entertaining. Anyway... I'm American and I always pronounced herb with an ""h"" until one day I moved to a different state and people started making fun of me for saying it that way. So maybe it is a regional thing? matt vodka coke? tripe? saying bullocks? calling a person a cunt? gross... and yea, fanny is not camel-toe here... AND! we pronounce things french because LaFayette helped us kick your ass and France owned most of this continent until 1825. There is no Queen on our (single-colored {no ""u"" because I'm not union-jack}) bills Statue of Liberty=french guy.... Stonehenge=english neanderthals... find a purpose. YORK Hey Matt. Run off with an Englishman did she? Know why the French gave you the Statue of Liberty? The Europeans couldn't stand seeing that stupid giant Elephant everytime they sailed into New York Harbour so they got togeather and France was choosen to give you something more tastefull to go in its stead. Jon I'm not sure where this author is in America, but last I checked there were 50 states here and as many if not more accents from each one. If this author is eating in what they call "" trendy "" restaurants, then the blitzkrieg service is to let the next wave of poseurs in ( see added the flaming U for you ). Until we start having the dog and pony show that the Brits have in a leader being the chosen from other politicians and we bow to inbred millionaires who think they rule, then we will just be the annoying country that the author loves living in. It wasn't until Teddy Roosevelt Americanized our language that we would still sound like Brits and all their territorial peeps. As for food, we might have lots of fast food here but it is at least palatable. You have us on rugby and football, we have you on style and pop culture enjoy. Louise If its a reason why us British people hate you Americans its because you're forever steryotyping us! 1. Yes we do have dentist. In fact, most Brits have strangly white teeth. 2.No we don't speak like posh gits from the 18th century. We tend to speak all ""yea man"" and ""cool bro"". 3. No, most of us hate ""Tea"" and ""Crumpets"". Mind you, we have a lot of multi-culrtral resturants, Chinese food for instance. This blog post is baiscly a smack back on the arse for America, if you can steryotype us, why can't we steryotype you?! P.s: Notice im not speaking like ""Your comments are truley appalling, the weather is dear to day"" ... Because us British don't speak like that!!!!!! Spazzticaunt Yup, and you just clumped every American up with the hoodlums that are being disrespectful on this forum. As an American I find that just as annoying as you find them clumping all of you British folks up. I think of our two countries in this light. Sibling rivalry plain and simple. Its a tit for tat thing since the beginning. And don't say it isn't cause you know as well as I do it is just that simple. tony I'm a huge fan of top gear and have never had a problem with any Britts and want to visit, but why all the cheap shots against the Usa? tony Many things have taken place since the revolutionary war, but the world would be so different if we never worked together. Spazzticaunt What bothers me as an American is that the writer to this article must be in the wrong America because in the America I live in all that stuff is considered freakishly weird. except for putting a flag out on memorial day in honor of our vets and on fourth of July in honor of the birth of our constitution. He/She is right of course about the difference between pride and emotion. For example I love my country and I am proud of our service men and women but not so much the rest of the mess. I also think that treating your dog as a human is slightly odd. I love my dog and yes I have a sweater for him but he's such a small guy and gets so freezing cold during the winter that if he don't have something on he can't do his do, if you get my meaning. The issue of spelling words, well that is usually only used in text messages and on the internet. Otherwise if they are using that spelling they are just too lazy to spell the entire word out. And yes as an American it drives me batty when folks use numbers where letters should be. I don't think the English accent is ""sexy"" or ""cute"" to be honest, It makes me think of snooty rich people. (sorry but it does.) While it is true that American's have developed their own ""English"" I guess you could say, All of us American's have fun with that fact and can laugh at ourselves. Hence the redneck jokes. American's have never claimed to be perfect in any way, shape, or form, but we enjoy walking to the beat of a different drum. ZUmber You're mistaking the English accent of probably the home counties. As a Geordie (someone from Newcastle upon Tyne) you'd not understand me. Daniel just because we took the 'u's out of out words doesn't make us stupid. it just means there's no 'u's there, that's no reason to be mad. and i agree some people do take having a pet too seriously. i treat my pets as friends and i count them as part of my family, but im not going to dress it up and give it a seat at the dinner table. Is there anything wrong with that? and allot of people aren't over patriotic normally that people who have lost friends or family in the army, or other people who had weird backwards patriotic war hero parents. so its not just random patriotism (usually). Is there anything wrong with that? Nathan To begin with, I'm Scottish. I guess i consider the way i speak ""Scots"" and not English as such because it's such a broad dialect however when I write I intend to write in ""proper"" English, correct grammar etc. I think also everyone on this post needs to calm the fuck down, I don't personally have a problem with American grammar and the people and I don't find the whole ""shop attendant being nice"" thing overbearing but actually quite refreshing in comparison with shop attendants (etc.) here who always seem depressed. However when American spellings/grammar starts to infect my own that annoys me, I was taught how to spell things the way they were intended to be spelled from the development of English. The whole turkey thing i think is a slight generalisation (as I typed ""generalisation"" it's marked as the wrong spelling, instead I was suggested to change it to ""generalization"" this annoys me to no end) I personally hate turkey and agree with the author in what she says though i don't think that because it's the staple poultry of two holiday's in America means that everyone HAS to love it. The patriotism thing i understand somewhat as well, I consider myself patriotic and don't consider myself ""British"" but Scottish so I get that sense of pride in your country but I agree that it can be incredibly over-zealous sometimes. Accents too, if an American said to me ""I love your accent!"" i wouldn't be a pretentious dick and tell them where to go, even if I wasn't in the best of moods I'd still thank them regardless as it's the polite thing to do and compliments can be nice, if you feel the sincerity though i think the point that was trying to be made is a lot of the time it feels as if (to use a previous example) Store Attendants will just say nice things because they feel that they're paid to do so, and it's not sincere whatsoever. Qu it's all scripted... store attendants just say what they are told to. they honestly don't care. no caps.. sorry (carpel tunnel) and i LIKE the S.. i understand it.. the z? got me. ZUmber Nathan if you're using FireFox then you need to download the British English language pack and it won't correct you. Keith Okie To the poster with the screen name ""England Blows Balls, Not to put too fine a point on it, but your view of the English language is dimmed by the American propensity for the slaughter of proper communication. At the risk of shaking the foundation of your ""mobile home"" let me explain that English is not ""old"" or ""outdated"", but a flowering, evolving language. Just because you choose to denigrate its natural beauty is no reason for you to call upon the rest of us to abandon the language of Shakespeare. I am a very proud American, but hearing my countrymen speak the way they do is probably the most offensive sound there is outside of dub step and hip hop. Patriotism? Are you kidding american's may fly a flag but they send all our jobs overseas, they give scholarships to athletes and not scholars. The only thing American's seem to care about is how much green is in their pocket. - Spelling? School don't care which spelling you use, we are just to lazy to type an extra letter. - Turkey? Done RIGHT, and often it's not, it's great. Add BUTTER when using ground turkey and don't get 90% lean (to dry). - Accents? We LIKE British accents because some of us have the 'joy' of sounding a bit like the sopranos... did anyone ever say ""hey, that mob boss has a great accent?"" or ""wow, i wish i talked like that girl on jersey shore."" We work hard NOT to sound 'distinct' here in the north... we also like accents southern, californian, canadian, australian, [...] accents (should i continue?) - um... I prefer Knickers or bloomers, or when in jest to a FAMILY member 'dog chew toys'. - dogs? do not go there you soulless beast... says the woman with a doggie stroller and a cute little pair of sheep PJs for her fluffy baby. - flags... ever notice the 1% fly REALLY big flags as they fire Americans and outsource their jobs.. oh and flags are also popular in woods-y areas of the south (though those are often confederate flags).. and they scare us too! - Tea? Milk really? Biscuits I get, YUM... milk... :p - I think American's need to look at the 'euro' and realize that it binds Europe the way the dollar binds States. We are not 1 nation we are 50 independent states bound together by currency. If we were one nation, we would have ONE set of laws, education requirements, and government. .. and let's be honest... Brit TV ROCKS... ttp://www.facebook.com/oghma.gem Oghma Gem I want to agree with you about British TV. Only PBS in America has such quality programming as they make in the UK, which doesn't insult the intelligence or play to the lowest common denominator in viewers. One must have some semblance of a brain to follow the British mysteries; they don't telegraph the ending in the first five minutes, as American shows do. LAKate Aww geez -- flying a flag from your house is creepy? Certainly Brits fly a flag on important national holidays. Re: pets as surrugate kids, I've heard it said that how well you treat your pets is indicative of the level of humanity of the nation. Re: fanny -- somehow fanny sounds more polite than bottom or rear. And aren't Brits ever more polite? I wonder what the Brits have to say about the Aussie differences -- But at the end of the day, our differences are like that touch of curry that is indefinable yet unique. Great job on the Jubilee! LAKate I'm a bit embarrased -- so many of my countrymen, being so rude and mean spirited over funny little article about a f ew of our minor differences -- Such rude arrogance over nothing. And yes I like crumpets and Earl Grey AND bangers and mash. Not real fond of spotted dick though. And BBC America (is it BBC2?) is a great station and I've watched all the Jubilee programming and plan on watching / recording all the Olymic programming as well. As for you rude mean spirited folks -- get a life. Clarissa Yup, completely agree Lakate. In reality, people on both sides of the pond should feel a bit embarrassed. lili where in america are you visting? i wanna live there Clarissa Wow...the vast majority of the people that responded on this thread, both American and Brits, need to take a chill pill...seriously. The article is meant to provoke a bit of banter and conversation, not to start WW 3. Part of those subtle differences is after all, the reason so many Americans flock to Britain(and vice versa) when we want a vacation in a different part of the world that's just that little bit foreign enough to make us feel like we've actually left the country, yet not too foreign that one feels the need to bother learning another language...Conclusion: If ya took offense to the list, I suggest ya grow a thicker skin. If ya really feel that put out by it, don't worry; there was a list published the day after pointing out all the silly things Americans dislike about Britain...that should cool your heels a bit. Amy this is like the third post i've seen telling people to chill, except like three people it's all been pretty civil unless i'm missing a huge hunk of the chat. Mark Daniel Martinez Where are these overly friendly retail workers you speak of? Mark Daniel Martinez Oh, and as far as the dressing up your pets and hanging flags from you house thing goes, that creeps a lot of us out, too. Don't let the comments section fool ya. Betsy who the heck in america says fanny? no one. and turkey is disgusting. and a lot of these situations are kinda extreme and usually never happen, like there are only like 10 people that drive their dogs in strollers. Jeff I like our little quirks and see how thay can get annoying. But nobody really uses the word ""Fanny"", and turkey's not THAT bad. Just like I'm sure England has their different characteristics, we do as well. But all Americans are not the same. I assume the British get there assumptions from movies or television programmes, but that can be deceiving. Believe it or not, but there are some quite down to earth Americans who treat their dogs like pets. P.S.- your accents are kind of cool. Rich i love top gear uk, and dr. who, both are smart funny deeply imaginative and long looking. i dont think that english not flying flags or having different spellings of works is wrong. in america we tend to be pretty far away from people that want to do us harm unlike the UK is, and sometimes i do think the US tends to be a bit overzelous with the patriotism. Cara Found the slight on patriotism a low blow, and I'm not easily offended. I'm very proud of my country because of what it represents and of whom it is comprised. Can one not be proud of one's parents or proud of one's friends or proud of one's high school football team? I may have no part in their achievements, but I celebrate because they are my kin. When I say I am proud of my country, I don't mean that I was born in a hospital in the state of Georgia twenty-one years ago seriously fucking enthuses me, I mean that I have a heritage of men and women who have fought and argued and reasoned and deliberated and achieved great, monumental things in the name of freedom. It is not a history without major, horrific blemish, of course, but in spite of our differences we work as one nation, indivisible. Is that not something to honour, daily? We're not trying to belittle other countries comparatively. We're trying to respect our history, and as we move forward, embrace an American future. If that annoys you, you're welcome to it, but honestly, I think it's one of the most beautiful aspects of this society that I am privileged to be a part of. Skunkfarmer Is this the right room for an argument? KL Ha, ha! Classic! Polly It depends....In the words of Monty Python ""Is this going to be a 5 or 10 minute argument?"" Brian Oh come on, turkey lasagna can be pretty good if done right. Connie Dodson I had a turkey burger. It was pretty good, after I sprinkled it with McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning and built a sandwich with Orowheat Oatnut bread, French's Spicy Brown Mustard and Best Foods (mayonaise) with olive oil. It was better than a hamburger, unless I get a truly great hamburger. I also like my fish and chips with Heinz Malt Vinegar. I must be cross-cultural. That said: I wanted to buy a sweater on my one and only big vacation that included UK. Everywhere the shop personnel were rude, especially really nice shops. I got all the way back across the Atlantic Ocean before I found out a sweater is a sweatshirt and a jersey is a sweater. Why can't the English speak english? Surrey Heinz... not Sarson's vinegar? You wanted a jumper, not a sweater. Sorry.... read this whole thing. It's hard not to comment I'm sorry you had such a hard time shopping. Maggie Please, people, can't we all just GET ALONG! To the fellow Americans, lighten up! Sure, the article was a bit rude, but get over it! This website is suppose to be fun! To the Brits, lighten up! There are always gonna be people boasting about how thier country is better than all others and, yes, they're gonna make some unfavorable word choices whilst doing it. That is the risk of the internet. Get over it. Sure, there are differences in our two countries. It's bound to happen when our countries have been seperated for over 200 years! We use different words, talk in different ways, and have different cultural priorites. One is not better than the other. They both simply exist. Can't we just celebrate our luck to born into some of the planet's top cultures? To have the resources to change the world or help out friends in need? Yet, instead, we're here bickering over something we have NO control over. Shame on us. Kaitlin I agree with the american nationalism often being a little over the top and the sometimes annoying over-happy employees in stores/restaurants but I dont understand the problems the author is having with our language use. Its just different, its not right or wrong to spell it ""color"" or ""colour"", just simple cultural differences. Most of the article was good until she brought up all this language crap. Arielle ?1. Actually your accent is annoying after about 5 minutes and a bit pretentious. 2. When you stop naming your children IMOGEN and HERMIONE then you can talk. 3. Use your man voice and tell the waiter to go away or is that too impolite for you? 4. It just seems like relentless cheer because you are emotionally stunted aka British. 5. You have a grandma as your ""head of state"" who does nothing but collect your money and demand to be called ""Your Highness."" I wouldn't be patriotic about that either. 6. Pets are people! 7. I have one word for you ""Haggis"". No British person should ever make a criticism about cuisine since in Britain you have none. Just like you can't say baseball is boring because you play cricket; a game who's excitement level is one notch above watching paint dry. 8. There is no ""U"" in color and it's ""organiZed."" Go back home if you want to put unnecessary ""u's"" in words. That is why we fought a revolution. 9. Get rid of that monarchy and actually get a president and then we'll talk. Oh an ""Constitutional Monarchy"" is an oxymoron. 10. Ok not you are just making things up. mary guys stop for a second and with an American accent -- any American accent other than a Southern one, that is -- try saying ""herb"" with an audible H sound It's WEIRD and DIFFICULT and it STICKS IN YOUR MOUTH WEIRD seriously I've tried side note: why do English people pronounce pedestrian PED-estrian, but then say pedophile PEED-ophile YES I WATCH TOO MANY CRIME SHOWS I KNOW but seriously why ttp://www.facebook.com/oghma.gem Oghma Gem Mary, I think it is because PED-estrian and PAED-ophile (original spelling? also PAEDiatrician) come from two different root words. PED=foot. PAED=child. Dekorume As an American (born in Texas, raised in California), I have heard many times that I have an accent. One of the fun things about living here is that we do have so many different ""versions"" of the same language. I agree with the article's author about elevators. Let the first floor be indicated by the number ""1?. ""G"" used to be for the garage level, now it is used to represent the ""G""round level floor. ""M"" is for ""M""ezzanine, talk about pretentious. We Americans can be prideful and arrogant, we look at what has been accomplished in our brief 236 year history and the influence we have had on the rest of the world (admittedly some good and some not-so-good) and like an insecure teenager (which in the historical scheme of countries, we are), we want others to recognize our accomplishments as well. Surrey Having returned to these comments and read every one... I have to leave one final (maybe...) comment. In spite of their similarities, England (and the UK) and the USA are foreign countries to each other. There are many differences; in language, culture, education, history, heritage, and ethnicity. I think , perhaps, that we are so surprised by the unexpected differences and inconsistencies, that we overreact. People blame the entire country for the foibles of a few, and because their tastes differ. If we travelled (yes, two Ls) to Egypt, for example, we would expect to see many things we're not accustomed to -- food, dress, habits, behaviour, table manners, etc, etc. We know we're in a foreign country so we accept these deifference with good grace (or we should), and go with the flow. We may complain about the toilets, or the fear of getting diarrheoa from the food, but we'll cope. ( take Lomotil... trust me on this ). We expect (in our arrogance) that most people will understand and speak ""English"", and become irritated when we can't make ourselves understood. We try, hopefully, to say a few words in the native language, which the locals may laugh about, but they love us for anyway. In other words, we know we're on foreign territory so we adapt. It's much more fun that way! We learn about the world. We make new friends. We expand out horizons. So, why should we expect that visiting the USA -- for Brits, or the UK -- for Americans, will not be a foreign experince? Both nations are melting pots of various civilisations and cultures, all meshed together to produce what we have now; and constantly evolving! They are separate. They are different! They are not, never have been, nor ever will be, the same! Accept those differences . We're all foreigners to each other! We talk differently. We eat differently. We dress, move, drive, work, etc... differently! I'm English, with an American passport. I've lived here with my American husband for 20 years. My children are American, but can speak with an English accent when they choose. My home is here, yet I still refer to my childhood home as ""home"". I go ""home"" for holidays when I can. I love a lot about my new home country, and still miss my old home a great deal. I've adapted. Yet sometimes I still feel like a foreigner here, and strangely, also in England! Hi, fellow humans. I came to Britain once, in 1973. Did some Clear Light at Stonehenge when people could picnic in the shade of the stones, did Windowpane at the old Alley Palley when Uriah Heep played, oh, yeah, Windowpane laid out all night in Russel Square listening to the night sounds of London, traded two hitchhikers from Brighton some Clear Light for Lebonese hash (they took us to their grandmother's house where we had fried eggs and tomatoes for lunch), all in all pulled some more bricks from the wall (I'm a teacher; we don't brick walls, we smash holes in walls for windows and doors.) Don't know what all ya'll arguing about, don't care. I'm here to say I loved England and thank Brigit for BBC America and Doctor Who. Kristen I was shocked to see how upset some people became just because someone insulted their ancestry in an online forum. This is what the net does to people; it gives them the capacity to be vile and speak their minds with impunity. Who cares what someone thinks about you or your culture? The people with these disgusting ideas about someone different than themselves would NEVER have the nerve to say it to your face. Just let it go and ignore the idiots. Responding to them gives them the fuel to keep going. Regarding the article, which some completely disregard in their comments, I do agree with many of the points the author makes and then some are just downright petty. To comment about someone being nice to you in a retail setting? I have to wonder what you're used to in the UK if politeness is frowned upon when you visit the US. Regardless, I look forward to visiting the UK and seeing how they do differ from the US, and hopefully, enjoying the differences and not feeling we even remotely have to be the same. Amber Just because some of us American's act this way does not mean we all do. We are a very diverse people. I don't care what accent you have as long as I can understand you. The last name thing is kind of dumb sometimes, depending on the name itself. My plate is never taken away too soon and the server will always ask if they can take it first. If you think we're too nice, than you should stay away from Canada, they have even more cheer than us. Yes, we're proud to be American's and I'm not sorry if that's a problem. Yes I treat my cat like a person but I don't push it in a buggy, that's just weird. I'm sorry but I love Turkey, always have. We're not spelling or saying words the wrong way, we just speak and spell a different dialect of English than you. And using words ""panties,"" ""fanny"" and ""bangs"" has to do with our culture, which, obviously, is different than yours. Courtney Brilliant. You summed it all up, perfectly. ttp://www.facebook.com/paul.ellison Paul Ellison Noah Webster created the American english to be different from the english spoken in England. That is why Americans speak, write, and pronounce words different. He took out letters from words to be less french. Colour to Color, ect Deb Chavis This article is completely satirical. Some of it is true. Don't get your panties in a knot. ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=7\\... Thea Allison You mean my knickers? I can only think of how many times I would have been laughed out of a classroom or beat up if I had used the word ""knickers"". In the South, that could sound like an awful unmentionable word! ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=5\\... Lisa Schultz I was going to leave an entire comment myself, but I'll just reply to yours, since you covered most of what I was thinking, with the exception of adding that the origins of the American-English language are (really!) 29% French, 29% Latin, 26% German, 6% Greek, etc. There's a pie-chart on Wikipedia. I'm currently learning French and find it fascinating to see the written word, and the many similarities between our languages. I also watch a lot of British TV online. Between learning French, and watching British TV, I'm discovering there are far more differences (and similarities) than I would have ever imagined! ttp://www.facebook.com/ronna.lester Ronna Sutton Lester You will find Spanish easy to pick up also, since words, not especially the grammar, are similar, sort of. macman1940 I take great delight in the differences between ""Brits"" and ""Yanks"". I enjoy mentally translating ""the boot of the car"" into the ""trunk of the car"", etc. There is room to celebrate our differences as well as our shared values. We all have to deal with shallow culture, paparazzi, and endless election campaigning. Long live the Queen! Courtney Couldn't have said it better! Nancy in North Carolina Absolutely! I love the Brits, for the most part. Our history is mostly their history, after all. We Americans view all the royal family happenings (weddings etc.) with avid interest. We share your joys and your sorrows. It makes me sad some Brits say mean things about us, although some Americans might deserve it. I consider Brits our best friends in the world and hope that, for the most part, they view us that way, too. God bless you guys! ZUmber Well personally I think American's are great for the most part. I think the halfwits (both British and American) need to try each others cultures out a bit more. First, apple pie a la mode, not applepie and ice cream. Second, there is no comparison of The Beach Boys to the Beatles. The Beatles win out every time and I'm not even a fan. Third, Cadillac versus Bentley is another non-comparison. Bentley all the way and I love Cadillacs. Maybe a Jaguar X-Type versus a Cadillac CTS. Fourth, Marilyn Monroe versus Princess Diane. Really? Read this carefully PRINCESS DIANE! Yes, Marilyn Monroe is an icon of beauty but PRINCESS DIANE is and was a historical figure in a power monarch. The rest was ok. Joe What the hell did Princess Di ever do to be historical except Di? The Royal Family is tabloid trash not historical. Amy wow you cannot be serious about this reply. everything you said is stupid. ZUmber The monarchy is not historical? Wow the internet just lowered it's self to a new low. lisa *itself Amy Bentleys are wonderful, but Cadillac has way better style. Honestly all of Europe styles cars wrong, some are fantastic, but American muscle cars just look better. ttp://www.facebook.com/kirsten.jaster Kirsten Jaster I thought it was Princess Diana... Lisa I thought this was very amusing. I am American with a wonderful adopted ""family* that are English. Some stupid Americans try and copy great shows like Top Gear and Being Human. They totally do not get the reason the British version of these shows are better then the American watered down boring versions. Courtney I always find it hilarious that people in England always want to poke fun at Americans, especially when they try to say that we're arrogant. By continually trying to write articles that make fun of us and put yourselves on a pedestal, are you not being arrogant? That's what I thought. Your ""English"" is not perfect either. People in America speak properly, but obviously there's going to be those who don't; same as over there in England. Just get off the high horse already; learn to smile! oregon usa For God's sakes. It's meant to be funny and clever. Anyone who took offense (offence?) at this article is a nit wit. Please go have some Doritos and chill out. Regina The hostility of this article really rubbed me the wrong way. All the points could have been made in a more amusing and less hostile, angry, and insulting way. Most of the points made were ridiculous, but could have been funny if presented with some real comedy. If this were written by an American complaining about annoying British ""things"", it would be just as offensive. I did not find the article to be lighthearted and funny, but cold and truly mean-spirited. While I agreed with some things, the overall tone was too hostile. I'm disappointed that BBCAmerica thought this was appropriate for their website. Lisa This article was a hoot! I can't believe that anyone could be insulted by it. As for the accent thing, I'm a proud Okie and get the same reaction anytime I travel to far east or west of my beloved Oklahoma! I hear,"" I just love your accent"", or"" where did you get that accent."" Hell, it scored me a free meal the last time I was in CA. Rachel *sigh* Why are people making such an enormous deal about this? Here's how I see it, we are two different countries who are actually a lot more similar to each other than most random countries are in comparison to each other. So we fight and get in huge internet arguments about about how much we dislike the cultural and language related differences we have? Really people? Does it matter THAT much that we have different views on patriotism, food and pronunciation? Yes, we got in a war a few hundred years ago, some of you realize that this was centuries before any of us were born, right? It also had very little to do with culture, it was (please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a history Rachel rofessor) mostly about taxes and issues with being a colony controlled from thousands of miles away, and other governmental problems. Why? Just stop fighting about stupid things, okay everyone? And since that won't happen, just please refrain from being to mean. Sincerely, a frustrated teenage American, who accidentally pushed the post button to soon... Robert Knihnicki Your so-called ""Prince"" (He does remind me of a whale), calls the queen ""Mummy"" and you are criticizing (or criticising?) americans? Funny that us New Englander types pronounce the word Aunt the way it is spelled rather than the way the sutheners, who pronounce it ""ant"". Do you have aunts or ants over there? Pip pip tally ho chaps. Answer quickly now or your tea and crumpets may get cold. Some of my best friends are British. Just kidding actually. I only know one, a doctor, a good one who fled your country after medicine was socialized. Dave I grew up as a scally in Liverpool,came to the States in ""77 with a wife and two babies and $300,worked like a dog,somehow got interested in the stock market,made a fortune in the .com era and retired at age 55.Where else in the world could i have done this.This is by far the greatest country in the world and i love it here,you want to stay in England do so but it is only jealousy that makes you rant against it. Nikki Most of the previous comments just emphasise the differences between Britain and America. It's pretty easy to see this article wasn't made as an attack against the American way of life, it's meant to be a joke. The only reason Brits would actually find these things annoying is because it's a break from the norm for us as opposed to everyone moaning all the time and being miserable. I've found from visiting America numerous times that change is a good thing, I'd rather have someone pretend to be nice to me in a shop than scowl at me because they have some kind of attitude problem and clearly don't want to be there. In this way I think Americans are much more polite rather than the stereotypical 'arrogance' that only seems to have manifested for political reasons. There are many things in America that I struggle to understand but Britain is by no measure perfect. We have four countries united that hate each others differences and hold onto old grudges. Scotland voting for their own independent party in the elections was proof enough that they don't want to be governed by England anymore and haven't since Great Britain was formed. The bottom line is, you can point out all the differences in spelling or customs you want but enforcing stereotypes and getting defensive solves nothing. The problem I find with some British people is that when they go abroad they like things to be how they are at home. Ruining parts of European countries is proof enough of this, Benidorm in Spain is the perfect example. Why leave Britain to stay in another version of Britain with warmer weather? Live a little. Experience something new for a change! At the end of the day I don't leave home to stay at home so why should I expect everyone to be the same? Difference is a part of life, you might not always agree with how people do things but it's not your choice so deal with it. I for one can't wait to go on my second visit to New York next month to get out of this dreary city! Duel Citizen As someone who decided to get to know British culture out of sheer curiosity, I love seeing where the stereotypes fade away and have come to realize that in spite of the fact I use a ""z"" in realise, we're a bit more alike than either side may admit. I often wondered why when people wanted to investigate and learn about another culture, why didn't they ever look toward that small island in the North Atlantic that pretty much started just about everything we know? I already had an admiration and appreciation for British history, but there's a lot of really great parts of modern Britain that I think more Americans should know. I chose to peer through the looking glass of popular culture, modern media and politics which ultimately led me to chance upon this article where I felt I needed to chime in because unless you're someone like me who chooses to look deeper, a British person reading the words of a British writer is just going to keep being fed vague propaganda. This is the same silly propaganda that caused an ignorant man in an earlier post to talk about how all English people have bad teeth which caused a big row (pronounced like ""cow"")... Bullshit flows with the tide across a sea of ignorance regardless if it is the size of the Atlantic. 1. Accents Being from Chicago, I have been told I have an accent nearly everywhere I go in my own country. Now since I now live in Scottsdale, Arizona, when I travel back to Chicago and dare call a fizzy drink ""soda"" instead of ""pop"", oh I usually hear about it. On the flipside it does get a little tiresome when you'd just like to get your receipt and leave the store, but after answering about where your accent is from the person feels compelled to tell you about family they have there and sometimes ask if I know them like Chicago is the size of a London flat. I tend to ignore the accent until well into the conversation as I feel is more proper to do so. For one I am sure that person is probably sick of hearing about it and two, probably equally sick of people finding them interesting based on how they sound rather than who they are. 2. Last Name First I can't remember the genesis point for the trend of using last names as first names, but I think it may have taken off or at least been nudged by ""Madison"" from the film Splash. I seem to remember hearing more and more baby names like Mackenzie and such popping up since at least when Splash hit cable. Sometimes the names can be cute and sometimes they can be ""well, I guess that can go either way"", but she did cite the name ""Smith"" which is by far probably the dumbest somewhat ""normal"" last name to give a child. I think the writer probably needs to step back on this one as I don't think this trend started in America and is not a ""typical"" American kind of thing. Names like Brad, Tad, Chet, perhaps... This is just yet another trend that should fall along the same lines as normal people trying to be like nutty celebrities and naming their child something off the wall. I'm personally waiting for Apple Computers to sue Gwyneth Paltrow for copyright infringement and think that people who feel compelled to name their kids something weird for the rest of their lives and aren't a celebrity with the money to pay for therapy are just trying to draw attention to themselves and are shallow people. This is universal and found on both shores. Skipped 3 4. Fake people... I'd like to know how stores and restaurants find these people so we can establish a demographic, round them up and send them to GitMo for a while. The best way to be is ""real""... You'll get more respect and more of a comfort level out of others by being that way. Across the pond, the opposite seems to be the case and I believe it was Rhod Gilbert who put it best when comparing American retail store staff to British and I think I'd prefer the disinterested, distant and otherwise unhelpful person in Britain to someone who is slathering me in bullshit sunshine. 5. Patriotism I guess I have to ask again exactly where this woman was and exactly how much time she spent in this country. For the most part, the only people I've ever seen with a flag constantly on their house is a Veteran, older people and sometimes a police officer here and there. Randomly you get that super American guy that everyone finds a little creepy as well, but not because of a flag on his porch. Oh and the Tea Baggers which are all nuts, so fair enough. Let's also keep in mind that we've got a very large military, they have families and communities and we've been involved in and still have people alive and kicking from WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Shield, Storm and the Bush Oil Wars who love their country, so maybe we're going to have a bit of a bigger patriotic footprint going back decades of armed conflict. For those who aren't military or from those families, there are a great deal who simply like to show their support for those who carry that same flag into battle. As far as the flag on the house comment goes, I think she needs to get around more. I do understand where she is coming from when it comes to the loudmouth ""yee haw I'm an American and I'm the best"" kind of douchebags all other Americans hate. These are the people that unfortunately give Brits the stereotype they use against us if they don't bother to learn beyond the lower common denominator in this country. Unfortunately since our media caters to fools and that's the entertainment often shipped overseas, that's pretty much the heart of this entire posting. Don't let this writer fool you for a second to think that Brits aren't proud of their country and not simply just glad to be born there. I think the British are quite proud of their country and actual, real BBC programming shows this quite a bit. I think the writer actually sells her own country a bit short, makes herself sound smug and as though she doesn't really care about the very country she is using to compare to America to point out our foibles. When not considering the minority the writer is probably only basing her opinion on, I think that a country that can unite themselves regardless of differences including the classes is far better than what she paints the people of Britain out to be in that possibly badly worded entry. The image suggested is a culture that is smug and self-absorbed with their own accomplishments so much that they can't be bothered to use the symbolism of a flag to come to one level saying ""I'm a Barrister from South London and you're a white van man from Manchester, but today we're all simply proud to be British."" I know this isn't true and I don't think this is what she truly meant, but since she chooses to cite a very small portion of American culture, I'm not exactly eager to write for the defense especially since she seems to forget that the same small minority of overzealous nationalists on her side of the Atlantic took to the streets. I think they're more than glad to have been born there and I'll take a fat bloke in a tight ""America the Beautiful"" T-Shirt playing Toby Keith too loud in his Ford pickup over the shutting down of an entire city center so the police can kettle in a bunch of ""glad"" patriots. 6. Pets as People Yeah, this is some kind of American recessive gene, but I think this affliction has roots in another and happens when parents who have children who resent them and told them to piss off. Since Tippy can't say no to being dressed up like a Keebler Elf for a day at the mall and the doggy spa, there you have it. I agree with the part about how you're expected to love the yappy dog because it's small and because the owner thinks the dog is cute and is immune to the incessant noise that this is acceptable. Again, this same affliction is one experienced by parents of bratty or otherwise undisciplined children who think society should accept the bullshit, or worse, take care of the kid for them. I would never hit an animal or a child, but as a proud founder of ""Save a Child -- Punch a Parent"", I can honestly say that it should be legal to smack someone who doesn't have the common decency to train their pet to be good in public or train their spawn to do the same. I do believe that pets should be loved as much as possible, so while it is quite eccentric and a bit silly, as long as it isn't for the wrong reasons and the animal lives a happy life, that dog or cat would probably appreciate it more and love you back a hell of a lot more than some spoiled kid. 7. Turkey Obviously this woman has never had chicken and certainly has not had a properly cooked turkey. While finding a good one might be a gamble, I'd urge her to prance on down to a local Boston Market. Yes I know I will get some people saying ""yeech"" to me on that one, but this observation is so short sighted and seriously must be limited to only a couple occasions. As for the turkey burgers, meatballs and other items, about the only complaint I can say I have from a properly done turkey burger or other item is the need to over season it for the sole reason it was used in the first place. The fat content in beef gives the flavor (flavour) and contrary to popular belief there are some Americans who'd like to eat a bit healthy, but love certain food items. Personally I find this to be inventive and welcomed as long as it is done properly. I've overcooked a turkey breast or two, but while it is a bit boring by itself, it does carry more flavor (flavour) than chicken when roasted, I feel. I personally think that she simply had one too many shite turkey dinners in Britain, but never had a proper bird in the states where even our fast-food versions are not ""insipid and stringy"". Again a baseless argument rooted in some truth, but I see this as a personal thing and not something that drive ""Brits"" nuts. 8. Spelling I can understand why this would bother someone who was from the UK and had to write for an American medium, but I think that is where something that would ""Drive Brits Nuts"" would end. Again I see this as more of a personal thing than a collective gripe of the British public. Things are spelled a bit differently in some cases and without looking up the history of how this came about, it seems as though we simply did away with letters we thought were not necessary based on how the word is pronounced. This probably happened an extremely long time ago as the result of a misspelling by someone sounding out the English word. This doesn't mean Americans these days are dumb or silly for continuing to do this and it doesn't mean that either side is wrong or right. We're two different cultures and societies that evolved separately for a very long period of time much in the same way Australia did, but I don't take offense since Brits like to pick on the Aussies as well for other things. Again, this only drives the writer nuts and Brits in general just don't care and shake their head when we talk about the Corvette ZEE OH SIX. Oh and here's a tip... There is a setting on all Windows and Mac computers, tablets and other items you're probably using to write which should already be set to ""English UK"". If not then Google and ye shall find. Job done, eh? 9. Pronunciation... I swear I've recently heard a bunch of this during someone's stand-up routine like Rhod Gilbert as I mentioned before, but it might have been on the Comedy at the Apollo and can't remember the comedian. With regards to herb and fillet, one could also bring up #8 and question why the English chose to ""frenchify"" words like ""colour"" and ""aeroplane"", but I don't know if anyone from this side ever cared to look the other direction simply thinking that's just how your words evolved. I think it was once said that the use of ""Filet"" is reserved for boneless cuts of meat while ""Fillet"" is used for fish in the United States, but I am not entirely sure. If anything, Americans probably pronounce it incorrectly when referring to fish according to the general consensus of international chefs and yes, decades of McDonalds advertising is wrong too. I think that just like anything else over the years being separated from English influence and probably getting along with the French quite a bit better, those worlds could have evolved from the melting pot influence. With regards to ""herb"", I think that came about the same way and being someone who pronounces the ""h"" anyway, I just think people pronounce it how they grew up hearing it. ""The colonel's secret blend of herbs and spices"" was how most kids probably even first heard the word itself. I guess I am not seeing where Americans are out there intentionally saying something incorrectly to sound more intelligent when that pronunciation has been part of our society for countless years. While mostly northern, I believe it is safe to say that entire portions of British people often don't pronounce the ""h"" in many words including herb. For example, if I was watching John Bishop, Jason Manford or (for our Americans here) Russell Brand, if the phrase was spoken ""Turn that down, the noise is doing my head in"", whether the accent be from Liverpool (Scouse) or Manchester it would sound like ""...doing my ed in"". Dare I even go into the weird sect of UK society that pronounces the letter ""h"" like ""hay-ch""? I think that might be more Northern Ireland, but I'm not sure. All I remember was hearing it a few times and then seeing David Mitchell shoot someone on Mitchell & Webb for doing it. I don't think any American really gives a toss about how he or she sounds when ordering a steak or piece of fish. All they do know is for a very long time this is how it was pronounced, it is grandfathered in now and to pronounce it otherwise would actually be more likely interpreted as unintelligent in this country and be a bit what one would expect Gomer Pyle to pronounce it as. ""Gee Sarge, that fill-et I had last night sure did stink up the latrine"" Blimey, I bet I'm going to hear about how I used the word ""latrine"" now... 10. English vs. British Slang I think the differences in the slang terminology are quite hilarious and the various theories of where the differences came from are quite entertaining as well. I remember when first learning what the English considered to be a ""Fanny"" and had a laugh, but then realized why my father who was from England would crack up when my American aunt would warn us about getting a spanking on our fannies. Thinking back to that now, I think that if I was my father and knew the true meaning, I would have probably lost it laughing as well. The term ""fag"" is well known for being different between the two countries and I recently laughed quite hard when Ricky Gervais had to speak up over Karl to let American listeners know about the English slang for fag not being a gay man. He then proceeded to talk about a couch being ""fag proof"" did not mean it kept gay men off your couch. Hahaha. I can only wonder what would happen to a nonce if he drove past a Fanny May Chocolates store. In the end I have to say that the writer here just seems to be a bit up-tight about things and I don't think they're reserved for only American items. The topic of the article was what ""Drives Brits Nuts"", but I think there are a host of things that would make an English person a bit wonky toward America and only a few of these I can agree with not only as an American who takes a deep interest in British society, but is also a dual citizen. I think I'd enjoy writing for the BBC. ttp://twitter.com/jasonthehyeena Jason Leer As a British person, I agree with everything you've said. ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=7\\... Thea Allison As an American person, I'd agree you are long winded and opinionated...and I also agree with most of what you say. Yay to protected speech! Jo You sure took a long time to say a bunch of nothing. Everyone is different no matter where they are from. Of course when people live in close proximity to one another they will pick up each others traits. This is natural and also follows a desire not to be different. I live in the South for instance but, not all people in the South have the same traditions or values. So many people and cultures have melted into the South that it is rare to find anyone who resembles the ""Old True Southerner"" as we would call them. The graceousness and sincerity of the South has gone. We all, and this includes those of other nations, have lost our compasion and trust for one another. We are alike in more ways than we are different, in that we have all abandoned our desire to embrace what is good and decent in others for a false tolerance that would force others to accept that which goes against all they believe is right. How someone speaks and the words they are accustomed to using is not important, just interesting. What a person holds dear and valuable is very important. This should not be mocked. This is the greatest tragedy of our time. steve logie Wow a lot of hate out here, from both sides. Chill out people! CaptainScorpio I'm very sorry you've never had properly prepared turkey. My mom makes it the way you describe, and most of my life I also thought it was normally that way. No, you just have to have it well prepared. Jonathan I live in America and I could never understand why people like turkey. I can't imagine turkey tasting good and still resembling turkey. ttp://www.facebook.com/paul.ellison Paul Ellison Have you ever had a whole roasted chicken before? Turkey's look exactly the same except a little bit larger. Quark Just want to say I'm an american and thought the article was hilariously funny and in the proper spirit. Kudos to the author for bringing humour (sic) to an issue that can sometimes be a ""sticky wicket"". Kate I'm an American and these things drive me crazy. Maybe it's because my skin tone is more suited to a rainier climate, but I agree with all of that. Words are so much smoother and make more sense spelled the British way. In fact, I like them so much more, that I have changed the settings on my typing programme and my phone to spell things the British way, or what I like to call ""correctly."" While I admit I do enjoy the British accent over the American one, Americans who bother the Brit about it are rather silly. They're the ones who stopped speaking like that in the first place. Don't dote. Change it. Anyway, several of the pronunciation and spelling points reminded me of the Eddie Izzard skit Cheating at Scrabble. I'm not sure if this is the actual title, but he goes on about American spelling and pronunciation versus British spelling and pronunciation. If you haven't seen it, I'm sure you would enjoy the sentiment. AAe You can not complain about the use of z and lack of u. Although very similar these are two different languages. American English was changed by the founding fathers and they wanted it too continue to change to show as much separation as possible between the two countries. Naomi What annoys me is that I get the feeling Americans don't realise that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all 'Britain', not just England. You can't say 'I love your British accent' (stereotypical a bit, but people must say it sometimes) because there is no such thing as a 'British' accent. I get the feeling they say 'British' when meaning 'English'. That's annoying. Plus saying they want to go to Britain, when they actually mean London. Oh -- and telling me I spell things wrong. I. Do. Not. Actually, the singing the national anthem before EVERYTHING is a little weird to me, but that's just different, not irritating. Hope I understand why us Americans saying we like British accents could be annoying, as most Americans mean English accents. I also prefer the way Brits spell things to the American way. It usually makes more sense. Brandygirl Wow, people! This article was supposed to be joke! Americans take things way too seriously! I am an American that was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI and I was so ashamed to see other Americans getting really ugly when responding to this article. Why are you on the BBC America page if you are this defensive about British humor toward Americans? Get over yourselves! neat #7. When people started realizing that turkey is a much healthier meat, it was put into everything to reduce the meat's fat content, lower its cholesterol and reduce the amount of salt we eat. I agree, it doesn't taste as good as the original. Though, Turkey bacon when smoked and peppered is pretty good. #8.Funny, this one has gotten on my nerves too, but from reverse. I keep wanting to say, it's labor or civilization. The one I saw recently was artifact spelled artefact. I think, you could add a few more to the list. Such as, the decimal and comma in numbers. 10,000 and 10.000 mean two completely different amounts to both countries. Dates too. In America, it is ususally seen as month/day/year. Ly Do you realize you just generalized over 300 million people as being ""too serious"" all from 440 comments? Please don't generalize, it makes you sound ignorant. VH Well, if the article is supposed to be a joke, it certainly lacks any amorous nature towards Americans, with the exception of a patronizing tone in the opening ""Americans are some of the loveliest people..."" None of the authors examples apply to me nor the vast majority of Americans that I know so her assessment is plain and simply a result of a small, impressionable sample. Perhaps she wouldn't like an in-kind response of Brits: their overuse of ""Cheers"" as a salutation, some of the most unhealthy and overindulgent breakfast items I've ever experienced,horrible showers, and a pompous attitude. So there, you can be summed up inappropriately too. I like humor, but please don't do it at the expense of a whole population. It doesn't endear us to you. ben I'm sorry, but 'unhealthy and overindulgent breakfast items'? are you mad? A full fry up still probably has only as many calories as a bowl of sugar cereal with MARSHMALLOWS in it or a pile of pancakes with SYRUP on them! megawfa79 Regarding your comments on turkey, perhaps you're leaving the bird in the oven too long. But, then again, British turkey is a contradiction in terms. Google ""trash can turkey"". Don't worry -- the can is clean and the bird is moist, tender, and to die for. ahahahaha, canadian here but canada is exactly the same. Heres a thought. STAY OUT OF OUR CONTINENT THEN. You are just jealous because we are richer then you and actually have something to claim (what was it about 40% of teh worlds economy?) Liz It seems funny how many people criticize Americans but need our help for all your problems. observateur No, you're confusing your meddling in other's affairs with helping. Laevatein FO (only people typing here) GB... you doun't see us commenting on the fact that you can't pronounce words... so get off our ass, and play with your 'torches', bonnets and boots. We love you Great Britain....... We don't care what you say about US!.. tally HO.....I'm off to an absolutely fabulous therapy session with my dog Bella! ttp://twitter.com/Metronil Metronil Brits seem to be a little bit emotional, insecure and bitter...Just sayin. amk671 I think your overreaction to anything that doesn't praise American to the heavens is covered under number five. ttp://twitter.com/DaughterMoon Nee M Amusing, and eye-opening in some ways... but very nit-picky in others. I'm sorry I was not taught to pronounce the ""h"" in herb, but I assure you it is not to sound clever nor sophisticated. It's how we say it over here and that's that. I'm not changing the way I say a word simply to erase the impression that I'm impersonating the French. Similarly, you should keep on saying knickers, bottom and fringe, and put the ""u"" and the ""s"" back on your keyboard. The world is smaller than ever before and most of us will know what you mean. For those that don't, they can learn. Just don't expect anyone to start saying and spelling words in a way that pleases you. ttp://twitter.com/DaughterMoon Nee M Oh and with you 100% on the patriotism. It's over the top. In my neighborhood, there's a man that has a ginormous pick-up truck with two full sized American flags hooked to the back of the cab. I see him and I can't help but think ""douchebag."" Brian Yes, how dare he. He must be such a jerk. ttp://www.facebook.com/people/Jamie-Whi\\... Jamie White Actually, in fairness, I've noticed that the ones who drive the large, bulky vehicles with lots of crap on them are very unpleasant on the road. In actual fact, the more you ""mark"" your vehicle, the more psychologically likely you are to be an aggressive driver (this is actually a thing, that has been proven with science. People get more territorial the more they think of the car as an extension of themselves). And I've noticed that the larger the vehicle (aside from Semis, sometimes), the more entitled to the road the driver seems to act. They become road bullies, assuming that they can swerve into your lane with no warning and often no turn signal, just because your car would take more damage in a crash (thus, they know you're the one ""forced"" to yield). They ride your tail, trying to make you go faster via intimidation, and if you don't, they'll swerve around and in front of you -- often honking or flipping the bird at you in the process. Then again, I live in the South. Our drivers are terrible to begin with. KB But it would be OK if they were MUFC flags I presume? Kenna I actually love this article -- so true! It's a funny article and I always love reading about differences between different cultures. So what if he doesn't like I have *bangs* and am proud to be an American -- I am! And I'm more than happy to celebrate these differences as well. Deb Chavis This article is the best yet! I love the humor in it. jane Why blame a whole country for a few people out of it that messed it up? I'm an American and I'm not overly patriotic? Our ""over zealous cheer"", never have I ever been told ""You're the best customer ever!"" for buying 2 things. Theyre two different countries and cultures. antastic.mrfox This is funny, especially the bang-on description of the word panties. It also reminds me of a time in New York when I commented on the ""shops"". I was wryly told that ""hear in America we have stores, not shops"". Don't even get me started on my mirth when I saw a display of ""fanny bags"". On the Spelling, most people do not realise thyat ""ises"" instead of ""izes"" in British English is a only phenomenon of the last half century. Check any older British dictionary and s is not used in such a proflific way. Although either spelling is in FACT now acceptable in most dictionaries, the Oxford English Dictionary specifically still prefers z in most cases. The only reason I have given in to ""ises"" is because of the misinterpretation that ""izes"" are American that jolts with fellow Brits. Oh. and on turkey, it is a definitely question of how it is cooked! Glynis Yes, and I hate how the spellings are changing on many words. Travelling, traveller, bussing, busses, etc. Tell me, how does one justify ""buses"", and why doesn't it rhyme with MUSES, from the root word ""muse""? Or fuses? Joost Fricke If the Brits cook turkey like they do the rest of their food it's not wonder they don't like it... V Doesn't matter, none of them brush their teeth anyway... ZUmber Well seeing as our health care is free and dentists are much cheaper. I'd have thought we'd have better of both worlds. WF I'm American and just gave a solid rant on how the British can drive one bat-crazy, so it's only fair that I provided the most unfettered of insight about my fellow people. 1) Saying ""could care less."" What's the point of even saying this? To tell me you've cared the entire time, or to tell me that you think a grammatical contraction is just as difficult to muster as a birth contraction? Don't indicate you care at all when you really, really wish the object of your indifference was found in the deepest trench of the Pacific Ocean. 2) Saying ""have a nice day"" when you don't know two cents about how my day's been going! Let's keep expectations at ground level, shall we? I myself am a busy teacher so let me just hope that I survive my day without attaching a ball-and-chain to my ankle and then subsequently throwing myself out the window. 3) Wearing sneakers, or trainers since apparently I must translate, in public or to any place as if it's proper dress code. Forget thinking first. I'm at the opera, let me wear sneakers! After all, the intermission was designed for me to jog around this new performance hall and check the new plaques of the donors! 4) Not understanding sarcasm and irony immediately. Do you know much it irks me when I've had to say, ""Oh, just kidding?"" or something like that? I've finally weaned myself off that, but not without a methadone-like withdrawal regimen to make sure I never relapse. 5) Thinking that everyone wants to come to America for ""freedom, prosperity and Jesus."" Or whatever. Tune into the BBC or PBS and you will learn that thousands upon thousands are trying to get into Europe, often illegally. Africa on Europe's doorstep is, I believe, a starker contrast to Mexico on America's. 6) And this leads me to my next point. Often presuming that someone is obligated to believe in God or a god of some kind. If one's an atheist (oooo, silence only interrupted by a whistling wind and ruffling leaves) he's automatically doomed in the most horrid of ways that I won't mention for fear of being blacklisted by the BBC and any number of oppressive theocracies in the world. You don't have to believe in any god if you don't want. In fact, some of my dearest friends don't and I don't think bad things will happen to them or that there is some sort of inexorable eye-for-an-eye justice that the man above will exert on these beings! 7) Making small talk too often or simply talking for the sake of talking. No, lovely barista, who's told me her life story about being a teen runaway and prostitute from LA, I cannot engage in conversation with you on my way to work. Does the wrinkled Garfield the Cat look on my face not give that away in the slightest? No, Signor Plumber, who has come to fix my sink in oversize jeans that still don't hide that bleak, hairy wasteland called your rear-end, I do not wish to hear or be sympathetic to you because your wife left you for a cult leader. The exorbitant fees you charge me do not include a donation to your mental health upkeep. Well, there it is and I really must conserve my rant energy. Mark number 9 and 10 on this list are stupid. We say thing differently because we are in another place than England. We say and pronounce things differently. We don't say ""tea time"" or ""bollocks"" or ""rubbish"". Get over yourself. kennedyshaffer71199 this is sooooo funny, im american. Personally i dont care for the half the things listed here, i hate turkey, i hate the cashires that are like ""have a great day, you are a great sshopper, and come again soon."" all in one breath! V What a joke of an article. If it wasn't for the good ole U.S. of A...you'd be part of a small province in Russia. I'd just rather you thank you me rather than try and make yourself look smart with this smut article. TheAngryAmericanFemale Seven Things Americans hate about prententious Brits: 1) Their pretentiousness, for one 2) Their food, which seems to consist mostly of beef and freakishly dry yorkshire puddings 3) (If the case is so)The horrible cockny-accents that are often displayed, which nobody can understand so we just smile and nod 4) Their hostility and unwillingness to communicate in an at least respectful manner 5) Their addiction to milky tea 6)Their hatred of cats and worship of dogs( both are equal, damnit!) 7)Their worship of a constitutional monarchy, which has been away from power for so long, that it makes no sense that the media still has intererst in them . So there, Ms/Mrs/Mr. Prententious List Writer, I have made my move Whitney I'm American and really enjoyed this article. To any American that finds this article offensive, I would say get over it. This is meant to be a playful ""slagging"" as the British would call it. I say that as someone who is from time to time offended by the anti-American bigotry that comes from Europe on the web and in person. I love my country but if anyone thinks this article is offensive, you should read what other Europeans think of us. Ive travelled all over Europe and lots of Europeans not only hate our policies but they hate us. For example, I'm surprised at how anti-American Ireland is. Greeks in Greece dont hate Greek-Americans, Italians hardly ever hate Italian-Americans, but lots and lots of Irish hate Irish-Americans. A lot of Europeans (not all and maybe not most) stereotype all 310 million of us as the worst people on earth living in some Godforsaken backwater of a country filled with greed, violence, ignorance, and fat people. When you the Europe I've seen, you can just laugh off articles like this. I think some of the reaction to this article has to do with the fact that bookgirl20 I thought for sure the sacrilege of serving tea cold would make the list. FrequentTraveller I know this is supposed to be tongue in cheek and humo(u)rous but as a Brit I don't find this funny at all. I L-O-V-E it when Americans comment on my accent. And if only Britain had the awesome restaurant service they have in the States. I've never had my plate whipped away like Ruth describes. American friends, I apologise on behalf of this person's editor who obviously said something along the lines of ""got a column, to fill, needs to be in the next 10 minutes, just dash off any old c**p."" Ruth, you're not speaking for me. To be honest this just falls into the rather embarrassing, snidey chip on our shoulder category that crops up way way too often and makes me cringe. (PS, Brits, if you want a laugh in the States just pronounce ""urinal"" -- all my American friends fall about). Anderson It's called culture. Different, not wrong. I know this is a joke and is completely ignorant and ethnocentric, but some people actually think like this. Just saying. aren't you the same 'americans' that brand all muslims as terrorists and call them ""towelheads""? then claim it's all a joke and that muslims have no sense of humour? well, this article was written for fun. can't YOU take a joke? 'americans' love laughing at others but can't take it when the position is turned around? GROW UP! ttp://www.facebook.com/kmischka Katie Mischka ey, please do not judge all Americans by the Tea Party. I'm trying to convince my cousin that not all muslims are evil. But you do have a point, a lot of Americans are stupid bigots. But please don't judge us all by that. Dizzychik Your own stupidity is showing,the tea party has nothing to do with bigotry and everything to do with getting the people playing with other people's money to show fiscal responsibility.And recognizing that while,all Muslims are not evil,their religion is being hijacked by extremists and that faction needs to be dealt with by someone who's got enough gumption to do it,and protect the rest of the world if they can. GBGamer Herb is the correct pronunciation. You were the guys who changed it after we moved here. You pronounced it the same way until (I think) the 19th century. Just pointing out. I know this article's a joke, but I still think people should know this. Also, who the hell says fanny? That's something you say. observateur you are getting 'your panties in a bunch' over a joke. you need to be less pompous and have more humility because no individual or nation is (how do you Yanks say it?) 'ALL THAT! Elle from Vancouver I am Canadian and being in the commonwealth and yet so close to the US we share a smattering of both, in regards to speech patterns etc. We say ""zed"" and spell with the ""our"". We eat turkey too but some of us don't like it either. Now, on the patriotic thing...yes, some of you Yanks are way over the top. We Canadians are a very proud and patriotic bunch (just watch a hockey game) but we are not as in your face about it. Interesting to read that not all of you are...it is a shared assumption. We all have good and bad qualities as my Quebec country folk would say, vive la difference! Angry American This is, frankly, a pretty stupid fucking article. 1. ""Herb"" is pronounced ""erb"". ""Fillet"" is pronounced ""Fillay"". That's how I was taught to say it as a child. Is it even possible to be ""pretentious"" as a child? 2. Spelling words the ""wrong"" way? ""Colour"" is considered incorrect on my American computer according to spellcheck; and spellcheck usually doesn't fail me. 3. Turkey is fucking great. Fuck you. The only one I agree with is the Patriotism one. I hate America. I also hate Britain. I also hate this terrible article. Maridine Hey, dickwad. I feel like you're just describing the hard time you are having adjusting to the American lifestyle. There is a ton of shit we Americans could come up with to rag on your damn culture. Fuck off and get out of our country because we don't need you here contaminating it. Bitch. Marion S In the U.S., we really love our country. We really are as happy as we act. We do smile and say nice things all day long to others -- and we mean what we say (yes, I'll agree that there is a small percentile of Americans that don't mean it). That is our way of making the world a better place to live. That doesn't mean that we don't have problems, it's simply the idea that our own problems won't be solved by burdening you with them every time we pass. We are not thin-skinned at all! We criticize our own selves all of the time!!! Our news reflects an overly self-critical nation. My British friends who visited the U.S. are actually surprised that we are not nearly as bad (or fat) as they had imagined from our daily news. Another confusing thing is ""How are you?"" doesn't mean that we want to be a psychiatrist. It's just a greeting. When a person answers, ""Not bad,"" that is actually a positive response. Being as our country is so large, we have our own differences about word choice, dialect, and pronunciation. Examples: A water fountain is called a ""bubbler"" in Wisconsin. Soda is called ""pop"" in Minnesota. Turkey is extremely moist when it is cooked properly. If it is dry and stringy, you had a bad cook. We really enjoy Brits and their accents, word choices, and phrases. But, sorry to say, this article is at least halfway inaccurate. eekahil I agree so very much with #10. ""Panties"" annoys the flippin' heck out of me for the reasons you give. I like to say ""underpants"" for males or females because it is funny and old fashionedy (even though I know ""pants"" is naughty ) or sometimes ""foundation garments"" because it is even funnier and more old-fashionedy. Why I Have no Friends Reasons 27 and 362. kb Putting the last name first really bugs me too! I'm from the USA ttp://www.facebook.com/ariel.wyckoff Ariel R. Wyckoff Hilarious! ttp://www.facebook.com/ronna.lester Ronna Sutton Lester Webster removed the 'o' from everything feasible to separate as far from GB as possible, changing other words around also, Revolutionary War stuff, you know.. I personally can't stand undercooked vegetables such as green beens. My Mama cooked them until they melted in your mourth, the Southern way! When we lived in NYC for a bit, she hated eating out, because she said they just blanched them, the way we do to get ready to freeze them. Ugh!! So, I guess my family did retain that bit from the big move here. actually, being an american myself, i agree with most of these. but then...i also think american culture has gone down the 'loo' in the last 50 years. ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1\\... John H Harris In regards to #9, we did elect a socialist. His name is Barack Obama! Dovakin A note on the patriotism... I'm in London right now and have been for the last week and I haven't gone more that half a minute without seeing the Union Jack plastered somewhere. On cars, accessories, flyers, practically every building. It was the same when I was here in July. It was one of, if not THE, first things I mentioned. The point is, I've seen way more British flags in one week in London than I can ever remember seeing at any point in the US... and that includes the rural community I grew up in and the London-comparable cities I've visited regularly on either coast (with the possible exception of Memorial Day in Washington DC And there is nothing wrong with being proud of the country you were born in. England (and Great Britain) has a wonderful history that your ancestors were a part of and that directly resulted in you in so many ways. You don't need to blare your national anthem out of the stereo or fly a flag off your truck (or paint it on the roof of your vehicle *cough* the mini *cough*) but you can be proud of the contributions your people have made to the world. Expat253 The amount of flags in London is not a surprise at all. For one it's the year of the Queens Jubilee and the Summer Olympics being hosted there as well as it being tourist season. It's far from a typical scene in the capital. Amelia ""Pretentious"" vocabulary? I think you'll find that Americans, probably due to its melting pot culture, doesn't pronounce French words the French way because it's pretentious. It's because it's a French word. Just like how we pronounce ""Quesadilla"" without using L's. Do Brits really use the L's in that word? 'Cause I would laugh in their face. ui Right on ttp://www.facebook.com/mary.talley.58 Mary Talley Oh honey, come down here to the South and you will learn a whole new language!

Wanna come over for some sweet tea? he he. -- A fellow G.R.I.T. &lt;3 sean I am an american and i completely agree. May Brits spell words wrong, not Americans. But the word panties should be removed from the face of the Earth with napalm. British and proud You get a hint from it being 'English' that it was and still is our language.Brits dont spell our words wrong you do, because it's OUR language.Its colour not 'color' and rubbish not 'trash'. Americans make everything so cheesy, like garbage. And before you say America's bigger in size, it may well be but it's full of the most dickheads saying its Americas language.WHEN ENGLISH IS OUR LANGUAGE! Joe Thanks for the suggestions. I will use these to annoy Brits whenever possible. t tapps 1. Herb and filet (you misspelled the word we are pronouncing) are pronounced as such due to the respect for other word origins and not the naive ""we built the world British attitude"" 2. The irresistible temptation for English to inject their unwelcomed opinion to criticize 99 percent of the time. 3. Beginning every sentence with ""You Yanks always""... Really? Only half the county were Yanks two hundred years ago stop already 4. The British Museum. A collection of all the UK's exploits and lootings. 5. Why not be proud of your flag. Move to another country if you not like your own. 6. There is no point for this thread. You see? Rich Interestingly, words being pronounced with or without the ""h"" is partially locality based (NYC folks typically drop the ""h"") and partially age based (&gt;60 tend to drop the ""h""). In my case, my folks were from Booklyn and pronounced ""human"" as ""uman"". It's all in the area with which they both grew up in (they are in their mid/late 70?s). The spelling of the words ""wrong"" is the difference between British English and American English. For what it is worth, I have to say.. Zed? Really.. C'mon now.. that just being pretentious. Like the author's irritation drawn by their interpretation of Americans dropping the letter ""h"" to pronounce ""herb"" as ""erb"", pronouncing the last letter of the alphabet as ""Zed"" doesn't impress anyone. While I agree with the sense of patriotism, we US folks only have 250+ years of nationalism to draw upon. Give us another 600+ years to catch up, and I would say that our expression will probably be similar to the UK. Also, consider in to the equation the world we live in today in addition to what we have had to overcome (hint: something to do with the 11th.. and the month of September). Have to agree 100% with the use of last names as unique first names. I would like to add that this is probably not unique to the US, though. Also, using names for the opposite gender is a peeve, too. ""Charly"" for a girl. Really? The pets bit is funny. It's unfortunately not limited to the US (it's all over the UK, too, as well as other countries). Yuck. Last thing: so we train our customer service staff to be happy and treat their patron with a semblance of respect. Besides, happiness is infectious and they'd rather not foster any continued nature of being a sour puss. Fun article. Thanks! James Hahahaha. But the funniest thing about America is that we are doing the exact same thing that we fought to be free of in the Revolutionary War. amused american I sat here laughing while reading it. XD funny, how the most innocent of actions in one culture can turn into the biggest of pet peeves of another culture. Never realiSed how abrasive a ""z"" really was until you mentioned it... Hey, my middle name's a surname, and I go by it. haha. Florence First of all, I'm American. I admit I like British accents, but most people I know find them really annoying and pretentious. Maybe it's different in the north but yea. Secondly, people in restaurants and stores are very polite because it's their job -- not because they're nice and love to please. If they don't make you feel overly sick from the amount of kindness they're giving you, then they get scolded or fired. Also, the patriotism is a bit over the top. I don't normally see flags unless it's the house of a veteran or soldier. Plus, it's not really bad to love your country. We pronounce words from other languages as they are supposed to be pronounced because it is their language so it's kind of stupid if you don't. Lastly, not everyone says panties and fanny. Panties is common but a lot of people say underwear or the actual type (ie; boxers, briefs). Oh, and I have never heard the word fanny used outside of old movies where they were acting stupid. Americans do have problems, but those aren't it. Your post should have been about how tons of people get knocked up for extra money from the government. How practically 75% of teenagers don't care about high school. How southerners (no offense, I am southern after all) tend to be more judgmental to people from foreign countries, other religions, and other sexualities. Maybe actual problems with Americans instead of spiteful ones that can't be generalized to the public. And I hate turkey. ZUmber Don't worry we have girls here being knocked up for free money too and our payments are very very generous. Infact some of them certainly get more than I do and I work for a living. Samantha What? Why are you even here? Maybe this is what is wrong with America. We let snobby noses come over here anytime they want and make fun of us. Ok so you don't like turkey? DONT EAT IT! Americans believe in freedom. With all this freedom comes choice. You choose to come here; maybe it is time you choose to go back! I am proud to be an American! That's right, I went there!!! J KD Wow Ruth, you comes across like a very bitter person. Why don't you just say you hate Americans and be done with it. Egg Most of those are legitimate complaints, but some of them are just cultural differences and make you sound like an idiot. Learn more about how Americans speak rather than expect Americans to speak like Brits. juniperowl This list is one of the dumbest things I've ever read. It just makes the author sound like a pretentious, insufferable assbag. Sorry you don't like our good attitudes or the way we speak, but in return we're not all that fond of someone who has nothing better to do than bitch about a culture they're not a part of. TheMagicalAri Personally I love the last names for first names thing. If i lost my name to marriage i could see myself naming a child my maiden name. But on the patriotism thing, we fought and won our country just slightly over 200 years ago, we are going to be patriotic for a long time. The English have been English for a quite a while, so it's not such a big deal. Also if anyone who is not 6 years old or the mother of some one who is, is saying ""fanny"" they're just silly. TheMagicalAri I work in a call center and if we're not overly sweet and accommodating we get in trouble. It's a business thing, not a personal preference I actually hate everyone Who interrupts me on the phone with a burning passion, but it's the rules. ttp://www.facebook.com/david.hopson.54 David Hopson I really hate turkey meat in any form. also,people that treat pets like children are freaky.especially those people that have ankle biters,trip hazards. alexis what is so bothering about a waiter picking up your empty plate? it allows more table space. also, im american and i pronounce the h in herb and everyone corrects me.It is very annoying. they also tell me i pronounce vase wrong. also most people dont think turkey taste good its just healthier fat-wise. By the way, we find the greeters at stores annoying as well. CoedK First off, I want you to know that not all Americans are like this. I for example, am an Irish American, and although im proud to have been born in this country I couldnt care less about where I live. I feel wierd saying the words panties, Fanny, and bangs. And am quite informed with international events. I can see where these stereotypes come from, I do afteral live here, and for the majority of people theyre true but painting such broad strokes about a country as large as the united states isnt right. Louis XV A man from a country where they routinely ruin good fish, fowl and meat complaining that turkey doesn't taste good. It does if you prepare it properly. And then he complains that a country of 300 million people doesn't slavishly follow the chauvinistic pronunciations of his quaint little island! Here, we assume that French words are pronounced the way the French pronounce them. Ditto for every other language on the planet. Have you ever noticed that Brits are incapable of correctly pronouncing ""Michigan""? Despite 300 years of examples they refuse to learn to pronounce a soft ch. Cholly Knickerbocker Plenty of Brits hang the Union Jack from their houses and have pictures of the sovereign hanging above their mantle, even if the fashionable self-styled ""intellectual class"" find it, well, a trifle lower class. Perhaps that's why the British Empire now runs from London to just short of the Scottish border? ZUmber The only time I've seen a flag hanging from a house here in England is when there's an important England match on. As for having the Queen on the wall too, never seen that either. Sarah As an American, I have to say that this is pretty funny. The author is just poking some fun at us; it's not like we don't do it to them and other people. Refer to the article 10 Things Brits Do That Drive Americans Nuts. People seriously need to just laugh and take a chill pill. Trekkie Gal The 'u' in colour, humour, neighbour, etc. serves no purpose. It doesn't change the pronunciation or meaning of the word. So why should we use it? Tyler I'm sorry the USA is not exactly like your country. And people say Americans are the ignorant ones.... ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=5\\... Daniel Chen Spelling differences are fine by me. It's when some Yank tries to call me stupid for spelling words like ""defence"" with a ""C"" instead of an ""S"" I blow my lid. American spelling isn't the only valid spelling system in the world. Billy Bob Don't knock turkey! It is delicious when properly cooked and served. And when you serve it with cornbread dressing, candied yams and a fresh cranberry dish, you have a real winner. AlexEconomics Wait... what's the second holiday that centers around turkey? I'm an American, born and bred. And from my knowledge, Thanksgiving is the only turkey-centric holiday. Our family does goose or duck for Christmas, if that's what the author is referring to. Bethee Easter and some people do it on Christmas as well i know my family does turkey and ham then and we have done roast and turkey for Easter Wolf ""Make an actual socialist your president and then we'll talk."" Ah when was this written? We do have a socialist President already. Dillydill09 11. Creating this list ttp://www.facebook.com/mike.netty.ornce Mike Netty Ornce I agree with almost all of it.... except for the knickers and panties issue..... PLEASE!!!!! DON'T EVER SAY KNICKERS AGAIN! UNLESS YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 80 YEARS OLD....Trust me... panties are much better, and no dude in his right mind (unless he's into banging old chicks) would ever find a ckick saying knickers to be sexy. ?Could you imagine some hot chick sticking her knickers in your mouth during a lap dance???? gag, gag, gag..... how do my knickers taste there sonny? erson i liked number i cant stand when people do that erson number 9 mr.magic96 lol mr.magic96 you brits Andre Richards The ""u"" was intentionally removed from words like ""color"" and ""neighbor"" in the early days of the U.S. as part of a deliberate attempt to differentiate our version of the language in the U.S. from that of the Brits as well as to remove some unnecessary complexity in the language. So that's not a misspelling, nor are words like ""center"" and ""theater."" We spell them correctly. Sorry you're unable to break with your quaint traditions. I have to laugh because the Brits always tell us we're wrong no matter what. Polly No, you are wrong there. lol Anaughtybear Actually, you can look in the dictionary and see that Brits are incorrect in their spelling of a lot of words, particularly 'aluminum'. It has has four syllables. I agree on the patriotism bit. Also, we're sorry about country music. Not all of us are that dumb. If Americans are in the U.K., we have an accent. If you're in the U.S., you have an accent. ZUmber Actually if you go 20 miles in any direction in the UK and you'll encounter a different accent. I can't agree with the aluminium though. Aloominum doesn't sound right to me. Jonathan O'bryant The only thing I agree with is the spelling of words, like honour, colour,ect. For some reason I've always spelled like that, (parents are from Ireland) Given to light I am Irish, I've heard nothing but bad things about the brits.... It's common in Ireland and the U.S... Just stating. While I am an animal lover, I completely agree with the pet thing. My ma tried to tell me my dog was like my brother once... I told her to shag off. The only thing pretentious is your god awful attitude, and us Americans are PERFECTLY HAPPY not living in a social nanny state. I have an accent, it's mixed, but I don't mind when people compliment it. Turkey is good if you know how to prepare it, but i wouldn't want to make it a steady diet. How's this for over zealous patriotism? Kiss my American ass and get me a beer Marlene i love the brits but we some how are always doing wrong and they say we should be more like them.STRONGLY DISAGREE!!! AMERICAN Most of this isnt true,dont you think if i went to the uk peole would be fascinated by my acent.This so affensive you should be a shamed, i dont go around making fun of other people who live in diffrent parts of the world because they talk diffrent or they like my acent.HERE LET ME WRITE IT SO YOU WILL UNDERSTAND YOUR AND BEASTLEY LITTLE TWIT!!!!! Justin Pretentious you say? Hah! I'd say take a look in the mirror. You seem rather ignorant, just saying. Sharon Your ignorant price of shut move back to England than! Stacy J I'm an American and I spent my summer in Oxford and London. Everything you listed above I witnessed happening to me when I was in England. Every where I went people were coming up to me telling me ""I love your accent"" and kept asking me to say different things. I noticed the spelling difference when I was there and had to adapt when I was writing papers. I did it and I didn't complain about it because I realized we live different lives, we have different but similar cultures and it was very interesting to see all of this. I loved my experience over there and I would go back in a heart beat. Everything listed above happened to me in England and I didn't mind it at all (except the ""I love your accent"" thing got a bit annoying). ttp://www.facebook.com/beth.mar.9 Beth Mar Wow. And I thought Brits were nice and accepting. Just.. wow. Tolerance is key when you're in a different culture, just FYI. Bethee I like food! Matt As someone who used to live in London for 2 years, there are a few things that REALLY annoy the fuck out of me after reading this... #4) give me a break. you are paid to have cheer in a shop when you work there no matter what country you live in. If you're rude to a customer and he/she complains, chances are you will be fired. #5) COMPLETE BULL SHIT. Americans are no where near MORE patriotic than the British (English, Welsh and Scottish). They have just as many flags as we do, and they are EXTREMELY patriotic about everything. Worst of all, sports. The welsh and the scottish hate the english. And the english hate the welsh and scottish. Try going to a England v Wales rugby match.... I'm sure you will see no patriotism there. #6) I have seen the same thing over there. Mind you they were gay men, but still. In a baby carriage. #9) FUCK... THAT... Pretentious? The word Fillet is french. Hence, why we pronounce it that way. The same goes for the word Buffet, which oddly enough, the british pronounce the same way we do... WEIRD. #10) So we say panties.... They say pants, knickers, scivvies etc. Its just the way the cards fell. How is one way better than the other? And bangs.... My wife is british. Literally born and raised in Wales. I have visited there numerous times. Everyone of her friends say bands says both Bangs and Fringe. How is fringe better than bangs? And furthermore, they throw the words cunt and twat around like it's no big deal. Men call women that they don't know those words everyday. How can you say you feel dirty after saying the word ""bangs""? Matt and another thing about the way we pronounce things. When you guys say any word with ""er"" on the end of it like ""wanker"" you make it sound like ""wankah"". Ridiculous how you think saying ""herb"" makes us pertentious. Or how about how no one pronounces the letter ""t"" when it is in the middle of a word. Like ""water"" becomes 2 words almost: ""wau'ah"" Having said all of this, I still love the british. I think this author needs to get a life Bill Murray *spoken with an utmost proper and unoffensive British accent* Why thank you for this delightfully uplifting piece, you crusty, cantankerous bitch. Guest this made me laugh so hard god we're so annoying griit lyf real men are ruff neck and we dont want mask or a happy happy joy joy version of thingz we ike the gritty side of thing we love went the subway smalls like piss so it keep the rich spolid people out Kate I'm American and have always pronounced ""herb"" with the ""h."" I didn't even notice that Americans pronounce it differently until recently, and everyone thinks it's weird that I say it like that. THE YANK Ruth Margolis- how do you consider yourself intelligent if you can go to new york city, see a few odd people, then assume thats how all americans are? that would be like me saying i saw a british person in tokyo shit their pants, then convincing myself that all british people enjoy shitting in their pants. see the logic here? new york city is a melting pot of all cultures from across the globe, new york city is IN america, but even here we view it as a totally different world, because it is nothing at all like the rest of america. there are well over 8 million permanent residents, a few million undocumented aliens, and not to mention the extra 10 million or so that go to that city to work every day, and the millions of visitors. so next time you want to insult america, go ahead and do it (we enjoy those with their own opinions here) just make sure you actually know what you are talking about when you do it, so you don't make yourself out to look like a bumbling munter. it's funny that you people think you are more intelligent than us, but you are so stuck-up that you can't even see past your own nose to see who we really are. open your eyes, we americans didn't like how you looked at the rest of the world, so we murdered thousands of your people, left that oppressive dungeon, and then beat your worthless redcoats back across the atlantic(with their tails tucked between their legs like cowards) when you tried to take our freedom away. and after all that, we still came to your aid when winston churchill came groveling at our feet, begging like a starved dog for us to send our AMERICAN weapons to YOUR soldiers. whether you like it or not, without our aid, britain would have fell to nazi germany. you may not have needed the tens of thousands of our people that bled to death defending you without question, but your people begged us for help, and without it, you may not be there reading this article right now. now back to your worthless analysis. here are some REAL facts about REAL americans. 1:most of us find your accent to be utterly grotesque. 2.most of us think people who use surnames as first names should be flogged. 3.if they take away your plate too quickly at a restaurant, it is usually because they don't like you, and want you to leave quickly. 4.nobody says ""you were an awesome customer"" they do say ""thank you for your business"", or ""have a nice day"", but that is just to be polite, because trust me, nobody here cares about you, your bloody snatch, or your baseball bat sized tampons. 5.we as americans earned the right to be proud through death, hard work, blood, sweat, and tears, but since you people are so stuck-up, you can't even look past your own nose to see what makes us proud. 6.some bag lady babbling to her dog in the corner of a flea market hardly represents how americans treat their dogs. most of us see them as.. you guessed it.... DOGS! 7.turkey is a symbolic part of thanksgiving tradition, and just because you stupid arse redcoats can't cook a turkey properly, and have no real sense of taste, doesn't mean turkey is bad, just that you people can't cook. turkey is never dry when cooked right, quite the contrary, it can be as moist as a pot roast when cooked correctly. only a retard can mess up cooking a turkey. 8.aren't british people supposed to be intelligent? if so, you would know what the word dialect means, and why american engish varies from the king's english. we do not spell our own words wrong. 9. we do not pronounce our words wrong either, i will say again that you can find the definition of dialect in any one of your dictionaries. 10. if you are still as much of a rube as you were when you started reading this, see numbers 8 and 9, then sodomize yourself with the dictionary you are reading. .s. i just wanked to that photo of kate's tits, and spunked on a photo of the queen while waving an american flag and eating a nice turkey leg! the YANK spotted dick??? are you serious???? if you ask an american to come to your house to eat spotted dick, they would think you wanted them to perform fellatio on a man with genital herpes.. and ""puffing on a fag"" makes you sound like you like to suck gay dicks all day long. if you limey, island monkey, crooked toothed, redcoat pussies don't like america, stay over there where you belong. i am proud to be a yank, because we wiped the floor with you wimpy little pussies, and now we don't have to live within smelling range of her majesty's royal snatch(5000km upwind) Norm It's the way our culture has evolved since we became the melting pot over 200 years ago. We're not you and we're not anyone else so get over it and be thankful our country and yours are allies. If I had my way I'd force our school systems to teach multiple languages so we could communicate better with others when giving them our money while on vacation. Jaime I, too, was taught to pronounce 'herb' with a silent 'h' and 'fillet' with a silent 't'. We aren't doing it (at least not now, anyway) to sound french, though we might embellish it a bit if we're actually trying to sound french (for fun, as some people enjoy doing impersonations), but rather because we were taught that it's how its supposed to be pronounced. Brewing Sound like you are in a permanent bad mood as most Brits from that dreary place. There are worse things than acting cheerful, saying they love your accent and thanking you for patronizing their store. Jeez... I find these examples so silly in the face of the real problems that are here like gun control or something like that. ttp://www.facebook.com/john.sarmento.3 John Sarmento Culinary comments from the country that puts ketchup (catsup?) on eeevvvrrryyything..... Good fun Erliche I guess a guy coming from a country that eats ""Bangers and Mash"" and ""Spotted Dick"" would think our way of talking is strange LOL! Daimon How do you complain about -ize, yet misspell sexualise and infantilise in the later example? Kelly i find this very mean. i'm american myself, and saying that we like your accents is a complement. blame the government for the spelling stuff! not the people! i was almost going to cry after reading this. i could be brittish and do all of the same things you just listed! and not all americans are like that. only one women did that not 3845639536 people. i'm sorry that us americans drive you personally nuts. we have our own customs that we do. and britian has theres too. Lauren To address some of these ""American quirks:"" I personally do not make big fusses over British accents. In fact, to us, your accents make you sound very pretentious in all honesty. And it really depends who you have as a waiter. Some will take the plate away too fast, others will forget you're even there. And the majority of us DO NOT have a relentless cheer about ourselves 24/7 (I'm the opposite -- I have an attitude 24/7, then again I'm a New Yorker). Not everyone treats their pets like people, at least I don't because that's creepy. Turkey IS good, you probably just don't cook it properly. And the way we pronounce herb and fillet is just how we were taught. And I have NEVER, ever, ever, ever (10x ever) used the word ""fanny"" in my entire life. I always thought you guys used that word. I get that this article is how some of you feel, but what I have said above is how some of us feel. ttp://www.facebook.com/people/Jamie-Whi\\... Jamie White Wait, so ""panties"" is ""infantilizing"", but ""knickers"" isn't?What? One is a tiny pair of pants, sure, so it's cutesy I suppose if you aren't used to the word, but ""knickers""... man, that doesn't even sound serious. At all. I always thought people were being (or attempting to be) goofily saucy when they used it. But now you tell me, that's just their (sorry, ""your"") word for ladies' briefs? Seriously? That's... I'm sorry, that's ridiculous. At least every bit as ridiculous as ""panties"". ""Fringe"" sounds weird to me because my dialect just doesn't use it in that context (more like in the context of rugs or buckskin jackets), but at least it sounds like something an actual adult would say. Also -- regarding ""fillet"" -- you do realize it is spelled ""filet"", and it is in fact not a native English word but rather a French loanword used in a specialized and exclusively culinary sense? ""Fillet"" (with the double L) means something rather different, being that it's a carpentry term! People are pronouncing it correctly! And I will honestly take an attempt to pronounce a loanword similarly to the original, over butchery like ""kamakazzi"" (from the Japanese ""kamikaze"", which is pronounced more like ka-mi-ka-zeh for the record). Don't even get me started on the horrid action-movie-originated mistranslation/mispronunciation ""mano-ay-mano, man-to-man"", what is that I don't even. ""If I'm having a bad day, or a good day -- make that any kind of day -- I do not want people in shops whom I've never met to swaddle me with their sticky, earnest, exaggerated niceness. In America, actual humans say things like ""Ma'am, you have been an awesome customer today,"" just because I bought a box of tampons from their store."" That ""sticky, earnest, exaggerated niceness""? That there is FORCED on us. Retail workers in America -- especially in major chains! -- have a horrifying rate of ""job stress"" and depression, in part due to crappy wages, sure, but really because we get crappy wages and then have to fake cheer our way through the day, no matter how we actually feel, and no matter how poorly we're treated by jerk customers or unpleasant management, etc. Oh, and we have set scripts we have to follow! At my work, I'm literally supposed to react cheerfully and super-helpfully to EVERY customer that comes within my sight... within 5 seconds of spotting them. Literally! ""Within 5 seconds"", that is the CORPORATE mandated time-frame. Not just ""acknowledge them"", mind -- actually go through a whole script of ""Hello! How are you doing today? Are you finding everything you need?"", etc.... even if it's clear they're just browsing or don't want to be bothered, even if I'm with another customer, and oh yes, I'm supposed to walk them to whatever they're looking for (assuming they even are looking for something specific) instead of giving directions or pointing, whether it's one aisle over or all the way across the store, and with no consideration for whether I'm already in the middle of helping someone else or even if I don't know where it actually is or if we carry it! With a super-duper-upbeat smile the whole time! DDDDD And oh, I'm sorry, they aren't ""customers"" -- they are ""guests""! And we're not ""employees"", we're ""team members""! You see what I'm getting at here -- normal people don't talk or act like this. But we're not expected to behave like ""normal people"" -- we're a ""team"" that serves our ""guests"" slavishly, going above and beyond any reasonable measures, with relentless, perky concern for their well-being! Never mind that we're working for minimum wage and helping two other people, or that the person in question is looking for something literally a minimum two-minute walk if you're brisk about it, that we know absolutely nothing about. No, see, you're supposed to magically and devoutly help every single customer as if they were the Queen, or possibly the Second Coming of Christ, and also, to know everything about everything or damn well find out. Even if nobody in the goddamn store at the moment knows a damn thing about Whozits, you will damn well help that ""guest"" find herself the perfect Whozit, from halfway across the store, while somehow not abandoning every other ""guest"" who needs your cheerfully upbeat attention. Oh, and don't forget to ask about mailers! Do you get our coupons in the mail? Would you like to? Are you sure? Because they're really good coupons! In the mail! Also, on your phone! Oh you don't have a smartphone? Well, regular texting phones work too! Also, there are flyers! Here, take one, even though there's absolutely nothing the coupons will be good on because they always time the sales so the good stuff isn't eligible! Did I mention you can get our coupons in the mail? COUPONS! DDDDD (I'm only slightly exaggerating. We really are supposed to ask EVERY ""guest"" we've harassed, er, ""helped"", whether they are on our mailing list or not. It's obnoxious, but we get chastised if they catch us NOT doing it) Seriously, you complain here as if this is something all American shopworkers do unintentionally and without realizing what they're doing (or possibly, that it's something they do intentionally to spite you) and that surely, if you point out how annoying it is they will have a Eureka Moment and stop! But they won't. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO. The moment the cheer drops, either some entitled customer gets a bee in their bonnet about it and complains, or management notices and gets huffy about it. I'm sorry, but if the choice is ""fake concern and niceness for bitchy customers"" or ""lose my job that allows me to pay rent"", I'm obviously going to go with paying rent! ttp://www.facebook.com/wooden.thomas Wooden Thomas 1. I don't say that, nor do I love most British accents. 2.I really don't have a problem with the last name for a first name thing. Common names are boring. 3.I see what you're saying there.Sometime the wait staff just has to keep moving and lose awareness. 4.I don't mind positive energy even if it's shallow. As long as it's sincere. 5.I agree. Humility is knowledge.Dissent is true patriotism. 6.All creatures are equal , Animals should be treated with dignity, I'm not sure how dignified putting one in a baby carriage is... 7.I'm a vegetarian now but what I miss the most is the dark turkey ""drum stick"" or leg. Do you call it a drum stick over there? 8.Do you mean when we say Elvis Prezley? 9.We pronounce Fillet the French way. it's not pretentious. We pronounce Garage the French way too. In most regions the word herb, is pronounced with out the h. Do the British not say 'ead when they mean head? and 'ello when they mean hello. it's not pretentious. 10. I don't understand what you mean here, are you saying short hair that hangs over the forehead is called Fringes? Spencer I'd just like to point out that it's you Brits who are pretentious in your pronunciation by making every single foreign word common in English conform to English pronunciation, as if English is the best language ever. It's indicative of that annoying superiority complex you guys have had going since the Victorian Era. Vincent van ""Goth?"" Really? You know that's not how he would have pronounced his name, right? Maggie Sweetheart, you're way too young. I learned to say 'erb' instead of 'herb' in the U.K. as a child. Until you mentioned it I never thought of 'bangs', instead of 'fringe' as being a sexualized word. I still tend to put in my 'u""s in words like 'colour' and spell 'theatre' rather than the American 'theater'. However, i don't lift 'the bonnet', but the 'hood', and don't open the 'boot', but the 'trunk'. And while 'hood' brings up picture of Little Red Riding or the neighborhood gang hanging out, 'bonnet' brings up pictures of Little Bo Beep and Miss Muffet. As to our heartiness, agreed. As to our patriotism, agreed. On the other hand treating pets like children, well, there are more dangerous eccentricities in which one can indulge. And as for tendency to weird and wacky names, agreed. Whatever happened to John & Mary? Hey Ho, Giles! ttp://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1\\... Katherine Wolfe So you guys will really hate the phrase we use when one team has really trounced another -- we say they ""waxed their fannies."" Ouch! Donna Wow, LOL, this is bloody rubbish since Brits have these exact same flaws! Juliean wow is it me? Or did everyone really take this rant a little to seriously? I'm American but I've had the privilege of living in the UK for several years and I can't help but wonder if if everyone has lost the ability to read ""tongue in cheek?"" Seriously??!! biffula Wow, what a bundle of joy the author is. Now I remember why we ditched British rule. REDFL We still like you and will be very nice to you -- it's how we were raised. We sincerely don't care if you put an extra ""u"" in ""humour"", we get it and it's charming. Don't hate us because we're dorks. We didn't know that ""panties, fanny or bangs"" meant something naughty Taylor I'm American, sadly, and I find most of these things annoying as well. Mostly the 'panties' bit. I hate that word. That and the word that's used as a term for women's privates, and men who seen as weak. i refuse to say it, it's just gross to me. Brandon in other words you could say the letter ""u"" is ""useless"" ^_^ Tara Let me tell you folks the secret to making turkey taste good.........FRY IT. I mean...that's the secret to making anything taste good though, right? AmericanMade Ruth...I can appreciative your perspective. However, as a born and raised citizen of the United States of America , I can tell you without even a little guile...get over it. Your perception of spelling, for instance. It may seem harsh to you to read a Z instead of an S (and for the record I neither know nor care who decided to do it that way or why), but it can be equally distressing to others who see that the incessant use of the letter U serves only make a word longer with no change in pronunciation. In other words, I'll type a Z, you type an S and between us we'll both still realize/realise what the other is saying. As for your assertions on accents and pronunciation...you will find no less than 20 different ways to say the same thing within our country...so why fight it? This is also true in England. While I can appreciate and do LOVE, LOVE, LOVE every Londoner's accent, I can barely understand some of the people from Cornwall or Wales or Scotland, especially if they're hopping mad or have had too much to drink. How do you reconcile your delicate sensibilities on accentuation and pronunciation within your own kingdom if ours bother you this much? Besides, unless you add the accentual flourish, 'erb' doesn't even sound French. So just call it oregano, marjoram, thyme, basil, or whatever, and everyone will know what you're trying to say. You say 'shed-yool', I'll say 'skej-ool' and my neighbor Dolly Whittington will say 'agenda'. Again, we can all figure out what the other is saying without the need to let minor annoyances dig under our skin. For the record, I don't know WHOSE turkey you've been eating all these years, but the ones my family makes are not dry or stringy or insipid. If there's a cuisine we regularly screw up in this country it is the cooking of veal, lamb, duck and goose. Turkey is something we do right in my neck of the woods, so feel free to stop in and have some any time you want juicy fowl. A fair warning though, should you decide to take me up on my offer, you will have to pass under a normal sized flag of my country on your way to the front door. Not twelve...just one. I don't have them hanging from every tree limb, from the car, or tattooed all over my arms. My residence isn't trying to double for a courthouse square on Independence Day. But there is ONE and it will wave to you happily on a breezy day. For all that I have disagreed with you I DO agree with you on the ridiculous naming trends, the lightning-quick removal of my dinner plate (because I tend to eat fast too), and the over-the-top insanity and prevalence of ""pet worshippers"" in this country -- a side note on this, you only saw dogs in the stroller...wait until you see the dog in a stroller and the little kid crawling BEHIND it...then you'll really flip. I too hate the words ""panties"" and ""fanny"" and have never, ever, EVER had to use either in any conversation in my life, but ""bangs"" is totally legit and I proudly wear them. And while I'm glad you decided to live here, let me say that perhaps it's New York that's got you down on Americans. Take a visit to a more normal place and you might enjoy more of what you see and hear. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
35604	An employee who has been dismissed can only challenge this by taking a personal grievance . Employees cannot pursue a claim for wrongful dismissal under common law, as was possible under previous legislation. Choice of procedure In some situations, employees who believe they have a personal grievance may also be able to complain under the Human Rights Act. This may happen, for example, when an employee believes they have been discriminated against, sexually harassed or racially harassed. Employees must choose either to take a personal grievance through to the Authority or to take their claim under the Human Rights Act. They cannot use both procedures for the same complaint. Raising a personal grievance with the employer An employee must let the employer know about his or her personal grievance, and that they want something done about it, within 90 days of the action complained of, or the date they became aware of it, whichever is the later. If the employer is not told about the personal grievance within 90 days, the employer need not consider it unless the Employment Relations Authority allows the employee to raise it after 90 days. The Authority will only allow that if it accepts that the delay was caused by exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances include situations where: the employee was so affected or traumatised by the action complained of that he or she was unable to consider raising the grievance in time the employee made reasonable arrangements with an agent to raise the personal grievance on the employee's behalf, but the employee's agent unreasonably failed to do so in time the employee's employment agreement does not contain a plain language explanation of services available to help sort out employment relations problems the employer has failed to respond to an employee's request to give the employee a written statement of the reasons for the dismissal (see below). Employer's reasons for dismissal An employee who has been dismissed may ask the employer for a written statement setting out the reasons for the dismissal. They must do this within 60 days after the dismissal or after the date they became aware of it, whichever is later. The employer must give the statement to the employee within 14 days after being asked. This information may be important in later efforts to resolve the problem. Also, if the employer does not provide this statement, the employee will be able to raise a personal grievance after the 90-day period. Three-year limitation period on personal grievances Employees may not start a personal grievance action in the Employment Relations Authority or the Employment Court more than three years after they have raised it with the employer.

21617	"10 of the Harshest Sentences for Pot in the U.S. The punishments for pot do not fit the crime. AlterNet / By Kristen Gwynne October 26, 2012 ttp://www.alternet.org/drugs/10-harshest-sentences-pot-us?page=0%2C0 Most Americans want pot to be legal, and as many as 70% of Americans want to legalize it for medical use. Nonetheless, the war on pot rages on. The Obama administration has actually increased raids on state-sanctioned medical pot programs, prosecuting both patients and their providers. Medical pot defendants have little protection in the justice system, which denies as evidence mention of their marijuana prescription or state-sanctioned use. A review of some of the sentences over the past few decades -- punishments that plague individuals for decades, even after release -- reveals the injustice of the drug war. Here's a rundown of the people who received the harshest penalties handed down for pot in recent history. 1. Christopher Williams A Montana medical marijuana provider is facing 82 to 85 years behind bars, due to mandatory minimum laws linked to some of his charges. Convicted of crimes like manufacturing marijuana, intent to distribute and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, Christopher Williams appeared to be in the for the worst. But in a rare move this September, U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter offered to drop four of Williams? charges and bring his sentencing down to ?as little as 10 years,? so long as Williams waived his right to appeal. Williams refused the offer on moral grounds. The case isn?t about medical pot, says Williams, whose judge prohibited discussion of Montana?s medical marijuana program at trial. Rather, he says, it is about government abuse of power. ?I have decided to fight the federal government, because for me not defending the things that I know are right is dishonorable,? Williams wrote to the Independent Record , ?Every citizen has a responsibility to fight for what is right, even if it seems like the struggle will be lost.? Michael Donahoe, Williams? attorney, said that federal prosecutors often bring gun charges against medical marijuana defendants without the intent to prosecute them. Rather, they are hoping for a plea bargain -- one Williams is not willing to take. ?We know this for two reasons,? Donahoe told the Missoulan, ?First, because the government readily agreed to dismiss the firearms counts for virtually every other medical marijuana defendant in those cases where firearms violations had been charged. And second, because insofar as [Williams?] ?conspiracy? is concerned, every other defendant had no real choice but to plead guilty in exchange for the firearms charges being dropped.? He added, ?Given the government?s conduct here that was a false choice inspired by an abusive exercise of government power, considering that it was the government?s reckless decision to change its medical marijuana policy that was the first cause of all these problems.? 2. Patricia Spottedcrow Oklahoma mother of four Patricia Spottedcrow learned firsthand how a small-time pot bust can completely derail an offender?s life. A $31 pot sale got her a stunning 12-year prison sentence. In the two years she has been incarcerated, she has seen her children only twice. What?s more, her good behavior behind bars, including completing her GED and other self-improvement programs, has not reduced the confusing back-and-forth from the Pardon and Parole Board. A judge recently reduced Spottedcrow?s sentence to eight years, because ?she needs more time to prepare and mature.? The latest frustration in her case came at the close of this summer, when the parole board withdrew her parole restrictions before suspending them, delaying her beginning of a work-release program. She spent just minutes at the work-release facility, Hillside Correctional Center in Oklahoma City, before being sent back in cuffs to Eddie Warrior Correctional Center in Taft. Unfortunately for Spottedcrow and her family, who are surviving on a limited income, they can afford to make the trip to make the trip to Hillside, but not to Eddie Warrior. Spottedcrow told KFOR-TV in Oklahoma, ?I?m not gonna give up until I walk out the gate...I?ve got my mom and my kids out there waiting on me. Whatever it takes to get me to them I?m going to do it. I?ve been doing it.? 3. Jonathan Magbie Jonathan Magbie's story is a stunning example of the cruelty that can accompany an arrest for medical marijuana. Paralyzed from the neck down after being hit by a drunk driver at the age of four, Magpie was charged with marijuana possession in 2004 after cops found a joint and a loaded gun in a vehicle in which he was the passenger. Though he had never been convicted of a criminal offense and required medical assistance 20 hours a day, he was given a 10-day sentence in a DC jail. With no ventilator to sustain his breathing, he died in jail four days later. Magbie?s marijuana punishment was a death sentence. Without their medication behind bars, pot patients who make it out alive have endured days, weeks or years without their medication. Even after release, conditions of parole, including urine tests, may prevent patients from accessing their medicine. 4. Robert Platshorn Robert Platshorn is famous for being a marijuana trafficker. A leader of what the DEA dubbed the ""Black Tuna Gang,"" Platshorn spent the mid- to late-'70s smuggling weed into the US from Colombia before he was busted in 1978. Authorities accused him of importing as much as 500 tons of pot, and Platshorn gained infamy for his connection to what the DEA said was the most sophisticated drug operation it had seen yet. He was sentenced to 30 years, 28 of which he served until he was released on parole in 2008. Because Platshorn served nearly the full length of his sentence, he has taken on another label, this time as the man believed to have spent the most time locked up for pot in America. Now almost 70 years old, Platshorn is a marijuana activist who has managed to stay in the public eye. He recently toured America with the Silver Tour, speaking with seniors about medical marijuana. His most recent brush with law enforcement went down this summer. In May 2011, Platshorn received a letter from the parole board apparently releasing him from service. But this July, after his parole officer had passed away and two days before he was to speak before the American Bar Association, a new parole officer named Scott Kirsche showed up at his door and demanded he give a urine sample. Platshorn -- who says his former parole officer allowed him to travel to pot-related events and also approved his use of cannabis oil for skin cancer -- failed the test and was ordered to immediately stop treating his cancer with cannabis oil. Then, in one of the most shocking elements of Platshorn?s life story, he received what is effectively a gag order: Platshorn told South Florida?s Sun Sentenial that he is banned from travel ?to promote the legalization of marijuana without the express permission of the U.S. Parole Commission.? Platshorn was specifically told not to appear at an upcoming High Times medical event in San Francisco, and to cut ties with patient and fellow Silver Tour board member Irvin Rosenfeld. In July, U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks ordered Platshorn to remain under parole supervision, while claiming his request for freedom to speak at marijuana-related events conflicts with his criminal record. 5. Will Foster US Army veteran and business-owner Will Foster was suffering from widespread rheumatoid arthritis when he started growing marijuana. In 1997, Oklahoma police discovered his marijuana garden and just $28 cash after a ?confidential informant? helped them procure a ?John Doe? search warrant for methamphetamine. His sentence was reduced to 20 years and he was paroled to California in 2001. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections was unhappy when Foster completed parole, and attempted to extradite him back to Oklahoma -- a fight Foster won. But in 2008, Foster?s marijuana grow, legal by California standards, was raided. Foster sat in a California jail for a year before local authorities dropped the charges. Unfortunately for Foster, Oklahoma officials showed up at the Calif. jail, shackled Foster and drove him back to Oklahoma, where he remained until he was released in late November 2009. 6. John Avery In 1994, more than 50 DEA agents, local police and sheriffs raided wheelchair-bound John Avery?s 50-acre property. They discovered 1,250 pot plants in an underground marijuana garden. Police arrested Avery's son-law, Ricky Daniels, and a friend, David Tapley. Collectively, the two implicated Daniels? wife Michele, John Avery, Avery?s deceased son, and his daughter Sheri. The five names were enough to charge John Avery with ?continuing a criminal enterprise.? Michele admitted that her dead brother had probably been involved in the grow, but she and the rest of her family claimed to be entirely in the dark about the operation. Despite lack of physical evidence (save for one fingerprint on a piece of portable equipment), the words of Daniels and Tapley alone were enough to take them to court. For their cooperation, Daniels was sentenced five years while Tapley got two and a half. Michele is serving 10 years; Sheri is serving six and a half, and John is doing 58. John Avery's wife, Eddie, has become the caretaker for Sheri?s two sons and Michele?s disabled daughter. ?They basically killed my whole family,? John Avery wrote. ?They took me and my daughters away from their mother, my wife, and their children, my grandchildren.? 7. Bryan Epis The first California medical marijuana provider to be arrested and convicted for growing pot, Bryan Epis is a bit of a martyr in the medical marijuana movement. Epis? saga began in 1997, when police arrested him for growing more than 100 marijuana plants in the basement of his Chicago home. Epis testified that he was growing pot for himself and four other patients and sending the excess to a medical cannabis buyers? club. A jury found him guilty of growing more than 100 plants, as well as conspiracy to grow more than 1,000 plants. He was given a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, toughened in part by his proximity to a local high school. After two years in federal prison, the 9th US Court Circuit granted Epis freedom pending the resolution of Raich v. Gonzalez , which actually turned out to be more bad news. The US Supreme Court ruled that federal drug prohibition trumps state medical pot laws. In 2007, Epis was resentenced to 10 years, but was free pending appeal on $500,000 bail. In 2010, he went back to prison, and this summer, his sentence was reduced to 90 months. But there was a catch: Epis cannot advocate for marijuana policy reform during his sentence or his first 10 years of freedom, when he will be on ?supervised release.? 8. The Young Family Clyde and Patricia Young were living with their eight children in Alabama near the border of Mississippi, surrounded by the property of wealthy businessman J.P. Altmire, when Altmire decided he wanted their land. When the Youngs refused to sell, he wrote 36 letters to lawyers, prosecutors and the local sheriff calling the family ?troublemakers.? In August 1988, the Young's eldest son was arrested for cultivating marijuana on Altmire property. Authorities tore up the Young?s home with pickshovels, and police seized all the money they had, including the children?s piggy banks and a 90-year-old uncle?s social security check. They did not find any drugs. A year later, police raided the home again, this time arresting the entire family. The Youngs learned at indictment that drug residue, a scale and a notebook of names and amounts of money were uncovered in a 1986 raid on Clyde Young's mother?s hunt club. At trial, the judge and Altmire?s former lawyer and friend, Charles Butler, did not allow the defense to admit as evidence the letters Altmire sent to local authorities. The prosecution?s witnesses included, as with many cases, criminals who may have been implicating others to reduce their own sentences. Clyde and Patricia, as well as four of their children, were found guilty of possession and conspiracy to distribute marijuana in an ongoing criminal enterprise. Clyde got 26 years; Patricia got 24; and their four children received sentences ranging from three to 15 years. Patricia and the four children have since been released, but Clyde is still serving his time. 9. James Cox James Cox suffered from testicular cancer that had spread to his stomach, and marijuana helped not only increase his appetite, but also helped him to cope with the pain. Addicted to Demerol after 15 years on the medication, he found that marijuana helped him to take less of the narcotic and still manage his chronic pain. In the late ?80s, police discovered his cannabis garden while investigating an attempted burglary at his home. James was sentenced to 15 years, his wife to five. Authorities also confiscated the home he and his wife, Pat, had inherited from her mother. The future looked so grim the couple attempted suicide while out on bond. Cox?s sentence was eventually given a stay, but when Cox was arrested for growing marijuana again, he was sent back to jail. In 1995, he wrote that being incarcerated led to ?constant discomfort? he believed to be ?a direct result of not having the medical benefits of marijuana.? His stomach ?deteriorated to the point where I could not eat anything due to incurable bleeding ulcers.? After almost five years in prison, Cox was finally released on parole. 10. John Knock John Knock received two life sentences plus 20 years behind bars for his alleged involvement in marijuana trafficking from Pakistan and Lebanon to the United States and Canada in the mid-'90s. Knock was living in Hawaii when he was extradited to Florida, a state in which he had never lived, to face charges related to a reverse sting because of his connection to an indicted San Francisco smuggler. The only evidence against him was the testimony of informants, and yet Knock is on track to die behind bars. While a life sentence for marijuana may seem incredibly rare, it has been handed to multiple nonviolent offenders. (For more information, visit www.lifeforpot.com. ) In 1992, Mark Young received a life sentence for playing the role of middleman in a large pot sale. That same year, Larry Jackson, a man with a long rap sheet of small-time, nonviolent offenses, received a life sentence for a minuscule amount of pot -- 1/100th of a gram -- and a tiny bit of cocaine. As Eric Schlosser wrote in Reefer Madness , Oklahoma has some of the harshest punishments for pot, but it is not the only state handing down life sentences for the plant: In Oklahoma City, Leland James Dodd was given two life sentences, plus ten years, for buying fifty pounds of marijuana from undercover officers in a ""reverse sting."" Oklahoma is not alone in handing out life sentences for buying marijuana from the government. In Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, William Stephen Bonner, a truck driver, was sent away for life without possibility of parole after state narcotics agents delivered forty pounds of marijuana to his bedroom. Raymond Pope a resident of Georgia, was lured to Baldwin County, Alabama, in 1990 with promises of cheap marijuana; he bought twenty-seven pounds from local sheriffs in a reverse sting, was convicted, and was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Pope's criminal record consisted of prior convictions for stealing televisions and bedspreads from Georgia motels. He is now imprisoned 400 miles from his family. He has three young children. Years behind bars is not the only way marijuana offenders are punished. Other consequences of marijuana prohibition are often far more devastating than the use of the drug itself. Students can lose their financial aid; the tiniest bit of weed can lead to a child neglect charge (and removal of children from the home); and drug tests can cause skilled workers to be fired and lose their government benefits. The punishments for pot do not fit the crime, especially when most Americans want marijuana legal. But until we demand an end to 75 years of pot prohibition, we will continue to spend tax dollars prosecuting marijuana criminals. "	Forum	News
32106	"advice needed please Hello everyone. So, my visa has been granted & I am itching to get my flight booked so I can look forward to it but do not want to rush into anything in case I make a bad decision. My plan is to book a flight to Perth for the end of February & visit some relatives & maybe stay for a month or so depending on work etc. Then I would head North up to Broome and Darwin in about May time, stay here for a month or so & then move on to Cairns in About August & stay here for a few months until summer kicks in & then head back down the East coast & finishing up in Sydney for Xmas & New Year & then to Melbourne for my last month or so & then maybe stay another year. Does this sound like a good plan, firstly for the weather? When is rainy season up North? I've heard Cairns is party town , would I be there at the right time? Secondly to fit in 3 months of seasonal work. I am a carpenter & after reading the sticky about seasonal work it sounds like I could work in construction wherever I go which would qualify, is this correct? Where is the mining work? Where are most of the fruit picking/farming jobs? I do not want to have to squeeze this in at the end if it is mostly over on the East Coast. So if I do it as I plan then would there be enough opportunities for me to do my seasonal work? Is it Easy Enough to travel up the west coast & is there any cheap ways of doing this? Another problem I have is that I would like to go to NZ to do some Skiing but I am presuming the skiing weather for NZ is May - September, when I will be in North Australia. How hard is it to get from north Oz to NZ, is it just as easy as going from south Oz? Sorry I have so many questions I just do not want to be going to all the wrong places at the wrong times. It is the official book for seasonal work and tells you what is in season when and where. At the beginning of each chapter about a state there is a chart giving you a summary of what is being harvest when. It is quite handy, but you also have to keep in mind that at the very beginning and towards the end of each season there could be nothing to do. Also, there might just be bad crops this year. When I was traveling in 2011, I could not find any jobs from Brisbane to Darwin to Broome because it was a ridiculously bad harvest season. That being said, it is normally easy to pick up harvest work all over Australia, so it is not at all limited to the East coast. Also you are right that you can easily find jobs as a carpenter. Mining work is mostly in Western Australia und Queensland, but I don't really know anything about that. Regarding your travel plans: Wet Season up North is roughly til May. That means if you are driving yourself you might run into trouble between Broome and the Northern Territory Border because early in the dry season just means the rain has stopped but the water has not subsided yet. Also keep in mind that it can still be rainy, very humid and super hot. If you can handle that, you shouldn't have a problem, if not try to come up here about June/July. The rest of your travel plan sounds just fine. Traveling up the west coast is not a problem, just a long way to drive at times (but then again, that's true for most of Australia ). Staying around Port Hedland is quite difficult because of the overpriced hotels/caravan parks/everything, but there are free roadside places you can sleep at if you don't mind that. And one last thing to keep in mind if you should be traveling by car: 1st Kangaroos really go crazy up north after dusk. Unless you have a roobar on your car and don't mind hitting a few of them, just don't drive in the dark. 2nd petrol prices can be a lot higher in the north of Western Australia and the Northern Territory (apart from Darwin). As you can see, I don't really know anything about the East Coast or flying to NZ, so maybe someone else can help out with this? Ok thanks for the good advice, that link to the harvest jobs was really helpful. Mainly by showing that there are opportunities for work pretty much everywhere at every time of year which is a big relief. I do not really want to do carpentry as I can do this at home so I will be glad to take on any available jobs if the money is right. I don't know how I will be getting about, probably by public transport unless I can find somebody who wants to car share. Is it cheap enough to get up the west coast by public transport? Thanks for your help And here is the official website where you can find out about the different tickets (They've got tickets for from A to B, or you can by a ticket with a certain amount of kilometres on etc): Welcome to Greyhound Australia Just one more tip for the West coast: Between Broome and the Northern Territory, try to squeeze the Gibb River Road in. Greyhound doesn't do it as it is a 4WD track, but there are other companys that offer trips. Yes that looks like a good way to travel up but I guess I'll meet people in hostels who are travelling the same route & I could tag along with them. Just have to see how things pan out when I get there & go with the flow. Cheers By using this Website, you agree to abide by our Terms and Conditions (the ""Terms"").

36133	"Our Web Site July 07, 2005 This blog got me started with a completely different form of using technology to explore and communicate. I had so much fun with it that I expanded and moved over to SignalHealth (link now inactive).  And I learned even more over there. Westchester County Medical Center, still another hospital to save, but not quite yet . But never fear. The legislative session's is far from over. I'd still put money on some kind of deal being worked out here. Of course, the local folks want it saved (and assume that requires State money). June 27, 2005 We have a new contributor, Tom Hilliard, over at www.signalhealth.com . He describes himself as ""a former health care policy wonk, former political hack, former labor consultant for health care unions, former Washington DC political activist."" He's already published a couple of well-written, thought-provoking posts. Come on over and take a look. And for those of you who've never visited www.signalhealth.com , though inspired by this site, it offers much, much more. June 24, 2005 In It's Only a Matter of When , we set the stage a bit with our discussion of subsystems overwhelming the systems of which they are a part and which support them, especially with financial resources and how that triggers system responses. The example we used was of the loss of coverage. Let's now discuss the implications for universal coverage generally and single-payer, in particular. The system structures and associated dynamics in It's Only a Matter of When help explain the rising numbers of uninsured, which are themselves much of the political impetus for some form of universal coverage. But, unless we're foolish, the leap to some form of universal coverage also requires that we create the structures in a new system to counterbalance those forces. Otherwise, we will simply transfer the associated problems from one coverage system to another. Growth in healthcare costs at rates greater than the rest of the economy will continue to cause more people to become uninsured - the gap that universal coverage would fill. But a one-time jump in transfers from the rest of the economy to healthcare that would accompany a political move to universal coverage would not, by itself, change the system structures that create these dynamics. Thus, any move to universal coverage must take those inflationary structures into account and deal with them as part of reform. Certainly no reform should weaken the counterbalances that exist today, much less create new inflationary incentives. Contrary to the rhetoric of many single-payer advocates, we cannot do this by relying solely on reduced administrative costs. Perhaps politically and rhetorically attractive, that's a dangerous distraction. Instead, we must face up to core healthcare costs and their continual rise and we must find effective means of counterbalancing them. The rejection of the Clinton plan, in part, because of the canard that it would have limited consumer choice, marked the beginning of a consumer revolution that rejected all limits on choice, thus virtually all cost-control mechanisms. So discussions of how we'll reshape the delivery system under a particular universal health care system to control costs probably miss the point, which is that the American public may not allow costs to be controlled under any model. (which is why I think it makes sense to target administration and marketing costs, since those may be the only excess costs truly on the table.) One of Tom's implicit assumptions is that only by limiting choice can we control costs. I'm not sure that's true. I've certainly seem mechanisms that had the effect of reducing costs without limiting choice. Indeed, I've even seen cost reductions result by giving the patient more choice leverage (through deeper education about their options), but I don't want to dwell on that here. Rather, momentarily granting Tom's assumption about unfettered choice, let's look at his next point, ""the American public may not allow costs to be controlled under any model."" Yes, they will. They may hate it. They may resist. They may claw and scratch, but, even under a single-payer system, ultimately they will have no choice but to allow cost controls politically. Why? Because continual and accumulative healthcare cost growth that exceeds the rate of growth of the economy that pays for it and supports it will sooner or later, but inevitably run into a ""Decision/Behavioral Change Threshold"" such as we discussed and depicted here . At that point the larger system (the rest of the economy in this case) will push back and say, ""no more."" (More likely the wording would be a bit more aggressive.) The healthcare sector will have to live and content itself with X percent of the nation's economic resources. Pick your own percentage threshold. Fifteen percent? A bit over where we are today. Twenty? Maybe. Fifty? You must be kidding. The American public which had previously rebelled over ""lack of choice"" would have long before furiously rebelled over the tax burdens associated with that level of economic commitment. Why would it be otherwise? The point here is not to argue what the trigger level would be. Rather it is to simply say that structurally, such a trigger level will be an intrinsic part of the system and pulling the trigger is a matter of when, not if. Tom, then using the single-payer advocate argument, goes on to say: ... which is why I think it makes sense to target administration and marketing costs, since those may be the only excess costs truly on the table. Over the last few years, the administrative costs argument has become the centerpiece of the rationale for single-payer advocates. This is dangerous. Whether large or small, administrative costs are an ""add-on"" to core healthcare costs. They rise with the increases in core healthcare costs, which the single-payer proposal does nothing explicit to address. All the systems we're discussing, reformed or otherwise have and will have some form of counterbalancing mechanisms. Whether in the present system or embedded in a single-payer system, the same generic system structures will produce the same generic system behaviors. It's best to  think about the nature of these counterbalances  consciously in advance of reform and to discuss them openly. The administrative savings rhetoric is more than a distraction. The rhetoric of many single-payer advocates supports at least implies more dramatic, perhaps radical controls on core healthcare costs: It does this in comparisons to other nations' healthcare systems which devote to healthcare much smaller shares of overall economic capacity. If the US spends 14 percent of GDP on healthcare and another system spends 10 percent, we must ask of the single-payer advocate, are you suggesting that the US move toward 10 percent? Are you suggesting that we cap the US system at 14 percent while other nations catch up? If two of the 14 percent is for administration and we can eliminate that, will we then cap healthcare's share at 12 percent? And, especially after dismantling the administrative controls, in any of these cases, how would we do that? Most single-payer proposals include or imply some form of price controls. Today that's often aimed at the current villain, pharmaceutical firms. But price controls certainly wouldn't be limited to such firms, they would apply to all forms of healthcare included in the benefit package. A single-payer systems would be a monopsony (single buyer rather than a single seller monopoly). Its leverage over hospitals and physicians and most other services would be near total. Service use controls would be of two types, implicit and explicit. Price controls will inevitably have a hidden, implicit effect on service. Priced low enough, no one will sell a service. So patients would have complete freedom of choice to seek services ... that no one sells. In part, this is just an extreme version of the waiting line effect. Explicit service use controls would no doubt emerge as well. Assume for the moment, that we could have a single-payer solution and universal coverage with zero administrative costs. We would have received a one-time savings. But would we still have a healthcare cost problem? Would healthcare costs continue to rise faster than the rest of the economy? Clearly yes. And therein lies the problem. Because as this new administration-free, single-payer system consumed an increasing share of gross domestic product, eventually the rest of the economy, the taxpayers would limit the resources available to healthcare As I discussed before, I've never found the administrative cost argument compelling except in the extreme short term. If single-payer advocates were actually able to make the sale to the American public, they would shortly thereafter find themselves accused of a ""bait and switch"" because the core costs, for healthcare services would continue to grow faster than the rest of the economy and there would be little alternative but to impose administrative controls on service, both raising administrative costs and creating exactly the sort of problems they had promised to avoid. Not a pretty picture. Any credible reform proposal must include the means by which core healthcare cost growth will be constrained to some fixed percentage of our society's economic capacity or it will necessarily fail. Any universal coverage system must directly face up to how the core costs will be controlled. This can be done bureaucratically or it must leave individuals and families the ability to choose among different systems of care and financing and do so with a financial incentive that creates a counterbalance to healthcare's core inflationary forces. Individuals and families must play an active role in the choices that affect them and their decision making must include personal trade-offs regarding service choice and cost. Even more than in the present system, in a healthcare system with universal coverage, core healthcare costs will be controlled by the rest of the economy. This can be done arbitrarily to patients and physicians and I fear that arbitrary means will be the only ones available in a single-payer system. We must find functional and politically acceptable means of restraining growth in core healthcare costs. At best, tinkering solely with administrative costs avoids finding a solution to the more serious problem, even worse, it's a distraction. Worst of all, it may undermine our ability to confront the greater challenges. June 23, 2005 Oh! We should be so relieved. Healthcare spending growth has slowed to a mere eight percent. Our last post suggests not. The news from the Center for Studying Health Systems Change is that healthcare spending growth has slowed a bit. The report is published in Health Affairs . Our prior post was a jumping off point to a larger discussion the central point of health economics in the US today. So long as growth in healthcare spending exceeds the rate of growth in the rest of the economy, which pays for healthcare, the day of reckoning is inevitable. Health care spending increased 8.2 percent in 2004. This was virtually unchanged from 2003, which suggests that health care cost trends have stabilized. Hospital spending grew 10.1 percent in 2004, also virtually unchanged from 2003, reflecting a small increase in the hospital utilization trend and a small decline in hospital price inflation. Meanwhile, growth in prescription drug spending continued to fall as a result of slower growth in prices. Growth in health insurance premiums slowed again in 2005, likely reflecting earlier years' slowing in cost trends and signaling that a turn in the insurance underwriting cycle might be under way. So why isn't the slowdown in healthcare cost growth satisfying? Because healthcare cost growth, as it has almost every year in the past decade (there were two early exceptions before the managed care backlash), and essentially for decades has exceeded growth in the rest of the economy or GDP overall and that only takes us closer to trouble. Most immediately, as we discussed below , it forces people out of the coverage system. The more recent source data are here . So headlines and links (here and here too) that even modestly celebrate this slowing of healthcare cost growth largely miss the point. Unless the slowdown is to a growth level less than the economic rate of growth, then we have not reversed our race to the day of reckoning. We might have slowed a bit, but not reversed. Moreover, these trends have a direct bearing on our discussions of universal coverage and why single-payer is a less than satisfactory response. That will be the subject of my next post. This post is about behavioral change, particularly as it relates to health economics and the healthcare system. The essentials, the mechanics if you will, apply similarly to individuals, organizations, and the place of healthcare in general economy. The next couple of posts will be based on it and I'll likely refer to it many times in the future. Before we get started, answer the following questions: If you and your family had (or have) to pay for your healthcare coverage directly, at what percentage of your family income would you be forced to seek less expensive coverage, even if it were more restrictive? Answer: __________ If you and your family had (or have) to pay for your healthcare coverage directly, at what percentage of your family income would you be forced to drop your coverage? Answer: __________ Put your answers aside for a moment. We'll return to them shortly. Some of this may look fairly complex, but it's not really. Just follow it step-by-step and you'll see what's going on both in the post and, more importantly, you will see how trouble is inevitable or perhaps why we're already in trouble. So don't bail out on me quite yet. Take a look at the following Chart 1, The Impending US Healthcare Crisis: Why it is Only a Matter of When: What do we see? We see economic growth E (with the random ups and downs taken out for simplicity). As is typically the case, it curves upward, representing exponential or compounding growth. We see D ""$ at Some Percentage of the Economy"" which parallels the economy itself. For example, this curve might represent 10 or 20 percent of the economy. Because it's a percentage, it grows at exactly the same rate as the economy. We also see H, Healthcare Spending. Note that, consistent with a lengthening history in the US, the rate of growth is faster than the economy (E) and faster than at $ at Some Percentage of the Economy (D). Because it grows faster, eventually it overtakes and crosses D at a point we have labeled ""Decision/Behavioral Change Threshold."" Then something changes. Now what might that ""Decision/Behavioral Change Threshold"" be? Let's return to the questions you answered at the beginning. (You did answer them didn't you?) Let's assume that you answered that at 15 percent of your family income you would have to drop coverage. Beyond that, regardless of the risk, it would be just too expensive to pay the monthly premiums. Your family circumstances and decision behavioral change are represented in Chart 1. Here's how. Your income is represented by Economy (E). Your 15 percent personal decision threshold is represented by ""$ at Some Percentage of the Economy"" (D). Premium growth is represented by Healthcare Spending (H). You drop coverage where the lines cross and at time T1. You may use the same chart to think of movement to more restrictive coverage. Assume that as the cost of coverage approached your 15 percent threshold (say at 12 or 13 percent), straining to maintain some form of protection, you might seek less expensive coverage. The chart will work in exactly the same way. Now what happens if economic growth slows, healthcare costs accelerate, or you ability to devote a set percentage of your economic capacity to healthcare diminishes? Chart 2 shows slower economic growth combined with healthcare cost growth the same as in the base case in Chart 1. Chart 4 shows a lower Decision/Behavior Change Threshold. For example, if you would be forced to drop coverage at five or 10 rather than 15 percent of your family income as would generally be the case for lower income families, then the Threshold would be lower relative to the family Economy. What Charts 2 through 4 have in common is that all produce a change in behavior at an earlier time. Slower economic growth, faster healthcare cost growth, or a lower percentage of your economic resources that can be devoted to healthcare all cause you to drop coverage earlier. Pick your own markets of economic growth. Pick your own measures of economic capacity. Consider this at the most macro-economic level or at the personal level. The same effects result. If a system consistently grows faster than a larger system in which it resides, eventually an intersection is reached at which the behaviors of one or the other, or both change less the larger system be overwhelmed. But even being overwhelmed will generally yield a behavioral change (think uncontrolled cancerous cells overwhelming an organ or body and eventually killing it). What has been happening is that healthcare costs consistently outgrow the rest of the economy - which pays for healthcare. Increasingly individuals, families, employers, and governments capacity to carry the cost are being overwhelmed. So their behavior changes. In some cases, they seek increasingly stronger means of maintaining a financial relationship with the healthcare system. But in other instances, their behavioral change is to simply walk away. Thus, increasing numbers of uninsured. We don't all reach the intersection at the same time or at the same rate. The same is true for employers and governments. But, sooner or later, given the underlying structural relationships and dynamics, the vast majority of individuals and the economy overall will arrive at that intersection. Tennessee and other states arrived at it earlier this year with their Medicaid programs. General Motors appears to be at the doorstep right now. In contrast, for the time being, it appears that the Federal government has chosen to spend a higher portion of its economic capacity (tax revenue plus debt) on Medicare. Yet, when we consider projections for the Medicare Trust Fund, clearly the day of reckoning is not that far away. I'm going to make a brazen assertion here: If you want to understand what is happening in healthcare and if you want to anticipate what will be happening, then the single most important measurements to track are overall healthcare spending, the carrying capacity of the economy that's paying for it (whether family, regional, employer, governmental, or macro-economic), and their relationships to one another. With healthcare cost growth rates exceeding economic growth rates, the larger the gap between growth rates in healthcare spending and economic capacity, the closer the day of reckoning. With a 4-2 vote, the Court dismissed the Consumers Union suit that challenged the transaction as unconstitutional. Empire did its IPO in late 2002, while creating a parent, WellChoice. Under the conversion plan approved by the State 95% of the funds (about $1 billion, was for salary supplements for healthcare workers, with the remaining 5% going to create a healthcare foundation. Arguing that salary increases were not a proper use of funds which had been amassed by virture of Empire's tax-exempt status, Consumers Union won a restraining order barring spending the money until there was a ruling on the conversion's legality. They favored other forms of community health initiatives. For those concerned about the public policy issues involved in such conversions, this pretty much ends the debate in New York. For those concerned with NYS finances and the age-old question, where's the money going, this means that the resulting funds the State was counting on for its own purposes are now secure. Hospitals and 1199 will get a substantial portion of the money. It also likely clears the way for the next conversion, that of HIP . DASNY, New York's public authority which does health care financings did not do the Cabrini deal . So, at least the State isn't involved in making its own work more difficult. Had a short, but useful conversation with a DASNY staff person who reminded me that the law creating the Commission lists a number of factors besides debt to be taken into consideration. And of course, very few hospitals have no debt. So, if that were the most important criterion, there wouldn't be many potential targets left. But the truth of it is that the folks at Cabrini aren't the only ones who think that way. Far, far from it. And, if you're running an institution that's a potential State target anyway, you may as well make it as challenging as possible. Well despite my description of this decision as outrageous, it is rational. The reason it's unsurprising is that we have a system at work in New York in which such behavior is rational. That's the larger and much more important problem. This decision is symptomatic but it's not the disease itself. Somewhere in the files is a presentation I used to do on ""The Regulatory Loop,"" on how many regulatory behaviors (in any industry) lead the regulated to shift their focus from improved efficiency and improved quality to reduced competition, regulated price fixing, and regulatory compliance as a proxy for true quality, and ultimately to view the regulator as the customer. These behaviors, perfectly understandable lead to higher costs and lower quality and then more regulation and oversight. And then? June 17, 2005 Cabrini Medical Center has refinanced its mortgage, after the loan was nearly paid off, Crain's says.  Crain's calls the refinancing  ""part of a two-pronged approach to surviving the machinations of the hospital-closing commission,"" because hospitals that have mortgages ""are less likely to be candidates for closure."" How unsurprising and how outrageous. The ""regulatory mindset"" doesn't just exist in the minds of regulators. Its more insidious form exists in the minds of the regulated. It manifests in decisions that are designed solely to influence the regulatory system and are often otherwise unhealthy, even self-destructive. We've seen it with debt; we've seen it with indigent care subsidies; we've seen it with deliberately weakened balance sheets designed to become eligible for extra subsidies as ""financially distressed hospitals."" And, by the way, which hospitals in New York don't have mortgages? They've been doing projects and taking on debt for decades in order to increase their cash flow from the reimbursement system (the excess of depreciation over amortization during the earlier years of mortgage life) as well as to protect themselves in exactly the manner that Cabrini has done. When the debt is small the debtor is in trouble. When the debt is mammoth, it's the creditor that's in trouble. I've sent a note off to the DASNY , the State's public authority for such financings,  asking whether it did this financing. If DASNY rather than a private entity, did the financing, then Cabrini's position is even stronger because the State will have a bigger stake in their survival. Its already on the hook for about $10 billion in healthcare debt in New York. Perhaps there should be a moratorium on new financings until the Commission's work is done. The analytical test for the Commission will be to ferret out similar cases that have not been so blatant. The test of its courage will be whether it resists gaming the system like this and resists itself being manipulated so blatantly. Actually I was coming from a different angle that does not have much to do with benefit design or program operation. It has everything to do with the way the medical system actually works. My experience has been that government agencies assume that uniform policies produce uniform results and they are ill prepared and have no incentive to deal with variation in results, especially when that variation itself is the result of a wide variety of factors that require careful localized analysis, patient targeted interventions and are the result of factors that are not within governmental control. Or put another way, I was focused on use of medical services. That's where the action is . Single-payer advocates focus on administrative overhead. That's simple and easy to understand. Regulatory types tend to focus on prices. That's simple at first blush and it can work in the short term, but once the regulatory process is captured by those regulated, it's just a lot of politics that produces no financial benefit to anyone but lobbyists and it may produce higher prices. More subtle, more complex, and harder to explain are the bell curves of medical service use. At the high end, they produce nothing but expense and the potential for patient harm. At the low end, they indicate inadequate care. In the equation of total costs ((service use X price) + overhead) = total cost, the longest lever is service use. And no, this does not lead me to having clerks deny care over the phone. But since you asked Tom, here's a long one and since you asked you have to promise to read it all and think about it and its relationship to what we've been discussing. Here goes ... When Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, based on what most everyone involved thought they knew about mainstream, privately insured, medicine, they took for granted three key assumptions. These assumptions were so deeply embedded, that they weren't even discussed. This was just the way the world was: That medical care was uniformly provided That when provided, with the possible exception of some oddities, medical care was consistently of good quality. And good quality produced uniformly good results. A related, implicit assumption was more is better. That, where quality was not good, it would be extremely bad and could be weeded out through a regulatory survey process and that aside from that there was not much that could be done. All three assumptions have turned out to be incorrect with significant implications for for patient care, clinical quality, and spending . What we've learned in the 40 years since is profound, but we still have a very long ways to go in taking advantage of it. This is relevant to the single-payer discussion because while a single-payer system might be centralized, medical care is not . I'll discuss that tie-in further below. Medical care is not uniformly provided Where's the evidence? Read anything by John Wennberg, MD. (If you do a search at the New England Journal alone, you'll find well over 100 citations.) Here's a recent one in the British Medical Journal that focuses on end-of-life care. In the late 1970s, Wennberg began to apply epidemiological methods to medical care. The first study I read was in Scientific American in 1979 as I recall, but that's not online. What Wennberg and his colleagues found was that there is substantial variation in medical care from one community to the next. They have also found what they characterize as a ""practice pattern"" effect, that physicians in one community develop a rough consensus on the best way to handle particular types of cases, but that their consensus differs from the next community and will produce care patterns that are stunningly different from those in other communities, even within the same state or region. For a quick introduction, start with the Dartmouth Medical Atlas , published by the Center for Clinical Evaluative Studies, which is one of the offshoots of Wennberg's work. These variations also exist within similar populations and in some cases very homogeneous populations. For example, a colleague studied variation in hospitalization patterns among Nebraska Blue Cross subscribers for conditions that can be managed on an outpatient basis (diabetes, asthma, CHF, COPD, etc.) As another example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, my own work focused on variation in hospitalization patterns of Medicaid clients in New York. Here's a quick and dirty update that I did in 2003 . The earlier work was much more rigorous and I'll be happy to send a copy to anyone who asks. Wennberg and his followers also learned that the variation itself varies from one condition to another. For example, appendectomies are always performed in hospitals and there is no known relationship of appendicitis to age, gender, race, socio-economic status. So there is very little variation and, from what I've seen, it's just random. Other conditions, however, are quite different. For just a tiny sample take a look at these: Regional variation in medical care , NEJM, August 31, 1995 where Detsky noted variation in clinical outcomes such as mortality after cardiac surgery. ""Once again we have learned that there is substantial variation among regions, hospitals, and even individual physicians."" Among New York's Medicaid clients the most variable conditions as causes of hospitalization were psychiatric and substance abuse, blood related conditions, and respiratory conditions. There is much, much more. This leads to ""what difference to these differences make?"" Medical care does not provide uniform results and spending more does not necessarily produce better results Or even more recently, take a look at Baicker and Chandra who ""find that states with higher Medicare spending have lower-quality care. This negative relationship may be driven by the use of intensive, costly care that crowds out the use of more effective care."" Fisher wrote an op-ed for the New York Times, More Medicine is Not Better Medicine (fee required for full article) December 1, 2003. He pointed out that additional service provided in higher spending regions are largely discretionary. He estimated that as much as 30 percent of Medicare's service spending was unnecessary. For you New Yorker's he also pointed to spending in NYC being double a community in the Pacific Northwest with no additional benefit. Here's Fisher's slide show, "" Is More Better? "" (Quicktime required.) If care is not of uniformly high quality or does not produce uniformly good results, there's nothing that can be done about it Where's the evidence? Start here at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement , founded by Don Berwick. In January of 1989, Berwick wrote ""Continuous improvement as an ideal in health care,"" the seminal paper in the New England Journal of Medicine on the use of industrial quality control methods, statistical process control and other similar methods in medical care. (That paper is not online, but it's worth tracking down if you're interested in the history.) The Institute was founded two years later (with a grant from a health plan by the way) and it has expanded each year. Their annual meetings now get thousands attending. IHI is just an organizational manifestation of many efforts to measure performance, understand clinical processes, and improve them. You can go into many hospitals today and see graphs of their performance on a wide array of issues hanging near the offices of department chairs and sometimes even in public places. That simply wasn't true 20 years ago. And in many healthcare organizations, it's still not true. What's necessary to deal with all this variation? Here's a starter list: Data to identify community-by-community, condition-by-condition, and service-by-service where the high and low rates are and, where at all possible, outcome data Peer consulting and other knowledge transfer Time and support for dealing with it locally The organizational infrastructure to support local efforts Financial and organizational incentives for local medical organizations and professionals to participate Comparative data must be collected centrally or at least in accordance with a standardized design. That would be simpler with a single-payer plan, but certainly feasible in a multi-option universal system. Beyond that, it seems to me that most of the advantages are with alternatives to a single centralized system. There's economic incentive and local involvement on scales that don't exist for Medicare, much less the entire US population. And what does this have to do with single-payer? The most politically compelling rationale for single-payer is that it would instantly provide a large savings in administrative expense. It quite likely would. But where would we go from there? Nothing I have personally seen or read gives me confidence that a large centralized system would be capable of effectively dealing with variations in care. In my experience with New York's Medicaid program and with the exception of some legislators and local officials, there has been nothing but resistance from government officials. Perhaps that's biased my view of the potential, but let's remember that New York is one of the states that is most intrusive into medical care and certainly, given the cost of its Medicaid program, it would seem that there should be an adequate incentive. For government agencies this requires too much subtlety and long-term commitment. What's required is a system that includes a significant incentive such as economic competition for example. And it requires lots of people working on it in different organizations with different perspectives. That's where innovation comes from. Innovation slows when you have to ask for governmental permission. It may also require the ability to be selective in ways that government agencies just can't be. I'm reminded of the multi-decade stalemate over Medicaid physician fees in New York. The state had stopped updating the fees in the same manner that it updated institutional rates. So here's what happened. First, physicians dropped out of the Medicaid program at increasingly rapid rates until there only a few left and many of them were practicing in the so-called Medicaid mills. Second, the patients recognizing reality rather than what the law said about what Medicaid covered moved to emergency rooms and hospital outpatient departments for care because there was no alternative. Third, the hospitals paid political attention to the regulators and the physicians largely did not.  When the state finally recognized the imbalance it had created, it was unable to fix it because to raise physician fees would have been to reward the Medicaid ""mills."" The log jam was only broken with the large scale use of Medicaid managed care which brought physicians back into contact with Medicaid clients by way of intermediary health plans. As a result primary care access has significantly improved for Medicaid clients. Docs may hate the health plans, but at least there's a working relationship. That was long past for Medicaid. You need an ongoing, permanent economic incentive, local working relationships (which admittedly some of the national health plans may be fairly weak on) and the ability to work with medical professionals targeting local patterns everywhere. I just don't see the Federal government doing that. Certainly if it attempted to, much of the administrative savings would be lost. If, as Fisher argues, 30 percent of Medicare expenditures for service today produce no medical benefit, then it is likely to become worse as medicine becomes more complex and involves more with each patient. Ignoring that for the cheap win of killing off the health insurers would leave us with no where to go and relying on the Federal government to find a new direction. This inspection found that 20 percent of sequences of three or more consecutive Medicare inpatient stays were associated with quality of care problems and or unnecessary fragmentation of healthcare services across multiple inpatient stays. Quality of care problems were defined as patient care that did not meet professionally recognized standards, medical errors, or accidents. Unnecessary fragmentation of services involved cases in which care provided across sequences of multiple inpatient stays may have been necessary and appropriate but should have been consolidated to fewer stays.  Medicare paid an estimated $267 million for these sequences of stays in fiscal year 2002. This inspection also found that 10 percent of individual stays within consecutive inpatient stay sequences were associated with poor quality of patient care. OIG recommended that CMS direct quality improvement organizations and fiscal intermediaries, as appropriate, to monitor the quality, medical necessity, and appropriateness of inpatient services provided within this types of sequences of consecutive Medicare inpatient stays that we included in our review. CMS concurred with OIG's case findings but stated that periodic reviews are sequences of consecutive inpatient stays are not warranted. Assuming that, like the Canadian system, there were a minimum Federal standard, it's certainly possible. Here are some of the issues that we'd likely have to deal with: What would be the states' financial obligations and to what degree would that lead to poorer or less healthy states' offfering much more restrictive benefit packages. How would we handle interstate movement? Would we have to dis-enroll and re-enroll? How would we handle families with multi-state legal residences? If we were using some form of voucher program, this would likely be even worse because different states might authorize different health plans. How tolerant would we be of the extra complexity? In contrast to our 50 states and a few other jurisdictions, Canada has 13 provinces and territories. Are the risk pools in smaller states smaller than we'd like? Canada seems to do OK, but I don't know how they deal with this or if they equalize the load in any fashion. And Neil's question raises more questions to which I don't have the answer (yet). They include: How does Canada handle its territories, especially those with very small populations? The Yukon barely has 30,000 people. Nunavut has less than that. How do they handle interstate movement? What are the provincial financial obligations? As noted earlier, this assumes there were a minimum Federal standard. If there weren't, you'd run into all kinds of extra problems, especially serving as a magnet for high cost patients. Over the past few years, there have been several states that have considered some form of state-only single-payer system. Vermont and California are considering them now. It strikes me as asking for trouble, but perhaps, if it relieved employers of the financial burden of paying for health benefits it would also be a form of economic development. Hmmm. That's actually worth analyzing. June 15, 2005 For the life of me I can't understand the disconnect when my liberal/progressive friends support single-payer without so much as a discussion, describe it as Medicare for everyone and then turn around and aggressively attack Republicans and a handful of Democrats for the Medicare pharmaceutical benefit. With a single-payer plan, this is going to be their full time occupation, because it's all going to be controlled in Washington. Don't these folks understand that Bill Frist and Tom Delay and their successors will control all of our health care? Are they out of their minds? That's at the policy level. Operationally, when I have a problem I'm going to call one of thousands of Federal employees or contractors and they are going to have no flexibility and I'm going to have no option. Hmmm. There seems to be a recurring theme here. Perhaps folks think GW Bush will pull a Richard Nixon and support universal health insurance. That's why so many are talking about this issue now. Sure. Right. Care in the VA system is much improved and we've talked about the VA comparison before. In my judgment, the apparent quality today is not an adequate argument for single-payer. Here's why . Five years ago while running for President, Bill Bradley made health care and health care coverage a centerpiece of his campaign. The plan he proposed was based on the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan and his argument was ""if it's good enough for your Congressman, it should be good enough for you. Clearly Gore ran a better political campaign, but the gist of his argument against Bradley was that someone with coverage might lose some benefits or the program was too expensive or both. Hardly the populist argument that we might expect from him today. Gore also seemed to have over-learned the lesson from the Clinton Health Plan, not so much that it was too complex, but that it was too ambitious. He bought into the ""incremental improvement"" position. There was just one teensy-weensy problem with the Clinton-Gore incremental improvements: At the end of the Clinton Administration there were many more uninsured than at the beginning. Evidently, they thought rhetoric was enough. We should have universal coverage. We will never be able to eliminate many of the inefficiencies much less the inequities in today's system unless we do. Recognizing that we might also eliminate some administrative inefficiencies with a single-payer approach, I think they're worth the cost. Most important, the differences in access to care between those with coverage and those without are so large, so significant, and so tied to racial, ethnic and income disparities, that it raises ethical issues that should disturb us all. A purely market-based approach won't get us near universal coverage, and an active role for government is essential. However, a single, government operated program won't work either. Too many needlessly take for granted that universal coverage requires a single payer system. But single payer can be separated from universal coverage by distinguishing between the financing and operations of a universal coverage program, and between gathering the necessary revenues and spending them. These functions need not all be located in one governmental organization. For example, we can and do use public money to buy private insurance. What's wrong with the single payer proposal? I made the following arguments in the late 1990s, but haven't seen anything since that would lead me to a different perspective. Who chooses? What choices? Single payer systems rest on the premise that there is a uniform best health benefit plan for every individual, that public officials and organized political interests always can know what this best arrangement is, and that they uniformly will choose it. The weakness of this foundation should be argument enough against single payer. The health care system will be even more politicized than it is today. If the revenue of health care institutions and professionals, as well as the rules controlling the institutions and the care providers, are determined by government policies, lobbying by vested interests will be even more fierce than it is today. Key choices will be made by government, political elites and vested interests. This same political process also would determine which medical services are available, to whom and under what circumstances. In today's political environment it doesn't take much to imagine what that might be like. Single payer systems minimize the involvement and responsibility of individuals and families The corollary to increasing government decision making and politicization is a diminished role and voice for individuals. In a single payer system, there is no role for the average person except to consume service. Individuals have no place in choosing systems of care and financing, little leverage over institutions that directly and significantly affect their lives, and only a faint voice when dissatisfied. Once we establish a single payer plan, we cannot easily undo it Some reform plans can be undone. A single payer system cannot. If we choose a single payer system, we will dismantle organizations and processes such as health insurers and plans. We will not easily or quickly rebuild them if the new system fails to satisfy us. And single payer offers no guarantees on cost and quality. Some countries that have single payer systems have had lower cost-growth than the United States. However, in order to restrain cost, single payer systems require centralized government control of health care prices and use of services--and the intrusiveness that goes with it. But our experience with heavy regulation on the state level raises questions about whether central controls really are effective. Organizational vitality and innovation The structure of single payer systems discourages diversity and thus discourages the robustness and resilience that typically characterize diverse systems. Organizations continually must revitalize themselves lest they become moribund and bureaucratic. Diverse systems usually are better able to adapt, innovate and survive. This is particularly so for innovations in the organization of care across provider's organizational boundaries. Moreover, because it will take Federal permission to do so, only those organizations with enough size and political clout will have a chance to innovate. Organizational clumsiness No single payer plan can centrally manage the formal or informal systems of care serving millions of people. No large centralized system can adequately tie together all of the diverse elements of a health care system on behalf of an individual. To do this we need organizations with motivation and means, and that operate at the local level. We can have a uniform system or we can have a system that is responsive to the needs of individuals, but we can't have both simultaneously. Locking the systems status quo into place A single payer system would cement into place the worst and most inefficient characteristics of our health care delivery system. It is based on a fee-for-service payment model and it relies on isolated individual institutions, agencies and professionals. The ugly (political) facts of life The politics of universal coverage are tough enough. Why we in the United States have never adopted a system of universal coverage is worth a separate post, but it is clear that the individualist preferences embedded in the American psyche, and our ambivalence about the appropriate role of government, play a substantial role. With this as backdrop, getting agreement that everyone should be covered is tough enough. Seeking the consensus necessary to force everyone into a centralized system will leave the problem unrelieved for decades. Even if a single payer system were ideal, we should sacrifice it in order to get even minimal coverage for those who have none. In sum There are other, better ways of covering everyone than to force us all into a uniform centralized system. Universal coverage does not demand a ""one size fits all"" solution, and single payer is not the answer. Because of the New York Times new pricing policy, requiring a $50/year subscription to view columnist online, I'm going to stop linking to them. But as a parting gesture, I'll give you one last link, this one to Paul Krugman's One Nation, Uninsured . (If the link dies, blame the Times .) In the column, he endorses a single-payer health plan. Let's ignore those who believe that private medical accounts - basically tax shelters for the healthy and wealthy - can solve our health care problems through the magic of the marketplace. The intellectually serious debate is between those who believe that the government should simply provide basic health insurance for everyone and those proposing a more complex, indirect approach that preserves a central role for private health insurance companies. He's right on that point. But we diverge on his next point: The great advantage of universal, government-provided health insurance is lower costs. To be more precise, what's lower is administrative costs. But that ignores where we (through insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid) spend the bulk of the money, on medical care. And it assumes that all of that care is just fine or not very expensive, or that even if it isn't the case, governmental action would take care of the problem. That's where I see things differently. We've talked here extensively about unnecessary care and I just don't have a lot of confidence in a single centralized system's ability to find the Mama Bear solution, not too much, not too little, but just right. Krugman goes on: Some people, not all of them right-wingers, fear that a single-payer system would hurt innovation. But the main reason these proposals give private insurers a big role is the belief that the insurers must be appeased... But I think that's the wrong lesson. The Clinton plan actually preserved a big role for private insurers; the industry attacked it all the same. And the plan's complexity, which was largely a result of attempts to placate interest groups, made it hard to sell to the public. So I would argue that good economics is also good politics: reformers will do best with a straightforward single-payer plan, which offers maximum savings and, unlike the Clinton plan, can easily be explained. Actually much of the Clinton plan's complexity was based on the the need to guarantee that the cost of the program would be within certain budget constraints (boy, those were the good old days, weren't they?). No question about it, we need to demand more of health insurers. Alternative plans would afford us the means to box them in and we should do just that. I agree with Krugman with much and particularly that "" We need to do this one right. If reform fails again, we'll be on the way to a radically unequal society, in which all but the most affluent Americans face the constant risk of financial ruin and even premature death because they can't pay their medical bills."" But I think we can do a better job both programmatically and politically and do so without rolling the dice on a one-size fits all, single-payer solution. A couple of years ago in an effort to lure more health insurers back into its market, New Hampshire allowed its insurers to establish premium levels based on subscriber risk, i.e., age, health status, etc. Here's the Concord Monitor on what happened and why New Hampshire has just reversed direction: Before SB 110 took effect, the state operated on a ""community rating""system that forbade insurers from rejecting an applicant for health reasons or from basing rates on health status or geography. Once community rating ended, insurers began returning to New Hampshire, just as supporters of the change predicted. They came, however, to cherry-pick, signing up the healthy while using exorbitant quotes to drive away those most likely to need care. Prices dropped considerably for a small group of employers, primarily those with young and healthy workforces that lived in an area where health-care costs were relatively low. But, according to the state's insurance department, 80 percent of the state's small businesses saw increases, and the rates for nearly half rose by 30 percent or more in one year. Some saw rates rise by 80 percent. Is there any reason to believe that health savings accounts won't have the same effects? If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, forget about it. It's a niche product at best and it's certainly not going to fulfill any legislator's fantasy that it will make a dent in Medicaid expenditures. June 11, 2005 So while we're waiting for New York's closure commission to tell us which hospitals and nursing home should close, time marches on. We've just posted on one hospital closing ( St. Mary's in Brooklyn ). And here's another (gasp) one that would close (Westchester County) except that it looks like the State will bail it out . Note the outstanding debt at Westchester County ( $750 million ) while it continues to lose money. If it were to fail, the County itself would be on the hook for a big chunk of that debt. June 10, 2005 We can't let the day pass without noting the court decision in the Canadian Province of Quebec overruling the state monopoly on health insurance. For now, the ruling apparently applies only to that Province, but it's caused an immense stir. There's lots of coverage: As premiums rise - especially in relation to income or other economic resources - coverage falls. The past decade at least, I've been convinced that this is the primary underlying cause of health insurance loss. Call it what you may, dress it up as much as you like, blame employers or public policy makers, coverage has simply gotten too expensive relative to the economic resources that pays for it. All you have to do is note that health care costs and therefore health coverage costs (both public and private) have been rising consistently faster than economy overall and thus the rest of the economy. Think in terms of a ratio of coverage costs to other economic resources. Regardless of the specific measures you use, the more that ratio rises, the more people will drop out or be dropped out of the insurance system. And as that ratio begins to cut at higher and higher income levels, it will affect an increasing proportions of the population. I don't know where the inflection point on the upslope (the left side of the peak) is in this graphic, but until we reach it, each increase in that ratio will affect an accelerating number of people. Then the rate of increase will fall, but the numbers of newly uninsured will continue to increase until we hit the peak. Think of the Cutting Edge ""Coverage Blades"" in the graphic moving to the right and slicing off increasing numbers of currently insured. Of course, when we do hit the peak, we will be deep into the middle class - being uninsured. At some point just to the left of the peak, I expect we will arrive at the political crisis and deal with the issue. But, like earthquakes in California, while we know this crisis is coming, we don't know exactly when. Lots going on, but only limited time to post. But there are a couple of things that shouldn't wait. Families USA released a study by Ken Thorpe on the costs of caring for the uninsured that are embedded in health insurance premiums. Here's the press release . Here are the key findings for families and individuals in 2005: Health insurance premiums for families who have insurance through their private employers, on average, are $922 higher in 2005 due to the cost of health care for the uninsured that is not paid for by the uninsured themselves for by other sources of reimbursement. In six states, health insurance premiums for families are at least $1,500 higher due to the unreimbursed cost of health care for the uninsured in 2005. These states are New Mexico ($1,875); West Virginia ($1,796); Oklahoma ($1,781); Montana ($1,578); Texas ($1,551); and Arkansas ($1,514). Health insurance premiums for individuals who have insurance through their private employers, on average, are $341 higher in 2005 due to the cost of health care for the uninsured that is not paid for by the uninsured themselves for by other sources of reimbursement. In eight states, health insurance premiums for families are at least $500 higher due to the unreimbursed cost of health care for the uninsured in 2005. These states are New Mexico ($726); Oklahoma ($680); West Virginia ($660); Montana ($594); Alaska ($565); Arkansas ($560); Idaho ($551); and Texas ($550). An extremely important, but usually ignored aspect of this issue is that ""the worse it gets, the worse it gets."" That's part of the reason the proportion of uninsured is rising. As more uncompensated care is provided it is subsidized either informally through price increase based cost-shifting or formally through such mechanisms are state indigent care pools, the costs of which are borne by health insurers and/or employers. Of course, as that happens, premiums rise. As premiums rise - especially in relation to income or other economic resources - coverage falls. That in turn, creates more uncompensated care ... take a look at the Self-Reinforcing Coverage Loop - a vicious circle. Insurer/employer based subsidy programs are thus inherently self-defeating. How to ensure that patient privacy and security of health information is maintained. Only a few of the Task Force members are State officials, the Health Department's CIO (a physician by the way who is also the Deputy Commissioner for Public Health), the head of Medicaid, the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Services, the State's Secretary of Technology, and a member of the House of Delegates. June 08, 2005 Jack Zwanziger, a health economist formerly at the University at Rochester and now at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Cathleen Mooney a researcher in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University at Rochester conclude in the latest Inquiry that, with some caveats and at least in the short term, hospital price deregulation led to price reductions for managed care plans in New York. Here's the abstract of their article, ""Has Competition Lowered Hospital Prices"" (subscription required): On Jan. 1, 1997, New York ended its regulation of hospital prices with the intent of using competitive markets to control prices and increase efficiency. This paper uses data that come from annual reports filed by all health maintenance organizations (HMOs) operating in New York and include payments to and usage in the major hospitals in an HMO's network. We estimate the relationship between implied prices and hospital, plan, and market characteristics. The models show that after 1997, hospitals in more competitive markets paid less. Partially offsetting these price reductions were price increases associated with hospital mergers that reduced the competitiveness of the local market. Hospital deregulation was successful, at least in the short run, in using price competition to reduce hospital payments; it is unclear whether this success will be undermined by the structural changes taking place in the hospital industry. However, the key finding is the confirmation of a change in the pattern of prices negotiated between HMOs and hospitals after implementation of HCRA. Mean case-mix adjusted prices declined during this period, and the multivariate regression results showed that this decline in the average prices was related to decreases in prices paid to hospitals located in more competitive markets. Actually the first real hint was a couple of years ago when Ken Raske, head of the Greater New York Hospital Association called for re -regulation. Why would he have wanted that? The same reason he didn't really want de -regulation, what economists call ""regulatory capture,"" the effective control of regulatory policy by the regulated industry. But nobody bought that idea. Zwanziger and Mooney also conclude that: An increase in hospital costs tended to be reflected in the price it negotiated, but with an elasticity that was substantially less than 1; thus some of the cost increase was absorbed either by other payers or by the hospital in reduced profits. Similarly, an increase in the proportion of a hospital's patients insured by Medicaid was associated with an increase in prices . (Emphasis added.) Hospitals that became more heavily dependent on an HMO tended to agree to deeper price concessions. Little acknowledged and discussed even less is the fact that New York did not change its method of calculating Medicaid prices when it deregulated private sector prices. However, its policies of using a variety of methods to shore up hospital finances have likely led to a reverse of the typical pattern, that of private payers cross-subsidizing Medicaid patients. In New York's case, the contrary appears to be true. Certainly there's been talk the past couple of years that Medicaid has become the ""best payer"" in New York. The authors also document: ... this market change also induced hospitals to discover means of reducing their vulnerability to the pressures of price-based competitive markets. It appears that the enactment of HCRA led many hospitals to become members of systems that included potential competitors. The resulting series of mergers has led to major structural changes in many hospital markets across the state with a concomitant decrease in the competitiveness of many hospital markets. The results of this study provide a preliminary indication that though HCRA may have increased price competition in the short term, in the longer term, the resulting increase in hospital concentration may have counteracted the observed effect on hospital prices. So hospitals have reduced price competition by merging into systems. And now they've set up the State to further reduce price competition by forcing hospital closures. Nobody bought Raske's idea to re-regulate prices, but they did buy his proposal for the State to reduce competition. Different method. Likely to have the same effect. June 07, 2005 In the meantime, hospitals are closing anyway. The latest is St. Mary's in Brooklyn. Of particular note in this Newsday story is the following quote: Particularly frustrating, said some residents, is that they probably will be rerouted to nearby hospitals such as Interfaith Medical Center in Bedford-Stuyvesant, with poorer performance records than St. Mary's Interfaith is the result of a State supported merger of hospitals the State was already shoring up. One of them, Brooklyn-Jewish, was the very first in a long line of hospitals that New York threw money and political capital at when they ran into financial trouble. That became institutionalized policy with an elaborate infrastructure and organizational bias. When I asked her how many hospitals the commission would likely recommend closing, a colleague grinned wickedly and said: Oh, five or ten would have closed anyway. So that's what they'll propose and then ... take credit for their closure. And there's more to come. HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt announced plans for development of a national health information network and creation of a federal advisory commission on standards for health care information technology. Leavitt will select up to 17 members to the commission, known as the American Health Information Community , and personally serve as its chairman. That's a nice symbol. The commission will focus on developing interconnectivity standards for health care IT. HHS on Tuesday will issue requests for proposals for: Architecture and design of a Web-based national health information network. Assessment of potential privacy and security problems in a national network and development of solutions. A prototype process for harmonizing standards so that different manufacturers' software programs, particularly electronic health records systems, can exchange data. Criteria to evaluate features and functionality of electronic health records, including interconnectivity. June 02, 2005 Here are some of the lucky folks who'll be getting pleading and/or threatening calls at home the next year and a half. They've been selected for New York's hospital/nursing home closure commission. There are some excellent choices in this group and some political innovation too. A couple of the appointees are not residents of New York State. Politically risky, but suggestive of really wanting to do something. Note that while the commission is supposed to have 18 members, there are only fifteen listed. The Governor's press release does not mention either the Speaker of the Assembly or the Senate Minority Leader. Seems they haven't made their decisions yet. From the Governor's press release here are the appointees of the Governor, the Senate Majority Leader and the Assembly Minority Leader: Stephen Berger (Chair), Chairman of the Chairman of Odyssey Investment Partners (OIP), LLC, a investment firm that specializes in private corporate transactions. Mr. Berger served as Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1985-1990. Leo Brideau, President and Chief Executive Officer of St. Mary's Hospital and Clinics in Milwaukee. Previously, he served as President of Strong Health Regional Network in Rochester New York Craig Duncan, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Health. Robert Gaffney, Partner in the law firm of Meyer, Souzzi, English & Klein. Mr. Gaffney after serving as a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1985 and was elected Suffolk County Executive in 1992. Robert Hinckley, Vice President of Governmental and External Affairs for Capital District Physicians Health Plan. Prior to joining to Capital District Physicians Health Plan, Mr. Hinckley served as Senior Deputy Secretary to the Governor in January 2003. Howard Howlett, Chairman and Founding Member of the Hospital Trustees of New York State Darlene Kerr, Former President and Chief Executive Officer of Niagara Mohawk (NIMO). Prior to serving as President and CEO, Ms. Kerr was NIMO's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Mark Kissinger, is Deputy Secretary to the Governor, and is responsible for policies and operations of the State's health and human services agencies. Mr. Kissinger joined the Governor's staff in 1999. Pat Lee, Chairman and CEO of International Motion Control, Inc.  Mr. Lee serves as Director of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Buffalo Branch and the Empire State Development Corporation, Western New York Region. Neil Roberts, former Chief Executive Officer of United Methodist Health and Housing, the parent company of Wesley Health Care Center. Teresa Santiago, Chairperson of the New York Consumer Protection Board.  Previously, Ms. Santiago was the Director of Hispanic Expert, a public relations and advertising firm specializing in the Black and Hispanic consumer markets.

In that capacity, he was responsible for the day-to-day direction of Medicare, Medicaid, Child Health Insurance Programs, Survey and Certification of health care facilities and other health care initiatives. Al Simone, President of Rochester Institute of Technology. He was named President in 1992. Prior to leading RIT, he was the President of the University of Hawaii System and Chancellor of the University Hawaii at Manoa. Bishop Joseph Sullivan, Vicar for Human Services and Regional Bishop for the 62 parishes of the Brooklyn West Vicariate. He has played various roles in Catholic Charities including Executive Director and Executive Vice President of the Board of Trustees. He is also Secretary to the Ordinary for Charities. In 1980, he was named Auxiliary Bishop by Pope John Paul II. Buford Sears, Senior Vice President and manager for health care and not-for-profit banking at Manufacturers & Traders Trust Company in Buffalo. Prior to that, he was Senior Vice President at Citizens & Southern National Bank. June 01, 2005 Busy week and so I'd figured on not posting much, but we've been waiting for the announcement of those selected for New York's hospital/nursing home closure commission and the news is in ... things are breaking down politically over the commission's membership and they've already missed the deadline for appointments. How entirely unsurprising. In today's Albany Times Union, James Odato writes in Leaders clash over hospital panel that the Governor and the Legislature are already behind schedule in naming the membership. Pataki's list of nominees was ready last Friday, the deadline, but there's already a dispute over whether to appoint lobbyists and health care trade association representatives to the commission. Pataki was ready to announce his appointees last Friday -- the deadline. But he and the Legislature's leaders have been struggling over the composition and on whether to allow lobbyists or stakeholders in the health care industry on the panel, according to health care officials. ""Stakeholders."" What a euphemism! What a crock! Eighteen members was too limiting anyway. Why don't we just expand the membership of the commission to include the CEOs of every hospital in the State and let them vote to decide who gets thrown off the island? (Just make sure that they all have to wear some sort of garish tropical print shorts and no shirts and force them to eat bugs for a week.) Read the article closely and what do you see? Virtually everyone quoted says ""not me, not me,"" they don't want such representation. Does this mean they're all being disingenuous or does it mean that the real hold up is Ken Raske, head of the Greater New York Hospital Association? Even without the quote, ""representatives of SEIU say they don't have to be on the panel,"" I doubt that it's Dennis Rivera, head of District 1199 (who gets bashed by the Post again here ) because he doesn't need a seat at the table. His presence will loom over the entire proceedings anyway. Why only have one seat out of 18? This effort holds as much promise as any I've participated in over the last decade, probably more,"" said Kate Sullivan Hare, the executive director of health care policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce Well, I've got mixed feelings about this one. Upside? A mixed group is talking. Downside? It's all Washington groupies. I've been part of such ""strange bedfellows"" efforts at the state level and even brought a couple of them together myself. From time-to-time, they're effective and those are very gratifying, but they're mostly not. Personal good will and scholarly interest are not enough. And think tanks are definitely not enough. There's got to be some real grassroots juice. Here's what such groups can do: Provide cover for elected officials who want to do something anyway. But that certainly doesn't apply in today's Washington Push elected officials to act. Works sometimes, but very, very rarely on an issue of this scope. Coordinate messages from disparate grassroots groups. Who knows whether that's going on here and how much heft they have. So it's continued discussions are a good sign, but don't get your hopes up. Moreover, this group is already deep into wonk-think: People are uninsured for different reasons,"" said Dr. Mary E. Frank, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a participant in the talks. ""No one solution will work for everyone. We need different solutions for different groups of the uninsured."" With all due respect to Dr. Frank and AAFP, which has been quite good on coverage issues, one point does not follow the other. ""People are uninsured for different reasons"" is true, but only narrowly - within the current mixed bag system . As soon as you begin thinking like this, you've given up universality. And as soon as you begin talking like this, you've given up political ground to those who don't really care about the issue, but don't want to get burned politically and to those who are actively resistant. Some conservatives may truthfully embrace expanded coverage but due to ideological constraints, confine themselves to limited proposals. Some may use false sympathetic rhetoric to protect themselves politically, but then say that if we fail to reach universality, well that's just unfortunate. The more important principle to them is that there is no legitimate role for government (George Bush, for example, in responding to an uninsured woman during his first Presidential campaign, saying he ""wished he could wave a magic wand"" but ...). This is not the first Times article on these discussions. Steve Lohr wrote in the Times business section on December 6 of last year, "" The Disparate Consensus on Health Care for All "". I didn't buy the headline then which is why I didn't bother posting on it. Lohr cited Peggy O'Kane, head of NCQA (""no one wants to touch it""), Dr. William McGuire, CEO of UnitedHealth Group (who supports mandatory insurance and focuses more on what's covered), and Dr. David Himmelstein of the Harvard Medical School, who's a single-payer advocate. Maybe there's a consensus among ""experts"" (think of the folks who show up at an APHA meeting) on the need for universal coverage of some form, but there's certainly none among elected officials or the public. The article didn't even keep up with the then current news: The Bush administration and conservatives say the way to cover the uninsured is to make insurance affordable mainly through tax subsidies (emphasis added) for companies, especially small businesses, and encouraging them to offer high-deductible insurance plans that cost employers less. Individuals, under this approach, are encouraged to set up tax-free health savings accounts to pay for more of their own care. The inconsistency aside, what was meant by ""tax subsidies""? The answer is crucial. Is it the Bush Administration's ever ready solution to everything, tax cuts? Or were they actually talking about something akin to the Earned Income Tax Credit, a refundable credit? Such credits generate, through the tax system, a net transfer to the lowest income people, but they have increasingly been the butt of conservative criticism? (Check here and here .) Lohr's article goes on: Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who is the founder of the Center for Health Transformation, a policy research group, recommends a package of federal and state tax incentives and programs that go beyond the Bush administration proposals. He estimates that his approach could result in more than 95 percent of the population's being insured. ""We could radically change the current discussion about the uninsured,"" he said. Well maybe. But there there are legitimate questions about the robustness of any approach that leaves a door open to seepage. Yes, there might be an increase in the number of people covered, but absent a structure that's designed to sweep everyone in (or if it's a big deal to you, every citizen), it's not only not going to happen, it's not going to get close. But assume for the moment that Gingrich is correct. Getting to 95 percent would be a striking change. But why is it that so many Republican leaders are satisfied with that? What's wrong with 100 percent? We can all speculate and much of our speculation would be about motivation which is always a iffy venture. And don't get me started tonight on the single-payer proposals. Now if the Christian Coalition was part of this ""emerging consensus,"" that would get my attention. That would truly make for strange bedfellows. In my too long queue of posts waiting to be finished were several that linked to Paul Krugman's column in the New York Times. As part of my effort to clean up unfinished work, but also to get the those with Krugman links up before the Times starts charging for access to their op-ed columns, here's one of them. In, Passing the Buck Paul Krugman referenced some World Health Organization (WHO) data, and pointed to the efforts of private insurers ""trying to get someone else to pay the bills,"" as the explanation for why we spend so much more on health care than other developed countries without appearing to get much benefit for it. According to the World Health Organization, in the United States administrative expenses eat up about 15 percent of the money paid in premiums to private health insurance companies, but only 4 percent of the budgets of public insurance programs, which consist mainly of Medicare and Medicaid. The numbers for both public and private insurance are similar in other countries - but because we rely much more heavily than anyone else on private insurance, our total administrative costs are much higher. Well trust me, the public sector may pay a smaller percentage, but it's not as if it isn't also trying to shift the costs elsewhere. You can read Paul Castellani's book, From Snake Pits to Cash Cows for example or talk to any number of people who've made their careers in state government by figuring out how to Medicaid ( as a verb ) new services in order to draw Federal funds. (Using Medicaid as a verb is insider talk and it refers to changing, sometimes distorting, program configurations primarily to draw funds.) Or talk to home care managers who are pressured by Medicaid agencies to bill Medicare first, sometimes pushing them close to the point of being charged with Medicare fraud. It's all the same system behavior, an inevitable by-product of having multiple payers. I've used a Palm Pilot for a number of years now and I use the Palm Desktop on my PC to synchronize with the handheld. It's pretty straightforward while working in isolation . However ... When I last worked for another company, they used Microsoft Outlook and Exchange and were pretty insistent that certain staff people publish their schedules openly so that others could know where they were and where there were schedule openings. But they did not buy PDAs for staff so we chose and purchased our own. Synchronizing the Palm with Outlook was a horror. The process lost data or it duplicated data (imagine having to delete, one-by-one, 2,000 duplicate contacts on both the PC and the handheld). Ultimately, I printed my schedule and made copies. Pretty stupid for an IT company, right? May 26, 2005 A colleague with great expertise in income support policies and programs told me yesterday that he had just learned that the US Department of Agriculture, which administers the Food Stamps program, will be counting the Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefit as income to low income Food Stamps beneficiaries. More ""income"" means lower benefits. He's researching it and I will too, but he's usually got this stuff nailed. What's it mean? The more Medicare pays for drugs, the less Food Stamps you get. Worse, if true, the Food Stamp benefit will change monthly based on what Medicare spent for drugs in a prior period. Mind you, because of the way Food Stamps work, there may still be a positive net benefit. But this will be an administrative morass as well as making the lives of beneficiaries more uncertain. Great catch, Alan. For you non-New Yorkers, he's a smart guy who, despite his properly serious public demeanor, is probably privately shaking his head on this one. Couple of observations: Hevesi rather deftly tossed this issue to the Feds and they're the ones ""scrambling"" in most of the news coverage. I wouldn't want to be in Leavitt's office today. Hevesi's auditors found the problem by matching the Medicaid claims data they have with the listings of Level 3 Sex Offenders listed on the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) Sex Offender Registry . Linking Medicaid data with data from other sources is one of the things that's explicitly forbidden by the Department of Health for others who wish to use the Medicaid data. Apart from the taxpayer's money that's being used to pay for the drugs, how aware are the physicians who are prescribing of the backgrounds of these patients? If the physicians don't know, should they be and how might they be made aware? Physicians' first ethical obligations are to their patients. How does or should that influence the decision to prescribe in these cases? Are there any instances in which there is a medical justification for the prescription despite or even because of the patient's legal history? You just know that somebody is going to take this the next step and suggest that felons, or at least these felons should not be entitled to Medicaid. Let's not go there right now. Just deal with the issue at hand. One provocative development in the ""battle"" between the Continuity of Care Record (ASTM) and EHR ( HL7 ). Some will say that the CCR can be a stepping stone towards an EHR and there are many strengths to the CCR concept. Others say that the CCR will be divisive and distract full adoption of the EHR. Lots of pros and cons that must be seriously considered. Competing standards organizations ... competing standards. Check this from a year ago . (I've not been immersed in this process and don't yet know what the inner dynamics or the latest stories are.) As I understand the CCR, it's not supposed to be the entire record itself, but the essential elements that can be passed across organizational boundaries. (I'm less familiar with HL7.) Say for example, a patient was in a hospital ICU last year. Whether atoms or bits, the volume of hospital data on that patient is immense. Now say the patient is seeing a physician for a routine visit. Does the physician need all of that hospital data? Not likely. They need to know the patient was hospitalized, was in the ICU, certain essential elements and how to get more data if necessary. So the CCR concept makes sense for interoperability, moving patient-centric information across space, time, and organizational boundaries. ASTM has been voting on the latest version of the CCR standard. There was enough dissent that they're going to continue thrashing out the issues rather than count it as an accepted standard. Yes, these stumbles are frustrating. But they're part of a long, hard, often tedious process that is essential to make progress. HIMSS Analytics releases its annual report. You can buy it for $60 or, if you want to save the money, here's the first item listed in the summary: "" Underinvestment in information technology continues. "" Franco still dead, full story at 11. For those of you too young to remember the early SNL bit, it translates as ""duh."" Funny. Elyse has a slightly longer and less wry summary here , but the essence is the same. May 19, 2005 The Medicaid cap is not just a financial change, it portends an operational change. This is personally symbolized by the return to government service of Brian Wing. Brian's the former Commissioner of Social Services and then after re-organization, OTDA . He left a while back to work in the private sector. Brian's returned and has joined the Health Department, specifically the Office of Medicaid Management and his charge is to figure out how to move the Medicaid functions currently administered by localities to the State. This is the administrative/operational change that needs to accompany the cap on local financial responsibility. That's a change long overdue. The first policy paper I ever had published, Barriers to Medicaid Reform , emphasized the dispersion of policy and administrative responsibility for Medicaid between different State agencies and different levels of government. That was in 1976 . Well, we're finally making progress. Brian's job will not be fun and it's won't be headlines sexy. But it will be important. Best wishes and welcome back. But New York City and the suburban counties do have some control over the cost of nonmedical home care and transportation to treatment sites. And, especially in the city and Nassau, they must do a better job at shaving expenses With the cap in place, such small scale efforts won't make any difference. Not to argue against local vigilance, but even under the old rules this argument is off base. Take a look at the attached graphic. Historically the big expenses have been fee-for-service hospital inpatient care and nursing home care. Even a small percentage increase generates big expenditure increases. But the dramatic increases have come from pharmaceuticals and other supplies and from HMO premiums for Medicaid managed care (including Family Health Plus, which will now be entirely a State funding responsibility). Transportation? Lost in the data haze. Non medical home care? We assume Newsday is referring to Personal Care and those costs have been growing along with other home health expenses. But this is symbolic of how diffusion of administrative responsibility has not only weakened financial controls, it's distorted program administration. Counties have had much more influence over who gets home care and how much than they've had over institutional care for identical patients. So naturally, when seeking to control expenses anywhere they could, they've limited access to institutional alternatives, directly undermining the State's policy goals and probably their own long term financial interests. So the Newsday opinion is out-of-date because they seem not to fully understand the implications of the cap and, even if the rules hadn't changed, offbase because they would have reinforced a distortion embedded in the old system. Rick warns counties in New York about the similarities between the new cap on their shares of Medicaid costs and the Medicare "" clawback ."" There are a couple of differences, one mechanical and one conceptual. The mechanical difference is that the New York law requires an annual reconciliation. That involves a calculation of what the counties would have paid under the old system. If it's less than the cap, the State is supposed to write a check to the county for the difference. The conceptual difference is that the ""clawback"" is intended to offset a financial side effect of legislation whose primary purpose is not about the relationship between different levels of government, in this case providing pharmaceutical coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. In contrast, New York's new Medicaid cap is entirely about changing the financial relationship between different levels of government. Not that, in a financial pinch, New York wouldn't change the rules again but there is a difference. Rick is right though. Remain vigilant. There are many ways in which to play this system. Does anyone doubt that the Department of Health is currently cranking out rate appeals so that the payments can be made this year in order to inflate the base upon which the cap is calculated? May 17, 2005 Why did I raise the possibility that Medicaid expenditure growth in New York might slow a bit? Take a look at the trendline. Note that while expenditures actually fell in the last quarter of 2001, the big spike began shortly afterward, after 9/11, when the eligibility standards were loosened considerably. But note also, that that in 2004 the trendline began to flatten out a bit. There are hints of a ""s-curve."" Additionally, from 2000 to 2004 the number of enrollees grew dramatically rising from 2.7 million to over 4 million. (Much of that growth was in Family Health Plus.) The rate of growth was virtually identical in New York City and the rest of the state. At some point, we should expect the pool of potential clients to be exhausted. Mind you, for now I'd bet against the possibility. But it's worth further exploration. Unless it gets cold feet or weasels out of its promise to localities, New York has fundamentally changed both the financing structure of its Medicaid program and its budgetary and program dynamics. It's not obvious yet, but as this change takes effect, it will become increasingly important and evident. This change, a cap on the local share of Medicaid costs will: Provide financial relief to counties and New York City. That part is obvious. Change State budget dynamics by requiring that the State itself be financially responsible for an increasingly larger share of cost growth. The cap works like this. This calendar year, 2005, will be used as a base year for Medicaid spending. In 2006, the local share will be the base year (2005) plus an increment of 3.5 percent. In 2007, the local share will increase by an additional increment of 3.25 percent for a total of the base plus 6.75 percent. In 2008, the local share will increase by an additional increment of 3.0 percent for a total of the base plus 9.75 percent or, if the locality chooses, a fixed percentage of local sales tax revenues based. Each year thereafter, the increment will be 3.0 percent. (See the attached table.) The subtlety here is that the local share increases are not compounded. In 2008, the State will fold the local share into the State budget process and localities will simply make a payment to the State based on the formula. Localities will be engaged in a form of ""reverse revenue sharing,"" whose only relationship to Medicaid spending will be historical. There are also some insurance provisions for localities. If the Federal share is increased, localities will share in the savings as well as the State. In the unlikely event that Medicaid expenditures fall and the local share under today's rules would have been less than under the cap, localities will reimbursed for the difference. While basing a financial formula on data which can still be manipulated is risky, the fundamental nature of the change is unmistakable. The local share will be fixed regardless of how quickly Medicaid costs increase. Since its inception, New York has required its ""local social services districts,"" counties and New York City to share in the program costs of Medicaid. Only North Carolina has had a similar financing structure and now having seen the change in New York, there's talk of change there too. For most services, the local districts pay half of the non-Federal share of the costs. There are exceptions, especially for the costs of long term care, so local governments now pay over $7 billion per year toward the costs of Medicaid while having very little influence on the program's cost. For State policy makers this financing arrangement has meant that it was easier to spend and politically harder to restrain program cost growth. After all, when taking the Federal and local shares into account, the State budget only had to come up with about a third of the actual costs. But now this will change. Let's start with next year. Assume base year local expenses of just over $7.2 billion, about 20 percent of the total. Also assume an overall growth rate of 6.62 percent. It's a relatively modest rate, but it's the same as the overall growth rate from 2003 to 2004. On a calendar year basis, the State will be responsible for over $225 million in 2006 that it otherwise would have left in the laps of local officials. If growth continues at that 6.62 percent, the State assumes responsibility for an additional: $500 million in 2007 $828 million in 2008 $1.2 billion in 2009 $1.6 billion in 2010 If the growth rate is eight percent, the State picks up responsibility for an additional: $330 million in 2006 $725 million in 2007 $1.2 billion in 2008 $1.7 billion in 2009 $2.3 billion in 2010 Those figures are on top of the increase what would have been the State's share under the old system. This is a prescription for increasing financial pressure. Now it's possible that Medicaid cost growth will slow naturally in the next few years. I'll return to that in another post. But clearly the State will be hard pressed to allow rapid growth. And even more clearly, in New York the cost to the State of Medicaid growth has just gotten much more expensive.

39879	"Opportunities and assistance: Alert Concern about rights violations on eve of Africa Cup (Human Rights Watch/IFEX) - New York, January 13, 2012 - The government of Equatorial Guinea, which is co-hosting the Africa Cup of Nations later in January 2012, cracks down on political opponents, intimidates journalists, and disregards due process, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said today. Some visiting journalists who have tried to report on Equatorial Guinea over the past year have been detained, interrogated, censored, and deported. These incidents do not bode well for the sports reporters who are expected to attend the opening ceremony in the city of Bata on January 21 and other matches there and in Malabo, the capital. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo said on January 3 that he views the games as an opportunity to ""sell the country's image."" ""Hosting international events is one way to charm foreign visitors and try to impress the media, but these are superficial and don't withstand scrutiny,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The only way President Obiang can really improve his reputation is by reversing his decades of misrule and allowing genuine human rights reforms."" Intimidation and Detention of Journalists In one incident that may foreshadow difficulties for the coverage of the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations, a television crew from Germany's ZDF network who were reporting in June 2011 on women's soccer and other issues in Equatorial Guinea were detained, interrogated at length, subjected to censorship, and deported. As described in an account by the ZDF team's producer, security agents seized their footage and ordered any ""negative"" images deleted or confiscated. These included footage of children playing soccer in one of Malabo's slums and interviews with the sole member of parliament from the political opposition and a human rights lawyer. The next morning, the journalists were escorted to the airport to leave the country. The ZDF crew had been working with an official visa and the support of government ministries. Some other foreign journalists who traveled to Equatorial Guinea before and during the June 2011 African Union (AU) summit meeting, held in Malabo, have described to Human Rights Watch incidents in which they were briefly detained and forced to delete photographs, despite having been granted press permits by the government. An Associated Press photographer was taken to the police station for snapping photos in a public market in Malabo and was ordered to remove the images from her camera, and released only after she did. A photographer working for the US public relations firm hired by the government to improve its reputation was himself briefly detained after taking a photo of the AU summit venue, journalists reported. In March, the host of a state-radio program was removed after mentioning Libya during a broadcast, in violation of a temporary news blackout the government had imposed in February on the pro-democracy protests of the Arab Spring, CPJ reported. ""President Teodoro Obiang's government routinely invites journalists into the country, only to restrict their movements in an ongoing effort to deceive the world and promote a pristine image,"" said Mohamed Keita, Africa advocacy coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""Journalists covering the African Nations Cup should be able to look behind the faade freely and without fear of reprisal."" Sustained Pattern of Repression In early January, the state media reported that Obiang had stressed the need for ""security and control of immigrants"" ahead of the Africa Cup games. The comment echoed the government's language in the weeks leading up to the AU summit, when migrants in Bata were rounded up by police and mistreated in custody as part of a wider crackdown in various parts of the country. Such repression has been a hallmark of Obiang's rule, Human Rights Watch said. Political opponents are subject to arbitrary arrest and harassment. The judiciary lacks independence and basic fair trial standards are disregarded. Despite a law banning torture, the practice remains a serious problem and those responsible enjoy near-total impunity. Obiang, already Africa's longest-serving ruler, pushed through constitutional changes in November that strengthened his near-absolute grip on power. The referendum held to approve the changes was discredited by serious irregularities. The government claimed that 97.7 percent of voters approved the measure. Obiang has claimed re-election by similarly large margins. Skewed Spending Priorities The Obiang government has undertaken a massive building spree, financed by oil revenues. Much of the construction is for the enjoyment of the country's tiny elite and foreign guests, Human Rights Watch said. The lavish spending offers little apparent benefit to the majority of the population, who live in poverty. The government has not revealed how much it spent to host the Africa Cup of Nations, but known improvements include building or expanding stadiums and other sports facilities in Malabo and Bata. It also has beautified these cities ahead of the games, apparently at considerable expense. The government describes the illuminated, granite-encased Freedom Tower, which has a rotating restaurant at the top, as the ""crown"" of a new seafront promenade in Bata and ""one of the most spectacular urban images of Africa."" Other recent examples of high-cost government projects include: * A presidential guesthouse ""following the standard of 5-star hotels"" to be built in Mongomo, in the interior of the country, at a cost of $77 million, according to the company that obtained the contract. * A $830 million conference center and resort complex built by the government in Sipopo, outside of Malabo, to host the African Union summit in June. It was also used to host the Africa-South America Summit in November and is slated to be the site of future meetings. Among other high-end amenities, the Sipopo complex includes 52 luxury villas that face a mile-long artificial beach. Obiang recently described those who accuse his government of diverting the country's oil wealth as its ""enemies."" ""President Obiang spares no expense to build luxury buildings, monuments, and major infrastructure projects,"" Bekele said. ""But all that shiny new construction can't detract from the harsh reality of repression and grinding poverty in Equatorial Guinea under his rule.""

18828	"Mother's Life at Risk With advances in modern medicine there are almost no conditions in pregnancy and childbirth that require abortion to save the mother's life. The exceptions are mainly tubal pregnancy and uterine cancer. Abortion advocates claim that every pregnancy threatens a woman's life. The person determining ""mental health"" is a gynaecologist not a psychiatrist. Young teenage mothers have the least complications in childbirth. The principle of 'double effect' means the intention is to save the woman's life, not deliberately to kill the foetus. An example of 'double effect' is a tubal pregnancy which is invariably fatal to the mother. The leading cause of death during pregnancy is murder. Alan Guttmacher said in his book "" Abortion Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow "" The Case for Legalized Abortion Now which was published in 1967: ""Today it is possible for almost any patient to be brought through pregnancy alive, unless she suffers from a fatal disease such as cancer or leukemia, and if so, abortion would be unlikely to prolong, much less save the life"" Alan Guttmacher, who succeeded Margaret Sanger as head of Planned Parenthood, probably did more to spread abortion on demand throughout the world than any other individual. Considerable advances have been made in medicine since he made that statement. Abortion activists have successfully used the same two step strategy to legalise abortion in countries around the world. First is the campaign to have abortion legal in the ""hard"" cases of incest and abortion. An example is where a very young teenage girl, say 13-years old, is pregnant as a result of rape or incest. The incidence of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest is around 1 percent. In many cases abortion is performed against the wishes of the girl, and is in fact used to cover-up the crime. The next step in the campaign is to expand the exceptions for abortion to include cases of ""severe foetal abnormality"" and to ""save the life of the mother,"" which is then expanded to ""when the physical or mental health of the mother is at risk."" This last definition is taken by abortionists to mean abortion on demand and 98-99 percent of all abortions for performed for 'mental health' reasons. 98-99% of all abortions are performed for 'mental health' reasons. Stretching the Definition Lise Fortier, an abortionist, said at the 1980 national convention of the National Abortion Federation: ""Each and every pregnancy threatens a woman's life. From a strict medical viewpoint, every pregnancy should be aborted."" This is a common attitude among abortionists and advocates of abortion. Many doctors, believing that abortion is safer than childbirth, consider any pregnancy as life-threatening and use that as justification for abortion. Abortionist David Zbaraz has actually claimed that all first-trimester and most second-trimester abortions are medically necessary since, as he alleges, they are safer than childbirth. Minnesota abortionist Jane Hodgson stated her case in much simpler and more direct terms: ""A medically necessary abortion is any abortion a woman asks for."" On the website safemotherhood.org, is an article entitled Every Pregnancy faces Risks, prepared by International Planned Parenthood Federation among others. The opening sentence states: "" Every time a woman is pregnant - which happens an estimated 200 million times every year around the world - she risks a sudden and unpredictable complication that could result in her death or injury, and the death or injury of her infant."" Dr. Jasper Williams, a former president of the National Medical Association, noted that, in 23 years of practice, he knew of only two women who had actually died in childbirth from previously undiagnosed causes; one of a pulmonary embolism and the other from an amniotic fluid embolism. It is his opinion that abortionists will expand even minor conditions (such as mild varicose veins) into ""threats to the woman's life."" Widespread exploitation of the ""mental health"" clause is the same the world over. Mental Health Widespread exploitation of the ""mental health"" clause in abortion laws is the same the world over. The person who makes a determination of mental problems is not a psychiatrist but the abortionist Professor Myre Sim, a lecturer in Psychiatry at Birmingham University, recognized that abortionists are certainly not qualified to make psychiatric evaluations; ""I was able to demonstrate successfully that psychiatry was competent to deal with all the psychiatric hazards of pregnancy, and that the day that a psychiatrist required a gynaecologist to treat his patients has not arrived."" Dr Sim studied 213 patients with puerperal psychosis and stated baldly: ""There are no psychiatric grounds for the termination of pregnancy."" (Sim, M (1963). Abortion and the psychiatrist. Brit. Med. J., July 2O, 145-148) Puerperal psychosis, in almost all cases, is a mood disorder accompanied by features such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations, severe thought disturbance, and abnormal behaviour. Dr Julia Faed, a clinical psychologist of Dunedin New Zealand, gave expert evidence in the Christchurch High Court in 1992 that reactive depression was a contra-indication for abortion (abortion is not recommended where there is depression). She stated that the correct treatment for reactive depression was counselling or, if necessary, medication, and for severe reactive depression hospitalisation. Read more here. There is no evidence that a continued unwanted pregnancy will endanger the mother's mental health. Dr. Carlos del Campose, who surveyed literature on the subject of children born to women refused abortion for various reasons concluded: ""The literature shows a generally comparable outcome of pregnancy, delivery and puerperium [the period immediately following childbirth] between women who were denied abortion and controls. ""No evidence that a continued unwanted pregnancy will endanger the mother's mental health; good acceptance of the infant by the mother, especially if she has the father's support; and minimal to moderate psychosocial disadvantages for the child."" "" There is now general agreement that pregnancy does not alter the natural history of disease, so that, provided a woman survives the immediate challenge, neither her health nor her life-expectancy is permanently changed."" Abortion advocates believe that extreme youth is a reason for abortion on the grounds that childbirth would endanger the life of the girl. Some even go as far as saying that abortion should be mandatory for all girls 14 and under. A study found that teenaged girls had the least complications from childbirth of any age group of childbearing women. Despite this, research has shown that pregnancy and childbirth is safer for young girls than for older women.The most comprehensive study every performed on the physical and mental effects of childbirth on teenagers found that teenaged girls had the least complications from childbirth of any age group of childbearing women. The four-year study conducted by the National Institute of Child Health Development (NICHD) and the University of Pennsylvania was based upon the case histories of 9,000 women who had given birth in a Copenhagen hospital. Chief researcher Dr. Brian Sutton-Smith stated that ""We have found that teen-age mothers, given proper care, have the least complications in childbirth. The younger the mother, the better the birth."" (The New York Times, April 24, 1979) Dr. Sutton-Smith also reviewed other studies that came to different conclusions, and stated that these ""obscured the findings"" by deliberately including a large proportion of teenagers living in deep poverty and comparing them to older, more affluent women. Any treatment administered to save a woman's life that also results in the death of a preborn child is not a true abortion. The Principle of the ""Double Effect"" The principle of the ""double effect means that any treatment administered to save a woman's life that also results in the death of a preborn child is not a true abortion, since the primary purpose of the treatment was to save a life not take it. Even if the death of the baby is a foregone conclusion, such an action is not classifiable as an abortion. Some of the treatments that may indirectly kill a preborn child include certain cancer treatments; hysterectomy (removal) of a cancerous or severely traumatized uterus; and salpingectomy (the removal of a Fallopian tube). It is possible that the surgeon could delay treatment of the mother until the foetus reaches a viable stage of development. In this way it could be possible to save the life of both the mother and the baby. Ectopic Pregnancy The most common application of the ""double effect"" occurs in the case of a ectopic (tubal) pregnancy when the embryo implants in the Fallopian tube, instead of completing its journey to the uterus. Such implantation is inevitably fatal to the woman if her pregnancy progresses too far. It is quite possible for a baby to implant virtually anywhere in the mother's abdominal cavity and survive. One mother gave birth to a perfectly healthy baby boy who had somehow migrated out of a rupture in the uterus and had implanted in the vicinity of her stomach. The surgical procedure used to remedy this situation is fairly simple to describe. The surgeon first must use ultrasonography to diagnose the unruptured tubal pregnancy. He then inserts a laparoscope (small camera with light) through an incision in the abdominal wall and locates the distended fallopian tube. He then laterally incises the tube and suctions out the embryo. Although legally and medically, this procedure is the same as a typical suction abortion, it is different in several critical ways. Although legally and medically, this procedure is the same as a typical suction abortion, it is different in several critical ways. In the majority of cases, the pregnancy is wanted and the intent of the surgical procedure is to save life. In the future, doctors hope to be able to remove the embryo intact and transfer it to the uterus, where it will be successfully implanted. See here for a list of Conditions that do not require abortion. Many New or Expectant Mothers Die Violent Deaths Five years ago in Maryland, state health researchers Isabelle Horon and Diana Cheng set out to study maternal deaths, using sophisticated methods to spot dozens of overlooked cases in their state. They assumed they would find more deaths from medical complications than the state's statistics showed. The last thing they expected was murder. A Washington Post article on December 19, 2004 reported the findings of a year-long investigation of death-record data in states across the country documents the killings of 1,367 pregnant women and new mothers since 1990. They believe this is only part of the national toll, because no reliable system is in place to track such cases. The Post quoted Pat Brown, a criminal profiler in Minneapolis, on December 19: ""If the woman doesn't want the baby, she can get an abortion. If the guy doesn't want it, he can't do a damn thing about it. He is stuck with a child for the rest of his life, he is stuck with child support for the rest of his life, and he's stuck with that woman for the rest of his life. If she goes away, the problem goes away."" Crime expert Louis Mizell said, ""When husbands or boyfriends attack pregnant partners, it usually has to do with an unwillingness to deal with fatherhood, marriage, child support or public scandal."" In conclusion Even before the legalisation of abortion around the world, there were very few instances where a woman could not obtain an abortion in order to save her life. To use the argument that abortion is safer than childbirth because every pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk, is seen by those opposed to abortion as a smokescreen, especially when advances in medicine are elimating, or at least controlling, most of the conditions that could have resulted in the death of a pregnant woman.

16488	"Tottenham confident they will hang on to at least one of their most wanted players 1 Comment Posted on 15 Jul 2012 at 10:00pm New Spurs manager Andre Villas Boas is confident of holding on to his star midfielder Rafael van der Vaart amidst speculation about the Dutchman's probable move away from the White Hart Lane. The ex- Chelsea manager is resigned to losing Luka Modric and despite signing Gylfi Sigurdsson he believes that ex- Real Madrid midfielder has a key role to play in the coming season. Van der Vaart has been linked with a return to his former club Hamburg but manager Villas-Boas feels he will 'probably' commit his career at the North London club. The arrival of Gylfi Sigurdsson might have placed tainted doubts about his future at the club while rumours circulated about probable addition of another midfielder in the form of Moutinho. However the Portuguese has asserted that Van der Vaart holds an important place in his plans. ""With Van der Vaart, at the moment I am absolutely counting on him,"" Villas-Boas said while speaking to the reporters . ""It is a totally different situation from Luka, who has been chased by different clubs in the past two seasons and is continuing to drag interest. We have to make sure the club's interests are met, and it is up to the chairman to decide that."" 1 Comment You mean Bale isn't wanted? Walker isn't wanted? Spurs have several wanted players that they will be keeping hold of, and are doing very profitable business with modric on their own terms, unlike if they had allowed themselve to be bullied out of him last Summer. I consider that to be highly positive. "	News	News
9878	"There is a certain irony to libraries in hospitals being closed at a time when the value and impact of evidence-based information for patient care is increasingly being recognized [ 1 , 2 ]. Between 1989 and 2006, it is estimated that between 36% and 44% of hospital libraries closed [ 3 ]. The closures may have resulted from the dilution of relevant hospital library standards by the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. As an example, the 1999 accreditation manual included three ""Knowledge-based information"" (KBI) standards [ 4 ]. The first required that hospitals provide ""systems, resources and services to meet KBI needs in patient care, education, research and management."" The intent section elaborated that this could be met by an on-site library, a qualified medical librarian, or a cooperative arrangement for their provision. By 2009, all that remained was one standard requiring access to KBI. Without the provision for a library or librarian, any ""current and authoritative"" website could suffice [ 5 ]. The dilution of Joint Commission standards appears to sanction reducing the level of knowledge required in hospitals. There is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship between the revised standards and the closure of hospital libraries, but the trends coincide. Pressures that diminish the availability of information conflict with the rising absolute need for more knowledge. Consider this: In the course of any single day, approximately 95,616 patients are hospitalized in the United States [ 6 ]. Insurance providers record the number of tests, surgery, and drugs administered to these patients, but no one measures the level of knowledge brought to their care. The need for information to support patient care has been documented: Research shows that 2 questions arise for every 3 patients in office practice [ 7 ] and an average of 5 questions arise per patient encounter in academic medical settings [ 8 ]. These questions may go unanswered. Studies report that physicians pursue answers to only 36% -- 55% of questions raised about patients' care [ 9 , 10 ]. Unanswered questions, or even unasked questions, may lead to poorer medical care. The Institute of Medicine estimates that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year from preventable medical errors [ 11 ]. With 95,616 patients in the hospital any given day, an average of 5 questions per patient encounter in academic settings, and at most only 55% of these questions being pursued, that leaves at least 215,136 questions a day going unanswered. No wonder health care errors have become a national crisis and remain at an unacceptable level [ 12 ]. In the face of rising errors and accumulating knowledge, finding time to sort through the literature to find answers to specific patient questions is crucial to quality patient care. Clinicians are hard pressed to find the time to answer these care questions. Yet the one staff person whose job it is to answer them, the librarian, is no longer a requirement. Evidence-based medicine is not without controversy: Ill-advised advocates for ""evidence-free,"" also known as ""logical,"" medicine have surfaced. Proponents of evidence-free medicine say it allows the ""incorporation of a variety of facts and warrants, reasons and reasoning, into clinical decisions. Forgoing evidence allows clinical medicine to once again be a personal and prudential undertaking, arising from and focused on the individual patient"" [ 13 ]. Evidence-free medicine may be a reaction to the evidence-challenged environment of hospitals deregulated from having access to a librarian or library. It is wise not to need what you do not have. Without the assistance of a qualified librarian and support for a collection, there is no one to call for searches and no journal subscriptions if an article is needed. The conflict between weakening information requirements on the one hand and increasing need for information resources on the other may result in diminishing availability of quality care. Who would really want to be treated at a hospital lacking an information base? Reactions to the eroding knowledge core are mounting. The following developments illustrate the pressures for change and the opportunities they create for librarians: President Obama's emphasis on comparative effectiveness research may encourage medicine to use what works for patient populations on a large scale. Practitioners need the literature base to determine what is effective and where exceptions exist and, at some point, to enable payment for genetic variations or innovations. The electronic health record (EHR) can effectively distribute such practice guidelines, and librarians are already actively involved in integrating practice guidelines with KBI resources [ 14 , 15 ]. Deepening their involvement with the EHR, librarians are using their classification and electronic record knowledge to inventory physician order sets and develop record databases [ 16 ]. Beyond installation, librarians stay on to educate staff in information retrieval, as training is a long-standing function for librarians. ""Magnet"" hospitals are associated with nursing excellence because their environment of care fosters a quality focus. Magnet hospital status, a designation of the American Nurses Credentialing Center, pushes for anchoring hospital, even unit-based, polices to the literature. ""Creating, advancing, and sustaining a practice environment grounded in evidence-based practice and nursing research is essential to achieving Magnet status"" [ 17 ]. Literature's importance in this setting is demonstrated by a recent survey of Magnet-certified institutions, which has found that 94% have access to a medical or nursing library in the medical center complex and another 4% have library privileges although outside the center [ 18 ]. Nurses are pivotal in quality care, being unit-based first responders and care providers. As they strive for excellence, they enhance the focus on information resources. Why not work at a hospital that uses what works? This integration of evidence into the Magnet Program facilitates librarian involvement and library use [ 19 ]. The movement to tie better results into better reimbursement is already underway in the form of Medicare's Pay for Performance initiatives. Perhaps the existing unsatisfactory hospital performance relates to the elimination of the library as a requirement for Medicare reimbursement in 1984 [ 20 ]. Hospitals need information resources to determine effective techniques and best practices in order to achieve better results. The conflict noted above is evident here: The requirement for information resources falls, while the need for information usage grows. Pay for Performance may require access to the literature, for example, when the hospital committee charged with developing a protocol for urinary catheter removal calls the librarian for a search. When the question becomes, ""When is the best time for catheter removal?,"" those institutions with a library can find an answer supported by data. New preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews require writers to describe their ""search methodology"" along with their research methodology and to identify ""who designed and conducted the literature search"" [ 21 ]. This statement emphasizes the importance of the information scientist and supports the premise that correctly synthesizing the literatures requires first retrieving the entire relevant literature base. PRISMA standards have been simultaneously published by four journals and are fast replacing earlier efforts to offer standards for systematic review information retrieval. The recognition of the importance of the literature retrieval process may be a reaction to the loss of life, possibly due to poor literature searching [ 22 ]. If accepted at a national level, the need for a search could be included in mandatory care guidelines for reimbursement. Given that systematic reviews are beginning to define best practice, librarians are well positioned to play a central role in the development of practice guidelines. Broadened accessibility of ""detailing"" services like systematic review assistance, search protocol projects, and librarian attendance at morning report reflect the increasing value given to ""expert searching."" A recent US survey has found the percentage of clinical librarians (CLs) increasing, with approximately 200 CLs in 2005/06 [ 3 ]. CLs possess the sophisticated knowledge needed to integrate diagnosis, drug, and disease variables. As an example, they can find literature on how therapy for psychosis changes in an immune-suppressed transplant patient on multiple drugs, with an underlying inherited disease. Support for the importance of the CL role is provided by a 2008 report commissioned by the British National Health Service (NHS) to review library and knowledge services in England. The report recommended an increase in the number of clinical librarians from 50 to 800 [ 23 ]. The British NHS report advocates for CLs as part of their effort to ""make the best use of its resources to provide high quality, equitable care for patients"" [ 23 ]. CLs help find effective interventions in the literature and bridge the gap between article and bedside. With the Oxford-founded Cochrane Collaboration demonstrating the impact of systematic reviews to determine efficacy, the international emphasis on using literature to advance care is flourishing. Increasingly, the ""science"" in ""library science"" itself is growing. The Evidence-based Library and Information Practice journal attests to the growing amount of science supporting information practice [ 24 ]. As librarians, we must advance and embrace the structure underlying good information retrieval and audit trails documenting a quality search. Accountability for the results only increases the value of the search and searcher. Hopefully, someday institutions will score their ""information readiness"" in order to quantify the information resources available for the care of individual patients. The information readiness score might be akin to designations like the ""most-wired"" status for hospitals [ 25 ] or hierarchy levels for trauma centers [ 26 ]. The availability of search design assistance or search performance by a qualified information professional, timeliness of article delivery, currency and depth of the literature collection, number of hours of onsite access, and number of licensed databases might factor into the level of information readiness. Hospital staff may note in the EHR the level of evidence used in decision making and the consultant who conducted the search. Institutions may come to boast about the level of knowledge available for patient care, while the time to diffusion and use of knowledge at the bedside may shorten. Many are quick to tout the broad-based searching of Google as the answer to ""searching"" in medicine. Searching and finding are two different things. Science has determined that multiple databases need to be searched for adequate coverage [ 27 ] and that Google Scholar lags behind academic databases for timeliness [ 28 ]. When it comes to searching versus finding, librarians have a privileged position [ 29 ]. The librarian has the combination of time, technique, and training, plus the expertise, to find the needed information. There is a subtle shift in the literature to valuing who is the searcher, paying attention to what they are searching, and determining the level of evidence of the retrieval. An article in the journal Chest recommends that ""a professional information specialist should be engaged"" before claiming ""the literature shows that..."" [ 30 ]. In time, hospitals may return to the notion that the librarian is an expert consultant who can provide evidence, maximizes the electronic database, and is an essential component in quality care. These hospitals' patients would not be the first people to owe their lives to a librarian [ 31 ]. "	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
20629	"Because the long arc of the universe bends toward justice. For religious people who are conflicted about same-sex marriage If you are among the many invisible Americans who are conflicted about same-sex marriage, there are a variety of items to consider, including: Understanding the dynamics of an identity shift. Identifying creative tensions between values and experience. Practicing being gentle with yourself as you sort things out. Living ""as if"" in order to gain experience-based information. Being ""willing to be willing"" as a way to alleviate inner conflict. Addressing knowledge gaps proactively. Exploring your own socialization process up to this point. IDENTITY SHIFT First of all, let's name the dynamic you might be experiencing. If you have been conflicted about what to do about voting on the proposed amendment that would impact same-sex marriage, consider that what you are going through is an identity shift. Just naming what is going on can alleviate the stress and make it easier to address it. An identity shift means that you are between trapezes, in a sort of limbo. You have let go of the trapeze that represented who you used to be, while being uncertain about what your life will be like once you grab the new trapeze. Or maybe you will return to the original trapeze you just released, realizing you aren't ready to move into a new position or grasp and claim a new opinion. It's like walking to the edge of the high dive at a pool -- and then, at that moment, realizing you're not ready to jump. With the issue of same-sex marriage and the proposal to define marriage as a union only between a man and woman, maybe you are shifting from the belief that marriage is always and only intended to be between a man and a woman, and you are earnestly and humbly seeking whether marriage can be expanded to include same-sex couples who also wish to make public loving commitments to one another, to provide mutual care for one another, and to grow old together. Or maybe your belief is shifting in the reverse direction. So be it. This identity shift and the status of being between trapezes is a process. It includes moving from the Known into the Unknown. The Unknown includes not knowing exactly when, where, or how the ""incoming trapeze"" will impact you. Being in limbo like that is one of the hardest psychological tasks that we as humans will encounter, and that is likely why you are in such anguish. CONFLICTING VALUES, EXPERIENCE, or KNOWLEDGE Another reason for such anguish and inner conflict could be that you have a growing awareness of two or more things that are in tension with each other, pulling at you. Is there an unnamed conflict between the teachings of your own religious tradition and your personal values that you've been living by? Is there conflict between what your community or religious leaders are saying that go against your own direct experience of people who identify as gay or lesbian, or go against your own experience with people who identify as being part of a long-term, loving, same-sex relationship? Maybe a religious teaching that you have followed is in direct conflict with a personal value, such as supporting the freedom for people to marry who they love; or it's in conflict with what you know of the history of marriage , such as women were once considered a man's property and marriage was a strategic way to transfer property or keep the peace. Identify the rhetoric, behaviors, attitudes, etc. that you are most and least comfortable with and explore where the tension comes from. Discipline yourself to view this exploration as a refining process or as a way to clarify at a deeper level what you believe in. And give yourself time... BE GENTLE WITH YOURSELF As I've said, being in limbo is a hard thing to live into. Give yourself the gift of practicing being gentle with yourself. Begin to notice when your body tenses up as you think through certain points, when you read things in the news, hear them on television, or come across them on the internet. Cultivate the simple ability to notice when your body tenses and when your body relaxes. Doing so can give you some indication of your own visceral response, which may in turn give you information about the direction you are naturally moving in, based on how you care for yourself and what your body tells you. LIVE AS IF Another technique is to live one day as if you disapproved of same-sex marriage and would therefore vote Yes on the proposed amendment, supporting the idea of defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman. The next day, you'd live as if you were okay with same-sex marriage and would vote No on the proposed amendment, indicating that you wouldn't support defining marriage as only a union between a man and a woman. Check in with yourself each day you ""live as if"" and reflect on how you viewed couples and families through that temporary lens. Consider keeping a journal to record new awarenesses and insights you may have. BE WILLING TO BE WILLING Another thing to do for yourself would be to practice what I call, ""Be willing to be willing."" If you don't feel ready to open yourself to receive more understanding about the issue, then affirm that you are willing to be willing to understand where you are moving to. Be willing to be willing to change. Be willing to be willing to know what is the more loving thing to do in a given situation, and what stance more closely aligns with your values; those sorts of questions. We might not be willing to be changed. That might be too scary. But we might be willing to be willing to be changed, and that can ease us into whatever change we're being calling to, knowingly or unknowingly. FILL IN YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE GAPS As a more intellectual step, take responsibility to explore your own knowledge gap about the history of the issue, about the dynamics of privilege and oppression, and about the impact on the groups who say they will be affected one way or another. Get a handle on what evidence and what rumors are available about what impacts will truly occur. For example, have those forecasted impacts occurred to heterosexual couples in other places where same-sex marriage is already allowed? Have they occurred to same-sex couples in places where same-sex marriage is barred? In addition, in terms of identifying, addressing, or exploring knowledge gaps, consider what is the multi-generational impact of approving any constitutional amendment, versus having a law on the books that already prohibits same-sex marriage. Why was the constitution of any state written in the first place? What's our current responsibility, if any, to standing by those original reasons and intentions? LEARN ABOUT THE SOCIALIZATION PROCESS There are many examples from history about how stereotypes are formed and reinforced, how they are broken down. Socialization happens in our families, in our political system, in our houses of worship, in our schools, among our peers, and through our newspapers, books, and television. As infants and children, we can't say, ""Please teach me about unconditional love"" or ""Tell me about why Americans believe in the American Dream."" We grow up in environments that decide for us what values and beliefs we should be exposed to -- about White people, about women, about people of color, about vocation, about the value of education, the value of manual labor; about being on time and about taking time to connect with people we seldom see; about how tolerant and welcoming to be about differing viewpoints, or how dismissive... Learn about how we are socialized , depending on if we are part of the dominant culture/majority group, or if we are part of the non-dominant culture/minority group. Then consider how that socialization plays into your stance on the issue you are exploring. And remember the trapezes. We can spend a lot of time in between them, but the world keeps on spinning, oftentimes according to the whims and the will of the majority. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Instruction
46776	"As Megan Stammers, 15, is found -- we ask is this the end of the story? Megan Stammers, 15 and the teacher she ran off with Jeremy Forrest, 30 have been found. Naturally her frantic parents are thrilled and are quoted in many papers saying they cannot wait to be reunited. Meanwhile, Mr Forrest could face charges under child abduction. Megan's parents will surely hope that now home this will be the end of Megan's 'relationship' with Mr Forrest. But, as it's reported the pair were not planning to return when they were found, is this the end...? In 30 years of journalism. I've covered all sorts of 'unusual relationship' stories but the most fascinating that springs to mind is the case of a former school teacher Mary Kay Letourneau who had an affair with her 13 year old pupil -- but has now married him and the couple have two children. Already a mum to two boys and two girls, Letourneau, 35, was a strict catholic, and living in Seattle with her good-looking husband Stephen, when she embarked on her illegal love affair. The couple first met when Letourneau taught the boy aged eight and even then she confesses she was 'hauntingly drawn' to the child. ""There was a bond between us that was instantaneous ,"" she explains. ""There was a respect, an insight, a spirit, an understanding that grew over time."" Then, in the summer of 1996 the boy, Vili Fualaau, showed his affection for his teacher by spending his pocket money on a silver ring. ""He pushed the ring on her finger and they stared at eachother for what he described as 'an eternity',"" says one police insider. ""That was when he knew his feelings were sexual."" Before long the couple were enjoying regular sex and within a few months, when Vili was aged just 12, LeTourneau became pregnant. Husband Steve, who had not made love with his wife for some months, became suspicious when his wife began showing early signs of pregnancy... then he found some love letters. ""I felt sick,"" he remembers. ""I went straight round to the boy's house and asked 'are you sleeping with my wife?'. When he nodded my world fell apart."" Mr LeTourneau confided in relatives, told school officials and Letourneau pleaded guilty to second degree child-rape and was jailed for six months. In 1997 she gave birth to a little girl, Audrey while out on probation. However, when she was released on probation under the conditions that she would not see her young lover and would get counselling, she ran straight back into the arms of the boy and Police discovered the pair together at 3am in a parked car with steamed up windows. Reports claim she was planning to run way with the boy and their baby -- cash, baby clothes and her passport were found in the car -- going into hiding until he was old enough to marry. But having violated her probation, a Seattle court then jailed her for 71/2 years. Incredibly, she found she was expecting another baby and in 1998 while serving time, she gave birth to a second little girl, Georgia Alexis. But in November 1999 Mary Kay was placed in six months' solitary confinement after letters she tried to send to Vili were intercepted. Mary Kay, then aged 42, was not released from prison until 2004 but by then Vili, then aged 21, had filed to get the court order of no contact between them reversed. The pair, at last reunited, wasted no time in getting married -- and in May 2005, having become a media sensation -- exclusive access to the wedding was granted to a TV show reportedly selling for a six figure sum. The couple's affair scandalised America. Mary Kay Letourneau's family and friends were stunned by her actions. After all, she was seen as the typical 'all American girl'. During an interview Vili said: ""I'm not a victim. I'm not ashamed of being a father. I'm not ashamed of being in love with Mary Kay."" Meanwhile Mary Kay is quoted as saying: ""He dominated me in the most masculine way that any man, any leader, could do. I trusted him and believed in him and in our future."" The couple have since gone on to have a book published and most recently their story was turned into a movie -- That's My Boy. Both daughters live with them and while Vili works as a DJ, Mary Kay is a paralegal.

One Response to As Megan Stammers, 15, is found -- we ask is this the end of the story? Since writing this post, Featureworld received this anonymous comment: This shouldn't be the end. Not only do I believe that it's not right for news presenters and readers to be saying 'she ""thought"" she loved her 30-year-old maths teacher'. It's mocking her feelings. Only Megan will know what she thought. And that brings me to the next point, these news readers, detectives and journalists think they know how she felt and what made her leave with her maths teacher. The truth is, once again, only she will ever know how she felt and how she still feels. She is fifteen, old enough to make a choice, and I understand it may not be the choice she would have made if she was five years older, but I know that she as every other teenager was thinking ""why not?""I am the same age as Megan and perhaps it's you ""adults"" that need to listen to us for a change when we tell you we know better. If I was ever to meet Megan, if I was ever so fortunate to be able to tell her I, myself, knows how she must have felt and still do. No I've never ran away with my maths teacher, but that does not mean that running away has never crossed my mind. It was heart-breaking to watch not only Megan's parents but alson Jeremy's parents plea for them to return home but it was what Megan wanted.""She went willingly"" All I ask for you is to realise Megan isn't the only one that wanted something she ""never had"". But she was the only one that did something she ""never did"". My wishes are that somehow, Jeremy and Megan will continue to see each-other if that is what they would want. We are all human, some older than others but it shouldnt be against ""the law"". I would proudly shake Megans hand and tell her how inspirational she has been. "	News	News

Back in the day, during some me time, I made a note to self to not say irritating things. Simples. I thought I was going forward and had become a ledge, but after drinking all the fat from my coke I realised people couldn't understand anything I was saying without degrading my language to theirs. They were confused.com and so I unveiled that I would revert back. OMG, LOL or any of their cousins. In fact, even saying Oh my God is now unacceptable. Anything endorsed ad infinitum by that moron Rio Ferdinand and his Twitter wannabe acolytes. Innit. I is. Bruv. Nearly every word spoken by anyone on Eastenders under the age of 21. World Class to be used to describe even the most non-descript footballer. Sky are guilty of this. Which brings me to 'Super Sunday' - we get the alliteration but you can't use 'Super' if you are about to broadcast Bolton vs Stoke. It's just Sunday. The one i most despise is referring to someone as 'my rock'. Two reasons quite clearly the person is not a rock. Secondly, that phrase was first introduced by Princess Diana in reference to a heart surgeon. Whenever i hear people say it i always ask them if they idolised her. They never know why i ask but they all do in fact idolise her. Note to self, going forward ignore any articles unveiled from lame.com site who thinks they are a legend from back in the day, who should have had more ""me"" time. I prefer the Full Fat articles, not inane drivel. Simples! Oh... and welcome to my world... bitches :D Heres a new one thats spreading like wildfire where i live ,people saying its ""not even that"" when your explaining something. It renders what you've just said as meaningless and i want to kill the cunts who say it great article, the one that gets me is ""he turned around and said"" then ""i turned around and said"" then"" she turned around and and said"" can everyone just fucking stop turning around, and a lot less bollocks would be talked, and Jeremy Kyle would be 20 mins shorter every day! Hmm, it seems like we have some real First World problems here, doesn't it? D'you know there are poor kids starving their shrivelled cocks off in shithouse countries ran by stoopid fucking useless corrupt cunts who'd give their right eyes to be able to hear any of the above atrocities. But fuck them. I hate - HATE - ""what's the dealio?"" I will rip someone's fucking neck apart one of these days, twenty-odd year old wankers. You are so much better than everyone else. Really though, most of this has been tweeted and face booked so many times that this falls into category it attempts to attack. Not an original idea in the whole thing. Using swear words to punctuate is far fucking worse than the thing it attacks. I completely agree with whoever brought literally to this. The over/misuse of the word literally really gets on my goat. Your friend is not literally on fire thank you very much. Also, in the office, people who pro-actively do things. Since when did we not just do things? @Sam - spot on about swearing in every other sentence! People in glass houses. Oh wait, you'll go add that to your list now! 12) Making childish lists of things people say that annoy you. 13) Reading a childish list of things people say that annoy a complete stranger, then leaving a comment about how childish it is to make such a list. There are no winners in this. ""I'm not being funny but..."" No, it was never 'funny' in the first place. ""She turned around and said..."" Did she quite literally TURN AROUND? No. She didn't. (But this WOOP WOOP thing does get on my tits, cheers Ed. 'The new' ... insert name of very famous and (usually but not always) talented; footballer, band, writer, wrestler, arc welder etc, afterwards. This is always and without exception a complete and unashamedload of shite and reveals a complete lack of imagination or grasp of your subject. Sub-editors of Sabotage Times who compose the strap-lines, please take note. JK, what are you like, eh? You're a regular says-annoying-things offender, aren't you? Come on JK, I'm not sure childish is the right word. You're just a big baby. This list could have been endless, really. Sorry, but I just thought of two others and these are down to our wonderful (M)Ad men (and women) ""New, improved..."" It's either new or improved - it's not possible to be both. ""Genuine reproduction..."" So new then? Some times it all gets a bit too much and I'm sorry to say that swearing does get run up the old flag pole to see who salutes it... Bollocks... I hate it when anyone associated with football says ""you've got the great players like the Beckhams, the Scholes, the Rooneys, the Terrys. And the great clubs like the Boltons, the Evertons, the Arsenals."" Fucks me off. And things being ""straight out of the top drawer"". That's where keep my pants, but I'm sure they don't mean that. Andy Townsend has a lot to answer for. Hagbard Is it me,or is everything in this article a sub-standard, bastardised version of the already substandard ""humour"" of ""is it me, or is everything shit?""? ......................................

2929	"Bitter fruit ... an Apple store in California. A law firm is alleging the company worked with publishers to push ebook prices up. Photograph: Russel A Daniels/AP A class-action lawsuit has been filed in the US alleging that Apple and five major publishers ""colluded ... to illegally fix prices"" of ebooks . The lawsuit, filed by law firm Hagens Berman in California northern district court, claims that HarperCollins, Hachette Book Group, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster conspired with Apple to increase ebook prices in order ""to boost profits and force ebook rival Amazon to abandon its pro-consumer discount pricing"", and that they are ""in violation of a variety of federal and state antitrust laws"". The complaint centres on the agency model -- used by Apple for iTunes and by most major publishers for ebook sales -- in which the publisher, rather than the retailer, sets the retail price of ebooks. The model has already sparked investigations in Europe and the UK , with the Office of Fair Trading investigating whether certain publisher-retailer arrangements ""may breach competition law"", and the European commission looking into whether companies have colluded to keep ebook prices high. Naming two plaintiffs, California resident Anthony Petru and Mississippi resident Marcus Mathis -- both of whom purchased at least one ebook for over $9.99 after the adoption of the agency pricing model -- the lawsuit, once approved, will represent any purchaser of an ebook by a major publisher after the adoption of the agency model and could, according to Hagens Berman, be worth ""tens of millions of dollars"". It alleges that the five publishers ""feared"" Amazon's move to price ebooks at $9.99 -- a figure considerably below physical book prices. The pricing ""threatened to disrupt the publishers' long-established brick-and-mortar model faster than [they] were willing to accept"", and to set low consumer expectations for ebook prices. Pointing to Macmillan's battle with Amazon over the agency model last year , which ultimately saw the online retailer capitulate to Macmillan's introduction of the model ""because Macmillan has a monopoly over their own titles"", the lawsuit says the five publishers ""forced Amazon to abandon its discount pricing and adhere to a new agency model ... If Amazon attempted to sell ebooks below the publisher-set levels, the publishers would simply deny Amazon access to the title."" This has, the suit says, seen the prices of new ebooks increase to an average of $12-15 -- a rise of 33 to 50% -- and reach a point where they are often more expensive than physical editions. ""As a result of the pricing conspiracy, prices of ebooks have exploded, jumping as much as 50%. When an ebook version of a bestseller costs close to or even more than its hard-copy counterpart, it doesn't take a forensic economist to see that this is evidence of market manipulation,"" said Steve Berman, founding partner of Hagens Berman, in a press release about the suit . ""Fortunately for the publishers, they had a co-conspirator as terrified as they were over Amazon's popularity and pricing structure, and that was Apple. We intend to prove that Apple needed a way to neutralise Amazon's Kindle before its popularity could challenge the upcoming introduction of the iPad -- a device Apple intended to compete as an e-reader."" But while publishers were likely to be ""concerned"" at the law suit -- ""it's another force ranging against them, and another example where they look like they are against rather than for the consumer"" -- The Bookseller's deputy editor Philip Jones said there was ""no smoking gun"" in the evidence. ""There are lots of accusations of collusion and conspiracy, rather like a John Grisham novel, but I couldn't find a single instance where they had proof, or even hinted that they had proof,"" he said. ""There is a question over how the agency model has been implemented and whether that is illegal in the US and Europe, and that is what the regulatory bodies on both sides of the pond are looking into, but they are insinuating that there was collusion between Apple and these major publishers and I don't believe they can make the case. The lawyers can write that collusion was necessary for agency to occur, and give logic to that argument, but that doesn't prove that collusion actually took place.""

35716	"drawing by picasso Theseus and the Minetor...um, Minotaur Long, long ago, back when togas were fashionable the first time around, the city of Athens lived under the weight of a terrible debt. This was not a simple monetary deficit - it was a debt to King Minos of Crete, whose son was killed there when he competed in the annual athletic games. King Minos took out his revenge in the way powerful and terrible people could in ancient times. He demanded that seven young men and seven young women from Athens come to Crete once every nine years. There these innocents would be devoured by the Minotaur - a frightful monster that was half man, half bull. Theseus, the grown son of King Aegeus of Athens, knew that his day had come to be one of the fourteen hostages who would make the fateful journey to Crete. But he swore that he would not die at the jaws of the Minotaur. ""I will kill him!"" he told the others. They did not believe him, but they were impressed with his courage and resolve.

26075	Yeah, OK. We have no war going on in the USA. No one is blowing up planes. We don't need the TSA and body cavity searches to fly to Vegas. No one is hijacking busses. We have a few bank robberies, some gang violence, and a flourishing drug trade, but the last time I CHECKED, nobody is indiscriminately blowing # up. We have more to fear from our local governments than we do from some explosive devise. So, what were you saying....? I am fully aware of this. What I was pointing out is the encouragement of sheep to turn in their sheep friends. I find it insulting to the average intelligence. WTF didn't anyone read George Orwell? 1984 was alive and well during WWI and WWII. Posters extolling the virtues of saving, turning in or a least shunning those that wasted or cheated on rationing. Keeping ones eyes out for the dreaded 'huns' and remembering that your own neighbor could be a spy. Round up those folks of Japanese heritage.... Put 'em in a camp. reply to post by GrantedBail I'm saying that a number of years ago you had people flying aircraft into buildings, which is a kind of attack. Who's to say that the same people won't try different methods? (And this point doesn't actually depend on the identity of the people concerned) reply to post by GrantedBail As I remarked, it doesn't actually matter who they were. Whether it was Al Quaeda or the government, the point is valid either way. I remember journalists on this side of the Atlantic, long before 911, commenting that America was unconsciously laying itself wide open to terrorist attacks, because no precautions at all were being observed at the time. In addition: Don't be naive. They aren't asking you to call them if you suspect your government may be up to no-good. They want to know if your neighbor is too brown. Or if your acquaintance at the bridge club is speaking ill of the government. Maybe your doctor has suggested an alternative medicine. The man in line behind you at the supermarket mentions he is not going to file his taxes. Your uncle buys an extra gun and converts his 401K into gold.

36625	"Related features Ants seem common and ubiquitous, especially at summertime picnics. But the names and types of ants crawling around city parks and streets are largely unknown to researchers. The School of Ants project is recruiting ant-gathering citizen-scientists for help creating detailed lists and maps of ants living in urban areas, particularly around homes and schools. ""The diversity of ants, even around your home, is pretty high,"" said Andrea Lucky, project leader and ant specialist at North Carolina State University. ""They're fairly charismatic, compared with other insects , and we don't know that much about them."" The researchers behind School of Ants hope the project will help students appreciate wildlife in their own backyards, while amassing an enormous data set. ""As a scientist going out on expeditions, I can only collect so much,"" Lucky said. Entomologists estimate that 30,000 species of ants exist worldwide. However, only about 12,500 species have been named and described. Even in the US, researchers are discovering new species. Chances are good that some fortunate school kids will be credited with finding new ants, said Lucky. After signing up through the School of Ants website, participants receive a collecting kit in the mail. The kits come with collecting instructions and vials filled with Keebler Pecan Sandies: cookies that are an ideal ant bait, with an irresistible nutrient trifecta of fats, sugars and salts. After collecting, participants preserve the ants by keeping them overnight in the freezer. They then mail them to Lucky and her colleagues, who identify the ants and let senders know what they found. The project is also building interactive Google ant maps, allowing people to search for and learn about the ants in their area. Beyond simple documentation, the lists and maps will help agriculturalists, ecologists and climate scientists keep an eye on the movement of ant species and the changes in their diversity over time, Lucky said. ""If we can get good coverage, and lots of people and schoolkids collecting ants, we're going to have the best range maps of urban ant species that have ever existed,"" Lucky said. ""They just don't exist right now."" The project began in mid-July and was overwhelmed by the number of kit requests. After ramping up operations, the project will start accepting new kit requests on 1 September, in time for the start of the school year. "	News	Promotion

Fuel costs now factor into the decision to buy something or go somewhere. Choose wisely. I took that picture in March. I was stunned that gas prices were so high. When I filled up this weekend, the price was the same. And I was thrilled! We'd had it in the high $4 earlier in the Fall. $3.69 seems cheap. What a difference a few months can make to our perspective. Nowadays, when I hear about a good deal at a store or of something that's on my list to get, I think twice. Is it really worth the gas? In the last week I've changed my mind on an outing because it just wasn't worth the fuel cost. In fact, for the bulk of the year I've not gone anywhere unless I could lump several stops into one trip. We don't go anywhere without asking if there's some other stop we could make while we're out. If I had learned this habit years ago, I might have saved even more over the years. But, as they say, better late than never. So, that's how I saved money this week. I stayed home. Whatever thing there was to do, it just wasn't worth the investment of the gas. Today's Frugal Friday! Time to swap ideas and inspiration for saving money and getting good values.

Prior to joining DB2, Lenisha worked in query development for the IBM Content Management organization. Summary: New IBMr DB2r temporal data management technology enables companies to track and query historical, current, and future conditions in a straightforward and efficient manner. The result is a simpler way to implement auditing and compliance initiatives, to pinpoint and correct human errors, to ensure the integrity of data over time, and to assess changing business conditions. Instead of hard-coding greater awareness of time into database applications, triggers, and stored procedures, companies can use simple SQL statements to instruct DB2 10 to automatically manage multiple versions of their data, as well as track effective dates for changing business conditions. This article introduces you to the key concepts and capabilities of DB2 temporal data management support on z/OSr and Linuxr, UNIXr, and Windowsr. It explains when this technology can be useful and provides examples to help you understand how easy it can be to deploy it. If ""time is money,"" then DB2 temporal data management technology is designed to save you some of both. Built-in support for managing multiple versions of data and tracking effective business dates can save database administrators and application developers considerable time and effort. In prior releases, database professionals were forced to create triggers or complex application logic to manage time-dependent conditions. Now, DB2 minimizes or eliminates such efforts through the introduction of table design options, and query syntax and semantics, based on the ANSI/ISO SQL:2011 standard. An internal audit requires a financial institution to report on changes made to a client's records during the past five years. A pending lawsuit prompts a hospital to reassess its knowledge of a patient's medical condition just before a new treatment was ordered. A client challenges an insurance agency's resolution of a claim involving a car accident. The agency needs to determine the policy's terms in effect when the accident occurred. An online travel agency wants to detect inconsistencies in itineraries. For example, if someone books a hotel in Rome for eight days and reserves a car in New York for three of those days, the agency would like to flag the situation for review. A retailer needs to ensure that no more than one discount is offered for a given product during any period of time. A client inquiry reveals a data entry error involving the three-month introductory interest rate on a credit card. The bank needs to retroactively correct the error (and compute a new balance, if necessary). For each situation, time is critical. The new temporal data management support in DB2 helps companies implement time-aware applications and queries with minimal effort, as we'll discuss. However, before exploring the new capabilities, we will introduce some time-related concepts, including the differences between system time and business time. System time involves tracking when changes are made to the state of a table, such as when an insurance policy is modified or a loan is created. Business time involves tracking the effective dates of certain business conditions, such as the terms of an insurance policy or the interest rate of a loan. (Business time is sometimes referred to as valid time or application time. ) Indeed, some organizations need to track both types of temporal data in one table; such tables would be considered bitemporal . How do these concepts apply to the previous application scenarios? Scenarios 1 and 2 require knowledge of system time because understanding the historical state(s) of one or more tables is important. Scenarios 3-6 require knowledge of business time because understanding and managing the effective dates of various business conditions is important. Furthermore, scenario 6 may also require system time (i.e., it may require bitemporal support) if the bank wants to retroactively correct the data entry error and maintain a record of when the error was corrected. Time periods apply to business time and system time. As you might imagine, a period indicates the starting and ending points of a time interval. With DB2, administrators identify two columns in a table to indicate the start and end times of a period. Simple extensions to the syntax of the CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements accomplish this, enabling administrators to employ temporal data support for new or existing tables. DB2 uses an inclusive-exclusive approach for modeling time periods. Simply put, the period's start time is included in the period, but its end time is not. So, if the end time of an insurance policy was recorded as midnight on 31 Dec 2007, the policy would have been active until midnight, but not at midnight. IBM has worked with the ANSI and ISO SQL standard committees to incorporate these extensions into the latest SQL:2011 standard. IBM is the first database vendor to support temporal data management based on this new SQL standard. Other database vendors use proprietary syntax for temporal operations and for the definition of temporal tables. The built-in support in DB2 for managing temporal data reduces application logic and ensures consistent handling of time-related events across all applications that run against your database, including purchased applications. Through simple declarative SQL statements, administrators can instruct DB2 to automatically maintain a history of database changes or track effective business dates, eliminating the need for such logic to be hand-coded into triggers, stored procedures, or in-house applications. This, in turn, helps companies adhere more quickly to new compliance initiatives. Furthermore, a consistent approach to managing temporal data reduces query complexity and promotes enhanced analysis of time-dependent events. An IBM internal study compared implementing a subset of business time capabilities with built-in temporal data management support in DB2 vs. hand-coding equivalent logic in two homegrown implementations. One implementation used triggers and stored procedures, while the second used triggers and JavaT application logic. All tests were done with DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows. The cost savings provided by the DB2 built-in support were striking. The built-in support in DB2 reduced coding requirements by more than 90 percent over both homegrown implementations. Implementing just the core business time logic in SQL stored procedures or in Java technology required 16 times and 45 times as many lines of code, respectively, as the equivalent simple SQL statements that use the new DB2 temporal features (see Figure 1 ). Furthermore, it took less than an hour to develop and test these few DB2 SQL statements. By contrast, the homegrown approaches required four to five weeks to code and test, and both provided only a subset of the temporal data management support built into DB2. Indeed, the homegrown logic didn't address system time, bitemporal data, views, and many other DB2 features. Thus, providing truly equivalent temporal data support through a homegrown implementation would likely take months. This is much longer than it would take to simply write the appropriate DB2 SQL statements, which we'll discuss shortly. To help you understand the temporal data management support in DB2, we use a common application scenario and sample data. The scenario involves car insurance policies, which we've represented in a single table for simplicity. The table tracks a subset of typical information associated with such policies: a policy identifier (ID), vehicle identification number (VIN), estimated annual vehicle mileage, whether a rental car will be provided if the car needs repair as a result of a claim, and the coverage amount (including accidental property damage, medical expenses, etc). Table 1 illustrates the basic structure of the POLICY table without any temporal support. The support in DB2 for system time enables you to automatically track and manage multiple versions of your data. By defining a table with a system time period, you're instructing DB2 to automatically capture changes made to the state of your table and to save ""old"" rows in a history table -- a separate table with the same structure as your current table. Temporal queries referencing your current table will cause DB2 to transparently access this history table when needed, as you'll see shortly. This feature enables you to work with historical data easily, avoiding the need for complex WHERE clauses with various timestamp and join conditions. Create the base table for current data -- Include three TIMESTAMP(12) columns, two for the start/end points of the system time and one for the transaction start time. (DB2 uses the transaction start time column to track when the transaction first executed a statement that changes the table's data.) You can define all three TIMESTAMP columns as GENERATED ALWAYS so DB2 will automatically generate these values on INSERT , UPDATE , and DELETE . This relieves you of specifying values for these columns when writing to the database and ensures that the timestamps are accurate. Optionally, you may define these columns as IMPLICITLY HIDDEN so they won't show up in SELECT * statements. Create the history table -- Define the structure of this table to be identical to the table containing the current data. You can achieve this easily by using a CREATE TABLE . . . LIKE statement. Alter the current table to enable versioning and identify the history table Let's step through an example to see how easy it is to instruct DB2 to automatically maintain multiple versions of your data using system time. Step 1: Create a table with a SYSTEM_TIME period -- (Our definition specifies that the TRANS_START column will be hidden.) You can also use the ALTER TABLE statement to modify existing tables to track system time. To do so, you would need to add appropriate TIMESTAMP(12) columns and define the PERIOD SYSTEM_TIME . DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows supports automatic schema evolution across a user table and the associated history table. For example, if you add a column to the POLICY table, DB2 will also add the same column to the POLICY_HISTORY table. Inserting data into a table with system time isn't any different from inserting data into an ordinary table. For example, imagine that on 15 Nov 2010 you needed to enter two new car insurance policy records into your POLICY table. The following statements accomplish this: When inserting each row into the current table, DB2 generates appropriate TIMESTAMP(12) values for system time columns and transaction start time. Note that none of these were referenced in the INSERT statements; DB2 automatically records the necessary information. Table 4 and Table 5 depict the contents of the POLICY and POLICY_HISTORY tables as a result of this query. (To make our example easier to follow, Table 4 and Table 5 show only the date portion of the TIMESTAMP(12) columns. Dates appear in YYYY-MM-DD format. Since the column containing the transaction's start time was defined as hidden, we've omitted it from Table 4 and Table 5 as well.) The SYS_START values in the POLICY table reflect when the rows were inserted (on 15 Nov 2010 in our example). The SYSTEM_END values are set to 30 Dec 9999 to indicate that these rows have not expired (i.e., the rows contain current data). When you update current data, DB2 automatically maintains an old version of the data in the appropriate history table. This happens transparently without any programming or user effort. Imagine that the following statement is executed on 31 Jan 2011 to change the coverage amount for Policy 1111 to 750000: Let's explore how DB2 processes this statement. As shown in Table 6 and Table 7 , DB2 updates the value of the row in the current table. In addition, it moves a copy of the old row to the history table. For both tables, DB2 correctly records the system time start and end values for these rows. In particular, DB2 sets the SYS_END column value for this row in the history table to the time of the transaction that issued the UPDATE statement. All this occurs automatically and transparently to the user. (Although not shown in Table 6 and Table 7, DB2 also records the transaction start time in both tables.) In effect, the processing by DB2 of this UPDATE statement records that Policy 1111 had a coverage amount of 500000 set from 15 Nov 2010 to 31 Jan 2011; thereafter, the coverage amount was set to 750000. As you might expect, any subsequent updates to policies are handled in a similar manner. For example, assume that Policy 1111 is updated on 31 Jan 2012 to change several details of the insurance policy, such as the annual mileage estimate, rental car coverage, and overall coverage amount. Here is the corresponding UPDATE statement: When you delete current data, DB2 automatically removes the data from the current table and maintains an old version of the data in the appropriate history table. DB2 sets the end time of the (deleted) data in the history table to the transaction start time of the DELETE statement. This happens transparently without any programming or user effort. As you'll see shortly, users can access this deleted data (i.e., old data versions) through queries that contain an appropriate time period specification. Imagine that the row for Policy 1414 is deleted on 31 March 2012 with the following statement: DELETE FROM policy WHERE id = 1414; As shown in Table 10 and Table 11 , DB2 removes the row from the current table and records the old version in the history table, setting the SYS_END column value for that row to the date of its deletion (31 March 2012). Querying a table with system time is simple. The syntax and semantics of basic SELECT statements remain unchanged. In particular, SELECT statements without any period specifications apply to data in the current table, as you might expect. Thus, existing applications, stored procedures, and database reports won't be affected by adding system time support to existing tables. Instead, you'll simply be able to include three new period specifications in your SELECT statements to transparently access historical data (or a combination of current and historical data). Let's explore a few examples so you can see how easy it is to write temporal queries involving system time. We'll start with the most basic scenario: a situation where you need to access only the most current information. Imagine that your current and history tables contain the car insurance policy data shown in Table 10 and Table 11 . Consider the following query: SELECT coverage_amt FROM policy WHERE id = 1111; As you might expect, DB2 returns one row with a coverage amount of 250000. (This is amount stored in the row that contains current information about Policy 1111.) What happens if you want to work with older versions of data? You simply include one of three supported period specifications in the FROM clause of your query: FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF ... enables you to query data as of a certain point in time. FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM ... TO ... enables you to query data from a certain time to a certain time. DB2 uses an inclusive-exclusive approach for this period specification. In other words, the specified start time is included in the period, but the specified end time is not. FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN ... AND ... enables you to query data between a range of start/end times. DB2 uses an inclusive-inclusive approach for this period specification. In other words, the specified start and end times are included in the period. Let's step through an example. To obtain information about the coverage amount recorded in the database for Policy 1111 for 1 Dec 2010, you could write the following query: To resolve this query, DB2 transparently accesses data in the history table to retrieve the correct information (to return a value of 500000 for this query). Note that you didn't need to reference the history table in your query. The FOR SYSTEM_TIME period specification causes DB2 to automatically access the history table as appropriate. Let's consider another example. To determine the total number of policy records for vehicle A1111 since 30 Nov 2011, you could write the following query: Given our sample data, this query returns the value of 2. As shown in Table 10 and Table 11 , one row in the current table and one row in the history table (the second row) meet the query's criteria. Note that this query references only the current table in the FROM clause, but DB2 automatically accesses the history table due to the system time period specification. As mentioned, business time involves tracking when certain business conditions are, were, or will be valid. For example, a given product might have been priced at $45 during one month and $50 another month. Or a credit card may have an interest rate of 16 percent one year and 18 percent the next year. Business time is useful in such situations because it enables applications to track and manage effective dates easily. Like system time, business time requires the use of a time period (the start and end points of the business condition). However, unlike system time, there is no separate history table. Past, present, and future effective dates and their associated business data are all maintained in a single table. In addition, users supply the start/end values for their business time period columns when they write data to the database. Finally, there is no need for a transaction start time column. Let's explore how to use this new DB2 technology in our sample application scenario. Creating a table with business time merely involves including appropriate columns for the start/end points of the time period and a PERIOD BUSINESS_TIME clause. The business time start/end columns can be date or timestamp data types. Here's a simple example that creates a table for car insurance policies, including their effective business dates. In this example, the BUS_START and BUS_END columns are defined as DATE data types. The PERIOD BUSINESS_TIME clause instructs DB2 to use these columns to track the start and end points of business time values for each row. To ensure temporal data integrity, DB2 automatically generates an implicit constraint to enforce that BUS_START values are less than BUS_END values. The primary key constraint in this CREATE TABLE statement uses the optional keywords BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS . This instructs DB2 to ensure that primary key values are unique for any point in business time. In terms of our insurance policy example, BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS means that there cannot be two versions or states of the same policy that are valid at the same time. You can also use the ALTER TABLE statement to modify existing tables to track business time. To do so, you would need to add appropriate DATE or TIMESTAMP columns and define the PERIOD BUSINESS_TIME . Inserting a row into a table with business time is straightforward: You simply need to supply appropriate values for all NOT NULL columns, including the columns representing business time start and end values. For example, to insert a few rows into our sample POLICY table with business time, we could issue these statements: It may help to summarize the contents of this table in business terms. The data shows that Policy 1111 had a coverage amount of 500000 in effect from 1 Jan 2010 to 1 Jan 2011. From 1 Jan 2011 onward, a coverage amount of 750000 is in effect. Similarly, the table shows that from 1 May 2008 to 1 Mar 2010, Policy 1414 had coverage of 750000 for a specific vehicle with an estimated annual mileage of 14000. Effective 1 Mar 2010 to 1 Jan 2011, the coverage for this policy changed to 600000, and the insured vehicle was expected to be driven 12000 miles annually. Let's consider the effect of the temporal uniqueness constraint defined on this table (with the BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS clause). Imagine that we issued the following INSERT statement: DB2 would reject this statement and issue an error message because the statement attempts to add a row for Policy 1111 during the same time that one or more other rows are considered valid for this policy. This would violate the temporal uniqueness constraint. If we intended to adjust the coverage of Policy 1111 from 1 Jun 2010 to 1 Sep 2011, we would accomplish this with an appropriate UPDATE statement. You can still write traditional UPDATE statements for tables with business time periods. In addition, you can also use the new FOR PORTION OF BUSINESS_TIME clause to restrict the update to a specific business time period. If your update impacts data in a row that isn't fully contained within the time period specified, DB2 will update the row range specified by the period clause and insert additional rows to record the old values for the period not included in the update operation. Let's review an example to see how this works. Imagine that you want to update information for Policy 1111 for a portion of time from 1 Jun 2010 to 1 Sep 2011 -- specifically, you want to alter the coverage amount for that period of time. Here's how you could write the UPDATE statement: Note that the temporal restriction in the query ( FOR PORTION OF BUSINESS_TIME FROM . . . TO . . . ) appears after the table name, not as part of the WHERE clause. As shown in Figure 2 , there were originally two rows for Policy 1111. Both are affected by our UPDATE statement because the portion of business time being updated overlaps partially with the business period of each row. This overlap is illustrated in the upper part of Figure 2. When DB2 applies the update, each of the two original rows is split into two rows, as illustrated in the lower part of Figure 2. DB2 adjusts the effective dates of the rows automatically. Table 13 shows the resulting state of the POLICY table. The first row from Table 12 gets split into two new rows, shown in Table 13 . The second row from Table 12 also gets split into two new rows, shown in Table 13 . To delete data from a table with business time periods, you can restrict the delete operation to a specific range of time by specifying the FOR PORTION OF BUSINESS_TIME clause. If a row to be deleted has data that isn't fully contained within the specified time range, DB2 will ensure that the appropriate information from the row is preserved. Let's look at an example to clarify this. Imagine that a client wants to suspend his car insurance policy from 1 Jun 2010 to 1 Jan 2011. Assuming the client is referring to Policy 1414, the following DELETE statement will accomplish this: Querying a table with business time is simple. Three optional clauses enable you to specify temporal queries so you can assess past, current, and future business conditions. Of course, you can still write basic SELECT statements (i.e., non-temporal queries) against a table with a business time period, and DB2 processing of such queries will remain unchanged. We'll explore a few examples so you can see how easy it is to write temporal queries involving business time. But first, we'll start with the most basic scenario: a situation where you don't need to consider any temporal conditions. Imagine that your POLICY table contains the information shown in Table 15 . (This is the same data shown in Table 12 , immediately after we created the POLICY table and inserted four rows.) To determine the total number of insurance records you have for Policy 1111, you could write the following query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM policy WHERE id = 1111; Since this query contains no temporal predicates, DB2 returns a value of 2. What if you want to consider various temporal conditions for these insurance policies? You simply include one of three supported period specifications in your query's FROM clause, right after the table name: FOR BUSINESS_TIME AS OF ... FOR BUSINESS_TIME FROM ... TO ... FOR BUSINESS_TIME BETWEEN ... AND ... Let's step through an example. To obtain information about the coverage in effect for Policy 1111 on 1 Dec 2010, you could write the following query: Temporal queries against tables with business time are internally rewritten to a query with appropriate WHERE clause predicates on the appropriate date or timestamp columns defined for the start and end points of business time. As you've learned, DB2 support for system and business time is straightforward. But the DB2 temporal data management capabilities don't end there. We mentioned that DB2 enables you to maintain system and business time in bitemporal tables. Furthermore, DB2 on Linux, UNIX, and Windows supports temporal views and a register setting that allows your database to function much like a time machine. While it's beyond the scope of this article to provide a full discussion of these and other advanced temporal topics, we'll describe each briefly. Bitemporal tables allow you to manage data with system time and business time simultaneously, combining the benefits of both. For example, you may decide to use business time to manage your application's logical notion of time, such as the validity periods of insurance policies, and also use system time to track the history and timestamps of changes that transactions make to these policies. Administrators can easily create or alter a table to include both system and business time. For example, the following CREATE TABLE statement defines a bitemporal table with a BUSINESS_TIME period on the BUS_START and BUS_END columns, as well as a SYSTEM_TIME period on the SYS_START and SYS_END columns. After creating this bitemporal table, you need to create a compatible history table and enable versioning. Then you can insert, update, delete, and query rows in this table using the syntax described earlier for system time and business time. We'll review a short example here. Imagine that you have a bitemporal POLICY table and associated history table as shown in Table 17 and Table 18 . (The TRANS_START column is omitted for simplicity.) Table 19 and Table 20 illustrates the contents of the POLICY and POLICY_HISTORY tables after these operations. (For simplicity, only the date portions of the timestamps for SYS_START and SYS_END are shown.) DB2 will return the results shown in Table 22 . The customer service representative can explain when changes occurred to the policy, as well as when these changes were in effect (or set to take effect). DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows allows you to use two types of views with temporal tables. Such views provide flexibility for application design and allow you to expose data for different points or periods in time to different users. First, you can define views on a temporal table where the view definition contains a FOR SYSTEM_TIME or FOR BUSINESS_TIME clause to restrict the view to a certain point or period in time. Then you can perform regular SQL queries against these views. A query against these views can't contain a FOR SYSTEM_TIME or FOR BUSINESS_TIME clause because the time constraint in the query might conflict with the time constraint in the view or lead to ambiguity. Second, you can define views on a temporal table without a FOR SYSTEM_TIME or FOR BUSINESS_TIME constraint in the view definition. Such views expose data for all points in time and can be accessed with queries that include a FOR SYSTEM_TIME or FOR BUSINESS_TIME clause. Such a clause is then automatically applied to every table in the view definition that contains a SYSTEM_TIME or BUSINESS_TIME period, respectively. In summary, DB2 offers you considerable flexibility when working with views and temporal data. You can use temporal constraints in a view definition or in queries against views over temporal tables. New register settings enable you to run existing applications against data from a certain point in time without changing the application itself. For example, imagine that you have an existing application that contains many SQL queries or a set of reporting queries you need to run from time to time. With the new temporal features in DB2, you may want to run those against a past point in system time, or against a past or future point in business time. However, enhancing all existing SQL statements with a FOR SYSTEM_TIME or FOR BUSINESS_TIME clause can be labor-intensive. Similarly, creating views for all affected temporal tables can also be tedious. Therefore, DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows provides special registers to set a database session to a specific point in time. For example, you could use the following SET commands to set the session's system time to 10 a.m. 1 Jan 2008: SET CURRENT TEMPORAL SYSTEM_TIME = '2008-01-01 10:00:00'; Subsequently, any queries against system period temporal tables (or bitemporal tables) performed in the same session will see data as of 10 a.m. 1 Jan 2008. That is, all queries in the session are internally rewritten to use the clause FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2008-01-01 10:00:00' that you saw earlier. DB2 performs this rewrite automatically for you; you don't need to change your application and SQL statements in any way. Similarly, you could set the following special register to look at the data from one month ago: SET CURRENT TEMPORAL SYSTEM_TIME = current timestamp -- 1 MONTH; When the CURRENT TEMPORAL SYSTEM_TIME special register is set to a value other than NULL, any DML operations (insert, update, delete, merge) against system period temporal tables are not meaningful and are disallowed. For business time, you can set the CURRENT TEMPORAL BUSINESS_TIME special register to apply queries, updates, deletes, etc. to past or future points in business time. For example, consider the following register setting: SET CURRENT TEMPORAL BUSINESS_TIME = '2012-06-01'; It means that queries and DML statements against tables with business time (or bitemporal tables) are rewritten to use the clause FOR BUSINESS_TIME AS OF '2012-06-01' . Again, DB2 performs this rewrite automatically for you. Similar to the usage guideline for views, you must avoid applying two time constraints at the same time. That is, you either set a system time (business time) special register or you use system time (business time) constraints your SQL statements, but not both at the same time. The time machine can accept only one destination at a time (no pun intended). The temporal support in DB2 was designed to allow easy migration of existing database tables to the new temporal capabilities. There are two common scenarios to consider: If you have existing tables without timestamp columns and you want to turn these into temporal tables with system time or business time periods, you can use ALTER TABLE statements to add the required timestamp columns and period definition to the table. For a system period temporal table, you would then also create a history table like your original table and use another ALTER TABLE statement to enable versioning. The second scenario involves migrating tables that already have timestamp columns. For example, you might already be using triggers to set timestamp columns and populate a history table. In that case, you can reuse the existing timestamp columns and history table. You simply perform ALTER TABLE statements to declare that the existing timestamp columns are now interpreted as a SYSTEM_TIME period. You can then drop your triggers and issue another ALTER TABLE statement to enable versioning between your base table and history table. Similar migration options exist for business time as well. The new DB2 temporal data support provides simple yet sophisticated capabilities for managing multiple versions of your data and tracking effective business dates. Based on the temporal features in the SQL:2011 standard, DB2 enables database professionals to work with temporal data in an efficient manner, saving considerable time and effort when compared with hard-coding temporal logic into triggers, stored procedures, or homegrown applications.

47908	MATCH REPORT EVERTON U21'S 0 READING U21'S 0 Everton faced Reading today at Goodison Park at the U21 level with a welcoming back to the fold for Darron Gibson who has been absent since his injury at West Brom 11 weeks ago. Everton huffed and puffed putting Reading under a lot of pressure but the stubborn visitors defence held out as Everton needed the victory to make the cut for the next stage of this development league with fixtures running out. 5 players in today's starting line up were ion the bench for the seniors yesterday at the Madejski stadium. The opening quarter of an hour offered very little for either side but Junior went close with a shot narrowly over the frame of the goal with a rasping shot. Vellios was next to go close as his shot was only inches wide of Henly's post with game remaining goal less. Junior having a busy afternoon went close again for the home side as Vellios played him through but Henly was quick off the mark to pounce on the ball. Henley repeated his heroics with a good reflex save to deny Junior from a blues corner moments later. Jordan Obita with 6 England U19 caps to his name threaded a ball inside to Aaron Tshibola but the 17 year old forced Mateusz Tadul into a save. Just before the break Everton conjured up some nice football with Conor Grant about to get on the receiving end of Kennedy's ball but a Reading defender blocked it out. Tyias Browning sped down the flank and won a corner which came to nothing as the second half got underway. Dominic Samuel who signed a professional contract with the Roylas 12 months ago after his impressive goal scoring for the U18's netting 13 in 14 games caused a little bit of danger with two attempts. The first one going over the bar then a block from Distin denying the youngster. Hallam Hope replaced Gibson on 63 minutes with the Irishman glad to get some match practice under his belt then 2 minutes later Vellios produces a shot which Henly did well to save. Alan Stubbs threw on 2 more subs hoping that would change the game but the teams took a share of the points at the final whistle. 	Forum	News

36981	"Bettman said that if their isn't a new bargaining agreement with the NHLPA by September 15th then their will indeed be an NHL lockout. How would you guys feel if their was indeed a lockout? Where would all of the NHL players play if their was one and how long would it take to get a new agreement done if it doesn't happen by Set. 15th? I personally think it would be upsetting if this where to happen again, this summer has been pretty boring so far and having this boring feeling throughout the rest of this year up to summer 2013 would be depressing. Discuss. But yes, I think there will be a lockout, but not the full season. I think it'll be a shortened season. Something like a 50-60 game season. As a side note, the Heat would have Sven, Brodie, and Bouma in addition to existing guys like Reinhart, Ferland, Lamb, Horak, Howse, Nemisz, Byron, Street and Kolanos. Also, if it's going to be a shortened season, Cervenka could even join the Heat for a couple of months. I fully expect him to go back to Russia if there's a season-long lockout though. The one thing I dont understand is, if the NHL goes to another lock out doesnt this demonstrate Bettman and the NHLPAs incompetence? A second lock out after just 7 years seems like the head honchos are not doing their jobs. Why do they wait only 60ish days to begin negotiations, especially when they know how hard headed the NHL and Bettman and the GMs are. How many times can the same mistakes be made till its time for a new NHL commissioner? Last lockout, i was still single and my lifestyle wasn't overly affected. However, now older/wiser, weaker liver, and most importantly, married, means my hockey addiction can't be avoided, so i'm certain i will feel the ill effects much more that being said, shame on everyone involved. I'd love to be able to boycott this, and hope that they can't hammer out a deal for another full year or so and they all suffer a year+ loss of income and be forced to really make the necessary sacrifices, but i'm weak. I know i will do my best to get my love of the NFL back such that i can do my part in at least putting my money to a less bush league league for few years.

If there is a lockout, your wife will make you make up for all those nights you watched the games as opposed to spend ""quality time"" with her, what ever the heck that is. Lots of extra chores, more alone time with her which sucks becuase you will have to listen to her talk about her friends and family which you dont care about let alone care to talk about. My suggestion to you is pick up a hobby to occupy you monday to saturday and watch football every sunday. I tried the whole baseball and mma thing, didnt work and I just felt cheapened afterwards. I can see there being a lockout for maybe a few weeks. 2 months at most. I'd be shocked if there wasn't a deal in place by the end of October. The players know the owners will sit out for a year. There's no point in going through the whole song and dance again. Maybe we'll miss some pre-season, but once actual game cheques start disappearing and given what happened 8 years ago, the players will concede to almost everything, and the NHL will throw them a consolation prize. Bettman and Fehr don't hate each other the way Goodenow and Bettman did. We'll be fine.

That being said, the wife's pretty cool in that she's down to watch the game.. I'm just more annoyed than anything else. I was so sure that the at least one of the NBA/NFL were going to get locked out last season, those greedy, self-centered group of players/owners got their ___ together, yet here we are, the NHL back to the lock out within 7 years. It's laughable. like i said, shame on everyone involved. If they do strike, i hope they can't cut a deal for 2-3 years and suffer the loss of income and NHL experience for that period of time.

36634	"(Warning : distressing scenes) video showing a senseless attack on a kangaroo has been used by prosecutors to argue for a tougher sentence for those responsible. This video has been edited, however viewer discretion strongly advised The limp baby roo is then picked up by the tail and thrown several metres before it slams into a tree trunk. Throughout the film the three men can be heard laughing before saying they planned to drop the dead kangaroo in the middle of a street. The joey had been caught by a dog and put into the boot of a car that the Saunders brothers were travelling in. It was later taken to Lions Park in Seymour where it was brutally killed. Zachary Hunter Appearance of three men in Seymour Magistrates Court accused of torturing and killing a young kangaroo. Zachary Hunter. Picture: Stuart Walmsley Source: Herald Sun Zachary Hunter, 23, pleaded guilty over his role in the incident that led to the joey's death in October last year. Picture: Stuart Walmsley Source: Herald Sun Brett Saunders played no role in the actual attack on the animal other than to catch the joey. The incident sparked widespread outrage with some animal rights' activists calling for the men to be jailed. The footage was shown by Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions John Champion, SC, who has launched a County Court appeal against the non-conviction sentences of the men. The landmark appeal is believed to be the first of its kind where the victim of crime is wildlife. Baby kangaroo attack A still image from the sickening footage of a savage attack on a defenceless baby kangaroo. Brothers Brett and Scott Saunders and friend Zachary Hunt were fined and placed on good behaviour bonds over the attack in Seymour. Source: Supplied SHOCKING: One witness recalled the kangaroo looked like it ""had been so traumatised it just stood there in terror"". Picture: SUPPLIED It comes as wildlife experts say there has been a worrying spike in wildlife assaults across Victoria over the past year. Lawyers for the men this week said they had suffered harrassment and received death threats since the incident was made public. But DPP John Champion, SC, argued the men's sentences were ""manifestly inadequate"" and said tougher punishment was in the public interest. Australian Society for Kangaroos spokeswoman Fiona Corke said she hoped the appeal would deter future perpetrators of animal cruelty crimes. "	News	News
11557	Re: Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? A couple of small things to note. The last post was written over a year ago...I doubt who ever wrote it is still monitoring this post. if you do follow the last posters advice then you will fuirst have needed to lodge a formal complaint with your provider, this can often be done by phone but always best to to write the complaint so that you have a record of it. it can take up to 8 weeks for them to resolve the complaint or give you a Final Response but it is only after this has been received that you can then approach the Ombudsman, if you try to involve him before this time they will only place an official standard complaint for you and you are back to square 1 (and day 1) of the complaints process and may have to wait another 8 weeks for the providers reply. As the last postersuggested too, you may find some help on the weblinks. Re: Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? I had the same problem with three. They ran tests and told me the reception on my area is fine but my calls kept dropping! They blamed my iphone even though I took it to apple store and had it checked, updated software etc. tried a Orange simcard in the same phone and reception was amazing! In the end I called up the ombudsman for mobile phones. They advised me to write a letter! I can send you a template if you like but if you call the Ombudsman, they can advise you further! Well story cut short, I wrote them a letter stating sales of good act and Supply of Goods and Services Act, and under those act's i got the contract cancelled! I was only into 6 months of it out of 24 months. They cancelled the contract and refunded me outstanding amount. You'll find some help here:http://whatconsumer.co.uk/know-your\\... and http://www.ombudsman-services.org/commun\\... Re: Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? The reason I chose O2 was because it had the best coverage according to their website. None of them said there would be a 'good' signal but their website said reasonable signal and showed 2/3 bars. I've spoken to a few people and have a few possible aerials I could try if I can't get anywhere in cancelling the contract. If the signal had suddenly gone downhill they would have allowed me out but because it was always the case they won't budge it seems. I haven't had a really hard try yet though so I don't think I've done all I can yet. Re: Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? I agree with maxstream - if the coverage map says its good and it isn't then you may have a case but it will depend on the small print in your contract. There are some rural areas where no mobile coverage is good - I can get an orange signal in about a third of my house (vodaphone and O2 are even worse) and getting 3G is about as likely as winning the lottery - its one of the joys of living in the countryside (along with slow broadband and paying through the nose for heating oil !). The best way to try out the recption is to get a free sim from each provider and put 5 or 10 PAYG on it and then see what reception you get before tying yourself into a contract. Once you know which one works (if any) then go for that one. Simple solution to not having a phone upstairs is to get a landline extension put in (or do it yourself) - not very expensive and then you'd have a definite phone that you could rely on. Re: Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? My view is that you can only justify ending the contract if the coverage maps say reception is good when it isn't and if, when notified, they don't put things right. Yes, there are boosters and aerials. The little strips that cost a few pence and are a few inches long are, I believe, useless but there are aerials that look like aerials for 10 - 30 which could help. Is it possible to get out of a contract with o2 due to no signal if you are outside the 28 days? I moved into a new house in October and due to lack of signal (its quite a rural area) I shopped around and using network coverage checkers decided o2 was the best option. I ordered a new phone/contract online and it arrived 1st December. Immediately it was obvious that the signal wasn't any better than T-mobile had been however because we knew the area was bad I wasn't sure what to do so I kept hold of it and thought I'd just have to get on with it. I've sinced decided I'm ridiculous for thinking I could have 2 years with a phone I cannot make/receive a call from my house and contacted them today. (yes I know outside my return period, I'm stupid!) They did a couple of test calls to my handset (after asking me to remove voicemail) to verify that I was not able to receive calls however then came back to me and said they could not log it as it had been like that when i took the contract and was not a new issue. So why test my line? Again, I know I should have contacted them sooner however I feel its unreasonable that they expect me to pay 30 a month for 2 years with no service. They advised I switch my phone settings from 3g to analogue but didn't know how I did that and were going to call me back. I'm still waiting several hours later and they are now closed. A few points, I'm aware I'm outside their return policy period. When I called they said the coverage data on the internet (which is how i decided who to go with) hadn't been updated since 2009. Surely that is extra ground for them to allow me to return it regardless of timescales? I also searched on Ofcom and there are only 2 local masts both of which belong to Orange. As far as I can find through research online they offer no kind of booster for signal like some of the other networks? Has anybody got any advice on how I can either get out of my contract or even reduce my monthly rental if they won't do that or boost my signal so I can actually use the free texts/minutes I'm paying for? I have a toddler and it makes me nervous that I have no phone upstairs. If somebody broke in during the night etc I wouldn't be able to call anybody or get help.

22436	Michael Langan talks to photographer Lee Baxter. It's a candid insight of an artist at work, and he learns that a good photograph takes far more than simply an eye for a good-looking man... ........................................\\... The Manchester-based photographer Lee Baxter has developed a style of image-making that is distinctive and appealing. He combines an interest in architecture with an eye for a good-looking man to create photographs that are thoughtful, intimate, and subtly sexy. The treatment of his subjects -- whether buildings, the sky, urban landscapes or people -- always conveys a sense of character, and while they are very real they are never mundane. I met up with him to talk about his work. When did you start taking photographs? I've been working with a camera since about 1998. I'd been doing computer-based graphics up until that point, quite commercial stuff, and spent my twenties going out clubbing before finally deciding I wanted to do a degree. I asked myself, what is it that I really like? Photography was the thing. Whose work inspires you? Who do you admire? One of the first photographers I had a thing for was Joel Peter Witkin. A friend gave me a book of his work many years ago and I was transfixed by every page. He uses cadavers and dead bodies to create beautifully crafted images and that, along with his very dark themes, really struck a chord with me. I also love the sexy, quirky quality of the work of Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin. I don't try to reproduce what these photographers are doing but I just really like looking at them and they give me energy. The painter Francis Bacon has also been a great influence on me -- I adore the visceral quality of his work. Where do you find the guys you photograph? Most of the recent ones have been friends, and Facebook is a good source. Some good-looking men are often quite shy and I have to convince them that they're going to look good in the photos and I'm not going to make them look pornographic. That's quite interesting, that engagement with somebody. I try to keep the shoot very conversational, as if I'm not really taking photographs. I usually try to do the shoots quite quickly, even though I've thought a lot about what I'm going to do beforehand. If it's not working I just try something else, to make the process as organic as possible. The longer you take the more fake people's smiles can become, though these days you can show people how it's looking during the shoot and if they like the images they'll relax more. And you don't manipulate or alter your images? No, I use Photoshop as sparingly as possible and just try to capture what is there. I also crop within the frame as I take a shot, staying true to the image at its origin. Obviously, I'm trying to find something that is interesting to look at but I really want to let images speak for themselves. I like to work with natural light and also keep a natural feel to the imagery, using flash very sparingly. Some people make their photos look very unrealistic -- David LaChapelle does this brilliantly -- but that's not really where I see myself, though I do love that kind of work. You've taken a lot of pictures of David Hoyle  -- have you known him a long time? Yes, going back to when I was seventeen. We just get on really well and we trust each other. He allows me to photograph in his dressing room, so nowhere's out of bounds. Because he's a performer he knows how the camera works so it can be quite easy for me to capture something amazing. One of the characteristics of your work is the way that you place people in the frame. You're not frightened of having a lot of space around a subject or putting them in interesting spaces. In terms of composition I think that comes from my graphics background. I try to think about what lines up really nicely. I've always really loved Mark Farrow's work with The Pet Shop Boys and I love the idea of the tiny image with lots of white space around it. It's not so fashionable any more but if you use it well it still works. I like the idea of a lot of texture in the background. Is there a link between your work and your sexuality? It's more common these days to see men presented as things to look at but did you have to work through that at all? It's never really been an issue to be honest. At the same time I do want to capture the fact that these guys have a personality. Obviously, some of them are more decorative than others and I don't have a problem with that, but I don't want them just to be lumps of meat to look at. Trying to connect through their eyes, or through a little gesture, can be enough to make the pictures more intimate. I've already created some kind of trust with these guys so the last thing I want to do is present a set of images that totally objectifies them and turns them into something else. You also take a lot of pictures of architecture. Where does your interest in cityscapes come from? When I first started photography I was more comfortable taking pictures of buildings than people, so it's just carried on from there. Having said that, I don't want to focus on just obvious, famous buildings. Is it possible to describe what Manchester, as a city, brings to your work? Without wanting to be clich, there's a gritty realism to Manchester, it being an industrial town. I try to find areas where there's a sense of beauty that maybe not everyone sees. It's got a really good arts community as well. It's quite small, but everyone helps each other out. You've taken some images of the sky in Ancoats that are really striking. I used to work in an office there and some of the skies were immense. That area is really being developed at the moment but there's still a touch of Lowry in that industrial landscape. There was a really stormy sky that day. By including some of the buildings I wanted to keep an essence of the city in there as well. And you have an exhibition coming up in Manchester this autumn? Yeah, it's called Splendid and is going to be about structure -- of men and of buildings, the two things integrated. There'll be lots of images of Manchester, some of Berlin and maybe a few of London. What direction is your work going in? I want to challenge myself and maybe do more images where I've created a set or something staged, with more people involved. I'd love to do something with dancers, maybe something outside, with a real sense of movement. I'd like to work with people who are very aware of their bodies. How do you feel about what's happening to photography as an art form, with the influence of new technologies and equipment? There are still people who never use digital and keep it quite analogue, but I like the instant results that digital gives you. If I'm out on a shoot I know exactly what I'm going to get at that moment in time. I see people Photoshopping beautiful images to death and with Instagram you can add a filter to a photo of a bowl of fruit or a coffee cup and it looks nostalgic, but it's still just a coffee cup. I like Instagram but it's not something I'd use in my work -- I feel like it's cheating. But who knows, in a few years I might do something that is completely about the unreality of an image, but I would want to make it look as if that was definitely what I was doing. ........................................\\...

28408	How To Do Updos For Curly Hair How To Do Updos For Curly Hair 5 1 user ratings Enlarge A hairstylist demonstrates a stylish up do for curly hair that anyone can do by themselves even when in a rush. It's a hairstyle that's perfect for day and night. If you've got naturally curly hair, I'm going to show you how to do an up do that takes seconds. It's so easy, it's great for work or going out, just a really cool up do for curly hair. So, we're going to start with using an elastic, and you can get them anywhere actually, even supermarkets sell these now. It's just a really large hair band, basically, and we're just going to pop it over the top of the head. So, when you're doing this at home yourself, just keep it firm with one hand and tuck the hair with the other hand. It's quite a soft look so it doesn't matter if it's too messy, and this bit of volume is perfect as well. So, we're going to take the curls and just bend them over and tuck them in the elastic there and let the loose curls just kind of hang over, and then do the same all the way around. When you get to the front, just decide whether you want pieces down or if want quite a bit more of a vintage look and pull the hair back, or if your hair's very curly, you might want to just tuck it all in and keep it out of your way. It doesn't matter if you can see the band either, it looks quite cool. And again, you're just pulling the hair back and tucking it into the elastic at the sides. If your hair is very curly or a bit shorter, you could actually get away with just leaving that out and sitting naturally. But her hair's just a little bit too long to do that. So, you can leave it like that, plain if it's just a day look, or if you want to kind of finish it up a little bit for an evening or for a wedding or something, you can pop a little bit of sparkle in the side. It would also look great with something a little bit more like this, which is also really on trend for this year. And that's it, a great up do for curly hair, good for day looks or work or if you're just in a rush. . 	Instruction	Instruction

The ""item in question"" that Adam's father's letter leads him to acquire from a safe deposit box in Switzerland is a precious Russian Orthodox icon made long ago for the Russian czars which by misadventure came into the possession of Hermann Göring sometime in the 1930s. Göring wanted Scott's father (one of his jailers at Nuremberg ) to have it in token of his kind treatment and because Göring realized Scott's father would be unfairly blamed for his pre- execution suicide . But the icon contains something that even Göring did not dream of: the only official Russian copy of a secret codicil to the Alaska Purchase treaty by which the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. "" Seward's Folly "" turns out to have not been a true purchase at all, but a 99-year lease akin to the British hold on Hong Kong , with a right of return to Russia (now the part of the Soviet Union ) if they can only retrieve their copy before the lease deadline, only days away.

17651	"Riverina Lions to roar in the face of adversity MORE than 50,000 kilometres of travel and ten years of hard work could reap the ultimate reward on Sunday when Riverina Lions strive to capture its maiden premiership by beating Eastlake in the ACT Women's AFL grand final at Manuka Oval. As the build-up to the big game continues, Riverina Lions skipper, and club founder, Julie McLean, revealed the exact amount of work and scheduling it has taken for the club to compete in the Canberra-based competition. The plan to form a women's Australian football team in the region was hatched in 2002 when Leanne Hodge contacted McLean with the idea to be a sister club with Wagga Tigers when it was playing in AFL Canberra. A true football lover, McLean was thrilled with the concept, and after months of planning, Riverina Lions was formed and commenced competing in Canberra in the 2003 season. Riverina Lions have gathered momentum each season and the team has played off in two grand finals, in 2005 and 2011, when it lost, ironically, to Eastlake, on both occasions. The tyranny of distance -- Riverina Lions have to travel to Canberra to play every second week of the competition -- and player numbers have been struggles at times during the 10-year journey but McLean said the club was in great shape for the future. McLean has done the calculations and Riverina Lions travel, on average, a staggering 5000 kilometres per season just to play football, meaning over the course of the 10 years the team has racked up roughly 50,000 kilometres on the road from Wagga to Canberra. McLean, who has played 154 games for the club, claimed a premiership triumph on Sunday would be just reward for the amount of hard work, travel and planning that has gone into making Riverina Lions a successful club. ""If we can win it this weekend we would have travelled 50,000 kilometres to get it,"" McLean said. ""When you are doing it (travelling) you don't really notice it but we have worked it out at least 5000 kilometres per year. ""It requires plenty of preparation and early starts and commitment. ""Numbers wise and skills wise we keep continuing to improve each year and that's a real positive."" Riverina Lions suffered a serious setback before a ball had been kicked this season when its home base at McPherson Oval was all but washed away during the floods that hit the city in March. It took a massive rebuilding effort from Riverina Lions, North Wagga Football Club and the North Wagga community to get the facility repaired and operational and McLean said a premiership victory this year would taste sweeter due to the adversity. ""With everything that happened with the floods, we didn't even know if we would have a team or a facility for a while,"" McLean said. ""It would be a fitting reward to win it."" Riverina Lions have been the most dominant team of the season and finished with the minor premiership before beating Eastlake in the major semi-final to move straight into the grand final. Despite its success, and the fact it has lost just two games this year, Riverina Lions will be forced to travel -- again -- to vie for the crown, but McLean said Riverina Lions would not be traveling to Canberra on Saturday even though the game will commence at 9.45am Sunday. ""We have gone over there the night before with the other two grand finals and it didn't work that well,"" McLean said. ""It made people nervous being there the night before the game and had them thinking about everything too early. ""We will keep to our normal routine, we will leave Wagga at 5am (Sunday) and we should be there by 8am to have a good stretch and get ready."" McLean admitted it had been hard to contain the nerves and excitement given the team had last week off, but said Riverina Lions would be doing its best to keep to its normal routine and structure. ""Time has been going slowly but we have been training well,"" McLean said. ""We will prepare the same way we have all year, we are treating it as just another game but obviously there is a bigger reward here for the winner."" Riverina Lions have defeated Eastlake on all three occasions this season and the grand final will commence at Manuka Oval at 9.45am on Sunday. "	News	News

24426	"NBAA: Boeing unveils BBJ version of 737 Max Boeing today revealed the 737 Max will be converted into a Boeing Business Jet (BBJ), with deliveries starting to the VIP market almost as quickly as the re-engined and updated narrowbody enters commercial service in 2017. The BBJ Max 8 will become the fourth version of the 737 family to be aimed at the business aviation market, and the announcement precedes a decision by Airbus on whether to offer a corporate jet version of the similarly re-engined A320neo . The same changes being introduced with the 737 Max 8 - including new CFM International Leap-1B engines, split-tip winglets and a redesigned tail cone - are expected to deliver similar performance improvements for the BBJ market, but with a different emphasis. Airlines are more focused on the fuel savings, while business jet passengers are more influenced by increased range and reduced cabin noise, Taylor says. Boeing The BBJ Max 8 should improve range by roughly 600nm compared to the roughly 5,670nm range of the BBJ2, the business jet version of the 737-800, he says. A BBJ version of the 737 Max 9 will follow the introduction of the version based on the 737 Max 8. By announcing the BBJ at NBAA , Boeing beats Airbus in the race to develop alternative versions of the re-engined narrowbodies. Airbus unveiled the A320neo nine months before Boeing launched the 737 Max family in August 2011, but has yet to announce an Airbus Corporate Jet (ACJ) version. The delay has baffled Airbus' competitors in Seattle. ""I'm fascinated they haven't moved out more quickly than not,"" Taylor says. Boeing, meanwhile, is continuing to evaluate other opportunities for spin-offs of the 737 Max. Boeing adapted the BBJ into a military surveillance and patrol aircraft, and Taylor says the example will be followed with the BBJ Max. ""Inevitably it will,"" he says. ""The military is typically not an early adopter of these kinds of things, so not right in the front end."" Boeing has sold 157 BBJs since introducing the type 15 years ago.

45321	Food & Wine Blog Nearly every human being on the planet is familiar with the concept of 2000 calories per day, which is the average amount of energy a human adult needs to sustain a healthy life. But what many people fail to realize is that it is less about quantity of calories you take in, and more about the quality of the food. 2000 calories of processed toxins is far different than 2000 calories of nutrient rich whole foods. The unfortunate reality is that the vast majority of people in the United States and other Western countries are not eating properly. Instead, there is an entire so-called health and wellness industry whose only purpose in life is to sell products. And considering how many overweight and depressed people there are in the United States who are consistently looking for a way to look better and feel better about themselves, it's no surprise when they take the bait of a magical pill. You cannot compress health and wellness into a magical pill or a special formula. It comes through whole foods and natural living. Even the Bible talks about this concept, because if you look at the people who lived in the Garden of Eden, regardless of whether or not you are religious, the stories all talk about how human beings in the beginning of time reliving hundreds and thousands of years. How, and why? The reason why is fairly simple. In the beginning of time, regardless if you are religious or not, men did not rely on supplements and pills and synthetic chemicals to fuel their bodies. Instead, they were only eating the natural products that come from the planet, things like fruits and vegetables, not processed protein shakes and lowfat lattes and diet sodas. It's 70% food and only 30% diet, so the issue is not in the lifestyle so much as it is the food. Whole food diet plans are the only way you can achieve total health and wellness and a body that is naturally sexy and toned through regular exercise. While The Mediterranean Diet is certainly the most famous of the whole food strategies, the reality is that any type of food combinations which include organic products and whole foods that have not been processed are superior in every way to the products the health and wellness industry tell you are good for you. You can either eat out of a can or a wrapper, or you can enjoy the bounties of Earth. It's your call. The secrets of the Mediterranean Diet whole foods are the real power behind the Mediterranean Diet Plan and Lifestyle. 	Opinion/Argumentation	Promotion
3061	"Art Talk with NEA Literature Translation Fellow Dan Bellm Dan Bellm. Photo by Annie Silverstein ""We owe it to each other to read world literature, to cross borders, to enter other lives and times in the way that only great writing can."" -- Dan Bellm Professor, editor, translator, and poet -- 2013 NEA Literature Translation Fellow Dan Bellm has some serious Renaissance man bona fides. In addition to translating the work of Pablo Neruda, Manlio Argueta, and Csar Vallejo, he has been translating French writer Pierre Reverdy's work for almost a decade. In 1998, Bellm received the Caesura Prize, judged by Mark Doty, for his poem, ""Aspens,"" and an Artists Fellowship for Literature from the California Arts Council. Bellm's poems have appeared in such publications as Poetry , Ploughshares , The Threepenny Review , and Word of Mouth: An Anthology of Gay American Poetry . We spoke with Bellm about his writer's life, his philosophy of literary translation, and why he likes taking apart poems to ""see how they tick."" NEA: What's your version of the artist's life? DAN BELLM: The artist's life, to me, means doing work I love, which includes continuing to try work that challenges or scares me. I'm not very interested in writing or translating the kind of poem I've already written or translated. The work has to pose some kind of question or riddle that I don't know the answer to; when I'm lucky, I grab a thread and just hold on. Or to take a different metaphor, I think of how pole vaulters keep raising the bar. And although not all writers do, I love giving public readings of my own and others' poetry. I consider it an essential part of my work. Poems are meant to be read aloud and passed on; once they're written and spoken, they're not ""mine"" any more. NEA: What do you remember as your earliest engagement with the arts? BELLM: Since I'm a literary artist, I'd have to say that my most important early memory is of my mother taking me to the public library in my hometown, Springfield, Illinois, starting when I was three or four, to pick out books, bring them home, and read them together -- a habit that's never come to an end. My sister Eileen, two years older than me, brought books home from kindergarten and first grade, too. It's all traceable back to that time, the amazing experience of words on paper coming to life as I learned to read. And leaping forward, I have to thank my high school English teacher, Jim Burke, for noticing me, and pushing me to read challenging books that weren't on ""the list,"" and really wanting to hear what I thought of them. NEA: Can you tell us about the project your NEA grant will support. How do you choose the works you translate? BELLM: I'm working on a translation of French poet Pierre Reverdy's (1889-1960) great postwar work, Le chant des morts (Song of the Dead), a volume of 43 poems written from 1944-1948. Although it's by far the most important book of Reverdy's middle and late career -- the time after he and his wife fled the very center of the Parisian art and literary world, in order to live a quite secluded life near the monastery of Solesmes in northern France -- Le chant des morts has been neglected by English-language translators, who have focused almost entirely on the poems of his Parisian years (1910-1926). Only four of its poems have ever appeared in English, and those are in books that are long out of print. Le chant des morts is a very unusual [account] of the public and private aftermath of war. It's not a documentary or a narrative -- it's about troubled states of soul. Reverdy has such a sure command of image, and the emotional atmosphere of life-at-the-edge-of-death in postwar France seems so strangely familiar, that I really believe that this poetry will speak eloquently to our own time. I have been working with Reverdy's poems for a decade or more, starting with two collections of his prose poems, and I've turned to Le chant des morts because it's so centrally important in his work. NEA: When and how did you begin your work as a literary translator? BELLM: I began to translate long before I had any thought of being a published translator. From the minute I started reading poetry in other languages -- Spanish and French, mostly -- I started wanting to make the poems that I loved ""my own."" It was always a bit like taking a clock apart to see how it ticks, and hoping to put it back together still ticking. I started teaching myself Spanish (my strongest second language, and the one I most frequently translate from) nearly 40 years ago, and well before I had made it through a bilingual edition of Pablo Neruda's poems, I was quibbling with the English translations, making notes in the margins and thinking, ""How hard could it be to improve on this?"" That kind of beginner's arrogance turned out to be useful, because it got me to begin, and it motivated me to continue long enough to appreciate just how difficult the art and craft of translation is. NEA: What is your process and how does your philosophy regarding translation impact that process? BELLM: I'm as ""slow"" a translator as I am a poet. Translations for me, typically, go through many drafts, and have to pass some kind of test of time before they feel complete. To describe my philosophy as a translator, I'd say that I am not an ""academic"" translator oriented to the kind of work that favors literalism or strict verbal ""accuracy"" over an engagement with the entirety of a poem's music. I love, and try to live by, the nineteenth-century poet and translator Dante Gabriel Rossetti's rather modest advice: ""A good poem shall not be turned into a bad one."" My deepest commitment is to translating as faithfully as possible the whole gesture a poem makes -- all of its resources of sound and meaning -- into a fully realized poem in English. NEA: How does your work as a poet inform your work as a translator and vice versa? BELLM: For me, translating has always gone hand in hand with being a reader and a poet. Throughout my decades of writing poetry, I've always had a translation project, or several, going on as well, whether or not I've had any intention of publishing those. I learn about how poems work, and I pay deep attention to the nuances and music of words; it's the closest act of ""close reading"" possible. I've been greatly influenced by such poet-translators as Galway Kinnell, Robert Hass, Marilyn Hacker, Chana Bloch, W.S. Merwin, and Robert Bly, all of whom consider the practice of translation deeply connected to their craft as poets. I always urge poetry students to try translating, as part of their craft, too, and for the past couple of years, I've been teaching literary translation in the MFA in Creative Writing Program at Antioch University, Los Angeles. NEA: I understand that you had an opportunity to see some of the original paintings by Pablo Picasso that accompanied the original publication of Le chant des morts . What was that experience like for you? BELLM: It's thrilling to see the original publication that these poems first appeared in -- a stunningly beautiful, hand-lettered edition, with 125 color lithographs by Picasso, brought out by the French art publisher Triade in 1948. The Museum of Modern Art in New York owns a copy, and it's an important work not only in Reverdy's oeuvre, but in Picasso's as well. It's hard to imagine the poems any other way now; I hope that any publication of my translation that occurs will include some of Picasso's work. Reverdy is quite a visual poet, and he was deeply connected throughout his life with such painters as Picasso, Braque, Matisse, and Gris, all of whom illustrated one or more of his books of poetry. Although Reverdy himself resisted all such labels, I think of many of his poems in visual terms as a kind of Cubist or Surrealist painting, the way they play with geometry and point of view, and up-end our expectations about narrative coherence or rational sense. NEA: What does the phrase ""Art Works"" mean to you? BELLM: I like this phrase in the sense that it puts ""art"" and ""work"" together. Not everyone agrees -- including, say, my own Dad! -- but it's a real job. And art itself works, of course -- it creates change, it forms and affects lives. It's an essential part of education, though it's often the first thing that gets cut. I guess we still need slogans like this because we're a society that still doesn't see art as absolutely central. NEA: Why do you believe it's important for the NEA to support literary translation? BELLM: Because we're all citizens of the world. We owe it to each other to read world literature, to cross borders, to enter other lives and times in the way that only great writing can. Without literary translation, there would have been no Renaissance, for example. Translation keeps a multiplicity of voices alive -- and it breathes new life into our own voices, our own English language. "	Other	Promotion
23490	"Microscopic appearance of cholesterol crystals in water. Photo taken under polarized light . Cholesterol , from the Ancient Greek chole- ( bile ) and stereos (solid) followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is a hydrocarbon organic molecule . It is a sterol (or modified steroid ), [ 3 ] a lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes that is required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity . Cholesterol enables animal cells to (a) not need a cell wall (like plants & bacteria) to protect membrane integrity/cell-viability and thus (b) be able to change shape and (c) animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells which are restricted by their cell walls). In addition to its importance within cells, cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones , bile acids , and vitamin D . [ 4 ] Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals. All kinds of cells in animals can produce it. In vertebrates the hepatic cells typically produce greater amounts than other cells. It is almost completely absent among prokaryotes (i.e., bacteria), although there are some exceptions such as Mycoplasma , which require cholesterol for growth. [ 5 ] Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell synthesizes it from simpler molecules, a complex 37-step process that starts with the intracellular protein enzyme HMG-CoA reductase . However, normal and particularly high levels of fats (including cholesterol) in the blood circulation, depending on how they are transported within lipoproteins , are strongly associated with the progression of atherosclerosis . For a man of about 68 kg (150 lb), typical total body-cholesterol synthesis is approximately 1 g (1,000 mg) per day, and total body content is approximately 35 g, primarily located within the membranes of all the cells of the body. Typical daily dietary intake of additional cholesterol, in the United States, is 200–300 mg. [ 8 ] Most ingested cholesterol is esterified, and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis. [ 9 ] For these reasons, cholesterol intake in food has little, if any, effect on total body cholesterol content or concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is recycled. The liver excretes it in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small bowel back into the bloodstream. Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts. [ 10 ] Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol produced within plants), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. [ 11 ] When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract , an important protective mechanism. Cholesterol is required to build and maintain membranes ; it modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar head groups of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids , while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which reduces membrane fluidity. [ 12 ] The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the decreased fluidity of the cell membrane as the molecule is in a trans conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar. [ 13 ] In this structural role, cholesterol reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, [ 14 ] hydrogen ions, and sodium ions . [ 15 ] Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin -coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis . The role of cholesterol in such endocytosis can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recently, cholesterol has also been implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane . Lipid raft formation brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. [ 16 ] In many neurons, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol, since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. [ 17 ] Within cells, cholesterol is the precursor molecule in several biochemical pathways. In the liver, cholesterol is converted to bile , which is then stored in the gallbladder . Bile contains bile salts, which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, A , D , E , and K . Cholesterol is an important precursor molecule for the synthesis of vitamin D and the steroid hormones , including the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone , as well as the sex hormones progesterone , estrogens , and testosterone , and their derivatives. [ 4 ] From a dietary perspective, cholesterol is not found in significant amounts in plant sources. [ 20 ] [ 22 ] In addition, plant products such as flax seeds and peanuts contain cholesterol-like compounds called phytosterols , which are believed to compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines. [ 23 ] Phytosterols can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or nutraceuticals that are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy. [ 24 ] Current supplemental guidelines recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III,FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15 gram per day. [ 25 ] However, the benefits of a diet supplemented with phytosterol has been questioned. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Fat intake also plays a role in blood-cholesterol levels. Isocalorically replacing dietary carbohydrates with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats has been shown to lower serum LDL and total cholesterol levels and increase serum HDL levels, while replacing carbohydrates with saturated fat was shown to increase HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol levels. [ 28 ] Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. [ 29 ] Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia ), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications. [ 30 ] The USDA , for example, recommends that those wishing to reduce their cholesterol through a change in diet should aim to consume less than 7% of their daily energy needs from saturated fat and fewer than 200 mg of cholesterol per day. [ 31 ] An alternative view is that any reduction to dietary cholesterol intake could be counteracted by the organs compensating to try to keep blood cholesterol levels constant. [ 32 ] Other research has found that an increase in the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol decreases overall serum cholesterol. [ 33 ] All animal cells manufacture cholesterol for their use, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 20–25% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver ; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the intestines , adrenal glands , and reproductive organs . Synthesis within the body starts with one molecule of acetyl CoA and one molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA , which are hydrated to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA ( HMG-CoA ). [ 34 ] This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase . This is the regulated, rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for the statin drugs (HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitors). Mevalonate is then converted to 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate in three reactions that require ATP . Mevalonate is decarboxylated to isopentenyl pyrophosphate , which is a key metabolite for various biological reactions. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum . [ 34 ] Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol . Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19-step process. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). [ 37 ] In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein) and Insig1 . When cholesterol levels fall, Insig-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus . Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 and -2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase . The LDL receptor former scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. [ 38 ] A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation. Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome . This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase . Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low. [ 39 ] Cholesterol is only slightly soluble in water ; it can dissolve and travel in the water-based bloodstream at exceedingly small concentrations. Since cholesterol is insoluble in blood, it is transported in the circulatory system within lipoproteins , complex discoidal particles that have an exterior composed of amphiphilic proteins and lipids whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; triglycerides and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the surface monolayer of the lipoprotein particle. In addition to providing a soluble means for transporting cholesterol through the blood, lipoproteins have cell-targeting signals that direct the lipids they carry to certain tissues. For this reason, there are several types of lipoproteins in blood, called, in order of increasing density, chylomicrons , very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The more lipid and less protein a lipoprotein has, the less dense it is. The cholesterol within all the various lipoproteins is identical, although some cholesterol is carried as the ""free"" alcohol and some is carried as fatty acyl esters referred to as cholesterol esters. However, the different lipoproteins contain apolipoproteins , which serve as ligands for specific receptors on cell membranes. In this way, the lipoprotein particles are molecular addresses that determine the start- and endpoints for cholesterol transport. Chylomicrons, the least dense type of cholesterol transport molecules, contain apolipoprotein B-48 , apolipoprotein C , and apolipoprotein E in their shells. Chylomicrons are the transporters that carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues that need fatty acids for energy or fat production. Cholesterol that is not used by muscles remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, which are taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver. VLDL molecules are produced by the liver and contain excess triacylglycerol and cholesterol that is not required by the liver for synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells. During transport in the bloodstream, the blood vessels cleave and absorb more triacylglycerol from IDL molecules, which contain an even higher percentage of cholesterol. The IDL molecules have two possible fates: Half are metabolized by HTGL , taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, and the other half continue to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they form LDL molecules, which have the highest percentage of cholesterol within them. LDL molecules, therefore, are the major carriers of cholesterol in the blood, and each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. The shell of the LDL molecule contains just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, which is recognized by the LDL receptor in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors become localized in clathrin -coated pits. Both the LDL and its receptor are internalized by endocytosis to form a vesicle within the cell. The vesicle then fuses with a lysosome , which has an enzyme called lysosomal acid lipase that hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. Now within the cell, the cholesterol can be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with cell membranes. Synthesis of the LDL receptor is regulated by SREBP , the same regulatory protein as was used to control synthesis of cholesterol de novo in response to cholesterol presence in the cell. When the cell has abundant cholesterol, LDL receptor synthesis is blocked so new cholesterol in the form of LDL molecules cannot be taken up. On the converse, more LDL receptors are made when the cell is deficient in cholesterol. When this system is deregulated, many LDL molecules appear in the blood without receptors on the peripheral tissues. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by macrophages , which become engorged and form foam cells. These cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). [ 40 ] These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein ) with ""bad"" cholesterol. [ 39 ] Also, HDL particles are thought to transport cholesterol back to the liver for excretion or to other tissues that use cholesterol to synthesize hormones in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). [ 41 ] Having large numbers of large HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes. [ 42 ] In contrast, having small numbers of large HDL particles is independently associated with atheromatous disease progression in the arteries. Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterols . Three different mechanisms can form these; autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. [ 43 ] This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their: participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription. [ 44 ] In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol are used. These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage and it is essential to purify cholesterol prior to use. Cholesterol can be purified using small Sephadex LH-20 columns. [ 45 ] Cholesterol is oxidized by the liver into a variety of bile acids . [ 46 ] These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine , taurine , glucuronic acid , or sulfate . A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile . Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. [ 47 ] The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation , which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder , cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones . Although, lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently. [ 48 ] Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol , a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces. [ 49 ] [ non-primary source needed ] According to the lipid hypothesis , abnormal cholesterol levels ( hypercholesterolemia ) — actually higher concentrations of LDL particles and lower concentrations of functional HDL particles  — are strongly associated with cardiovascular disease because these promote atheroma development in arteries ( atherosclerosis ). This disease process leads to myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles, [ 50 ] LDL particles are often termed ""bad cholesterol"" because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as ""good cholesterol"". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, medications , food choices, and other factors. [ 51 ] Resistin , a protein secreted by fat tissue, has been shown to increase the production of LDL in human liver cells and also degrades LDL receptors in the liver . As a result, the liver is less able to clear cholesterol from the bloodstream. Resistin accelerates the accumulation of LDL in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease. Resistin also adversely impacts the effects of statins, the main cholesterol-reducing drug used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. [ 52 ] Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially ""small dense LDL"" (sdLDL) particles, are associated with atheroma formation in the walls of arteries , a condition known as atherosclerosis , which is the principal cause of coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease . In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people. [ 53 ] Elevated levels of the lipoprotein fractions, LDL, IDL and VLDL are regarded as atherogenic (prone to cause atherosclerosis). [ 54 ] Levels of these fractions, rather than the total cholesterol level, correlate with the extent and progress of atherosclerosis. Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. Recently, a post hoc analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of ""good cholesterol"". [ 55 ] Elevated cholesterol levels are treated with a strict diet consisting of low saturated fat, trans fat-free, low cholesterol foods, [ 56 ] [ 57 ] often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents , such as statins , fibrates , cholesterol absorption inhibitors, nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid sequestrants. [ 58 ] Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery , which has now been superseded by medication. Apheresis -based treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids. [ citation needed ] Multiple human trials using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins , have repeatedly confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates, even for people with cholesterol values currently considered low for adults. [ 59 ] Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression. [ 60 ] As a result, people with a history of cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels (total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L [193 mg/dL]), [ 61 ] and in men without cardiovascular disease, there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels (""primary prevention""). [ 62 ] Primary prevention in women was originally practiced only by extension of the findings in studies on men, [ 63 ] since, in women, none of the large statin trials conducted prior to 2007 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in overall mortality or in cardiovascular endpoints. [ 64 ] In 2008, a large clinical trial reported that, in apparently healthy adults with increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein but with low initial LDL, 20 mg/day of rosuvastatin for 1.9 years resulted in a 44% reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality; the effect was statistically significant for both genders. [ 65 ] Though this result was met with some skepticism, later studies and meta-analyses likewise demonstrated statistically significant (but smaller) reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, without significant heterogeneity by gender. [ 66 ] However, as today's testing methods determine LDL (""bad"") and HDL (""good"") cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol /L), [ 69 ] although a newer upper limit of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier. Reference ranges for blood tests , showing usual, as well as optimal, levels of HDL, LDL and total cholesterol in mass and molar concentrations, is found in orange color at right, that is, among the blood constituents with the highest concentration. Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a variant ): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400 mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400 mg/dL. [ 70 ] Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes. [ 71 ] In the Framingham Heart Study , in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1 mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the fact that people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels. [ 72 ] This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme, in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age. [ 73 ] Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia . Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression , cancer , and cerebral hemorrhage . In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. [ 53 ] A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome , which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every five years for people aged 20 years or older. [ 76 ] A separate set of American Heart Association guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that patients taking statin medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter. [ 77 ] A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a lipoprotein profile . This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2 mmol/L or more (200+ mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking. [ 78 ] Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the liquid crystalline ""cholesteric phase"". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral nematic phase , and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid crystal display thermometers and in temperature-sensitive paints. Cholesterol has 256 stereoisomers , although only two of them are of biochemical significance (nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol, [ 79 ] [ 80 ] ) and only one of them occurs naturally (nat-cholesterol).

27935	"Guess Who Went To The #GracoSafety Event At Babies R Us! Introducing...the new Snug Ride Click Connect 40 from Graco. Last Saturday I was invited to assist at one of the 50 VIP events that took place nationwide, and I had a blast! I took the little peanut along with me. Doesn't she look snug all tucked into her Graco MyRide? It's easy for me to be excited about Graco car seats-they're my favorite brand. I've owned seven! I was thrilled to be involved in the launch of this new car seat, and not only because I got to leave the house and go on a little road trip to Grand Rapids. No, it's also because car seat safety is something that I have always been interested in. Bored and hugely pregnant with my first child, I read article after article about how much safer it was to rear face their car seat, and made up my mind to keep my kids facing backwards until they were to big to fit. Did you know: The American Academy of Pediatrics says that ""...toddlers are more than five times safer riding rear facing in a car seat. They should stay rear facing until 2 years of age."" We all want to keep our kids safe. Keeping them rear facing is a huge part of that! If this seat had been on the market when I was pregnant, you can bet your britches I would have wanted it. I still want it, but it turns out that collecting car seats is not something my husband approves of. Who knew? The lovely Kate from Sluiter Nation hosted the event and let us all in on the great features of the Snug Ride. There were two events back to back, and she rocked both of them. Not only did we get to spend the afternoon schmoozing and talking about fun things like how important it is to keep your child rear facing until at least two, we also got to give away TWO brand new Snug Rides! Ashleigh from Being Cheap Is Easy was our first winner, and she was thrilled. No word yet if she is going to give it away to her pregnant friend, like she said, or if she's going to keep it, like I totally would. It was such a pleasure to get to know the other bloggers that attended. Heather from Sassy Wassy Momma attended as well, and she brought along her little miss, Aurora. Kate highlighted all the great things about the seat, including the great cushy padding inside. Did you know that when you purchase a car seat, you should never add any inserts or extra padding? The addition of any extra products can reduce the effectiveness of the seat. My all time favorite part of this seat? The Snug Ride has a unique feature allowing you to adjust the harness and headrest WITHOUT undoing the straps. Have you ever removed the straps from a car seat and had to thread them back through those tiny slots, nervously making sure they are exactly right? It's a huge pain. I love that you don't have to remove the straps to adjust them as your child grows. This is my totally unscientific opinion, but I also think this will eliminate a huge chance for user error. The seat comes in two great patterns, Moonstruck (pictured at top) and Mena, which is the one we were able to get up close and personal with. We also got to play with the matching stroller! The new Snug Ride has the Click Connect technology, which means that it clicks right into the stroller and connects securely. Also, this stroller is something else. After wrestling with my huge double jogging stroller, I just about fell over when I saw how easy this one folds up. Trisha was our second winner! I can't believe we got to give away two seats. It was awesome to announce the winners! It was a pleasure to attend and assist at this event, and I'm so glad I had the opportunity. I love that I was able to learn about such a great car seat! If you want to learn more be sure to check out Graco Safety . You can also look on Instagram and Twitter under the hashtag #GracoSafety for more firsthand opinions from the other bloggers that attended the events! The Graco SnugRider Click ConnectT 40 -- the first and only newborn to two-year infant car seat that actually grows with your baby from four pounds all the way up to 40 pounds. The car seat is designed for a parent on the go. The infant car seat can be easily removed from the base and used as a carrier when the infant is small, providing portability and convenience so you can easily move your infant in and out of the car without disturbing them. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently made the recommendation to keep all children in rear-facing car seats until the age of 2. Graco set out to make this product so parents can keep infants rear facing longer while still keeping them comfortable. This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Graco.

6738	"21 of the most AMAZING rainbow cakes that you'll ever see (recipes included) Bright colours, pots of gold, blue skies...what's not to love about a rainbow birthday party? Especially when one of these gorgeous cakes takes center stage. We're obsessed, and we've rounded up recipes and easy-peasy tips for recreating them without the fuss. Colourful Cupcakes We love how simple these rainbow cupcakes are to make: Just buy a few boxes of vanilla cake mix, make the batter and then separate it into five bowls. Add food colouring to get the colours of the rainbow, and then pour each colour into the cupcake pan one layer at a time. (For the best results, follow this tip: After pouring each layer, dip your finger in water to smooth over the mix before pouring the next -- it keeps the colours from blending together.) And once they're out of the oven and cooled, add a dollop of vanilla icing on top for the cloud. Cotton Candy Treats It's not just a rainbow-coloured confection, it's shaped like a rainbow, too! To make, simply bake a round cake, let it cool and then use a 7-9cm round cutter (see it here ) to cut a hole out of the middle. Then, cut the cake in half to make the arch shape. To finish, cover the pieces in vanilla icing, top with M&M's and stick pieces of blue candy floss to the ends to make clouds. (Add those just before serving, so the candy floss doesn't disintegrate!) Six Layers of Love It's not a cake pop -- it's a cake stick ! To make this sweet treat, start by baking six vanilla cakes -- each dyed a different rainbow shade with food colouring. Once they're cooled, use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut pieces out. Then ice the tops of all with vanilla icing and layer on a stick. Done -- and yum! Rainbow Mosaic This modern take on the classic rainbow cake looks beautiful -- and it isn't as tough to recreate as you might think. After baking (or buying) square-shaped cakes, ice the layers with vanilla buttercream -- as smooth as you can get it -- and carefully press in bright candy pieces. Cut-up licorice pieces, even Jelly Bellies will work! Rainbows and Sunshine Our favourite cakes are the ones that are easy to make and pretty, too! This super-simple rainbow beauty is just four circular cakes (of any flavour) stacked on top of each other and smothered in bands of colored icing, topped with a cloud of white seven-minute icing . And that sunshine? It's made out of fondant pieces, but we bet you could make it yourself with a piping bag of yellow icing, too. Good Buy Just like an actual rainbow, this candy-covered cake is a joy to see! Here's a piece of news that'll make you just as happy: all parts of this cake are store-bought. You heard us. You'll need to get a cheesecake and various colours of M&M's, and then cover in concentric circles of colour. That's it -- time to party! Rainbow Bites What's better than rainbow cupcakes? Cupcakes arranged to make a rainbow! This beautiful display is perfect for a party and super easy to do: all you need is food colouring, cake mix and some buttercream icing. Add matching sprinkles, arrange in a rainbow shape and you're done! Biggest Surprise Somewhere over the rainbow -- or when you cut into this colourful cake -- little birdies fly in excitement! Imagine the delight in their eyes when this seemingly all-white dessert transforms into colour as you cut the first piece. Need help on all those layers? Martha Stewart did, too. No, seriously: watch it here . Easy Treats Those sugar-lovin', sweets-hoarding kiddos of yours will go ga-ga over this candy cake . Behind that Kit-Kat fence and under that endless pile of M&M's is a two-layer cake that you lovingly made. (Or, you know, bought at the shop and just decorated.) Either way, they'll think you're the coolest mum ever. Pretty in Pastel We love this subtle take on rainbow birthday cupcakes: sweet pastel icing with carefully-carved white fondant on top to let the pretty colours underneath show through. If you're stumped on how to make those delicate designs -- check out the how-to tips here . Pot O' Purple A riot of rainbow sprinkles on the outside plus five gorgeous (purple!) layers of ombre-dyed cake inside make this confection a sweet standout. Even better: making this cake is way easier than it looks -- follow the instructions here . Like, Snap Don't be fooled by these cute-as-can-be cupcakes . They're easy! Buy plain cupcakes at the supermarket  (we won't tell, promise) and a spectrum of fondant colours to cut into circles and form into rainbow shapes. Or take an even simpler approach -- buy the  pre-made fondant shapes. Done and done . Jarred in a Jiffy Everything out of the jar tastes better (and is more fun to eat): pickles, jam, and... cake, of course! Unlike pickling, jarred rainbow cake is super simple -- just spoon layers of dyed batter into the jar, place in a shallow dish filled with a -inch of water, and pop it in the oven for 35 minutes. To serve: top with whipped cream and sprinkles. A is For... Need some inspiration for your little builder's birthday? Pay tribute to his favoruite toy with this personalised alphabet block ! To ahem, build, you'll need four square layers of cake, icing to glue 'em together, and fondant to cover the cube. In the Pink Now this is the kind of gumdrops-and-Carebears rainbow cake we're talkin' about. The six colourful layers hidden inside might seem daunting, but they make a heck of a vibrant surprise! The rainbow pieces can be made ahead of time using royal icing. And best of all: There's no fondant! Just yummy buttercream. Check out the recipe here . Rainbow Love O.M.G.: a dazzling of array of fondant flowers and rainbow coloured layers?! Swoon -- times two. We admit it, this one requires some effort -- but these concise step-by-step photos and tips will help guide you. Wittily Wonderful We love a cake with a sense of humour, and this fun, iced leprechaun trap cake fits the bill. Use an angel food cake pan to make the secret rainbow inside and a textured piping bag for the grassy terrain. The trap is simply pretzel sticks across the hole in the middle, and the ladder is pretzel sticks held together with chocolate candy melts. And the bait? Chocolate ""gold"" of course! Thrilled for Frills This happy stack of wonder looks pretty darn cool -- and contains no dairy! To make it, first dye, bake and stack six 8-inch layers. Then fill up a piping bag with one colour at a time and use a rose tip to make layers of frilly ruffles. Super Stack We can't decide what we love more: the adorable unicorn cake topper (notice the rainbow hor), the simple white icing covering a hidden rainbow inside or the festive coloured garland decorating the outside. If you need a recipe to use, try this similar cake from Whisk Kid . Rainbow Times Two It's a no-brainer: One rainbow is good, but two are definitely better -- and this cake totally delivers. Bake, stack and frost six 9-inch layers (dying each a different colour) and then get creative with the rainbow decorations on top: Skittles, marshmallows, M&M's -- they all work!

I've done so much for myself, grown so much as a person, and I'm the happiest I've ever been. My first year at Uni has been amazing. It wasn't easy to begin with, but some amazing friends helped me to get through it. I challanged myself in ways I never thought I would. I've a large collection of friends now, all willing me on and supporting me through thick and thin. I've done more for other people, things which have helped me as well as them. I've had so much fun doing it as well. Building gardens, doing parades, helping at Open Days, Street collections, and the countless charity events at the Union. It's all been so much fun. I've been awarded for my commitment, I've clocked up my volunteering hours and been awarded for that too. I have an amazing boyfriend now. He treats me like an angel.. he's so understanding of everything. He's helped make me happy. I'm healthier than I've been in a long time too. I'm happy with my weight now and damn it feels good. For once I can say ""I look good, I feel good, Everything is good."" and mean it. I've moved on from RYL now. I no longer feel the need to come on here for support. I come on here to read general posts, and even then I rarely reply. It's been a great support when I have needed it, but I feel I've moved on now. I hope I've managed to give a little bit back in the 4 years that I've been here, but I guess I'll never really know. Not only have I moved on from RYL, I've moved on in my life.. the past IS behind me now. Last week I ripped up all my old diaries and threw them out. It's all gone now and it feels like there's a weight been lifted from my shoulders. RYL has been a big part of my life, and some of the people I've met through here I will never forget. They've become friends who I wish to keep for life. But I guess we all have to move on at some point, and for me, this is it. But I don't believe in saying Goodbye, because more than likely I'll still be around, and i'll still speak to some of you.. so this isn't a goodbye, more of a See you later. Thank-you to RYL, all the staff and most importantly all the members who have helped me through the difficult times. its so good to hear things are better for you. The even better part is that you have gotten to a stage in your life where you don't need ryl i am happy things are going well and i hope they continue to keep getting better for you. if you ever need us we are here though. See you soooooon :) I'm so glad to read this from you - I know you would've never believed me if I'd said you would've written something like this in a few months time last year so YAYYYYY. Take care of yourself Stephaaaannie. Loveyou. xx ""Be nice. Think happy thoughts. Champion silver linings. Love all things (not just cute things like babies and kittens) & when you do love - love like they do in power ballads (you know like on a cliff with the wind in your hair and your eyes shut, knowing you'll never know love like this). Watch out for dog poo. Smile at people - even grumpy ones. Remember anything is possible & whatever you do always try to look on the bright side."" "	Forum	Opinion/Argumentation

9024	"Journal titles can be a problem for the medical researcher. This is because the editors of some publications require that references should give full journal titles, and other editors require that references should give abbreviated journal titles. For example, JAMA specifies that authors should ""abbreviate names of journals according to Index Medicus "". Many other medical journals, including The Medical Journal of Australia , follow the same policy. On the other hand, some journals (for example, The British Journal of Psychiatry ) require journal titles to be given in full. The Index Medicus abbreviations are the abbreviations used in the Medline/PubMed database. These abbreviations are assigned by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), and are sometimes known as the ""NLM abbreviations"" or ""Medline abbreviations"". There are also other systems of journal abbreviations in use: always check the ""instructions for authors"" of the journal to which you are submitting your paper to find the style of abbreviation required. EndNote copes with the problem of journal abbreviations by means of its term lists . A term list can be set up for any field in an EndNote reference, but the term list linked to the Journal field is particularly sophisticated, because it allows you to store not only the titles of all the journals which appear in your EndNote library, but also up to three different abbreviations for each of those titles. It is possible to import ready-made term lists into your EndNote library. The University of Queensland Library has produced a medical journals term list which is based on a list prepared by the makers of the EndNote software, augmented by further titles which have begun publication in recent years. The medical journals term list records titles of journals indexed in the Medline/PubMed database. For each of those titles, it gives the full title, the Index Medicus/Medline/PubMed abbreviation and the same abbreviation with stops after each element. Note that there are some journal titles that do not appear in the medical journals term list (see section 6 below). NOTE: A journals term list is specific to a particular EndNote library. If you have more than one EndNote library, you will need to create a journals term list for each library. Now that you have imported the journals term list, you will have to make sure that the EndNote output styles which you use are configured to select the correct column in that list. For example, if you were submitting a paper to JAMA , which requires Index Medicus abbreviations of journal titles, the output style would have to be configured to take journal titles from the third column (?Abbreviation 2?) of your journals term list. To check the configuration of the output style: Click on Edit&gt;Output Styles&gt;Open Style Manager Highlight the style named ""J Amer Medical Association"" Click on the Edit button When the edit window opens, you will see a number of options on the left-hand side. Click on Journal Names . When the new screen appears, the option Abbreviation 2 should be checked, as shown below. This output style is correctly configured, and requires no editing. Click on the X button to close the edit window. Not all styles will be correctly configured. Some will have to be edited. For example , look at the output style for the British Journal of Psychiatry , which requires that journal titles be given in full, without abbreviation. Check the output style for the British Journal of Psychiatry , following the instructions given above ( section 3 ). With this output style, the option checked under Journal Names is Don't Replace . This means that when formatting your paper, EndNote will ignore the journals term list and simply use whatever appears in the Journal field in each of your references. NOTE: This is not a problem, if you are sure that you have always used full journal titles in your references, but if you have imported references from Medline/PubMed with abbreviated journal titles, then these abbreviated titles will appear in your formatted paper. If you want EndNote to use the ?Full Journal? column from your journals term list, then you will have to edit the style to reflect this. When you import references into your EndNote library using a filter or connection file, or when you input references manually yourself, EndNote will automatically update your Journals term list . The Journal field in each reference will be checked against every entry in the term list (including the abbreviations). If EndNote does not find a matching entry in the term list, it will insert the new journal title into the first column of the term list. If you are importing references with abbreviated titles in the Journal field, the automatic updating of the Journals term list could cause problems. If the abbreviation is not already in the Journals term list, it will be added to the first column (?Full Journal?). To avoid this, you can disable the automatic updating of the term lists. To disable automatic updating of terms: Select Edit&gt;Preferences When the dialogue box opens, highlight Term Lists in the left-hand frame Uncheck the options ?Update lists when importing or pasting references? and ?Update lists during data entry? When importing references to your library from the Ovid Medline database via the UQ Library web server, we suggest that you use one of the filters which can be downloaded from the UQ Library web server. These filters have been configured so that they will import both the full journal title and the abbreviated journal title. The abbreviated journal title will be imported into the Journal field of each reference, and the full title will be imported into the Alternate Journal field, or vice versa, depending on which filter you have chosen. If you are importing references from the PubMed database, the references will give only the abbreviated journal title. However, as long as this abbreviation matches one of the abbreviations in the medical journals term list, EndNote will be able to identify the full journal title for it when formatting papers using an output style that is configured to use full journal titles. If you are importing references from other databases , e.g. Biological Abstracts or PsycInfo, the reference will probably have the full journal title, as most databases no longer use abbreviated journal titles. However, as long as this title matches one of the titles in the medical journals term list, EndNote will be able to identify the Index Medicus abbreviation for it when formatting papers using an output style that is configured to use those abbreviations. When you are inputting references manually , you will have to use the full journal title, as you are unlikely to know the Index Medicus abbreviation. Again, as long as this title matches one of the titles in the medical journals term list, EndNote will be able to identify the Index Medicus abbreviation for it when formatting papers using an output style that is configured to use those abbreviations. The abbreviations used by Medline/PubMed are not the only abbreviations used by journal editors. Check the ?instructions for authors? of the journal to which you are submitting your paper. Even if you follow all the instructions given above, there will still be occasional problems with journal titles when you are formatting papers with EndNote. a. Using an output style configured to use ?Abbreviation 2?, some journals still appear in full This means that there is no entry for that journal abbreviation in your journals term list. Check the reference in your EndNote library. If you imported the reference from Medline using one of the UQ Library filters or connection files (see above, section 5 ), then both the full and abbreviated title should appear in your reference, in the Journal field and the Alternate Journal field. Check the journal title in LocatorPlus , the online catalogue of the U.S. National Library of Medicine If the journal title is listed, there should be a ?Title Abbreviation? field in the catalogue record, giving the official NLM abbreviation. When you have found the correct abbreviation, edit your Journals term list to include it (see below, section 7 ). If you cannot locate an official abbreviation for this journal title, then the editor of the publication to which you are submitting the paper will probably prefer that you cite the journal title in full. b. Using an output style configured to use ?Full Journal Name?, some journals still appear in abbreviated form This means that you have imported some references with abbreviated journal names, and those abbreviations did not match any of the abbreviations in your Journals term list. Check the reference in your EndNote library. If you imported the reference from Medline using one of the UQ Library filters or connection files (see above, section 5 ), then both the full and abbreviated title should appear in your reference, in the Journal field and the Alternate Journal field. When new journals begin publication, or existing journals change their titles, you will have to edit your Journals term list to insert the new titles. Sometimes you may also need to delete entries, for example when an abbreviated title has found its way into the Full Journals list. To edit the Journals term list: Open your EndNote library Click on Tools&gt;Open Term Lists&gt;Journals Term List Click on the New Term button A dialogue box will open. Enter the full title in the ?Full Journal? window and the Index Medicus abbreviation in the ?Abbreviation 2? window. "	Instruction	Instruction
18386	"Burrow quietly advanced through the opening rounds of competition, building momentum throughout the latter rounds while punctuating his efforts on the final day with an amazing variety of forehand maneuvers. Burrow toppled young Brazilian Gabriel Medina (BRA), 18, and goofy-footer Travis Logie (ZAF), 33, en route to the Final against compatriot Wilkinson. Both Burrow and Wilkinson opened up strongly, but struggled to secure a solid backup score. Wilkinson had an opportunity in the dying moments, but couldn't hold on during a third critical maneuver and came up just short. ""This win feels incredible,"" Burrow said. ""It happens sometimes where you never feel like you have the best heats. I was kind of in the zone. I never really had a good heat the whole event, but I still felt good. It's such a tricky wave and I guess the only thing that helped was my wave count. That Final was the battle of the back-ups. We both stacked it on a couple and we were in a fluster. Wilko (Matt Wilkinson) fell on that last one and he would have got the score, but I'll take it."" Burrow's win marks his second of the season after snatching the opening event on the Gold Coast of Australia. Western Australia's favorite son now sits at No. 6 on the 2012 ASP WCT rankings. ""I really wanted to win another event this year, especially since I'm out of the race for the title,"" Burrow said. ""That's pretty depressing, but I'm really happy that it just fell in to place here in Santa Cruz. To get two wins in a year, I've only done that once before so I'm really happy with that."" Wilkinson, a former winner at the venue in 2010, continued his lethal backhand assault at Steamer Lane, belting the day's highest heat total of 17.73 while defeating Adriano de Souza (BRA), 25, and Michel Bourez (PYF), 26, to attain his first ASP WCT Final appearance. ""I was stoked when I made it through the third round,"" Wilkinson said. ""Every heat after that, I just kept building. I felt amazing. I was getting 9s and backing them up. All year I've been dropping one big score. Out here, I felt like I was getting better every heat. I had that one that would have been a 9 if I made it out of that last turn."" Wilkinson was in desperate need of a result entering the O'Neill Coldwater Classic ranked 30th on the ASP WCT rankings. ""I was starting to freak out,"" Wilkinson said. ""I didn't want it to be left up to Hawaii needing points. Anything can happen there. There's a bunch of locals in the contest so it's not like any other event. You have to surf more rounds than usual and the more down the list you are the harder it is because you have to surf more rounds. I'm definitely happy to have these points heading in to Hawaii."" Today's Runner-Up finish vaults Wilkinson up to 22nd on the ASP WCT rankings and 15th on the ASP World Rankings, solidifying his requalification position for the 2013 ASP Top 34. Michel Bourez (PYF), 26, marched to his best result of the year, besting veteran Damien Hobgood (USA), 33, and Jeremy Flores (FRA), 24, with an amazing array of powerful carving turns on his forehand. Unfortunately for the Tahitian, he was unable to put a stop to Wilkinson's progressive backhand approach in the Semifinals and finished Equal 3rd overall. ""It was a good event for more,"" Bourez said. ""I'm frustrated that I didn't have a better Semifinal. I feel like I haven't had the best year and I was having a good event this week. My son is here with me and my family is my life. They have been my inspiration this week."" Travis Logie (ZAF), 33, was another deadly backhander at Steamer Lane, besting current ASP WCT rankings' leader Joel Parkinson (AUS), 31, in the Quarterfinals while securing his best result of 2012, an Equal 3rd place finish. Logie's tear continued in the Semifinals, posting an excellent 8.33 against Taj Burrow, but the South African was unable to find a backup score against the Australian, finishing just shy of the Final. ""I'm pretty stoked with how I surfed in this event,"" Logie said. ""I'm really disappointed because I had one really good one in that heat and I feel like I just needed an average one to make that heat. Taj has been ripping though and congratulations to him."" Logie, who entered the O'Neill Coldwater Classic ranked 26th, vaults up the rankings to 17th, compliments of his 3rd place finish in Santa Cruz, revitalizing his campaign to requalify for the 2013 ASP WCT. ""This result is huge for me,"" Logie said. ""These points are massive. I was looking pretty out of it going in to this event and a third place here shoots me quite a bit up the rankings. I'm still not home and dry, but hopefully in Hawaii I can make up some points."" Kelly Slater (USA), 40, current ASP WCT No. 2, struggled to find a rhythm in his Round 4 bout against Adriano de Souza, finishing equal 9th overall. Despite Slater's early exit from the event, a 9th place finish replaces his last-place injury points from Brazil, exponentially narrowing the ratings' gap with current frontrunner, Parkinson. ""I haven't looked at the numbers, but it's funny enough, I gained a couple thousand points,"" Slater said. ""Joel (Parkinson) dropped a 9th and gained a 5th and I dropped a 500 and gained about 3,000 points. It's a huge opportunity lost for Joel (Parkinson)."" Heading into the final event of the year, three surfers remain mathematically in contention for the 2012 ASP World Title: Joel Parkinson (AUS), 31, Kelly Slater (AUS), 40, and Mick Fanning (AUS), 31.

28342	"Mugged in Disney Court ACT Policing is seeking witnesses to an aggravated robbery which occurred early this morning (Sunday, April 15) in Belconnen. Around 12.37am a 24-year-old man arrived at his home in Disney Court Belconnen after finishing work. As the man parked in his driveway he was approached by three men. The man had a brief conversation with the group before one of the men produced a knife and made threats towards the victim and demanded cash. The victim complied with the demand, and handed the man a sum of cash. The group of men also took some of the victim's motorcycle gear before running off towards College Street in Belconnen. All three male offenders are described as being Caucasian in appearance and around 16-years-of-age with slim to medium builds. One of the offenders was wearing a grey coloured hooded jumper, tracksuit pants and runners. Another of the offenders was described as wearing a grey or black cardigan, jeans and casual shoes. Acting Duty Superintendent Daryl Neit said it's important to remember your safety in situations such as this. Police are urging anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity around Disney Court or College Street Belconnen early this morning to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or via the website at www.act.crimestoppers.com.au .

I've never been a fan of Twitter, but after reading several of the quoted tweets on here, I decided to visit some of the girlfriend's twitters on here. There was an early exchange between Cath Wiggins and Michelle Cound, which was rather funny to see. Wiggins seems to be one of those ardent defenders, and hunts down twitter to call out anyone saying bad things about Bradley. As the tour went on, MichelleCound's tweets had me worrying for Chris Froome, she seemed to stir things up a lot and many of her tweets seemed to be deleted?

20785	"As I Lay Dying Interview We recently caught up with As I Lay Dying frontman, Tim Lambesis, whilst they were touring the UK with Trivium. Following the release of their recent studio release, Awakened, the band are currently touring Europe with Florida metallers, Trivium. OMG: Summer 2012 had some pretty awesome highlights, namely the Mayhem Festival tour and playing Download 2012 in the UK, were there any other highlights that I've missed, and what was your favourite moment of this summer? TIM: It's all a blur because there's been so much travelling; it's hard to remember real specifics but the Mayhem Tour was a good experience for us because it's that festival atmosphere every day, but we get to re-live it 40 days in a row, so that was pretty exciting. OMG: So you've just released ""Awakened,"" how do you write a song, do you have a specific method and process or is it different for every track? TIM: It's a little different for each track, the general idea is that five of us will start working on individual ideas and start emailing each other those ideas, for everybody in the band we'll program some basic drums, and start layering guitars over it. In some cases the ideas being emailed back and forth are pretty much completed songs, and in other cases they're just a collection of riffs that we finish as a band when we get together in a traditional rehearsal environment. Instrumentally when we're happy with the song, I start evaluating which of the lyrics I have written fit the feeling of the song, and start to match those together at that point. OMG: Did the process for ""Awakened"" differ from how you normally write a record or is it pretty much the same across the board? TIM: That didn't really start until ""Shadows Are Security,"" which was when we started first demoing stuff with the drum machine before we practiced it acoustically in a rehearsal environment, and then of course modern recording got a little bit easier and easier, so each album became a little bit more developed as far as the overall ideas. Back when we wrote ""Shadows Are Security"" (2005) we had these incomplete songs and then we'd really need that time together to jam them out. By the time we wrote Awakened, all of us were so good at recording in our individual environments that the jamming process and rehearsing was more to make it feel alive and natural, but the actual creative part of the song writing was primarily done by that point. The other differing factor with ""Awakened"" is that (bassist) Josh Gilbert was a very big songwriter on this record. He joined the band at An Ocean Between Us, and by the time Awakened came round he wrote about half the record, instrumentally. OMG: ""My Only Home"" was beautifully written, and to me it sounds like quite a sand song. I know it's about touring and being away from home on a general scale isn't it? Are there any points where you really think, ""I want to go back home to California""? TIM: ...Yeah, usually most days I miss home, and if there was a way to be home but still make a living playing music I would do that in a heartbeat, but the catch is that as a profession this is what I'm passionate about and then as my personal life what I'm passionate about is my loved ones back home, so those two are at a conflict with each other. The only thing I can do is find a balance where if I'm gone for a month on tour then I find a month to be home, and just even it out that way. OMG: Absolutely. So how did the recording experience go with Bill Stevenson, and how did it compare to recording ""The Powerless Rise"" with Adam D from Killswitch? TIM: With Adam and us we really agreed on a lot, we all have a similar background as far as our taste in the way that we like to write metal goes. When it came to working with Bill we wanted somebody who had a different background and maybe, even if they were bad ideas, throw different ideas our way. Bill definitely understands underground music; he gets the mentality that we have. He's not a metalhead through and through, he just appreciates it, so his ideas were big picture kind of things, he didn't care about really small intricacies of guitar parts, he cared more about how the song flowed as a whole. We have very concise and well-structured songs as a result of Bill. OMG: So what do you get up to when you're not on tour or in the studio? TIM: Besides just catching up with my loved ones back home I own a recording studio so I'm there a little bit. I'm (travelling so much that) I try to just get myself organized at home, so I lead as much of a boring life as possible, I know it sounds weird but that's what's exciting to me in contrast, compared to what I normally do. OMG: Did you ever think As I Lay Dying would get to where it is today from when you started out? TIM: No, I always viewed the music we played as pretty underground. When we first started we were, I guess, one of the earlier metalcore bands, and the combination of the heavy rhythmic parts with the metal riffing was pretty abrasive. To me it technically still is. To a completely mainstream audience, it's still a little too overbearing for them and I felt like it would always feel that way. And then the metal genre as a whole has had some changes and trends and we, with Killswitch Engage and a few other bands opened the door for a newer modern era of metal that seems to be pretty readily accepted now. I didn't view that happening when we started the band. OMG: What's your favourite song off ""Awakened"" and why? TIM: I think for me I enjoy listening to ""Wasted Words,"" because it's not incredibly different, but it's enough of a different style of chorus, and a different style of song, that it has it's own identity for me.

15814	"MOST people in their 20s or 30s already know that love and money don't mix. It's all very well falling for someone's unworldly charm, but it's considerably less romantic two years on when you want to buy a house and your partner refuses to save any money or think beyond next week. Fiona Price, managing director of independent financial advisers Fiona Price & Partners, says she tells clients that being open about money is as important as all the other intimate details you reveal to your partner. ""It's very sensible to know what's in your partner's bank balance,"" she says.""You should assume that your relationship is going to work out - but if it doesn't, you should be able to walk away with some financial independence."" Being open about money doesn't mean you have to agree every transaction with your partner, and you shouldn't sling out your separate current accounts along with your single status. Independent financial adviser Christine Ross, director of Willis National, says: ""A lot of people keep one bank account separate; you don't want to know how much your partner spent on your birthday present."" Ms Price says the key to avoiding disagreements about who owes what is to have a joint account for bills and other expenses. Add up how much you'll need to put in the kitty each month and each agree to pay a fair percentage. ""Quite often what causes problems is that a couple put in 50 per cent each, taking no account of the fact that one earns more than the other,"" says Ms Price. Banks can be unenthusiastic when couples set up a joint account that is dedicated to paying bills, especially if the current accounts are held elsewhere. However, the Co-Op Bank's Pathfinder is a savings account that lets you set up standing orders and direct debits for all bills, and you also get Visa/Delta cards. It's also useful for any joint short-term savings you may want to make: interest is paid at 2.5 per cent up to pounds 2,500, and up to pounds 5,000 earns 4 per cent gross. Many married people like to keep their building society or bank savings separate from their partner's, if only to give an illusion of independence. But if one of you is a 40 per cent taxpayer and the other isn't, it does make sense to put savings in the lower- earner's name to save tax. The picture is different if you aren't married. ""There could be a hell of an argument if unmarried people split up after having set up joint savings,"" says Ms Ross. ""Remember that when you have a joint account, either partner could draw out all the money."" A good compromise are the ""linked"" savings accounts offered by Direct Line and Standard Life. You both have separate accounts in your own names but all the money is pooled for interest calculation, so you get a higher overall rate. You are especially vulnerable if you've moved in with a partner but have no official share in the house. Even if you pay half the mortgage, you have no automatic rights. ""There's no such thing as a common-law husband or wife,"" says Ms Ross. ""The burden of proof is on the person who doesn't own it to prove they've contributed."" Married people benefit to an extent from the married couple's tax allowance, currently worth pounds 274.50 a year. If you're getting married in the near future you'll need to ask for form 11PA to claim the money, all of which automatically goes to the husband unless you ask for a different arrangement. (Be warned: deviating from the ""norm"" involves a lot of complicated form- filling. The Inland Revenue seems unable to cope with the idea that a wife might fill in the claim form.) Finally, everyone in a relationship should make a will. If you die without making a will and aren't married, your partner will keep any assets in joint names (such as the house) but may have to fight the family for a share of the rest. It's not so bad if you are married: if you haven't got kids, the surviving spouse will automatically inherit everything up to pounds 200,000. Anything above that has to be shared 50/50 with the dead spouse's parents and siblings. In Scotland the survivor gets slightly less. 1. Leaving all the finances to one partner to sort out. This is unfair and leaves the financially ignorant partner vulnerable. If your relationship were to end, would you know where to find all the relevant documents and do you know where all the money is invested? (If your relationship is in trouble you should find out and, nasty though it sounds, photocopy everything.) 2. Taking out ""joint life"" policies. Joint life insurance, such as term assurance to back up a mortgage, is cheaper but it makes more sense to keep separate policies. Given that more than one in three marriages ends in divorce, taking out a joint endowment policy can be disastrous. If you split up, one partner may not be able to afford to buy the policy outright and you'll end up losing money when you surrender it or sell it. Better to buy two policies. If you split up, you've both got something to show for it. 3. Paying unequal shares. If you earn more than your partner, consider whether you shouldn't pay more towards the house and bills. Not being fair breeds resentment. 4. Keeping secrets. By all means keep separate current accounts, but if you share a bathroom with someone, shouldn't you be ready to let them see your bank balance? 5. Being at odds over spending. There's no cure for this one. If you are pounds 2,000 in debt on credit cards and your partner searches behind the sofa for a missing 10p, you are financially incompatible. You can work at it - and it can be fine when each partner helps to curb the other's excesses - but don't bank on it. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Promotion

36744	Billionaires Ruined Football, But What If It Was Your Team? I'd like to dedicate this article to a internal discussion I've been having, with myself (feel free to join in) about how much multi-billionaire businessmen have essentially spoilt the game, but I would imagine it's a test of any fans' morale fibre when one comes to England and says they want to takeover their club, to make them become one of the best in the world. My personal opinion is that football should be played the Dario Gradi way. I.e. placing emphasis on the academy, nuturing a group of young, home-grown prospects and introducing them to the first team early on and developing a team spirit within that group, that will come with them playing together so often. Then, once they grow out of themselves a bit and want a move to a bigger club, you sell them to a Premier League team and make money from them and develop the next group of young players. That's generally how I would feel passionate about seeing my club run. And that's how it used to be about thirty to fourty years ago, when local business men who cared about their club could actually afford to run a football club. Now, possibly partly because of so much football, particularly in the Premiership, being on TV more, more and more foreign chairmen want to takeover clubs. Some of them, i.e. Carson Yeung at my club, Birmingham City, want to make money from it and treat the club like a business. Which makes some logical sense- why would a chairman from Hong Kong that had hardly heard of Birmingham City want to pump loads of money into the club to make them a slightly better team than they were before. His lack of contact with the fans proves that his only intentions with Blues was to make more money. Some of them, i.e. Abramovich, childishly want to takeover clubs so that they become their plaything, to make that club become the best in the world immediately. So he moved to London where he would be loved by all the Chelsea fans and could become a bit of a celebrity, have all the best players and win everything- whilst privately knowing that people only like him because of his money and not who he is as a person. I have to say, I can't help but feel a bit sorry for Abramovich if that's what makes him happy. But realistically speaking, the only way Birmingham City could ever win the Premiership title or the Champions League, is if an Abramovich came in and wanted to buy the club outright. I honestly don't know whether I would still support Birmingham City if that happened. It would go against absolutely everything I believe in, and if it got to a stage where we were winning the Premiership title every season by 10pts or more, I'd probably get bored of it. But before I submit to a resounding declaration that I would never support Birmingham City again if that happened, I'd like to talk a little bit about the club's history. The last time we actually were a good team was in, I think the 1960s when we played in some European competitions and beat Aston Villa in the League Cup final, in 1963? Since then, we've been a little bit of a yo-yo club (although I can't help but think the strings have been cut off now), we got relegated to the third tier of English football in 1989, in the late 90s to early 00s we lost in the playoff semi-finals on penalties about 5 times, finally got up in 2002, spent the next four years thinking we might actually be an 'established' premiership club, went down, went back up, went down, went back up... went down again, and now we're back to about where we were in 1989. The amount us Blues fans have had to put up with is incredible and so many of us have stuck with it through thick and thin, you'd have thought we'd earnt a few glory years. Would we really stop watching it if we won something and had an awesome team that could beat Villa? Also, going to football every Saturday has become such a big, routine part of my life, would I not go? Would I support someone else? I certainly wouldn't support Aston Villa or Wolves I know that much. I'd be tempted to support West Brom, which would feel weird at first, and it would be a bit more of a drive, but worth it for what is at the moment, good quality, Premiership football which we're not even getting at Blues at the moment! But it would be a strange thing to do. The other option, would be to go and support a non-league team, like Solihull Moors, or Halesowen Town. It certainly wouldn't cost as much. But my problem with that, would be that it wouldn't be that serious, there wouldn't be a proper stadium, the crowd watching the game would consist of the player's girlfriends, three men and a dog. The atmosphere would be a bit rubbish, and unproper. And that makes me question my initial values, for supporting a team that doesn't have too much money but can introduce young, homegrown players and have people who have the club's best interests at heart. Which is exactly what non-league football is, but it wouldn't feel quite the same. The brutal reality of football will be that it always comes back to money, and the teams with the most money, will eventually always win. It's as simple as that. So for me, it's a question of where do you draw the line? Because it's the money these chairmen provide that makes the Premier League so exciting. If money didn't exist in football, football at all levels would be like Sunday League and non-league matches, which would be boring, and no football would be on TV. Knowing that, it then seems almost pointless to try and be an ethical football fan, but I also think it would be wrong for the spending in football to go beyond the current level it is at now.

43329	"Learning needs assessment has a fundamental role in education and training, but care is needed to prevent it becoming a straitjacket It might seem self evident that the need to learn should underpin any educational system. Indeed, the literature suggests that, at least in relation to continuing professional development, learning is more likely to lead to change in practice when needs assessment has been conducted, the education is linked to practice, personal incentive drives the educational effort, and there is some reinforcement of the learning. 1 Learning needs assessment is thus crucial in the educational process, but perhaps more of this already occurs in medical education than we suspect. The key lesson might be for those who design new systems of education and training: for example, the postgraduate education allowance system in general practice was felt to fail the profession because it did not include needs assessment and so led to ad hoc education to fulfil the time requirements of the system rather than the needs of individual doctors or the profession as a whole. On the other hand, basing learning in a profession entirely on the assessment of needs is a dangerous and limiting tactic. So a balance must be struck. Summary points Learning needs assessment is a crucial stage in the educational process that leads to changes in practice, and has become part of government policy for continuing professional development Learning needs assessment can be undertaken for many reasons, so its purpose should be defined and should determine the method used and the use made of findings Exclusive reliance on formal needs assessment could render education an instrumental and narrow process rather than a creative, professional one Different learning methods tend to suit different doctors and different identified learning needs Doctors already use a wide range of formal and informal ways of identifying their own learning needs as part of their ordinary practice These should be the starting point in designing formalised educational systems for professional improvement Learning needs assessment in medicine In 1998 both individual and organisational needs assessment became part of government policy in relation to the continuing professional development and personal development plans of all healthcare professionals. 2 Thus, it has a role in the clinical governance of the service 3 and is therefore much more than an educational undertaking. This integration of needs assessment, education, and quality assurance of the service was first made explicit in 1989 in relation to clinical audit, which would identify practices in need of improvement and ensure that educational and organisational interventions were made to address these needs. 4 Accordingly, audit was described as ""essentially educational"" and the educational process surrounding it described. 5 Long before these recent developments, needs assessment outside medicine was presented as an important part of managed education and learning contracts, which are the predecessors of the personal development plans to be developed for all NHS healthcare professionals. 6 In his descriptions of adult learning Knowles assumed (he did not claim to have research evidence) that learners needed to feel a necessity to learn and that identifying one's own learning needs was an essential part of self directed learning. 7 In medicine a doctor's motivation to learn would therefore derive from needs identified during his or her experience of clinical practice. So the pedigree and practice of learning needs assessment, if not the evidence, are well established. The definition of need As in most areas of education, for many years there has been intense debate about the definition, purpose, validity, and methods of learning needs assessment. 8 It might be to help curriculum planning, diagnose individual problems, assess student learning, demonstrate accountability, improve practice and safety, or offer individual feedback and educational intervention. Published classifications include felt needs (what people say they need), expressed needs (expressed in action) normative needs (defined by experts), and comparative needs (group comparison). 9 Other distinctions include individual versus organisational or group needs, clinical versus administrative needs, and subjective versus objectively measured needs. 10 The defined purpose of the needs assessment should determine the method used and the use made of findings. Furthermore, even though the concept of educational needs assessment is enshrined in practice, policy, and the educational canon, several factors indicate the need for careful planning and research in this subject (see boxes 1 and 2 ). Exclusive reliance on formal needs assessment in educational planning could render education an instrumental and narrow process rather than a creative, professional one. This is especially so in a profession where there is inherent unpredictability and uncertainty. Members of any profession require wide knowledge and depth of experience -- the relevance of some of which might not have been obvious at the time of learning. Certainly, learning needs can and should be identified on the basis of what has been experienced and of what more experienced members of the profession know to be relevant, but this must not deter other, more general or even speculative, learning that, at the time, seems to answer no specific need. Possibly no specific learning needs assessment would ever send a person to a large international conference on a generic subject (such as endocrinology, medical education, or management). It is, nevertheless, important that doctors attend such meetings and return with the unexpected and expected benefits that they accrue. Box 1 : Need for careful planning in needs assessment There is little evidence that needs assessment alone enhances educational effectiveness and outcomes, so it must be placed within the wider process of planned learning, relevance to practice, and reinforcement of learning in the appropriate context Formal needs assessment can identify only a narrow range of needs and might miss needs not looked for, so breadth and flexibility of needs assessment methods should be embraced In professional education it is not necessarily defensible to focus all learning on identified needs -- wider professional learning not related to a specific need is also of fundamental value where practice is not predictable Individual and group learning needs are different -- group learning needs may produce an average picture that fails to address important needs and interests of individual members of the group -- so a balance is required. Each approach has its uses and effects, but each must be used for the right purpose Identifying individual learning needs, often not shared by others, may lead to an unimpressive cost-benefit analysis in terms of individually targeted use of educational resources if used inappropriately. Individual learning needs assessment is best used in the context of learning that occurs on an individual basis -- such as in the relationship between general practitioner registrar and trainer Methods of needs assessment Although the literature generally reports only on the more formal methods of needs assessment, doctors use a wide range of informal ways of identifying learning needs as part of their ordinary practice. These should not be undervalued simply because they do not resemble research. Questionnaires and structured interviews seem to be the most commonly reported methods of needs assessment, but such methods are also used for evaluation, assessment, management, education, and now appraisal and revalidation. 11 Together, these formal and informal methods might make an effective battery where there is clarity of purpose. The Good CPD Guide details 46 formal and informal methods of self assessment (see box 3 ). 12 Peer review Non-clinical activities Academic activities Conferences International visits Journal articles Medicolegal cases Press and media Professional conversations Research Teaching The methods listed are both formal and informal, planned and opportunistic, showing that day to day work and encounters have the potential to generate needs as much as do formal methods. Formal needs assessment methods include critical incident techniques, gap analysis, objective knowledge and skills tests, observation, revalidation, self assessment, video assessment, and peer review. Such methods are often used to identify group needs. 14 15 Formal identification of needs can also arise from audit, morbidity patterns, adverse events, patient satisfaction surveys, and risk assessment. Most of these tools use quantitative methods that can generate computerised data and cover wider population ranges, but these are often unable to probe into the personal agendas and opinions of individuals. Types of needs assessment Methods of needs assessment can be classified into seven main types, each of which can take many different forms in practice. Reflection on action is an aspect of experiential learning and involves thinking back to some performance, with or without triggers (such as videotape or audiotape), and identifying what was done well and what could have been done better. 18 19 The latter category indicates learning needs. Reflection in action involves thinking about actual performance at the time that it occurs and requires some means of recording identified strengths and weaknesses at the time. The Canadian MOCOMP programme uses formalised reflection as its basic process. 20 Similarly, PUNs and DENs (see box 3 ) are well known in British general practice. Self assessment by diaries, journals, log books, weekly reviews This is an extension of reflection that involves keeping a diary or other account of experiences. 21 However, practice might show that such documents tend to be written nearer the time of their review than the time of the activity being recorded. Peer review This is rapidly becoming a favourite method. It involves doctors assessing each other's practice and giving feedback and perhaps advice about possible education, training, or organisational strategies to improve performance. The Good CPD Guide describes five types of peer review -- internal, external, informal, multidisciplinary, and physician assessment. 11 The last of these is the most formal, involving rating forms completed by nominated colleagues, and shows encouraging levels of validity, reliability, and acceptability. 22 23 Observation In more formal settings doctors can be observed performing specific tasks that can be rated by an observer, either according to known criteria or more informally. The results are discussed, and learning needs are identified. The observer can be a peer, a senior, or a disinterested person if the ratings are sufficiently objective or overlap with the observer's area of expertise (such as communication skills or management). Critical incident review and significant event auditing Although this technique is usually used to identify the competencies of a profession or for quality assurance, it can also be used on an individual basis to identify learning needs. 24 The method involves individuals identifying and recording, say, one incident each week in which they feel they should have performed better, analysing the incident by its setting, exactly what occurred, and the outcome and why it was ineffective. Practice review A routine review of notes, charts, prescribing, letters, requests, etc, can identify learning needs, especially if the format of looking at what is satisfactory and what leaves room for improvement is followed. The difference between needs assessment and assessment Needs assessment is not the same as assessment in the sense of examination of learning. Assessment systems that lead to academic or professional awards should show certain minimum characteristics, including measurement of performance against external criteria and standards, a decision on adequacy by an assessor, and standardised data gathering. 25 Needs assessment might sometimes have these characteristics, but it also might be based on practice, reflection, professional judgment, discussion, and informal data. Needs assessment methods that are limited by the standards of assessment will fall into the trap of assessing only a narrow range of needs. Learning for needs The main purpose of needs assessment must be to help educational planning, but this must not lead to too narrow a vision of learning. Learning in a profession is unlike any other kind of learning. Doctors live in a rich learning environment, constantly involved in and surrounded by professional interaction and conversation, educational events, information, and feedback. The search for the one best or ""right"" way of learning is a hopeless task, 1 especially if this is combined with attempting to ""measure"" observable learning. Research papers show, at best, the complexity of the process. Multiple interventions targeted at specific behaviour result in positive change in that behaviour. 26 Exactly what those interventions are is less important than their multiplicity and targeted nature. On the other hand, different doctors use different learning methods to meet their individual needs. For example, in a study of 366 primary care doctors who identified recent clinical problems for which they needed more knowledge or skill to solve, 55 different learning methods were selected. 27 The type of problem turned out to be the major determinant of the learning method chosen, so there may not be one educational solution to identified needs. Much of doctors' learning is integrated with their practice and arises from it. The style of integrated practice and learning (""situated learning"") develops during the successive stages of medical education. 28 The components of apprenticeship learning in postgraduate training are made up of many activities that may be regarded as part of practice (see box 4 ). 29 Senior doctors might also recognise much of their learning in some of these elements and could certainly add more -- such as conversations with colleagues. Thus, educational planning on the basis of identified needs faces real challenges in making learning appropriate to and integrated with professional style and practice. The first step in all of this is to recognise the needs assessment and learning that are a part of daily professional life in medicine and to formalise, highlight, and use these as the basis of future recorded needs assessment and subsequent planning and action, as well as integrating them with more formal methods of needs assessment to form a routine part of training, learning, and improving practice.

6736	"So as a Facebook fan, is there a way to fix this? Yes. It requires a few steps to set up, but yes. And then it's super handy. How to see all the updates from the Facebook Pages (and Friends) you love Currently, the best way to accomplish this is to use Interest Lists on Facebook. Update 11/5/12: There is another option that Facebook is rolling out which is the ""Get Notifications"" option you can/will see when you go directly to a Page and click on the gear icon. Because FB is just now rolling it out, it's possible you don't have this option yet (as of today, I don't) but I'll keep you posted as soon as I know more. (Check out Inside Facebook's post about it for more info.) Interest Lists basically let you create a personalized feed in which you will see all the updates from exactly the people and Pages you want. After you set up an Interest List (or lists), then when you login to Facebook, click on the list(s) you want to view from your Home page, you can be sure to see all the updates from the Pages and people on that Interest List as they are posted. How to set up an Interest List Once you do, scroll down until you see "" Interests "" in the left column. If you don't see ""Interests"" in the left column, click on ""More"" at the end of the left column and ""Interests"" should appear. Click on ""Add Interests..."" to create a new Interest List (you'll see here I already have created an Interest List called "" Faves ...""). In the next window, click the ""Create List"" button. First you'll get some suggestions of pages that Facebook thinks you might want to add to your new list (see below). To include any of them on your new list, simply click on them. Once you do so, you'll see a check mark appear in the bottom right corner of the profile pic. (If you make a mistake and add something you didn't mean to, just click it again to deselect it.) Tip: I highly recommend you choose your own Page (if you have one) so you can keep tabs and make sure you are indeed seeing all posts on this list. (It's just good to subscribe to all your stuff so you know what your readers/followers/fans are seeing.) Now, I assume these are not the only pages you want to add to your new list. (Please note, Facebook can be buggy here, so hang with me. A note about the workaround at the end of this explanation, but ideally this is how it should work...) Ideally, once you have selected the suggestions Facebook presented (above), you should be able to add more to this list by navigating through the options in this window. For example, perhaps you know of a Page you want to add but it didn't come up in your suggestions. You can search for it by typing it in the search bar up top. Once you see it, click on it to select it. Go ahead and type in more page names you know off the top of your head. (The others should remain checked even if you navigate away from them.) And then you might want to select some of your Friends by clicking on the ""Friends"" link in the left column. Yes, you can have a mix of Friends and Pages on one Interest List. Cool, huh? Once you click there, your Friends should pop up on the screen. Add any of them to your list by clicking on their profile pic. And maybe you want to choose some of your Subscriptions or browse some of the categories Facebook suggests (again see left column in image above). So go ahead and select all the Pages, Subscriptions and/or Friends you want to add to this list.  Then once you've selected everyone you want to include on this list, click the Next button in the bottom right corner of the window. On the right side in the next window you should see all the people and pages you just selected. Workaround: Now this is where Facebook can get buggy. If you realize not all your selections are on the list, you might have to add People and Pages in batches, checking after each to make sure they are showing up as shown above. If this happens to you, simply click the ""Previous"" button at the bottom right of the screen. Once you go back, work through the above steps again, this time clicking ""Next"" after each group (suggestions, search entries, Friends, etc.) to make sure they were indeed added. I know it's a pain, but it's the only workaround I've found when Facebook is temperamental. OK, workaround is done. Back to our regularly scheduled program... Once you've got everyone on your new list that you want, enter a name for your list. Then choose who you want to be able to see the list (Public, Friends, Only Me) and then click the ""Done"" button in the bottom right. Once you are done, you will be taken back to your Home page. Again, look in the left column under ""Interests"" to see the link to your new list. Or, access all your lists here . How to make your Interest List easily accessible Once you've created your Interest List, you want easy access to it right? The long way to get to it is to scroll down on your Home page (of your Personal Profile) and click on it under ""Interests."" The faster way is to add your Interest List to your Favorites so you can get to it quick as a wink. As a Favorite, it will show up in the top left corner of your Home page. To add a list to your Favorites, from your personal profile's Home page, scroll down until you see ""Interests"" in the left column. (Again, if you don't see ""Interests"", click the ""More"" link at the end of the left column and it should appear.) Hover over the list you want to add to your Favorites until you see the edit icon (pencil) appear. Click on that pencil. Then click on ""Add to Favorites."" Doing this will bump up your Interest List link to the top of your Home page (see above) so when you login, you can go directly to your list. Bonus: If you want to be super on top of things, hover over your list name again (under Favorite) until you see the pencil icon once more. Click the pencil icon and then click ""Rearrange."" You'll see three lines appear to the right of the items on your Favorites list. You can drag and drop your Interest List where you want under Favorites, like, just below your News Feed (which has to stay put). I don't know how you could make it any easier to get to. How to create a list and add Pages or Friends on the fly or individually So now let's say you have your list created, but as you are browsing your News Feed or as you are bopping around the internet, you come across a Facebook Page you want to add to your list, or you remember you want to add that new Friend. Simple. (If you have trouble with this, you may have to switch your ""Using Facebook as..."" options.) How to add a Page to an Interest List on the fly If you already Like a Page and want to add it to a list on the fly (like when you're browsing your News Feed), simply hover over the Page name, then hover over ""Liked"" and then click ""Add to Interest Lists..."" when the menu pops up. Just choose the appropriate list. Or, another alternative is to go directly to the page itself and click on the gear icon until you see the option to ""Add to Interest Lists..."" Not only can you add the Page to an existing Interest List, you also have the option to create a brand new Interest List right from here. Just select ""New List..."" How to add a Friend to an Interest List on the fly If it's a Friend you want to add to your Interest List, they must allow Subscribers . To add a Friend to a list, I've found it works best to go directly to their main Profile page and then complete the steps required for adding a Page (click the gear icon and then ""Add to Interest Lists..."") like so: A few more tidbits If you own a Facebook Page, consider sharing this post with your readers so they understand how Interest Lists work. There is so much confusion about this issue and so many are probably missing your posts ! If you found this post via another blogger, consider adding their Facebook Page to one of your Interest Lists so you don't miss their posts. You can subscribe to my Faves list if you'd like. It's a handful of pages on a variety of subjects. You do not have to Like a page or Subscribe to a person in order to include them on an Interest List. Kinda makes Facebook Page Likes sort of not an accurate representation of how many people may be actually following your posts, right? Interesting... Amy! Once again you knock my socks off. I am in the stage of enhancing my Facebook page and there you are, posting content about Facebook update. Yey! Perfect timing. Thank you for all your blog content, you help me tremendously. Thanks so much Amy! I stumbled across your site a month or so ago an am so happy I did! I just shared a link to your site through Pinterest and my Business Facebook page. I appreciate all of your helpful tips and will spread the word. ~ Julie (EAB Designs) So glad you wrote this post! Curious: do you think Facebook is phasing out the old style lists ( https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/lists )? They were certainly easier to add friends to, and are what I've used so far for my private ""people/pages I follow"" list. This is great Amy and I will definitely be sharing it with my friends and followers. Just one question. I subscribed to a list that a few bloggers created and I noticed the posts are in kind of random order but I usually sort my newsfeed to ""recent"" so I can see them in chronological order. Is there a way to make interest lists sort posts in order? Thanks! Actually Amy, now that I've played with interest lists in my personal FB account more, I've discovered that the posts are in fact in chronological when I click on the interest list. {The random posts were when I tried to subscribe to a list from my blog's FB page. When I did that, my blog's newsfeed has a group of posts from the interest list together but in random order -- weird -- must have something to do with the fact that you aren't supposed to be able to subscribe to an interest list from a blog's page.} I'm with the others commenting about how frustrating it is to not be able to create interest lists from blog FB pages. I prefer to comment from that account too Super helpful! Have you done a post on the idea of creating a Facebook group as an alternative to a page? I'm seeing some bloggers talk about that as a way to get more visibility for their posts, but I wasn't sure about the downsides....I'm pretty sure you get a lot more updates when you're part of a group, right? I wouldn't want to annoy people! Amy, thank you for your step-by-step instructions, especially for those of us who are technologically=-challenged, hehe. I have a question: this setting (interests) that you just taught us, will it send emails to me so I alwasy know what is going on, even if I don't log to facebook? I used to received them automatically but somehow now I dont anymore, it has been a few months already. this facebook changes almost everyweek so I really have no clue... thanks for your help, I just discovered you thru mrs. january. Thank you so much for such a thorough explanation. I just went in this evening to do this. I love being about to click on my various interest lists to see the posts that I am looking to see at a particular moment. Sharing this tutorial on my wall for sure. Thanks Amy. This makes sense and no sense all at the same time. So basically, if I like a page I won't be guaranteed to see it in my feed. ( I pretty much have caught on to that because I only see about 10 of the same blogs I have liked on FB and they are the same everyday) Also I can tell that only about 200 of my 800 followers see what I post. So here are my issues with the interest list, I have to now go to my feed, my pages feed and my interest list to make sure I can keep up with all that I want to follow. Secondly, it looks like the interest lists have to be made under your primary account and not your page so I cannot leave comments under my blog facebook page but under my personal page. It's just all very irritating. I know this isn't your problem. I just don't understand why we can't just have all the blogs we follow show up in our stream. Thanks for letting me vent. But do you know how to comment on your interest list under you page and not your personal account? I know, it's frustrating to me too. I keep reminding myself that Facebook is free, so they can do what they wanna do. Yes, using Facebook as your Personal Profile as opposed to your Page is definitely another frustration. If I find a workaround, I'll let you know (or if any of you all, know of a workaround, holla!). Hi Amy, I've noticed that I can't create an Interest List from my own Page-CozyCondoLiving. I have to do it from my Home Page-Lisa Allen. I have purposely kept the two separate since my Home Page is for family/friends and my CCL page is for followers. I like to make comments on pages I am following as CozyCondoLiving so that bloggers know who I am. I don't want to comment as Lisa Allen. So, if I make an Interest List from my Home Page I would ONLY be able to use it to view and not to comment or ""Like"". That is a bummer! Have you noticed this yourself? Do you have any suggestions for what I could do? None of these things work for me with all posts. I do not see posts from any of my friends and/or pages if they post via a service like dlvr.it, HootSuite, NetworkedBlogs, etc. I see all the posts they post directly, but if they use a service it doesn't show up in my feed, my interest list, or any other list (though I can see it happening in the ticker if I'm watching). Do you happen to know of a workaround for this issue? I have repeatedly petitioned help from Facebook, but of course I have never been given any. Thanks! No, unfortunately, I don't know a workaround. We are largely subject to Facebook's algorithms unfortunately. I'll be interested to see how the newest function to get notifications works once it's rolled out though. "	Instruction	Instruction
47743	"The ruins of ancient Troy will be examined by a cross-disciplinary team of scientists in an expedition led by UW-Madison classics professor William Aylward. The ruins of ancient Troy,  sacked by the Greeks through trickery and a fabled wooden horse, will be examined by a cross-disciplinary team of scientists next year. The  expedition will be led by University of Wisconsin-Madison classics professor William Aylward. Aylward is an archaeologist with long experience digging in the ruins of classical antiquity, including Troy itself. The new international project at Troy, to be conducted under the auspices of and in cooperation with Turkey's anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, will begin a series of summer-time expeditions beginning in 2013. ""Troy is a touchstone of Western civilization,"" says Aylward. ""Although the site has been excavated in the past, there is much yet to be discovered. Our plan is to extend work to unexplored areas of the site and to systematically employ new technologies to extract even more information about the people who lived here thousands of years ago."" William Aylward Troy and the Trojan War were immortalized in Homer's epic poem The Iliad centuries after the supposed events of the conflict. The site was occupied almost continuously for about 4500 years, from the beginning of the Bronze Age to the 13th century AD, when it was abandoned and consigned to myth. It was rediscovered in the 1870s by the wealthy German businessman and pioneering archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann whose work at Troy laid the foundations for modern archaeology. ""Our goal is to add a new layer of information to what we already know about Troy,"" says Aylward, who is contributing an international team of archaeologists and scientists to conduct what promises to be the most comprehensive dig since Troy's discovery more than 140 years ago. ""The archaeological record is rich. If we take a closer look with new scientific tools for study of ancient biological and cultural environments, there is much to be found for telling the story of this world heritage site."" The site of Troy is in modern Turkey and is situated on the Dardanelles, a crossroads between East and West and a flashpoint for conflict in both ancient and modern times. The archaeological site is a complex layer cake of history and prehistory, with 10 cities superimposed one atop the other, some with clear evidence for violent destruction. Following the demise of Troy at the end of the Bronze Age, the site was re-settled by Greeks, Romans and others, who all claimed Homer's Troy and its cast of characters -- Achilles, Helen, Patroclus, Priam and Ajax -- as their own cultural heritage. The ancient city was visited by the Persian general Xerxes, Alexander the Great, and Roman emperors, including Augustus and Hadrian. Homer's epic poems about a lost age of heroes and the legendary Trojan War have endured as sources of inspiration for art and literature ever since. Although archaeologists have been digging at Troy for almost 140 years, with the exception of a 50-year hiatus between 1938 and 1988, less than one-fifth of the site has been scientifically excavated. With about 4500 years of nearly uninterrupted settlement at a crossroads between Europe and Asia, Troy is fundamental for questions about the development of civilization in Europe and the Near East. ""Troy deserves a world-class archaeological program,"" says Aylward. In its heyday, Troy's citadel, with walls 12 feet thick and more than 30 feet high, was about 6 acres in size. A walled lower town covered an expanse of 50 acres, much of which is unexplored. Mysteries abound. Ancient Troy's royal cemetery, for example, has yet to be discovered and archaeologists are eager to add to the single example of prehistoric writing known from Troy, a small bronze seal from the Bronze Age. In future work at Troy, Aylward plans an array of collaborations in order to deploy powerful new scientific techniques to reveal the hidden record of the ancient city and its inhabitants. New methods to examine chemical residues on pottery from ancient kitchens and banquet halls, for example, may reveal secrets of ancient Trojan culinary proclivities, and genomic analyses of human and animal remains may shed light on diseases and afflictions at a crossroads of civilization. Much of the new work in the area of ""molecular archaeology,"" which includes DNA sequencing and protein analysis, will be conducted in collaboration with the UW-Madison Biotechnology Center, which has become an active partner in the new Troy project. This past summer, researchers from the center participated in reconnaissance for future studies. "	News	News
26214	"App Synergy: How To Make A Travel Journal Last weekend, I took a small vacation to Montreal . While I like to travel, I am not an ambitious sightseer. The exception to this is when the sights I see involve food. I love food. It was a real treat to visit the Jean-Talon Market (French: March Jean Talon), which is a historical farmer's market located in Montreal's Little Italy district. I decided to use this gastronomic excursion as the object model for this week's app synergy use. Step 1 -- Capture Your Memories One of my coworkers, Stella Violano , told me about an app called 645 Pro . She bragged that it allowed photos to be taken in RAW and TIFF formats. Being an amateur photographer, I had no idea what she meant, but I was finally able to try the app out on my trip to the market. 645 Pro Screenshot -- Random Market While I have yet to scratch its potential, I definitely see the appeal. All of the settings are located directly on the camera. While some may be unfamiliar with the different options, there are no confusing menu layers to navigate. I found the response time to be quicker than that of Apple's camera app and took some nice shots with it. The nicest thing I can say about 645 Pro is that it made me to want to learn more about ""real"" photography. I even started reading the 32 page user manual. Until I find something better, 645 Pro will be my new default camera app. I find it poor form to share pictures I've taken of strangers. To get a glimpse of the Jean-Talon Market, check out this picture from the National Geographic Society . It can be found within the app, A Taste Of Montreal . The app hits my sweet spots, as it combines journalistic storytelling with mouth-watering photos of Montreal's cuisine. I had some excellent meals in Montreal. A Taste Of Montreal shows me what I missed and whets my appetite for my next trip there. Jean-Talon Market Step 2 -- Mark Up Your Memories Another useful Montreal-specific travel app is Montreal: Travel Guide , by eTips LTD . This travel guide has some cool features, like the use of Augmented Reality (AR) and the presence of zoomable offline maps. My main interest in the app, for the purposes of this article, was its Metro map. Montreal Metro Map The map provides a basis for modification by PhotoPen , a photo annotation app. It's a simple way to mark up your photos and share them. Although it's not difficult to guess where the Jean-Talon Market is on the map, I may not always remember the name and location of the market. PhotoPen allows me to make a quick note to myself, which also results in a personalized contribution to my journal. Map Annotated By PhotoPen Step 3 -- Collect Your Memories When it's time to create your journal, you have some options. There are a number of journaling apps available for your iDevice. Day One is a popular choice. Earlier in the week, it received a significant update , which allows you to finally add pictures to your entries. You can also add weather information, location/GPS data, and check in to Foursquare . Unfortunately, you can only add one photo per entry. On the bright side, the results look great and really add to what was already a fantastic app. I created the following entry with a shot I took of some delicious oysters. Day One used the photo's metadata to fill in the location and date. Day One Now Has Photo Support As good as Day One is, you may not be satisfied with its single photo diary style. You may instead envision a scrapbook type app, which allows you to intermix photos and text. For that, check out Maxjournal , which allows you to add up to 30 photos for each journal entry. You can then rotate the photos and position them in between the text. Due to its simplicity, aesthetics, and superior syncing, I prefer Day One. But in terms of adding multiple photos, Maxjournal has Day One beat. Please also note that Maxjournal is iPad only, while Day One is universal. Incorporate Multiple Photos In Maxjournal Finally, one of my readers in India reminded me that journals don't need any text at all. He creates pure photo journals using iPhoto. I previously discussed the iPhoto journal feature in my Mother's Day article . In that article, I had already imported all my photos into an album and then sent the entire album to a journal. It's a little trickier to create a journal from individual photos, if no album already exists. From the main photos page, touch a picture to enter the single photo browsing mode. From there, tap on the share icon and choose the journal option. To add multiple photos to the journal, select ""Choose,"" which allows you to add up to 200 thumbnails for sharing. You can then send them to a new journal. If you want to add them to an existing journal, you need to go one step deeper in the menu and tap on the bar that says ""New &gt;."" This gives you the option to choose from preexisting journals. Personally, I find the user experience to be a bit clunky, especially for an app made by Apple itself. However, it can produce some good looking photo journals. Creating A Photo Journal In iPhoto Traveling is a lot of fun, and it can be even more fun to document those travels and the memories associated with them. Hopefully, this article has given you a first step toward creating your own travel journal. If you would like to share your experiences with me, please send a note to leonard@appadvice.com. I'd love to hear your stories and see your photographs, especially if they involve food. "	Instruction	Promotion
17546	"Search form Is there any love for Hawkwind? Submitted by tiggerlion on 14 November 2012 - 9:22pm We are all living in the 70s, after all! I confess, I loathed them at the time. A friend dragged me along to a gig in Liverpool. I wasn't keen even when he promised a stripper. They were all muddy noise and bad smells to me. The 'stripper' turned out to be the six foot two Stacia, whose breasts are not human. The sight of her in the weird lighting effects gave me nightmares for years. Some bloke got up and spoke some nonsense I couldn't quite catch. All in all, I was unimpressed. Still, my friend persevered and they grew on me. I found I could tolerate their lyrical gibberish. They were one of those groups in the early 70s that were neither prog nor rock nor jazz nor pop. Their grooves were colossal. There was a lot of parping & squawking. Yet, there was a group collective that was really very disciplined. My favourite album is In Search Of Space. The opener, You Shouldn't Do That is sixteen minutes that Sun Ra would be proud of. Master Of The Universe is earning them big money from the latest Ford car advert & good on them. We Took The Wrong Step Years Ago features the loudest acoustic guitar I've ever heard in my life. I positively enjoy listening to all six tracks. ... loving the Hawkwind for many years, especially the excerpt on the first Greasy Truckers album, just immense... and as Lando says, Space Ritual... Lemmy in Hawkwind is one of the two reasons that I started playing chords on me Rick4001 (Lemmy in Motorhead is the other...) We may have been at the same gig, although I'm sure they played there a number of times. I saw them in either 1973 or 74. I thought it was pretty awful. You sum up the musical content well. The much vaunted lightshow was pretty disappointing - perhaps it wasn't working properly that night - but it seemed to mostly a projection of planet Earth plus some strobe lighting. The visuals, including the album covers, were provided by Barney Bubbles. He got a lot better, especially when he worked for Stiff. The covers for This Years Model & Do It Yourself are great! He also directed videos for EC & Squeeze that were excellent. OOAA All throughout the gig I was somewhat perplexed by the sight of a - to my 15-year-old eyes at least - quite elderly couple sat in the front row. I couldn't imagine that they'd really enjoyed Sonic Attack very much. After the show I went up and asked them if they'd had a good time. ""Oh yes,"" one of them replied, ""we're Mr and Mrs Brock."" Lets see; serious grooves, monster riffs, primitive synthesisers, naive '1st time on acid' adolescent sci-fi lyrics, blokes who look the person who sold you an underweight 1/8th, blobby psychedelic lights and proper epilepy-quality strobes, and a fanatical greebo / old-freak audience (anyone who likes to get out of it, really). What's not to like? Anyone who doesn't at least appreciate all of this has no heart, and, as Nigel Molesworth once said, I DISKARD THEM. And threw everything at it. Michael Moorcroft, Stacia & Bubbles. They got a proper krautrock bassist, they employed their roadie. The band founder members met whilst working fair grounds. They knew how to put on a show. They were more than a mere band, they were a travelling circus! Avoid the 1970 debut album, they hadn't really found their sound (or established their milieu, if you will) at that point. All you need are the second, third and fourth albums plus the magnificent Space Ritual double live set. There are some really great moments after 1974, but from that point on they basically repeated themselves, with ever diminishing returns. So it's part of the selfmythologising - there's lots of that in song titles and so on. Oh, and I'd get the debut as well - first 5 albums are the best run they ever had. Hall of the mountain grill is almost Pink Floyd in places. You can pick up the expanded editions for a few quid each. Personally I'm less keen on PXR5 and Quark Strangeness and Charm (although Hassan I Sabbah is a must have track) - the start of trend following as they tried to go New Wavey. Their metal period is probably their worst, although I do like ""Live Chronicles"". The triple Epoch Eclipse is a pretty good compilation - all the stuff you want, and some alternative takes make it worth while even if you go back and get the full albums later on. In Plymouth around the late 80s, as a callow youth. Walked into the Academy, and almost the first thing I saw was someone falling down the stairs. He got up to reveal a T shirt with the message ""Say Yes To Drugs"" and proceeded into the auditorium. You had to be well pickled to appreciate fully. Englands half-assed answer to The Grateful Dead or something. ""Say yes to drugs"", and apparently all your teeth fall out. And to the man that suggested that Stacias ""norks"" were ""not a pretty sight"" (never heard that word) - I have to report that this may very well be an error in your judgment.'Cause they always looked Ok to me. In fact as gimmicks go, they were considerably better than OK. I remember seeing a documentary where Lemmy claimed that Stacia, with whom he apparently shared a room on tour, used to pick ""goggle eyed"" boys from the audience. So you may have missed out there. Not least because under the present conditions, it would have made a very amusing trial. Right, so what you're saying is, it's perfectly acceptable for a full-grown woman to have sex with a sixteen year-old boy. And you imagine a ""smile"" on the face of the abused child after his harrowing ordeal - humiliatingly abducted in a public place, taken to a dingy backstage area, forced to strip naked and sexually service a woman old enough to be, at the very least, his mother's sister? Probably plied with narcotics? I find the whole thing odious and reprehensible, and consider your comment a belwether post for the sad decline of the Afterword blog, once a safe haven for pastry-fanciers and ukelele-botherers. Euro psychedelia was much better musically than the US's west coast version, IMHO. As noted before, barring a few bits where they wig-out properly, I find the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, (etc.) too much like generic bar bands, with insufficiently groove, jazz or gritty noodling for my tastes. Spirit were OK, mind, and Todd Rundgren's psychedelic phase was much more like it. You want hippie wierdness and proper evocations of the psychedelic experience, stick with Gong, Hawkwind, and their offshoots - and Todd's ""A Wizard, A True Star"". Stoned bluegrass music is most definitely isn't. Particularly their poppier moments....PXR5...Astounding Sounds etc.....the Hawklords album, half of which is ace, the other not....the live version of Shot down in the night taken from the Live 79 Tour (i think)...and this, from their mid-to-late period in 1992 I've only knowingly heard two Hawkwind songs in my life. One is the obvious one. The other is Night Of The Hawks. If my memory is not mistaking me, it actually got some airplay on Radio One when it was released as a single. It's pretty primitive stuff. I bloody love it! Been a bit of a fan but not seen them live. They topped the bill that night but had the misfortune of being preceded by a young upstart band from Essex who basically blew them away. Wilko skittering across the extended stage wings, Brilleaux at his growling best. After that, preparing myself for ""sonic attack"" by a load of prog lords didn't seem the best way to spend the rest of the night so repaired tentwards along with many others. too bad you didn't wait around to see them - maybe the weather was a factor. Actually I can't recall if it rained on the Friday. It fair bucketed down on Saturday night during Yes, but they were still amazing. Lou Reed didn't appear, though he was on the bill. Nor sadly did Richard & Linda Thompson. Wishbone Ash were the headliners on Sunday, but couldn't top the magnificent set by Robin Trower. under a copy of the Reading Evening Post about 4 oc'clock in the middle of Caravan and had the weirdest dream through Soft Machine and the Mahvo's. I do recall the Albertos redeeming the evening though. Those were the days when you bagged a spot and stayed there all day. Not like the nomadic musical grazing that is Glasto today.

20820	The digital world is a remarkable place, and not only because of the vast number of diverse voices and opinions it supports. It is a place full of vibrant ideas and communities around them. For example, Reddit can have millions of users and still be a counter-cultural site full of people who can find communities by subscribing to the things they care the most about, now matter how niche the subject matter. It's also a place where smaller contributions from many can empower real action. Kickstarter has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for projects that likely never would have become realities. Similarly, charitable acts have never been closer than a click away. Whether raising money for people in need through crowdfunding platforms, or helping people organize to do service work in the real world, it's never been easier to make a difference for someone you've never met before. But the digital world can also be a crowded place. Things can change, and fast. The state of the industry is that of flux, with things constantly moving forward.

11121	"Welcome to Windows 7 Forums . Our forum is dedicated to helping you find solutions with any problems, errors or issues you are experiencing with Windows 7 . The Windows 7 forum also covers news and updates and has an extensive Windows 7 tutorial section that covers a wide range of tips and tricks. All of a sudden I could not find my sent mails in the Sent Items Folder. I looked for help from the forums and got a suggestion to create another profile to test whether I can see my sent mails there. I followed the instructions but there was not enough to lead me through so I don't think I completed creating a profile. Then I got another suggestion to purchase the Registry Booster to clean up my registry. After I did that I was able to see my sent mails again. However I still continue to see the Outlook Data File Popup with the message ""This data file has not been configured. Select an existing file to configure or try the name of a new file to create"". After I clicked ""OK"" then I got another pop up to prompting me to choose a file from the Libraries.Documents directory. I clicked ""Cancel"" then I got another pop up with ""Properities for this data file must be defined prior to use"". I clicked ""OK"" and then I got the Outlook Data File Popup and the same subsequent popups again. After clicking through I was able to start my Outlook but when use the registry Booster to scan I got more error messages. So apparently these errors from Outlook is mucking up my registry. Anyone has any idea about this problem? Please help. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you. Helen. Firstly, you certainly do not need any registry boosters to solve Outlook data file issues - was this a recommendation made by someone, or was this suggested to you by an automated pop-up? If its the latter, is there any chance you could be infected by some sort of malware? To solve the Outlook issue, do you know where your Outlook data file is being stored? Can you do a search on your computer for all files with this extension: .pst Post back here with your findings. Also, can you tell us about your current system : what anti-virus software are you using. I'm a bit concerned about this Registry Booster : generally speaking, in most cases you really do not need/want to be mucking with the registry at all. Thank you kindly for your help. I'm afraid I have purchased the software online and used it. It found more than 300 errors fromt the registry and fixed it. After that, I was able to see the latest sent mails from the Sent Items folder again. When I checked with Microsoft support I got a pop up about this Registry Booster. They claimed that they are Microsoft Partner. I thought that they are legit. I'm using Norton antivirus, do you think Norton would detect the malware from the registry? When I did a search on PST file, I found the following: For 3 email accounts that have not been active under my original Profile the files are stored under C:\Users\UserName\My Documents\Outlook Files. For the current active email account under the same original Profile, the files are stored under C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsof\\... For the new Profile (I don't think got as far to create a user account yet) that I tried to create for testing purposes, the files are also stored under C:\Users\UserName\My Documents\Outlook Files. Scanpst.exe is installed on your computer when you install Microsoft Outlook 2010. The Inbox Repair tool tries to correct any problems by resetting the data file structure and rebuilding the headers for Outlook items. If you are using an Exchange account, the tool does not connect to or analyze the data saved on the Exchange server. Important You must exit Outlook before using the Inbox Repair tool. It is not accessible within Outlook. In the Enter the name of the file you want to scan box, enter the name of the .pst or .ost file that you want to check, or click Browse to select the file. To specify the scan log options, click Options , and then click the option that you want. Click Start . If errors are found, you are prompted to start the repair process to fix the errors. A backup file is created during the repair process. To change the default name or location of this backup file, in the Enter name of backup file box, enter a new name, or click Browse to select the file that you want to use. Click Repair . Start Outlook with the profile that contains the .pst file that you tried to repair. In the Navigation Pane, click Folder List . Keyboard shortcut To open switch to the Folder List, press CTRL+6. In the Folder List , you might see a folder named Recovered Personal Folders that contains your default Outlook folders or a Lost and Found folder. The recovered folders are usually empty, because this is a rebuilt .pst file. The Lost and Found folder contains the folders and items recovered by the Inbox Repair tool. You can create an Outlook Data File (.pst), and drag the items in the Lost and Found folder into the new data file. When you have finished moving all the items, you can remove the Recovered Personal Folders (.pst) file, including the Lost and Found folder, from your profile. Notes If you are able to open the original Outlook Data File (.pst), you may be able to recover additional items from your damaged .pst file. By default, the Inbox Repair tool creates a file with the same name, but with the file extension of .bak. The .bak file is located in the same folder as your original .pst file. You may be able to recover items from the .bak file that the Inbox Repair tool could not recover. Make a copy of the .bak file, and give the file a new name with a .pst extension, such as bak.pst. Import the bak.pst file, and then move any additional recovered items to the new .pst file that you created. From your description, it doesn't sound malware related so I wouldn't be overly concerned with that. The apparent registry errors are more of a concern. What is the name of this software that you purchased? I concur with Irene : try the repair she suggested. In addition, can you also try to scan for system errors on your PC. To do this, please follow these steps: 1. Click Start Orb, and then type cmd in the search box 2. Right-click on cmd and choose the Run as administrator option 3. This will open up a cmd (DOS) window 4. Type sfc /scannow anf hit enter This will check and attempt to repair any issues with the system files. Let the process finish, and then post the results here. Open Outlook and see if you get the same pop-up message. If you do, please post a screen capture image of the message here. Thank you so much for your kind help. I tried the Scanpst on all the files and it hung a few times but finally manage to complete the repair . However, after the repair , I started Outlook again but still got the same error. I think the error was caused by me creating a new profile but the activity was incomplete so it's still looking for some files. I did go in and delete this profile from Outlook by going into the Control panel, Mail, Show Profile and Remove. Now I only see 1 profile from the Control panel. But when I used the Scanpst and browsed I could see that the outlook files associated with the new profile are still there. So the Remove did not remove everything cleanly. If my assumption is correct, is there anyway I can go in and delete the new profile and all of the related files associated with it so that hopefully I can remove these error messages. I'm concerned that whenever Outlook start up looking for these files it will muck up the Registry. I think that's why I did not see the latest sent mails before and after I ran the REGISTRY BOOSTER it cleaned up the registry and I could see the latest sent mails again. Thank you very much for your suggestion. I just tried Irene's suggestion to run the SCANPST. It took a long time, so I ran out of time and I have to go to work now. I will try your suggestion later on today and report back to you. However, the SCANPST did not remove the error messages. I am almost certain that these have something to do with my creating a new profile but not completing properly. Could you offer some insight? Thank you both for your help with my problem with Outlook. I have continued to receive the same error messages from Outlook 2010 due to the fact that I did not add another Profile correctly. Eventhough I have removed the profle I still continue to receive the error messages every time I started Outlook. These error messages seem to have caused user related errors in the registry which subsequently caused Outlook not to display the latest sent messages in the Sent Folder. When I did the Scanpst before I could still see file from the 2nd profile still there. I think that's why the system keeps complaining and gives me these errors. Is there any way that I can completely clean up the 2nd profile that I did not correctly created? "	Forum	Instruction

16760	"Tender is the Night, by F. Scott Fitzgerald III About a year and a half before, Doctor Dohmler had some vague correspondence with an American gentleman living in Lausanne, a Mr. Devereux Warren, of the Warren family of Chicago. A meeting was arranged and one day Mr. Warren arrived at the clinic with his daughter Nicole, a girl of sixteen. She was obviously not well and the nurse who was with her took her to walk about the grounds while Mr. Warren had his consultation. Warren was a strikingly handsome man looking less than forty. He was a fine American type in every way, tall, broad, well-made -- ""un homme trs chic,"" as Doctor Dohmler described him to Franz. His large gray eyes were sun-veined from rowing on Lake Geneva, and he had that special air about him of having known the best of this world. The conversation was in German, for it developed that he had been educated at Gttingen. He was nervous and obviously very moved by his errand. ""Doctor Dohmler, my daughter isn't right in the head. I've had lots of specialists and nurses for her and she's taken a couple of rest cures but the thing has grown too big for me and I've been strongly recommended to come to you."" ""Very well,"" said Doctor Dohmler. ""Suppose you start at the beginning and tell me everything."" ""There isn't any beginning, at least there isn't any insanity in the family that I know of, on either side. Nicole's mother died when she was eleven and I've sort of been father and mother both to her, with the help of governesses -- father and mother both to her."" He was very moved as he said this. Doctor Dohmler saw that there were tears in the corners of his eyes and noticed for the first time that there was whiskey on his breath. ""As a child she was a darling thing -- everybody was crazy about her, everybody that came in contact with her. She was smart as a whip and happy as the day is long. She liked to read or draw or dance or play the piano -- anything. I used to hear my wife say she was the only one of our children who never cried at night. I've got an older girl, too, and there was a boy that died, but Nicole was -- Nicole was -- Nicole -- "" He broke off and Doctor Dohmler helped him. ""She was a perfectly normal, bright, happy child."" ""Perfectly."" Doctor Dohmler waited. Mr. Warren shook his head, blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at Doctor Dohmler and then at the floor again. ""About eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago or maybe ten -- I try to figure but I can't remember exactly where we were when she began to do funny things -- crazy things. Her sister was the first one to say anything to me about it -- because Nicole was always the same to me,"" he added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being to blame, "" -- the same loving little girl. The first thing was about a valet."" ""Oh, yes,"" said Doctor Dohmler, nodding his venerable head, as if, like Sherlock Holmes, he had expected a valet and only a valet to be introduced at this point. ""I had a valet -- been with me for years -- Swiss, by the way."" He looked up for Doctor Dohmler's patriotic approval. ""And she got some crazy idea about him. She thought he was making up to her -- of course, at the time I believed her and I let him go, but I know now it was all nonsense."" ""What did she claim he had done?"" ""That was the first thing -- the doctors couldn't pin her down. She just looked at them as if they ought to know what he'd done. But she certainly meant he'd made some kind of indecent advances to her -- she didn't leave us in any doubt of that."" ""I see."" ""Of course, I've read about women getting lonesome and thinking there's a man under the bed and all that, but why should Nicole get such an idea? She could have all the young men she wanted. We were in Lake Forest -- that's a summer place near Chicago where we have a place -- and she was out all day playing golf or tennis with boys. And some of them pretty gone on her at that."" All the time Warren was talking to the dried old package of Doctor Dohmler, one section of the latter's mind kept thinking intermittently of Chicago. Once in his youth he could have gone to Chicago as fellow and docent at the university, and perhaps become rich there and owned his own clinic instead of being only a minor shareholder in a clinic. But when he had thought of what he considered his own thin knowledge spread over that whole area, over all those wheat fields, those endless prairies, he had decided against it. But he had read about Chicago in those days, about the great feudal families of Armour, Palmer, Field, Crane, Warren, Swift, and McCormick and many others, and since that time not a few patients had come to him from that stratum of Chicago and New York. ""She got worse,"" continued Warren. ""She had a fit or something -- the things she said got crazier and crazier. Her sister wrote some of them down -- "" He handed a much-folded piece of paper to the doctor. ""Almost always about men going to attack her, men she knew or men on the street -- anybody -- "" He told of their alarm and distress, of the horrors families go through under such circumstances, of the ineffectual efforts they had made in America, finally of the faith in a change of scene that had made him run the submarine blockade and bring his daughter to Switzerland. "" -- on a United States cruiser,"" he specified with a touch of hauteur. ""It was possible for me to arrange that, by a stroke of luck. And, may I add,"" he smiled apologetically, ""that as they say: money is no object."" ""Certainly not,"" agreed Dohmler dryly. He was wondering why and about what the man was lying to him. Or, if he was wrong about that, what was the falsity that pervaded the whole room, the handsome figure in tweeds sprawling in his chair with a sportsman's ease? That was a tragedy out there, in the February day, the young bird with wings crushed somehow, and inside here it was all too thin, thin and wrong. ""I would like -- to talk to her -- a few minutes now,"" said Doctor Dohmler, going into English as if it would bring him closer to Warren. Afterward when Warren had left his daughter and returned to Lausanne, and several days had passed, the doctor and Franz entered upon Nicole's card: * Diagnosis: Divided Personality. Acute and down-hill phase of the illness. The fear of men is a symptom of the illness and is not at all constitutional. . . . The prognosis must be reserved. And then they waited with increasing interest as the days passed for Mr. Warren's promised second visit. It was slow in coming. After a fortnight Doctor Dohmler wrote. Confronted with further silence he committed what was for those days ""une folie,"" and telephoned to the Grand Hotel at Vevey. He learned from Mr. Warren's valet that he was at the moment packing to sail for America. But reminded that the forty francs Swiss for the call would show up on the clinic books, the blood of the Tuileries Guard rose to Doctor Dohmler's aid and Mr. Warren was got to the phone. ""It is -- absolutely necessary -- that you come. Your daughter's health -- all depends. I can take no responsibility."" ""But look here, Doctor, that's just what you're for. I have a hurry call to go home!"" Doctor Dohmler had never yet spoken to any one so far away but he dispatched his ultimatum so firmly into the phone that the agonized American at the other end yielded. Half an hour after this second arrival on the Zurichsee, Warren had broken down, his fine shoulders shaking with awful sobs inside his easy fitting coat, his eyes redder than the very sun on Lake Geneva, and they had the awful story. ""It just happened,"" he said hoarsely. ""I don't know -- I don't know. ""After her mother died when she was little she used to come into my bed every morning, sometimes she'd sleep in my bed. I was sorry for the little thing. Oh, after that, whenever we went places in an automobile or a train we used to hold hands. She used to sing to me. We used to say, 'Now let's not pay any attention to anybody else this afternoon -- let's just have each other -- for this morning you're mine.'"" A broken sarcasm came into his voice. ""People used to say what a wonderful father and daughter we were -- they used to wipe their eyes. We were just like lovers -- and then all at once we were lovers -- and ten minutes after it happened I could have shot myself -- except I guess I'm such a Goddamned degenerate I didn't have the nerve to do it."" ""Then what?"" said Doctor Dohmler, thinking again of Chicago and of a mild pale gentleman with a pince-nez who had looked him over in Zurich thirty years before. ""Did this thing go on?"" ""Oh, no! She almost -- she seemed to freeze up right away. She'd just say, 'Never mind, never mind, Daddy. It doesn't matter. Never mind.'"" ""There were no consequences?"" ""No."" He gave one short convulsive sob and blew his nose several times. ""Except now there're plenty of consequences."" As the story concluded Dohmler sat back in the focal armchair of the middle class and said to himself sharply, ""Peasant!"" -- it was one of the few absolute worldly judgments that he had permitted himself for twenty years. Then he said: ""I would like for you to go to a hotel in Zurich and spend the night and come see me in the morning."" "	Prose/Lyrical	Prose/Lyrical
26363	"Fitting A Saddle Fitting a saddle is one of the rider's most basic concerns, and there are many important criteria to meet regarding the horse's comfort, the rider's position, and the optimal transmission of aiding between the rider and the horse. Fitting a saddle: The relevance of the tree All horses have the same basic width of spinal column and angle of spine in relation to the horizontal. The height and shape of the wither, and the proportions of the ribcage vary quite dramatically between breeds of horse, but they still tend to fall into three basic types. Ideally the tree of your saddle will mirror this basic spinal pattern so that the saddle sits in balance. This means that the entire panel surface is in contact with the horses back, distributing the weight evenly, and avoiding pressure points, rocking or bridging: Rocking is when the tree shape is incorrect i.e the angle curves too much, like a banana, and the whole saddle rocks back and forth with the horse's movement. Bridging is also when the tree shape is incorrect, but this time the angle doesn't curve enough and the saddle only contacts the horse's back at the back and the front of the panels. These places are then taking all the weight, and are likely to cause discomfort and pain due to the pressure points. Interestingly, the vast majority of saddles are built on the same mass-produced tree. This tree is not shaped to the horse's spinal column, due to short-cuts taken in the manufacturing process, and a basic lack of understanding of the shape of the horse's back by saddlers (who are usually not riders themselves). It is held together with metal struts and features recessed stirrup bars. Stirrup bars are designed like this for the comfort of the rider, but for the horse they invariably become pressure points, and often horses have hardened lumps and even white hairs on the corresponding place on their back. When fitting a saddle, we feel that it is important for the it to have a tree that provides a consistent weight-bearing structure, so the weight of the rider is distributed evenly. We know that for the horse's spine, the tree structure is crucial, it can't be improved with different panel types or padding. Like the tale of the princess and the pea , an incorrect tree shape will always impinge on the horse sooner or later. We have had the good fortune to discover a little-known design of saddle that addresses beautifully the above issues of fitting a saddle. Strada saddles (above) have a tree made with carbon fibre and wood and they are designed to fit the universal spinal shape of the horse. They are made in different widths i.e the panel angle alters to accommodate the different types of horse, and they fit all horses with reasonably healthy musculature like a glove. These saddles also have panels made of thermo-reactive memory foam so that although they mould themselves to the individual horse's back, they return to their original shape after use, unlike wool-filled panels which invariably take on the unevenness of the horse's back over time. Positioning the Saddle Once you've understood what your looking for when fitting a saddle, you also need to consider where you are actually placing it on the horse's back. When you place your saddle on the horses back and slide it back, to find the right place, the main thing to be aware of is the position of the scapula in relation to the saddle. When a horse moves his leg forward, the scapula rolls back, and if there is a saddle in the way, eventually the cartilage of the shoulder joint will be damaged. To feel this, cup your hand over the top edge of the scapula and get someone to lift the horse's leg out - you will feel how it comes back. For this reason the saddle must be placed so that the scapula is visible and you can watch it moving back and forth unrestricted. Horses with the saddle on their shoulder like in this photograph, will start to shorten their stride in front to try and avoid the friction. We find that in general saddles very often come forward against the shoulder during work, even if they are placed correctly to begin with. Go to Using a crupper to keep the saddle in place for more on this. Putting the saddle on Keeping your horse happy with his saddle can be quite a challenge. If he has had a damaging saddle previously in his life he will anticipate that he is going to be hurt again, and even if you have subsequently taken care correctly fitting a saddle, it can be difficult to convince him otherwise. Always put it on as gently as you can and do the girth up very gradually. If you are putting it on a young horse get him used to the saddle-cloth first, and don't do everything in one day. It's better to assume that he need's more time than go by a lack of reaction. Watch his eye and see if he is accepting the process or tuning out. Young horses tune out easily and it can be difficult to see it happening. The saddle-cloth one day, then the saddle-cloth and saddle without girth the next, then the saddle-cloth, saddle and the girth the next again is a good speed of progression. You, or someone else is going to be putting the saddle on thousands of times throughout the horse's life. There is very little advantage in rushing the process and ending up with a difficult horse later on.

2232	"Search Read Ownership ain't what it used to be I recently signed up for Spotify , a music service that allows you to find, and listen to, whole tracks and albums. It's less social than LastFM, say, but more focused around the specific music you want - whereas LastFM uses the artist you like as a springboard for finding other artists, Spotify uses it just to give you that artist's music. It brought back to me some considerations I'd had about the nature of ownership. My generation will have a distinctly different concept of ownership to that of my daughter's generation. For my generation you partly constructed your identity around what you owned - your bookshelf, record collection and DVD archive were important aspects of who you were (as anyone who has read Nick Hornby's High Fidelity will appreciate). But for the digital generation this strong link with ownership has been broken. It took time and money to build up any of those collections. Therefore they demonstrated a commitment which was worth exhibiting. In a digital world this effort is greatly reduced, and as a result so is the emotional attachment one feels towards them. How often would people say that their book collection or record collection would be the things they would want to save from a burning house? This simply doesn't apply anymore - you can just download again (iTunes keeps a record of what you've purchased or you just download ahem, free, versions from BitTorrent). But even more than this, the need to own anything is reduced. Imagine a service like Spotify greatly increased so you could find any artist, and with mobile devices, get access anywhere. Why do I need to own any of these tracks then? I can get them whenever I want, and isn't that the point of ownership, to have access under your control? Obviously there are some things you still need to own (clothes, cars, phones, etc), but if so many previously coveted items move to cloud services, what will the next generation cherish? I think the answer is evident already in where they spend their time - it's in their identity. This was one of the functions of owning these items in the first place after all. For the digital generation things that cannot be easily duplicated will be important - this will be the MySpace or Facebook page they have generated over a long time, the network they have created. These represent the 'things I'd save from a fire' in an online world. Comments Hey Martin, I agree with all this - but in addition to representing your identity these modern-day assets are cherished because they are also just really useful in your everyday life. I guess it comes down to what is irreplaceable these days - and it's not virtual objects themselves, but the record of their locations: bookmarks, addresses, file locations, contact info. If you don't know where they are, you have really lost them. ( Or at the very least you're looking at a lot of googling to find them again ) So, if the Facebook servers burned down, and you could google to retrieve one thing, what would it be for ? : ) Hi Matt, I couldn't give a toss if the FB servers burned down - what I would miss most in an internet fire would be a) this blog and b) the network I have established in Twitter. The former because I would never get back all the content I have put in on here, the latter because my network has built up over 18 months or so. As you say, both of these are about identity, but also, really useful - indeed essential probably for my professional life. Doc, Yep, it's a virtual world alright, but i don't see the impending cloud culture a bad thing. Yes, having a tactile history at hand is reassuring and often a reminder of who we were, are and wish we'd been - though i do see such items/possessions a little like a safety blanket - fuufy if you will - and maybe this and later generations will be liberated from the shackles of ownership. Perhaps my sons will have to affirm their identity through their actions and general character more than I. Of course this is wishful thinking - both are submerged into fake video (do we say Video now?) worlds - and don't fully appreciate how to covet their belongings. Blimey, Jenkins and Burton both make it to my blog after 4 years. I don't think it's a bad thing either - but it is a fundamental change in how we relate to stuff and how we express our identity. Also a lot of businesses are still going on the ownership model (cf Zavvi) - it ain't a horse worth betting on. Now get back to work. I definitely feel ""ownership"" of my blog, as you said in the comment above--which is why when Blogger recently (finally) added an export feature, you can bet that I immediately backed up my four years of blogging in, like, three different places!:D Is there a stronger culture of identity though ownership ( clothing, labels, sports shoes, phone brands, jewellery/bling) among cultures who fall on the wrong side of the digital divide, or are otherwise digitally disadvantaged*. I wonder if forward-thinking archaeologists are really displeased with this trend? The reason I wonder about this is because archaeologists painstakingly construct our understanding of the past through the artifacts we've left behind. In an increasingly digital society built on storage technology that is not expected to survive more than 20 or 30 years, what will be left of our music, our literature, our art, and our science? What will our descendants in a thousand years be able to say about our lives? "	Opinion/Argumentation	Promotion
45401	"Marketing plan - how to write Adopting a customer focused business ethos is a proven method to increase the chances of a sustainable and profitable future. The marketing planning process is at the heart of any truly marketing orientated company, and ensures the customer is at the centre of key decisions. The plan is a detailed written document which can be used to promote a single product of form the annual business strategy. Marketing-made-simple.com has split the marketing plan into three steps which are easy to follow and relevant to both small and large businesses. The marketing plan should provide direction for all relevant members of the organization and should be referred to and updated throughout the year. The main purpose of the marketing plan is to provide a structured approach that ensures the marketing manager considers all the relevant elements of the planning process which could otherwise be missed if a more rushed approach is adopted. Stage 1: Research & planning This section includes the following: Statement of your current situation and scope of the plan Research into potential / current customers Examining the marketing environment Identifying opportunities for growth Current business situation Summarise where you are at the moment, possible items include: Financial results Sale figures and trends Market share Customer satisfaction Level of repeat business The marketing environment Examining both the internal and external marketing environments can identify both opportunities and threats to the business and is a core component of the plan. The whole area is usually broken down into the macro, micro and internal environments as summarised in the diagram below. The macro-environment A commonly used method of quantifying the macro external environment is with a PEST analysis. PEST is an acronym which divides the macro-environment into four areas -- Political, Economic, Social, and Technological, examples of which are shown below. Political environmental factors Trading agreements Tax rules Employment regulation Environmental legislation Legal issues Economic environmental factors Recession Interest rates Exchange rates Rate of inflation Population wealth Growth of the housing market Social environmental factors 'Green' behaviour Eating habits Shifts in attitude Population demographics Attitudes to career Technological environmental factors Emergence of new communications channels Improved production processes Advances in computing and the internet New technologies such as electric vehicles Automation Reduced cost of materials Micro-environment The micro-environment includes factors which are still not directly under the control of the company, but more directly relevant to strategy such as consumer trends, stakeholders, suppliers and competitors. Some example items are listed below. Summary of your market segment Market growth, trends and competition Potential new markets Direction from shareholders Supplier costs and service quality Changes is consumer behaviour Understanding your customers and market Ensuring a thorough knowledge of the consumer is vital for successful marketing planning. Use the primary and secondary (first and second hand) market research information at your disposal to describe your customer. The more accurate your picture of your consumer, the better you'll be able to design products which cater for their needs and the easier it will be to communicate with them. If you have a broad customer base, you might need to split your customers into groups (segmentation). Understanding your competitors Internal environment The internal marketing environment includes factors that the business can directly influence. This can include: The organisational structure The strengths and weaknesses of a department Financial stability and resources Staff morale Spare production capacity Client base Pricing structure Selling channels Staff skills Identifying opportunities in the marketing environment Once you have completed the internal and external environmental audit, you can summarise your findings using a SWOT analysis which can be used to make key decisions. SWOT analysis A ' SWO T analysis' is a useful way of summarizing the results of the environmental audit and presenting the current status of a business. SWOT simply stands for the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats which have emerged from examining the macro, micro and internal marketing environments. For example, here is a SWOT analysis for a fictional electric car manufacturer Strengths Our electric motors are cheap to produce and maintenance free Charge time is class leading Production capacity can be increased R&D department is class leading Weaknesses Batteries are heavy, slow to charge and provide limited mileage Dealer network is small Customer trust in the segment is low Market is highly competitive Opportunities Government grants are available Road tax breaks for electric cars Market is growing rapidly Battery technology is evolving Threats Tesla has secured a large government grant The big players are investing heavily Hybrid and diesel technology is evolving fast Stage 2: Marketing strategy This section includes the following elements: Development of mission statement Statement of objectives Strategy and tactics to accomplish the objectives Mission statement Your mission statement is a formal commitment and focus for the business. It should explain to customers concisely what the nature of your business is and where you are going, and also provide a motivational tool for employees. It should be aspirational, something to strive for, yet obtainable and relevant. Once this has been defined it should form the focus for your business strategy. Vision statement A vision statement is a more long term, ideal-world statement which outlines where you would like to take the business in the long run. Objectives Combined with the mission statement, your objectives should be the key statements that drive your business. The most successful goals follow the SMART acronym. Specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound. What do you want to achieve by the end of this year? Where do you want to be in one, five, ten years? Objectives must be quantitative in order to accurately measure success. For example, 'sell 600 units in the next year' or 'increase customer retention by 20%'. Selecting a suitable strategy Selecting a strategy for growth - the Ansoff Matrix Most businesses need to grow, and the Ansoff Matrix (below) is a method of determining the best course of action if growth is your priority. Product development Creating a range of similar products, for example shaving foam if you are already manufacturing razors Diversification Developing a new product for a completely new market Example tactics: Market research Product research and development Selecting a pricing strategy Once you have determined the product and market you want to be in, the next problem will be setting a price. Porter's model discusses three strategies for competitive advantage based on price. Three generic strategies for competitive advantage - Porter's model Cost leadership: A good quality product at a lower price than the competitors Differential strategy: A product or service which is perceived as unique within a particular market Focus strategy: Delivering focused attention to a particular segment to deliver service which competitors cannot compete Determining which products to invest in If you have a product range it is likely that some will do better than others. The Boston Consultancy Group matrix is a method of determining which to invest in, and which to drop, shown below. High market share Low market share High market growth Stars Question marks Low market growth Cash cows Dogs Stars High growth products with a strong market presence. Probably need high investment to maintain position. Cash cows Low growth products with a high market share. Probably don't need much investment, but require management to maintain profitability. Question marks Products which have potential, but may require investment to yield decent profits. Dogs Rarely worth investing in, dogs should at least break even to be retained. Tactics - the marketing mix The marketing mix is a selection of customer focused business elements which work together as a toolkit to market your product or service. The tactical section of a marketing plan summarises how you intend to use each element of the marketing mix, which can be summarised in seven 'Ps' as shown in the illustration below. Product Product refers to the items you are selling or the service you are providing. Your product based tactics link back to your overall strategy - if your strategy is market penetration (see the Ansoff matrix), then there may be little need to do anything to the product. However if you have chosen product development or diversification, then a certain amount of research and development, and product design will be needed. Price Comparable pricing -- if you are not the market leader, competitors will have set a price expectation which can be followed Market penetration strategy -- deliberately low pricing in order to enter or control a market quickly. Place Place refers to the method of getting your product to the consumer - this could be a dealership or an online shop. How will you attract more retailers to sell your product? How will you maintain a premium appearance? How will your distribution network function? How many countries should you operate in? Promotion Promotion is much more than just advertising - this is the discipline of marketing communications. What is your branding strategy? Which promotional channels will you use? How will you divide up the budget? Will billboards work better than TV ads? What should be the discount for special offers? How will you generate positive PR? Should you out-source the creative work? Physical evidence This element of the marketing mix is mostly used to promote services. If you're not selling anything tangible, how will people know what they're getting? This is where physical evidence comes in. Examples of physical evidence include a brochure for a holiday tour, customer testimonials for a dentist, or a portfolio for a website design company. Segmentation, targeting & positioning When using the marketing mix, it is important to keep in mind the three generic stages of marketing - segmentation, targeting and positioning. Segmentation is the detailed breakdown of your customers into as much detail as practical, targeting then ensures all elements of the mix are tailored to your identified consumer group. Positioning the process of ensuring potential and current customers perceive your company in the way you would like them to. Stage 3: Actions, measurement and controls How will you monitor progress? Who will do which jobs? When will each element be completed? How will you adjust the plan? What will be the budget? This section discusses action plans, controls, measurements and reporting. Actions Developing an action plan An action plan is core to the marketing process -- a constantly evolving document which is cascaded to the relevant people and monitored regularly. Most action plans are relatively short term documents which focus on the coming year, but longer term implications should also be considered. Action planning is a stages approach: Clarify goals, and ensure they are SMART Link back to your objectives and tactics Set criteria for success Prioritize Set timings Determine who will complete each action point Monitor the progress of the plan and review regularly An example action plan is shown below Measurements, controls and reporting The final stage of the action plan is the implementation of measurements and controls and reporting results. Many models for monitoring the performance of businesses have emerged, many of which address the needs of key stakeholders and allow them to evaluate the overall success of a company. The balanced scorecard approach for monitoring company performance The balanced scorecard approach is a widely used method of monitoring overall performance and ensuring daily work is focused on the strategic objectives. The scorecard is a ""strategic planning and management system...which is used to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals"". This approach encourages open communication throughout the business and allows tracking of performance throughout the year. Reference: http://www.balancedscorecard.org Traditionally, businesses have tracked success based on just one measure -- financial results. However the scorecard system views the business from four external perspectives to gain a more relevant approach to performance metrics. Learning & growth -- how you are innovating and improving to meet your goals Business process -- how critical processes are measuring up Customer perspective -- usually measured in terms of time, quality, performance and cost Financial perspective -- financial performance from the stakeholder point of view Each element is tracked using four items which are listed individually: Objectives - as identified in stage 2 of the marketing planning process Measures - how will success be measured? Targets - specific quantifiable targets Initiatives - how to make the targets more readily achievable Key performance indicators ( KPI s) Depending on your industry, you may also have certain specific metrics which determine success, these could include: Market share analysis Sales analysis Quality control Financial results Market research Marketing information systems CRM - New customers acquired, retention Service levels Brand awareness Competitor performance Benchmarking Profitability Gap analysis Gap analysis is another useful tool which answers two questions: Where are you? Where do you want to be? It can be useful to identify where you are with the following facets of the business: Organisation Business direction and marketing mix Business processes Information technology Requirements vs capability Market potential vs existing usage Your business vs competition Feedback Now that you have an accurate picture about the success of your plan it's important to feedback this information in order to fine tune the strategy and update the courses of action accordingly. Final words The marketing planning process is a comprehensive method for examining your business, your market and the environment in order to develop a strategy to exploit opportunities. It is a vital process which should be used by almost every company to ensure a profitable and sustainable future. "	Instruction	Information/Explanation

Doing a good job, being reliable. What exactly do you mean. I don't think I have every come across what you are inferring. I must admit to being a bit shocked in moving to a city which is dominated by a particular industry, which is itself male-dominated. I know a lot of jobs are allocated on the basis of who you know, not what you know, but they actually turn down decent employees here on the basis that they will show up their cronies. Happens again and again. And its not my field, so I have no vested interest. Depends. I think that especially in the public sector this can be an issue. Can be very cliquey. Most promotions are not based on merit IME but through preventing people access to all relevant information resulting in them not having a chance ... What is going on in the Department of Transport is scandalous IMO, it is not the ordinary civil servants carrying out the work, it is the top who is at fault. The underlings only do what the top wants (or what they think the top wants), otherwise they will be out during the next reorganisation (tend to be many in the Civil Service). So it is the top they should get rid off, small chance of that happening, it is rather blame the messenger as usual. That's why nothing will really change/improve. Just power games. That's why I held out when I was made redundant and did some temping until my perfect dynamic, all-working-for-the-same-thing, no bullshit owner and employees small-but-rapidly growing company job came along. I love it. Never worked harder, but never felt more of a round peg in a round hole. I loathed the dead men's shoes, hidden agenda, greasy pole mentality of other places I have worked. Not all large companies, either. And the acceptance of mediocrity. Bleugh. A good manager recognises that everyone has something valuable to give and finds a way to enable them to give it. Poor management looks after friends. I have experienced both and like to think I am the former. Hard to know what you should do on so little information but please don't think there is anything wrong with being the shy one. An effective team has a mix of people, not all loud or all shy, but it takes a good manager to make the most of that team. Quiet and brilliant is fantastic! Well, if you happen to be in the Civil Service, then you have to lick arse ... It is not about doing the best job you can, it is not about being truthful, factual, integrity. It is about finding out what your superiors want and giving them that bending the information to suit their view even if totally incorrect. And of course, always be very nice to your superiors and try not to be too nice to the people underneath you as this may be seen as weak. You can earn a lot, a lot money this way plus a good pension, but it does involve selling your soul. Teaching won't pay me enough. I love what I do but for the lack of recognition. Just today saw a colleague (an utter twat) get promoted over me. I am better at everything. Except that I am not in the in crowd. Sometimes, if there is an opportunity you have to move upwards and outwards rather than staying in the same place for too long and getting stuck there. You can then move back in at a more senior level. I think teaching is quite well paid these days (have just started my 9th year) but I am amused by the concept that it is free from all the things described in this thread. Come to my school and see the politics in action! Doesn't teaching have any of these issues? The NHS certainly does Survival strategies? Well, remember it's only work and make sure you have a life outside. If you can't change it, try to figure out if it's likely to change within a time frame you can cope with, maybe through restructuring - this happens in the NHS all the time, sometimes for the better in terms of the management environment and sometimes not. If not, plan an escape strategy to something better. Above all remember there is nothing intrinsically wrong with being the quiet brilliant one 'A good manager recognises that everyone has something valuable to give and finds a way to enable them to give it. ' Yes. yes. I also think many managers forget to do the basic stuff; saying positive things; giving bad news face to face; all the simple good manners. They treat their employees as they would not treat even the most distant member of their family, and then wonder why relationships with and between the people they spend all day with are shite. One woman in our team is an absolute workhorse; a colleague and teamworker par excellence (sorry, i believe in teamwork). But she doesn't take any shit, our manager is scared of her and now avoids giving her any positive feedback. She is going to walk out of our team on maternity leave, we are going to struggle so much without her, and she is not even going to look back Yy public sector, crappy people getting promoted, and then when they're not surprisingly crappy n the new job, moved into another new job, until eventually a super fancy job is created with big money and no actual responsibilities so they can't do any more damage. Because you can't actually sack them, can you. I also don't think teamwork involves carrying people weaker than you necessarily. It's about pulling together, accepting differences and enjoying commonality, and doing your level best and working with integrity and decency. Can you tell I like my job and feel privileged to have my colleagues and managers? Silibilimili, you say teaching wont pay you enough. I dont actually know what ordinary teachers get paid,,but they are not on strike,so I sort of assume they are getting a decentish wage. Which begs the question,and I dont mean to be rude,but why do you need to earn more than what I assume is a pretty average salary for the country. Do you have large overheads? Do you need to work in a work environment,that probably means you earn more,which probably means the people working there are more competitive,which probably means it feels like some of them would sell their granny? Actually this post is coming across to me as a bit harsh,and for all I know could be complete rubbish.But I cant be bothered to redo it,so hope you do not take offence. That's the thing sili; and the bad people know it. The world is full of brilliant people who do not get promoted. It's not enough to do your job well, even brilliantly. You have to put other people down, compare their work unfavourably to yours and kiss ass, even publicly, shamefully. amillionyears - I expenct that Silibilimili is actually working hard, good at her job and wants some recognition for a change. Rather than seeing not very clever and possibly someone not really pulling his weight being promoted above her. amillion , your post is good. Don't worry. It's not even the money. By should I give up something I love because of these people? There has to be some tricks of the trade in can learn to 'play the game' and not compromise my morals/integrity? I am waiting to see what Silibilimili says,but now that my kids are older,one of the first things we look at when they apply for jobs,is the ethos of the company. If we dont like the look of it,we dont apply. obviously now that the op is working there,not such an easy situation. Also,to me,what we do or dont do in life,is a series of priorities. To me,work culture is quite a high priority,so if Sili doesnt like it there,she needs to look around for companies that would hopefully appreciate her. I don't know ""a million years"". Go in, get there on time, don't rock the boat, be nice to people, be honest, don't shaft anyone, protect colleagues when necessary, follow procedure where necessary, bend procedure where one can. Agree generally and if things need changing do it incrementally, trying to get people on side first. amillion , I did not realise the culture is like this before I joined. All was well for a whole while. Things started going belly up when i did not want to do the 12hr days to meet deadlines for nothing jn return etc. it's hard to choose an 'ethical' company. How do you know what the culture is like?! Months on end for nothing on end is harsh. Was that in your contract? Did the financially reward you properly for that? Standing outside. a.what is the dress code,important if you end up having an interview there. b.if you stand outside in the morning,do the workers arrive on time? c.do they look happy do be there? d.are they sloppily dressed. e.what sort of people are they? f.do their cars look like yours at all. g.very importantly,do they look as if you will fit with them h.if it is the evening,how do they look now? i.even go into the building casualy for a brief look round.How does it feel.What is the receptionist like. j.do you want to work on an industrial estate etc k.what is the transport system like there All this helps to give a glimpse of what the company is actually like and whether you think you may enjoy working there. I understand what you mean but in my experience those who claimed about cliques and conspiracies and agendas and corruption were paranoid dick heads. I spend 10 years working with someone who complained that the reason she wasn't being promoted was because her ideas were too 'forward thinking' or too 'out there'. She was being held back because people were threatened. She was a knob. People loathed her. There are two reasons you are not getting on at work. One is the place is corrupt and full of cronies, the other is you are the problem It's not you silibili, in the sense of you are crap, you are no good. It's you in the sense of, you do not blow your own trumpet enough and are too nice to the people below you and not creepy enough to the people above. It's ludicrous to sggest this is paranoid. It's the way it is! Yes agree with zoomeister: stop expecting people at work to be your friends and to like you. Locate someone above you who is clearly headed for higher things. Latch on to them; suck up to them. You might think it's cringingly obvious. Not to them. Hang on to their coat tails, for a start. Diss your colleagues to them if necessary but in a subtle way, back-handed compliments for example. Never bitch outright; don't smile too much; be very cool; never apologise. Sili: i'm like you but towards the end of my career, which has been fine, reasonable, decent pay so I haven't minded. But because i don't mind so much personally (which let's be honest really can cloud things) I have a very clear view of what happens in my workplace and in the other offices linked to it. I would say it's got about ten per cent to do with how good you are at your job. That's it. I think you would either have to change, or make yourself content with the way things are. Change or make myself content. I know. So hard. I don't think I can do either. As for slating off colleagues, not in my nature. It makes you look bad in the long run. I am not saying I am perfect. However, I see incompetent people going waaaay above and think, 'it's not fair!!' I recent went from being a contractor to staff so here is what the problem is. To put up with all the work politics. But just made me wonder, I can't be alone. There must be 'good' people out there that cope somehow. Or even get to the top. How? That's all. Maybe it's time I went back to earning money again than having a career. The apparently good people who get to the top have ALL had their moments of ruthlessness behind the scenes. The truly good get half way there, director rather than VP, sidelined into a nice job in training and so on. But slating off colleagues YES it looks bad if you are bitchy. It's not about being bitchy. It's positioning yourself above them in conversation and appraisals, explaining how you helped them achieve something when they couldn't do it, making sure you get the credit, ""helpfully"" suggesting to someone they need training in an area because they'd then be really good at it. You don't have to lie. Bosses want people who can be like them ie hard. I have worked for people who haven't been ruthless or evil. Ok so they were truly genious or minor royalty, but have been fairly decent human beings. These were old school boys (very few women - who did tend to be unpleasant) though. The new generation tend to be slimeballs whod sell their own granny for a profit. I think for women it's a sexism thing - women have to be better, harder, faster, stronger to get the same job as a man. They have to PROVE they aren't going to melt. It's unfair. The old school boys could afford to be nice - they had a job whatever they did,and f they fucked up one of Dad's friends in the foreigno office would find a little spot fo rhim. Or her. such an interesting and enlightening thread.I have been sat all morning thinking about work problems and getting stressed. like everyone I have watched others bitch,kiss ass and then get promoted when they are generally lazy or not great at their jobs and have been frustrated that my hard work and achievements has never seemed to get me anywhere. this thread helps me to accept that this is business and I must either choose to be like others and move to the top or just do enough to ensure my working day is as stress free as poss so I can enjoy time out of work I may be broke in the meantime but hey one day I will run my own business where things are different. .s.if there are any business owners out there who require hard working and extremely capable employees who will fit into their ethical, honest and truly rewarding team environment please pm me! It should be a lesson really - we've all thought ""how can Boss X not SEE how much of a suck-up employee Y is being. It's so fake!"" Because they can't. They're on the receiving end and they are also playing the game. It depends on the culture of the office. I have known unqualified secretaries scamper up the greasy pole very very quickly (very naively I thought it was because she must have been talented ans well-liked). When she left all the men talked about how she wanted to sleep with them all - then I was told that she was having an affair with the boss. She was very self promoting 'look at meeee, I'm fabulous!!' Very self confident but didn't have a tufty really. Emperors new clothes syndrome! Most places I have work have had a bad reputation in the industry for being really horrible places to work. One place had a reputation for being great and I loved it - there was such a lack of politics! I go into quite a few organisations as part of my job and it's amazing the variety of business cultures that exist. Few I would want to be part of too. For me slef employment or small business works best. front , I have seen that too here. It's natures way. It's a part of office life. The sexual tensions, prettier women doing better than the uglier ones, the taller men doing better than the shorter ones. That's Darwinian theory. I just need to be more thick skinned and less sensitive, more controlled I suppose. It is going to be tricky? Any women out there who are emotional and are doing well in their careers? This thread has indeed been insightful for me too. Thank you all for the contribution. I tend to think that those who deny it have done it ..so they see others as whingers and moaners rather than ""actors"". The thinking goes, well I did it, why can't you instead of moaning on. And I've been promoted, so I can't possibly be incompetent or a bad manager. It's a mindset, and you have to buy it! By whinging and moaning, quite frankly I don't blame you, I've done it myself, but it doesn't buy you promotion. It basically says ""I am unhappy but impotent"". That's not the impression you want to give. And by those who deny it, i mean those people who say, this does not happen, you are paranoid. Yes, it does, it's almost universal, and you are not paranoic. People who say that have climbed the greasy pole or are doing it and will see others as weak, impotent, whingers and so on. There's nothing wrong with constructive criticism - noticing that something isn't working and suggesting an improvement or a better way of working. But some people - and I am not suggesting that this is you btw, I don't know you - really do just moan. About everything. Even the stuff that clearly can't be changed. Even the stuff that everyone else manages perfectly well with. They are often the same ones who won't work 5mins overtime, with a 'they don't do anything for me, so why should I do anything for them' attitude. They are often also heard complaining about colleagues in a bitter way. Who is going to promote someone like that, someone that they essentially don't like and don't want to spend more time working with than they absolutely have to? There's usually a pool of people to choose from, and enthusiastic competence wins every time. ade , agree. I have all the good qualities you mention. Enthusiastic, technically competent, moaner but do try and change or influence things, which makes me quiet and direct and do not suck up. So do tend to piss people off by my great 'communication' skills. How do I get out of this quandary or my predicament. Surely it's the work that matters and not the other bullshit surely. Who would you rather have in your team at the end of the day? Someone hi gets the job done or someone who agrees with everything you say and does mediocre? I certainly wouldn't want someone who agreed with everything I said, but someone who gets the job done with a smile on their face and doesn't rattle the feathers of their colleagues unnecessarily. There are two words that you have used to describe yourself on this thread that would concern me - 'emotional' and 'direct'. IME people who describe themselves in this way can often come across as a little self absorbed, maybe rude (and you may not be like that at all, have just heard colleagues describing themselves as 'direct' and I've thought 'no, you are tactless and a bit rude'). I think it sounds like your communication skills are your issue, perhaps make a big effort for a few months and see where it gets you. If you genuinely don't think that you are doing anything wrong at all, go and see your line manager and make it clear that you are looking for extra responsibilities/promotion, and ask what you need to do to make that happen. It depends what organization and what industry. Its certainly true that a lot of ""desirable"" industries (journalism, investment banking, advertising, charity sector, civil service) are riddled with cronyism and basically its hard to get in without contacts and impossible past a certain point without a large degree of arse-licking. But in all honesty I don't think Britain is worse than most places. A good friend of mine emigrated to Italy and then moved back because she had totally lost faith in the possibility that her children would ever get good jobs because they weren't Italian/didn't have right family connections. Britain isn't the meritocracy it likes to think it is but anecdotally I think a lot of the ""latin"" economies are far, far worse. I don't think all industries are like this though. Definetely do something. My Dad is a lovely man but spent 30 + years in an office that was back stabbing and very political - he was a work horse but found himself blamed for other mistakes. He was made reduant 55 + and is now a very bitter person. Having said that he has the opposite of charm - he makes the most innocent remarks and people take offense its not obvious why. My first work place was like this as well - I did the bare minimum amount of time and left for somewhere better and got more money with it. ques agree and can relate to all that you say. However, I thought we were meritocratic. We definitely are not. That's what I can't get my wad around. And comparing to the worst of the lot and feeling good is not really what I want to do either. Another problem is that none of us really know what other people think of us and that can vary from person to person. Eg you think I am direct someone else thinks I am rude. I work ith someone who thinks she is really hard working; I think she is a lazy cow who spends too much time making everything into a drama instead of just getting on with it. But who is right? You say you are emotional.What sorts of things have you got emotional at work about,that maybe other work colleagues didnt get emotional over? What changes have you suggested be implemented that have not been taken up. I think you said you moan.Have fellow colleagues commented on this. Are you British? Have you worked abroad and are now working in the UK,and have suggested your work place does some things that you have gleaned from working overseas. What age are you? Dont answer any if this if you dont want to. Might they think you may want to start a family soon,so are possibly discriminating against you. Do you meet up with them socially at all. Do you say to them from time to time that you feel like leaving? ooh,coming across as arrogant and unapproachable. If that is what people see and think,even though it is not true,that is not going to help you at all. I you said you didnt want to change character. It sounds like you need to change the public perception of yourself so they can understand and see the real you. The classic book for this thread is ""How to win friends and influence people"". I havent read all of it,but I think you would find it useful if you havent read it already. "	Forum	Instruction
38255	"Facebook Friends Reviews from Your Friends 32 reviews in English Review from Laura P. Shout out to the excellent staff at Swartz Bay!  We heard that the waits could be interminable so we got in line 1.5 hours before our ferry.  We somehow forgot to unplug our GPS and ipod so right before our ferry started boarding, our lovely, trusty hybrid engine was no go.  Bummer was we obviously didn't need the GPS and the ipod wasn't even being used.   It kind of hurt to see our ferry leave the dock without us. Hubby ran back to the toll booth to let them know we'd need a jump, but secretly I thought it would be a no go due to the hybrid.  Sure enough, minutes later BC Ferries arrived to assist.  Right away I asked if they'd be able to jump the hybrid and they couldn't.  I'm not blaming them in any way whatsoever.  They had a handy card at the ready explaining that they can't be liable for hybrid jump starts.  Sounds like in the past, major electrical damage has been done to hybrid cars due to an improper jump. BC Ferries gave us the number to a local CAAA (AAA to US users) and we got our jump in time for the next ferry.  While we got our jump, another BC Ferry staff member came out to check on us.  He reassured us that this has happened numerous times to Honda and Toyota hybrids.  I chatted with him later outside the terminal during our wait for the second ferry.  Sounds like other people have drained their battery just by watching dvds while plugged in.  This somehow causing the hybrid battery great problems. Since we were totally weirded out by the experience, we hung out in lane 13 next to all the big rigs.  We didn't want our car not to start a second time and didn't want to be in the way again if there was failure.   The staff was completely understanding and reassuring during this glitch. Thanks BC Ferries!  The amenities on board rock.  I'm sad that I didn't partake of the buffet but glad that the view from the cafeteria's eating area was better than the buffet (forward vs aft).  The sundeck was an amazing place to catch the views. Review from Brian W. It's funny that we can review public services, hmm like anyone has a choice to come on a Ferry.  Why I love them - well they let me get all over our amazing islands, and happens I will be getting on one in 48 hours for the Sunshine coast.  Not many places in the world offer the consistent, classy, working, on time, nice staff, roomy and safe ride our Ferries do.  If it wasn't for them, nobody would live on Gambier? etc, lol....  My buddies will be scarfing back whitespot and we can all get some sunshine and wind on the decks.  The massive humm of the engines is easy to sleep outside to.  I have been on boats on Thailand where we get lost and the captain jumps off and swims to shore, boats in Mexico with waves nearly capsizing us.  Most excitement you get on a Ferry is the horn to goto your Car, that's right most these beasts allow you to friggin drive right on and off. ""'And then, we get on the ferry and they made us sit there, for 40 minutes. We had to sit there.' Oh? Really? What happened next? Did you sail through the sea in your car, incredibly, like a whale? Did you partake in the miracle of human sailing, you non-contributing zero?""  ""People, like, they say there's delays on ferry's. Delays? Really? Vancouver to Victoria in 2 hours. That used to take 30 years. Plus, you would die on the way there."" Review from Robin M. It's a ship, people. A ship. You get to ride on a ship on the ocean. This blows my mind in itself, but then add a gift shop, a classy restaurant, a kid's play area, a White Spot, TVs (wut! I don't even have one of those at home! No, for real. I don't), clean bathrooms (may I remind you that we are on a BOAT) and some workstations for us laptop-tech-types, and holy hell -- we have ourselves a winning experience. Offering some of the best views in the entire world for a fraction of the price of a cruise, BC Ferries is a luxurious experience disguised as a public service. Yes, we could talk about the price -- both financial and environmental -- but you should be so lucky as to go for a ride. Review from Vivian A. We rode the BC Ferry from Vancouver to Victoria on a 4pm ferry. It wasn't too packed when we got there. We were able to check out the Tswwassen Quay Market while we waited. They announced our ferry had arrived and they loaded the cars quickly and left on schedule. Review from Scotty D. I LOVE THE BC FERRIES! anytime our family went into victoria this was our way of getting to the island. the fact of driving your car onto a large boat was crazy to me as a kid. all of these people and all of the cars make one heavy boat. it was always a pretty long trip back and forth but the scenery was always breathtaking. i always had to go up to the top deck and feel the brisk wind and hope to see the whales in the waters below. well i was lucky enough to see a family of whales once and it was remarkable. they seemed to be chasing along side us as they thought it was some sort of game. make sure you head down into the restarant or caferteria for some suprisingly good food. and the duty free shops are a must. lucky for me i never get seasick so this will always be my way of getting around to the many different islands next time i'm up there. it's sure beats flying. Review from Tam F. I had never been on a ferry before so I had/have nothing to compare it to.The concierge at our hotel made reservations for us from Tsawwassen to Victoria and even advised us as to what time to leave the hotel in the morning and what time to make sure were in line to board the ferry upon our departure from Victoria. Since we had rented a car we paid about $80.00 each way which seemed a bit steep in price, but when in Rome (err) Canada, you pay for the adventure. The ride was seamless and there was plenty of people watching to be had. There were restaurants aboard from a buffet style place to a take and eat cafeteria style place. Gift shop, coffee shop, even a ""spa"" available for a quick mani/pedi. For an extra $10 per person, there is a separate lounge with less noise, less people and comfortable seats along with snacks and beverages. There was a small arcade and I passed some time playing Ms. PacMan which was great fun. The service was wonderful as well and the driving on and off the boat was super fun (and my husband let me do it)! The ferry terminal in Tsawwassen had a great food court and even a Starbucks while the terminal in Victoria was much smaller with less food options/clean bathrooms. Review from D.J. Y. This is how a ferry line should be run. On time, clean, and helpful staff. We've ridden the Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay run many times over the years.  This is, in my opinion, the only way to travel to Victoria BC from the mainland.  Take your car/truck/van and travel the island in comfort of your own vehicle, only down side is you'll need to convert Kilometers to Miles to figure out the speed limit! The ferries themselves are in great condition, comparing the Washington State line to this would be insulting!  Decently price food options are available and they offer both restaurant and cafeteria style dinning.  Can anyone say White Spot!!!  OH YEAH!! Another really great item to note is the waiting/staging areas for your vehicle.  While you wait for your ride, the Tsawwassen side has a very state of the art facility.  A huge big screen, almost the size of a drive-in theater, keeps peeps entertained, updated on the boats and at the terminal itself, is wonderful.  The market-style food and trinket  vendors are well equipped to tickle your fancy!  And there are plenty of restrooms! Online booking of sailing reservations is suggested during the busy summer months.  Check this out for time schedules and reservation information: http://www.bcferries.com/ Oh, hey, during your trip, the views are not to be missed, enjoy the top-side ride and check out the Orcas and bald eagles, what a treat!! Review from Ed U. Love, exciting and new Come aboard! We're expecting you Love, life's sweetest reward Let it flow, it floats back to you... What an operation. The model of efficiency. It works like clockwork. It's about an hour's drive from Vancouver to Tsawwassen where the ferry departs. Make an online reservation in advance, and you get to wait in a special lane where drive onto the boat first. You deserve it, right? It also gives you peace of mind because the occupancy capacity probably gets heady during the summer. Once you're on, you lock up the car and climb up to hang out on deck or in the seating area just a level below. The Love Boat soon will be making another run The Love Boat promises something for everyone Set a course for adventure Your mind on a new romance The crossing through the Georgia Strait is gorgeous (see photos). It lasts close to ninety minutes, and there is even a nature specialist who gives lectures on the local flora and fauna. I'd avoid the movie-multiplex-level food since it's pricey and stale. This was my first time on the ferry as a motorist, and it does add up - C$46.75 for a standard vehicle plus C$14 per passenger. Yikes! I would have told Jamie W. to hide in the trunk. The Swartz Bay side on Vancouver Island is even more commercial with a fast-food cafeteria in full operation while you wait. Food still looks awful, so make sure to fill up on those Nanaimo bars in Victoria before you head back to the mainland. Run fast when you get on the boat because everyone grabs a chair on the way back. It's exhausting to buzz through the Butchart Gardens, tea at the Empress, and make it back to the ferry queue for the 5PM sailing. But this is a must-do for any tourist, so just accept the consequences. Review from Jen D. Pretty good for public transportation!  While they've gotten more and more expensive over the years, they've very rarely stranded us on Vancouver Island (nope, not Victoria Island). And they're almost always running on schedule - while growing up very close to where the ferries let you out (in Sidney), and working in the visitor information center a couple summers that caters to the ferry users, you can almost set your watch by the PCL busses that lead the ""ferry traffic"" down Pat Bay Hwy. You are always sure to commute to Victoria down 17 outside of the ferry traffic. That aside, the ferries -- they're clean and they have white spot burgers in the cafeteria. Must try (get the BC burger), and worth suspending a diet for - they are pretty awesome and just as good as White Spot proper. Although I'm not sure they have the Sunshine Breakfast anymore. What a shame. The view is nice, and on rare occasions you may see a whale, which may be noted over the PA system by the crew.  It's a very ""west coast"" experience with the salt air and forested islands. Oh yeah, the last time I was on a BC ferry a few years ago I saw that comic steven wright. That was cool. And finally, if you've never been to Vancouver Island, you can't drive around it in a day. It's about 6 hours to Tofino, and a full day to drive end to end. And yes, the roads are paved and we have electricity :)   (this may seem ridiculous, but I did work in the visitor info centre and answered these regularly) Review from Tony S. I find it hard to believe I am posting a 5 star rating for a 25 minute ferry ride (car and passenger). Hear me out....if this route works into your travels, hopefully you will be equal in praise. This ferry run is advertised as the most picturesque, perhaps, of the BC Ferry offerings. We found it, indeed, to be that, and more. Personable, attentive, fortunately on time, and a great way to break up a road trip from Nanaimo into Victoria. Cost: modest ($26.25) for one vehicle and 2 adults. Wished, if anything, the on-the-water time was more than just 1/2 hour. Pay as you board or purchase in-advance your fees at a local convenience store a short distance prior to arrival at the Mill Bay landing. Review from Jen N. First time on a ferry and it reminded me of going whale watching only this is a much bigger boat! For a family of 6, 30 bucks RT per person and 100 RT for our minivan was worth it from Vancouver to Victoria, and from Victoria to Point Angeles, Washington. The weather and view was nice, the ride was smooth, and there's a lot of amenities within the boat. Would use BC Ferry again and recommend it to others! Review from joe w. I'd rather swim to Vancouver! No local residents enjoy taking this trip, we actually loath it. For some reason ""mainlanders"" enjoy it though. Run to the cafeteria and save a seat, or you will wish you had. Have a fries and gravy,  play a game of Pacman, and hit the massage chair, really live and enjoy the voyage. Be sure to locate life boats, and remember what floor you parked on in case you get to stoned like I have in the past. Review from Eric B. It's not cheap but that's the government's fault for treating a critical piece of infrastructure like it's NOT a critical piece of infrastructure. Otherwise BC Ferries works pretty well - the ships are in good shape, there's decent food on board (though the selection is rather poor and it's not exactly cheap) and the scenery is great. If you don't like being a captive on the ship bring an iPod or a laptop to watch a movie, the time will go by quickly. You can also go outside and enjoy the sights. Review from Katie F. Loved the ferry ride itself and the cleanliness... definitely did not like the price! I haven't taken the ferry to the island since I was a kid, so this was a pretty novel thing for me!  That being said, this ferry is fabulous compared to the stench and crowding I've experienced on the ferries in Greece and Mexico.  It's reasonably well-organized, lots of seating, TVs, a kid zone, some workstation areas, and food ranging from $10 cafeteria meals to the $22/person dinner buffet. The views to and from the island are great and the buffet isn't bad - salads, 2 soups, prime rib, salmon, shrimp and canneloni were available when we went.  The time flies by if you eat on the ferry. The wait time sucks if you come when it's busy - we lucked out on the way over but got stuck waiting a couple of hours on the way back to Vancouver. It's pretty pricey to use - about $46-ish for a car and $14 per person each way.  Didn't like the fact that there's a charge to make a reservation but I suppose I'll cough up the money next time if I don't want to risk waiting in line. Review from Amy Y. Ferries were on time, staff members keep everything running smoothly and keep everybody in check. Once on board, there's plenty of things to do- such as rush to the cafeteria so you can buy fries with triple O sauce, there's gift shop for you to browse. Seats are comfortable so you see a lot of people taking a nap. Restrooms are clean and well-supplied. Review from Shannon N. Can't argue with this service - went from Victoria to Vancouver [Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen].  It's a bit expensive if you've got a car, but with a reservation, you get first on/first off privilege so that's nice. Didn't feel any rocking but there was an odd vibration on the ferry the whole ride.  Tons of tourist brochures near the rear of the ferry to help entertain you on the ride and find things to do at your destination. I've added a photo from our view of docking at Tsawwassen from the front of the boat.  Whee! Review from Susan A. Smooth sailing, good ferries!  First experience riding on a ferry and driving a car into it so I was really happy with how smooth & flawless the transition was.  Upper deck was closed both times due to weather and people on prior trips hurting themselves, which is unfortunate.  During the wait to go on the ferry, there's a mini-plaza to walk around with food and trinkets which was pretty neat (both on victoria side and vancouver side). On the ferry, you have the option of either cafeteria food or buffet-food.  Also have coffee-bar,dessert, etc.  And... last but not least, the ""store"" where you can kill some time browsing mags, books, and lotions, earrings, toys, randomness of sorts. Seating area was vast, with different types.  Tables, benches, facing each other, aisle-style, almost everything I can think of at least.  They even have electric outlets for those laptops!  TVs were out (thank goodness!) otherwise would have been subjected to non-stop Canadian hockey action... but for the hockey fans, sorry! All in all, quite enjoyable.  It's a lot for a boat ride though.  But, since they are moving so many cars and people, I s'pose it can't be helped.  However, I can't help feeling it's a huge monopoly. Review from Yiling W. Compared to the Washington State Ferries I've been on, the Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay ferry is awesome. It's huge, there's room to wander, there's a gift shop, a cafeteria/food area, a kiddie zone, a buffet restaurant, work stations, lots of vending machines, and relatively comfy seats. The bathrooms were pretty clean, and it just seemed well-kept and newly painted overall. The terminal at Tsawwassen, however, didn't have quite enough signage to get my friends and I to the right terminal, so we had to just ask some one random. Oh well. Review from Stacey E. If you're an islander the ferries are the bane of your existence. We never reserve unless we're attempting to travel on a really busy day (check the ferry traffic reports before you leave). The 9pm is hardly ever busy and is much quieter. If you aren't driving on, take the PCL. It takes half the time of the city bus. Note to tour group operators: I have a proposal for an onboard activity. Everyone in your group has to communicate without speaking until they get back on the tour bus. It's a traditional local custom... ummm.... and the whales like it. That's it, they'll be GUARANTEED to see whales. But no talking. See, I told you it was a good idea. Review from Dave D. You've got me trapped on an island and you privatized my only way off.  What a surprise - the prices keep climbing ""due to oil prices"" even when the price of oil goes down. The service itself is alright and if the price was better (or at least if they stopped jacking it up or perhaps gave a discount to people on an island who have no other way to get to the rest of the world) I'd be much happier. Review from Jean P. My family and I will never forget our last trip to Bristish Columbia. The day we drove into Canada after visiting relatives in Tacoma, we headed straight to the port at Tsawwassen in Vancouver to catch a BC Ferry to Victoria Island. There were 7 of us all together. I found it neat that we got to take our old school Toyota van on the ferry despite the wait time.  Once we arrived in Victoria, we practically spent the entire day sightseeing and checking out the wax museum and gardens. My mother had with her a red Nina Ricci totebag which inside held all of our passports, some cash, credit cards, and precious jewelry. By the end of the day, we headed back to the port to catch the ferry back to Vancouver. We were tired, beat, and exhausted. All we could think of was heading back to my cousin's house in Tacoma and crashing. When we were only a few minutes away from arriving at Vancouver, my mother gave her tote bag to my Dad's Aunt to hold while she went to the restroom. The line in the restroom was pretty long so we waited for her in the cafeteria up until we were told we could head back to our cars. The family decided to just to head to the van since everyone was leaving the ferry lobby/cafeteria and that my mom would just find us there. When my mom got to our van, everything was good up until about 20 minutes after we drove out the ferry boat on our way back to the U.S.A. My mother asked my Dad's Aunt, ""Oh can I have my bag?"" ""I need to get the passports ready."" My Dad's Aunt responds (in Filipino), ""HOLY SH*T!"" ""I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT IT!"" ""I LEFT IT IN THE FERRY BOAT!"" ""SUSMARIYOSEP!"" My dad suddenly braked out of shock and busted a U-turn on the highway and drove as fast as he could back to the port. By the time we got there, the ferry was gone. My mom, dad, and dad's Aunt went to the the BC ferry office to let them know what had happened and to have them locate and search the tote bag. It took them a long time talking to the authorities and reps at the office. In my mind all I could think of was that it was too late and that some stranger probably took the bag and kept it for themselves because of all the jewelry and money that was stored inside. Because it was going to take BC Ferries overnight to conduct the search, we had no choice but to crash in Vancouver since it was already pretty late. It was a good thing we had relatives living in the area because no one else had a credit card in thier possession to book a hotel room. Our relatives, who live in the Richmond district were kind enough to offer their place to let us crash. By noon time the next day, BC Ferries called my cousin's house to let my parents know that they had found the tote bag and that it was sitting in the Vancouver office ready for pickup. When we got there, my mom was able to retrieve every single thing. According to her, there was nothing missing. All our passports, money, credit cards, and jewelry were all in the bag. Somehow, an employee of the ferry found the tote bag under the table in the cafeteria while she was cleaning and had brought it to the lost and found office in Victoria. A staff member at BC was able to get it transported back to Vancouver. Because the employees of BC Ferries were honest, extremely helpful and responsive in retrieving our family valuables, they deserve 5 stars. If it wasn't for them, we would have had a lot of trouble getting back home to San Jose, California. Review from Randy T. -Drive up to a booth and pay your fare. -Get in a lane and pull up to the car in front of you. -Park car and enter gift shops to buy souvenirs, snacks to munch on, and trinkets you think might be great gifts for friends. -Get into car and wait.........and wait...........and wait. Possibly take a nap while waiting as well. -When time comes to board ferry, observe the mass of cars in the opposite lanes to the left fleeing the ferry at tremendous speeds. -Drive forward and enter the lower car holding area of the ferry. -Lock car, take a whiff of all the car exhaust, and hurry upstairs. -Relax inside or outside the ferry and take pics of the scenery like a typical tourist. -Upon arriving, get in line and be prepared to violate each other's personal space to get to the lower deck to your car. -Enter car and wait patiently for cue to leave. -Drive off ferry, accelerate like a madman, and continue to your destination. Great trip to have and everyone needs to do this at least once in their lives. Review from Fraulein C. I love that you can drive a car into a little ferry boat so you can tug it all the way to Victoria Island. Awesome I tell you! Along the way, you feel a bit queazy if you're not a ""sea"" type of person. I sure as hell felt sick, but after getting off the ferry boat...I was a happy kid standing on solid ground. Hehe! Anyway, you get the chance to take wonderful breathtaking views for a slight bit of Canada. Stuff like this...makes me want to go back and give BC another visit. Sucks that it takes a while to get from one place to another with all the ""extra"" weight. Review from Beth C. Haha, I love how all the four and five star reviews are tourist reviews. If it's something you don't have to do with any regularity, yeah, the ferries are novel enough (so beautiful with the scenery) to seem really wonderful. But once you get over the breathtaking surroundings and how cool it is to drive your car onto a boat.....BC Ferries is overpriced. They basically have a monopoly and drive their prices far too high far too often. The food sucks, and as if it wasn't expensive enough, if you're driving, they also basically either force you to get a reservation (by allowing so much of the boat to be reserved that drive-ups wait hours and hours) and spend another $20+ to do so, or wait out there for, occasionally, as long as 5-6 hours. The main purpose of my gripe today is the new (ish) system they have for parking out there. I drove up on Friday to pick a friend up at the Swartz Bay terminal. She'd walked on in Tsawassen. When I got out there, a little man with a glow-stick waved me vehemently to one side, where I was greeted with a PAY parking lot (like I'm going to pay to pick someone up when I'm out there for 5 minutes?) and no free spots. It's confusing, maze-like, and vastly insufficient in size, as well as being too far from the terminal for a quick pick up. I was in a car accident recently and walking hurts a bit, but there were NO spots anywhere, and we joined the sea of confused, frustrated people driving in circles. My boyfriend jumped in the driver's seat for me and kept circling while I limped into the terminal to get my friend. While I was in the terminal I overheard at least three other people complaining about how ridiculously insufficent the parking was, and saw two people saying ""we have to hurry, so and so is circling while I come get you"", cutting off their hugs to run out to the stupid parking lot. and the arrivals area is supposed to be relished! It's where all the smiles and hugging happen! As an islander, I'm stuck with BC Ferries and have no choice but to utilize them sometimes, but for the amount they charge, and how often they hike their fees, I expect better. Review from Andrew P. We took the Tsawassen-Swartz Bay ferry via the Pacific Coach bus.  It was a nice way to get conveniently from Vancouver to Victoria.  We made the crossing on a beautiful glassy smooth summer afternoon.  The bus and boat left and arrived right on time.  Both were clean and pleasant to ride.   It was a really nice trip. Review from Patrick R. I am very fond of the ferries. I find my self taking a trip across and back, with or without my car at least once a month, usually more. I always take time to marvel at the view on the way across (even at night. If there are no clouds, the stars are breathtaking). Being a regular on Route 1 between Swartz Bay and Tswassen, I'm most familiar with the two Superferries (the Spirit of British Columbia and the Spirit of Vancouver Island). I adore these two. They are big and comfy with plenty of space. I'd recommend going to the top deck lounges, which fill up more slowly than the main deck, and sport TVs with children's programming in the forward lounge and a news broadcast in the rear lounge (though avoid the rear lounge during any playoffs if you do not like sports) The cafeteria is large and well designed with two queues for hot entrees (and quick through-ways for cold), though long line-ups can develop. If you are on any ferry, try to wait til about mid-voyage to dine in the cafeteria, you'll get through a lot quicker. If you are in the mood for a nice meal, the Pacific Buffet is well worth a visit (and well worth the price). The food placed out is of wonderfully high quality and I have never been disappointed. The other amenities available on the Superferries are nice, though since I don't really use them and other reviews note them so I won't go into detail. The Coastal Celebration is the other ship I am familiar with on the route (the fourth ship was switched, so I cannot speak to it). It matches the Superferries for amenities, but not space. The Coastals feel cramped and maze-like compared to their larger cousins, though I must note that if you are traveling with kids, the ship is a bit better designed with properly enclosed play areas and the Caf view is to die for (again wait til mid-voyage when the ship is close to the islands). While you may have a different experience, I'd recommend aiming for a sailing at an odd-numbered hour to ensure passage on the Superferries. BC ferries scheduling is one of the annoyances of traveling with them. While they make an admirable effort to keep on schedule, they are easily delayed and often fall behind. (There have been occasions when it was as much as an hour or more, however cases such as this are rare and usually the result of mechanical failure or medical emergency). I find the best thing is just to bring your patience and a book. I'll also note here that if you are traveling by vehicle, be prepared to wait. It is minimum one hour between sailings, two in the off-season, and if it is busy there will usually be sailing waits for vehicles. If you're traveling during a busy time, make a reservation and make sure to show up at least a half-hour early like they say (you -will- lose your reservation if you don't, regardless of circumstances) Price wise, I find the ferries to be quite reasonable. The single passenger cost  is very cheap and makes it easy to make several trips. The vehicle cost can be a little more prohibitive though. At $45 +$14/vehicle occupant one-way  the cost for frequent passengers can get pretty steep. However, when compared to the cost of flying, it is still the cheaper way across (especially when you consider that you are able to take your car). I'll also note that BC Ferries will also sometimes do fare-sales where the cost will drop significantly, so it's worth keeping an eye on their website. Review from Brenda G. This was my first time on a vehicle transfer ferry and I liked it a lot.  It's pretty expensive, it cost $76 CD for a car plus two people.  It's $12 per person so the car is what gets you.  It's like others say, drive to the booth, pay your fare, get in line and drive onto the ferry.  The BEST advice I can give regarding the ferries is MAKE A RESERVATION.  If you are coming or going on the weekend the wait can be up to two hours to get on the ferry.  Thank goodness they have facilities and food at the port.  Last Friday, we were leaving Victoria heading to Vancouver and they took one of the large ferries out of comission for the weekend.  Instead of making a reservation, we headed out to the port and had a 1.5 hour wait then the 1.5 hour ride.   The ride itself is great.  There are a couple of decks, you can go outside and look at the wonderous view, sit inside, read, eat, whatever.  Clean bathrooms to boot.  All in all, it's great.

21127	"Argentina v Ghana at ITLOS On 14 November 2012 Argentina submitted a request for provisional measures to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (' ITLOS ') regarding the dispute over the Frigate ARA Libertad. Argentina has requested ""that Ghana unconditionally enable the Argentine warship Frigate ARA Libertad to leave the Tema port and the jurisdictional waters of Ghana and to be resupplied to that end."" On 29 October 2012, Argentina instituted arbitral proceedings under Annex VII of UNCLOS against Ghana. Article 290(5) of UNCLOS provides that pending the constitution of an arbitral tribunal to which a dispute is being submitted under Annex VII, any party to the dispute may request ITLOS to prescribe provisional measures. ITLOS may prescribe provisional measures if it considers that prima facie the arbitral tribunal would have jurisdiction and that the urgency of the situation so requires. The Libertad is a 100-meter-long tall sailing ship, used as a training vessel by the Argentine navy. It was arrested in Tema, Ghana on 2 September 2012 after a subsidiary of US hedge fund Elliott Capital Management (NML Capital) gained an injunction from the Ghanaian Commercial Court to prevent the ship and its crew members from leaving the port. The arrest of the ship arises in the context of the sovereign debt moratorium announced by Argentina in 2001. NML Capital is the holder of Fiscal Agency Agreement ('FAA') bonds issued by Argentina, purchased at a discount on face value. In 2001, Argentina announced a temporary moratorium on principal and interest payments on public external debt, including the FAA bonds. In 2005 and 2010, Argentina initiated a restructuring of its debt, offering FAA bondholders the opportunity to exchange their defaulted bonds for new unsecured and unsubordinated external debt. The majority of bondholders participated in the exchange, accepting roughly 30 cents on the dollar for their FAA bonds. However, NML Capital held out on both the 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings. Before the Ghanaian Court, NML submitted that it is owed $370 million by Argentina (based on the outstanding principle plus interest). NML Capital has sued Argentina for face value of the bonds plus interest and has sought to enforce its debt in a variety of judicial fora around the world, including the UK Supreme Court, the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris and the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. On 11 May 2006, NML Capital was granted a summary judgment by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York for the principal amount of the bonds valued at $284,184,632.30, plus interest thereon. The UK Supreme Court decision in NML Capital v Argentina [2011] UKSC 31 recognised and declared enforceable the US judgment. Most recently, on 26 October 2012, in the case of NML Capital Ltd v Republic of Argentina , the US Court of Appeal for the 2nd Circuit ruled that Argentina had improperly discriminated against NML Capital by giving priority to the payment of bondholders who had entered the 2005 and 2010 debt swaps. Argentina claims that the order of the Ghanaian court is in violation of international law and, in particular, of the immunities enjoyed by warships. Article 32 of UNCLOS provides ""With such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in articles 30 and 31, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes."" Under the terms and conditions governing the bonds held by NML Capital (as quoted in the UK Supreme Court judgment), Argentina waived sovereign immunity in relation to execution of judgments by bondholders as follows: ""To the extent that the republic ... shall be entitled, in any jurisdiction ... in which any ... other court is located in which any suit, action or proceeding may at any time be brought solely for the purpose of enforcing or executing any related judgment, to any immunity from suit, from the jurisdiction of any such court ... from execution of a judgment or from any other legal or judicial process or remedy, and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there shall be attributed such an immunity, the republic has irrevocably agreed not to claim and has irrevocably waived such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction ... solely for the purpose of enabling ... a holder of securities of this series to enforce or execute a related judgment."" The Ghanaian Court held that this wording clearly amounted to a waiver of sovereign immunity by Argentina. Since the Argentine application to ITLOS has yet to be published, the Argentine position on this waiver remains unclear. Presumably, Argentina will argue that sovereign immunity of warships is unwaivable and that the waiver in the bond conditions does not apply to warships. It will be interesting to see how Argentina supports this argument. Comments JP Selwyn Thursday, 15 November 2012 Whilst this is a 'legal' article, allow me to add a comment on the 'economics' side of this case. Whilst what NML has done is completely legal, it is highly un-ethical and probably immoral. They bought discounted bonds, and some of them enjoyed outrageous interest payment (to a total many times over their investment) precisely because they were very risky. If they wanted certainty, they should have bought US Treasury bonds at 1%, not the 21% paid by Argentina! In addition, looking at the human cost of the Argentine collapse, they should have taken the money when it was offered, which was still more than what they had paid for it. Just sayin.. "	News	News
42106	"Know your ISP. 3 tell me it's because they are now using Vodaphone towers primarily and roaming onto Vodaphone. I don't understand why it's roaming if the the primary network and the roaming network are both vodaphone. Furthermore I don't see that thier suggestion of moving my contract to vodaphone will help. Any thoughts? I'd rather move over to telstra but I still have 10 months left on my contract. So 3 customers still on contract will continue to roam to Telstra until the contract finishes? Telstra roaming will be available to at least April 2013, until the Optus JV (with Vodafone) takes off ie: Voda 2G default -&gt; Telstra NextG Once 3GIS shuts shop at the end of this month, Vodafone will be the HOME network, then you'll roam to Telstra (considering your in a coverage area with a compatible handset) when no Vodafone coverage is available. Be aware of the data charges when roaming onto Telstra (50c per MB, not included in any allowance/cap or data pack) I had the same issue and since last 2 days $$$ on pending bill start going up, I called overseas shit CC and found out that its because I am still a 3 customer and vodafone is my roming network so I will charged for data roaming everytime i used data on vodafone network. the sollution they gave me was to change my mobile service provider to vodafone, I took it seriously and changed it to TPG ;-) ... found out that its because I am still a 3 customer and vodafone is my roming network so I will charged for data roaming everytime i used data on vodafone network. Happy Dude told you yesterday that using data while connected to the Voda network does not incur any extra charge. 3 customers will only be charged extra for data if they consume it while connected to a Telstra network. using data while connected to the Voda network does not incur any extra charge. 3 customers will only be charged extra for data if they consume it while connected to a Telstra network. Given that my phone displayed ` roaming' when it was on 3 but connected to Voda, and I had ` use data when roaming' off so as not to incur charges to Telstra, how are the users supposed to tell the difference -- and be able to use their service properly when on Voda.? It wouldn't do that. If it displayed ""Roaming"", you were connected to Telstra. When the changeover first happened, I realised because my phone showed ` roaming' I checked what provider I was connected too, and the phone informed me I was on Vodaphone. When I went back to the home screen I was still on `roaming.' The phone at this location, with a flaky 3 signal that would fail by my bed, had _never_ gone to roaming before. I'm quite ready to accept that it wasn't _supposed_ to show Voda as roaming. This was on an Acer Liquid Metal. It may be a frunction of the phone. It certainly was what occured. Try taking the simcard out and doing it. Or swap in a different simcard from a different carrier. Thanks for that advice. Turned the phone off, took out the SIM and still no carrier option. Turned it off again, reinserted the SMI and voila....we have the ""carrier"" option, but only at the turn on stage. After that, no carrier option.....even after repeating the process. I find its better not to put your phone in.. .then you can see the full range of frequencies available in the area and ascertain whether upgrading your phone (to 850 3G for example) may make a difference. Or put in a quad 3G phone. All SIMs issued by 3 were capable of OTA update. As I said before, it doesn't matter how old it is. It is quite possible that the update fails and if that's the case, Care can try the OTA again manually -- or just get a new SIM. *lol* You're most welcome. Your logic is also wonderful. Even though the Carrier has a clearly stated contract condition, the fact that a phone has a function, which you've misinterpreted in any case, obviously overrides that. NO -- the operator has an option -- the user can roam onto Telstra, however data is charged at a high rate when they do so. The phone the carrier sells has a function -- the user must turn on roaming for data. It is called ` Data Roaming' -- subtext ` Connect to a data service when roaming.' When the phone on 3 is connected to Telstra, it informs the user it is roaming. We now have a phone that offers the ability to toggle data when roaming and is roaming. Apparently, from what you tell us, 3 chose to ignore this, and allow data to flow. We now have the situation [on your planet] where not only is the user culpable, ignorant and fully liable for the charges incurred by an action they took reasonable steps to avoid, but the phone manufacturer and programmers as also rather mischievous and foolish. We could, and I imagine the assessors at the TIO, would, in the event of any dispute, look at the arguments, who stands to profit from such a situation, and assess the situation accordingly. However you dice it, you are stating that, on 3, that function doesn't work. _If_ so, then that is unacceptable, and clearly misleading. We could, and I imagine the assessors at the TIO, would, in the event of any dispute, look at the arguments, who stands to profit from such a situation, and assess the situation accordingly. It's listed in your contract and SFOA that 3 may use the services of another network to provide you with network access to services and that rates may vary. You are warned at signup and you can always refuse to sign if you do not agree with the t&c's laid out infront of you -- and walk away to another carrier If roaming is such a problem, why stay with 3? (ps -- Telstra are the ones who make the most out of data roaming. Take it up with them for not offering Hutchison/VHA a cheaper wholesale rate?) It is -- my part in this is when I commented that the first time my phone had shown ` roaming' was when it first went onto the Voda network [according to the carrier and signal strength reported by it]. David stated that was impossible. I observed that that was what appeared to have happened. My second point, raised on that, is that a person who had taken reasonable steps for their phone _not_ to use data when roaming has a reasonable expectation that the data use would not occur. All the spin and pointing to the `conditions of the contract' do not affect that. However, feel free to quote them. I'll take them at their face value.:-) NO -- the operator has an option -- the user can roam onto Telstra, however data is charged at a high rate when they do so. So there's the basic misunderstanding. You think that Telstra roaming is being offered as an option. It's not. When you're in a location with no ""3"" (that now means Voda) coverage but where Telstra coverage exists and is available to 3 customers, then you'll connect via Telstra. No choice. This was explained in the contract. The phone the carrier sells has a function -- the user must turn on roaming for data. It is called ` Data Roaming' -- subtext ` Connect to a data service when roaming.' That's your subtext. The function actually disallows data when connected to a non-home network. Telstra is a home network for 3 customers. In any case, this is a really stupid argument. Do you think you're the first 3 customer in the nearly 10 years the Telstra network agreement has been in place to be caught with high excess data costs because they didn't understand the contract they signed? Whirlpool has many threads on the subject. It's really simple to avoid these costs: swap to Vodafone or some other carrier. Are you sure you're not connected to Telstra? What handset do you have? What networks are in your network list, and which one are you connected to? I am using Samsung Galaxy S2. I am not sure what network my phone is connecting and that is the help I was looking from 3 Tech support, but the only option they offered me is to have my services moved to Vodafone and that was not acceptable solution to me, considering the over service I moved to vodafone 3 months back had lots of issues and their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. There for I am moved on from 3/vodafone now :-) Switching to vodafone is not an option for me due to some unpleasant recent experience. Hence the second part of my statement (which wasn't addressed to you anyway). You were very non-specific about your problems other than lots of issues so I can't comment on that and Voda's service is conducted in the same way by the same people as 3 -- so it's hard to guess what suddenly got your goat there either. You were very non-specific about your problems other than lots of issues so I can't comment on that and Voda's service is conducted in the same way by the same people as 3 -- so it's hard to guess what suddenly got your goat there either. Well there are too may issues, the most annoying one is that what customer service staff says is different to what Vodafone shop staff says and this has happens to me few times in last few weeks, also, I had to go through changing 3 instrument in my first 8 weeks which was lots of pain due to contradicting statements by the staffs. Any ways, its no more an issue for me as one of my service is no longer with them so pain is only  . Three set up their simcard and networking arrangement so that when it roams to Telstra the phone is NOT informed that it in fact roaming. They have just renamed ""Telstra"" to ""Roaming"". Sure it's a little misleading, if you're just looking at your phone settings at face value. It's always been the worst thing about 3. ""Fake"" roaming tags make data use very expensive (unless you manually initated data and checked things yourself). Telstra was probably quite happy with the arrangement, but I wonder if 3/Voda tried to fix it. If you didn't need data then the 3 coverage combining 3GIS, Telstra & Vodafone was quite extensive and no hidden costs. If your phone could have turned off data when on Telstra it would've been brilliant. "	Forum	Instruction

Does that nurse really think that the tiny sample of formula is going to feed the baby for any substantial length of time? If mom is going to formula feed she is going to have to go to the store to buy formula whether she takes the stupid bag or not. I'm laughing at the visualization of a nurse dashing through the L&D unit with an outstretched hand holding the oh-so-important formula bag, jumping over isolettes and sliding foot first into the elevator to give the mother her life saving 12oz. of free formula. Wow, good thing she was on shift today or else this mother would have been sent into the big cruel world with only her breasts to nourish her child. I agree with the suggestion to send a letter. The nurse may be assuming the mother is going to go back to work full-time in a few weeks, but the way it's said, the nurse has communicated a belief that breasts only produce milk for a month or two at the most. You gotta wonder how we managed to survive as a species and live on this planet for as long as we have if that were the case. All babies would've died and we wouldn't be here to have this conversation, would we? The more I read this site and my own background in medicine tells me that people just don't THINK anymore. Even if this was true, why on earth couldn't the mother just drive to the nearest Wal-Mart and buy a can of formula? I think the lack of logic behind the ""this goody bag of formula will sustain your child for the first year of his/her life"" bugs me more than the ""breastfeeding only works for a few weeks"" nonsense!

19442	"the freedom to say whatever you want, write whatever you want, make movies about anything you want, etc. has it gone too far? Do you think we would have a more civilized society with a little censorship? People need to use more discretion as to what they print. Just because a person can do something, doesn't mean they should. We have that right for a reason, but some rights can and are being abused. I am typically against censorship, but with the way are society is declining, I think the only way we can start to get back on track is by pulling in the reigns a bit. There are some movies/videos/tv shows which i believe have a lower rating than they should eg PG 13 when there are sex scenes in a movie, shouldnt this be a higher rating? Also you often see movies on tv in nz which have nudity and sex etc but at the start of the movie this isnt always stated it might just say violence etc and parental guidence is advised. I think these types of things need to have a tighter net so that we can get the propert warning before choosing to tune in with our younge family or not. Im by no means a prude, but belive its out right to be informed so we can make the best decicions for ourselves as to what we want to watch. side censorship issue would be some music videos which are out there these days which have fully topless woman in them rubbing on each other. shouldnt these be censored instead of being shown during day hours? perhpas these should be shown later or ""rude bits"" blurred during ""children""hours? Its not what id want my young neices looking at thats for sure. Censorship a very broad topic. There are so many different kinds of censorship put in place for many different reasons under many different agendas. It's not a question like what toothpaste do you use? This is why I haven't commented so far and am unlikely to do so unless I have enough spare time to write a decent and honest, thought-out personal response. I like to think about this sort of topic before giving my opinion rather than just plunging in. Perhaps a little more positive censorship would benefit society. So much of the aberant behaviour we see in the youth today seems to be a reflection of the behaviour portrayed in third rate videos. Trouble is, who sets the bench mark? And how do we censor the internet? I am in favor of our rating system, but not censorship. People can choose not to watch if they are given informed information about the content of a program. Generally people in favor of censorship are so because they think the material will negatively effect other people. No one ever says ""Oh, I can't watch that because I think it will inspire me to go out and commit crime"" do they. I agree Fiona. No one can make informed decisions without some information on which to base them. It's setting acceptable guidelines that seems to be the problem. Still most censorship is for not aimed at adults, but at younger people and children. I think information, along with the free will to choose, is the way to go. I think thats what God seems to have gone for! I dont like to see evil or disturbing things myself, and I like to be able to choose to avoid them. I choose to watch and listen to positive things myself. Perhaps alongside the age ratings we could have a good cheer factor! "	Forum	Opinion/Argumentation
8716	"Interview: Diane Gaston, author of 'Born to Scandal' Tags 11:41PM EST November 13. 2012 - Diane Gaston grew up with a head full of romantic stories and yet never imagined being a writer until she read a really bad best seller -- and decided she could do better. Now Gaston is a successful author of Regency romance with numerous awards to her name, including the 2006 RITA award for best Regency romance. We tracked her down to chat with her about Born to Scandal , her latest release, and to find out just what happens in a woman's life when she decides to pursue the things that make her happy. Pamela: Welcome back to HEA, Diane! You had a career as a mental health worker before you were published in romance. Do you think that foundation and your understanding of the complexity of human emotion and interaction have helped you in your writing? Diane: Hi, Pamela! It is delightful to be at Happy Ever After again. Thank you so much for having me. I know without a shadow of a doubt that my career as a mental health worker has helped me understand the complexity of human emotion. I was privileged to learn this from my clients. Another thing they taught me was the resilience and strength of the human spirit, even in face of enormous hardship and pain. My clients taught me what drives human behavior, what people need and what they fear. My child and family clients gave me a good sense of how a person's early life experiences and family relationships affect later behavior and emotions. Pamela: Although your master's work was in psychology and social work, your undergraduate degree was in English literature. Among the authors you enjoyed were Jane Austen and later Georgette Heyer. When did you realize that you wanted to leave mental health work and write romance? Diane: First I must confess that I never even heard of Georgette Heyer (or Regency romance) before I started writing. It still amazes me that I never read Heyer when I was young. I would have loved her books! When I was an English major in college, I never, ever thought I would be a writer. The only writing course I took was basic composition. I was an English major because I loved reading and I hadn't yet discovered psychology. In college I read Thomas Hardy and D.H. Lawrence. And Austen. When I was a mental health therapist, also raising children, also studying for a master's in social work, I didn't have time to read for pleasure. By the time I earned my MSW and my social work license, my children were old enough to be a bit independent. I suddenly had time on my hands. I started reading again, and I read a runaway best seller that I thought was dreadful. Any romance I'd ever read was light years better than that book. I thought, if this author's book can make the best-seller list, maybe I can write a book. It also helped that a friend of mine had gone back to college to get a degree in creative writing. She kinda normalized the idea of writing for me. I never considered writing anything but romance, though. It was what I loved to read. I'd always had romantic stories running around in my head, so I just dared to write them down. Pamela: I think it's incredible that the day you retired was also the day you got ""The Call."" It seems like destiny. Can you tell us about that experience? I can't imagine how that must have felt. Diane: It wasn't quite that serendipitous, but almost. I made the decision to retire and that next week I got The Call. The truly amazing event was how I made the decision to retire. I happened to be instant messaging at the same time as an Australian friend who is very spiritual. We never IM'd before, nor have we since. She convinced me to follow my dream, to retire even though I'd not sold yet. She convinced me that God wanted me (and all of us) to be happy. In my mind I made the decision right then and there. I worked another six months after that day. Two weeks after I retired, I took my first trip to England, a Regency tour designed for writers, and while there went to the Mills and Boon offices in Richmond to meet with my editors. Pamela: As an author, you've written about the gritty underside of the Regency period, taking risks by depicting characters normally shunned by respectable society -- prostitutes, for example -- with depth and compassion. What led you to write those kinds of stories? Diane: The dark, gritty side of the Regency really captures my imagination. There is something that captivates me about the contrast between the wealth and beauty and privilege of the aristocracy and the darker side of war, gambling, prostitution, poverty. I think there is more emotion and potential conflict in the darker sides of the Regency, as there always is in places of suffering. I also love to give characters who ordinarily wouldn't have a happy ever after their happy ever after. Pamela: How do you research those parts of Regency history and culture? Typically speaking, history favors recording the lives and actions of the powerful, not the marginalized. Is historical research something you enjoy? Diane: I am surprised how much I love the research! I've amassed a whole library of research books and I have become rather skilled at researching online. Information about the darker side of the Regency is harder to find, but there has been a great deal written about the Regency and a lot of primary sources still available, both in print and online. One of my favorite sources is the Annual Register , thanks to my friend, Kathryn Caskie who found two shabby sets of the books for the years 1810 to 1820 and sold one of them to me. The Annual Register has a chronology of news events throughout the year. Murders. Crimes. Storms. Shipwrecks. It is a gold mine. Google Books now has some of the Annual Registers online, by the way. Pamela: What a terrific source for a writer! What are the essential qualities a man must possess to be a hero in one of your books? How about a heroine? Diane: My Regency heroes must, above all things, be honorable. They do the right thing, no matter what, although what he believes is the right thing may not be what society tells him. They are strong and protective -- and I also like to make them tortured in some way. My Regency heroines must be strong, independent women, which goes a bit against the norm for women in that time in history. I want them to act on their own behalf, not just passively accept whatever men decide for them. Pamela: Tell us about Born to Scandal, your Nov. 20 release. Diane: Born to Scandal is my homage to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre . Like Jane Eyre , it is a governess story complete with secrets and betrayals. The Marquess of Brentmore -- half Irish peasant, half English aristocrat -- grew up under a cloud of scandal. Even money and a title aren't enough to stay the wagging tongues of the Ton. But he's vowed that his children will never experience the same stigma. After the death of their infamous mother, they need a reputable governess. Anna Hill is too passionate, too alluring, but she fills Brentmore Hall with light and laughter again -- and its master with feelings he's forgotten. But even if he dared risk the gossip of a lord marrying a governess, Anna's birth is even more scandalous than his own. Pamela: Sounds captivating! What topics did you find yourself researching for this book? Diane: I researched the role of governesses, Regency-era toys, kitchen gardens, Irish tenant farms, Irish legends, Ingatestone Hall, the model for Brentmore Hall, Gunter's Tea Shop, and a variety of other small things. Pamela: Regency-era toys! I love it. Those kinds of details are precious in a story and bring such life to the pages. What can your devoted fans look forward to getting from you next year? Diane: Next for me is a two-book series: The Masquerade Club ... identities concealed; desires revealed. The first book, A Reputation for Notoriety , will be released June 2013. Someone is trying to sabotage the gaming hell the illegitimate Rhys Marrick runs for his biological father in return for his father's public acceptance. Is it Celia Gale, the secretive woman with a need for revenge whom Rhys hired to induce gentlemen to gamble and who is quickly winning his jaded heart? Little does he know how entwined their lives already are and how much more entwined by passion they will become. Pamela Clare is an award-winning journalist and nationally best-selling author of both historical romance and contemporary romantic suspense. She loves coffee, the Colorado mountains, and her two grown sons. Her website is PamelaClare.com . "	Other	Promotion
34915	"How to Work with the Psychopath-in-Chief And now for the latest ""no-duh"" news: According to a recent study in Behavioral Sciences and the Law, bosses are four times more likely to be psychopathic than the average worker. That's hardly shocking. In fact, the real news should be that somewhere, somebody has found a boss that isn't psychopathic. Our workplaces choose the craziest people to lead us precisely because they are psychopaths, a condition that brings lots of great business attributes with it: viciousness, narcissism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and wild mood swings, to name a few. And those who aren't psychopaths when they become bosses? The job turns them into one. Psychopaths have gotten a bad rap in recent years because a very small percentage of them, you know, kill people. Unfortunately, that's made problems for the friendly, witty, hard-working psychopaths who run our corporations, universities, and nation. None of them are likely to kill people. They simply go about their business, being charming when they need to be and ruthless when necessary. They are not troubled by doubts about themselves or their future, and they have no conscience. In short, these folks are everything a successful businessperson should be, and they have a tremendous leg up on those who are not psychopaths. Which is why, in the evolutionary sense, they are selected to be our bosses so much of the time. The good news for those of you non-psychopaths is that madness conveys weakness as much as strength. And the thoughtful, savvy, strategic person who does not have the benefit of being crazy can manipulate the boss who is. Use these tools to deal with the psycho in charge. 1. Listen Up The psychopath relates well to the people who can put up with his incessant, ongoing ruminations about himself. In my career, I've enjoyed the company of many psychopaths who rattle on for hours about whatever is roiling around inside them. I listen. And somewhere in there, as I'm listening, I manage to tease out a duty, an objective, a thing to do . Psychopaths very often have ideas that need help being actualized. If you listen well enough, you can help make your boss's dreams come true -- and reap the benefits. MORE USEFUL STUFF 2. Use Your Lever One of those classy Greek dudes said it: Give me a lever long enough and I will move the world. The corporate strategist puts it another way: Give me a boss who's crazy enough and I will control the organization. History is chock full of Rasputins who had a merry time while their psychopath was bouncing off the walls. When President Nixon was bubbling and fulminating in the Oval Office, it was two canny ad-men who ran much of the nation's business. Because everybody in the organization fears the psychopath, you carry that fear in your arsenal of corporate weapons every time you emerge from his office and into the world. 3. Beat Him at His Own Game The one thing that may be most difficult for you, and most necessary, is to learn one crucial lesson: The psychopath is all about himself. You cannot beat, manipulate or otherwise manage a psychopath by going up against him self-for-self. You have to step away from yourself -- your feelings, fears, and ambitions -- and approach the psychopath as a cool, focused, selfless embodiment of Duty. I know that sounds like a crock, but believe me, it works. It's like Jiu-Jitsu. Your power is not in your weight and size. It's in the way you use the weight and size of the monster's madness against himself. In that war, your coldness and sagacity is your best offense. I guess that makes you a bit a psychopath, too, doesn't it? Good for you. "	Instruction	Promotion

42024	Promote Advertisement Britain stun Brazil in front of record home crowd Brazil's Marta (R) dribbles the ball against Britain's Alex Scott during their women's Group E football match at the London 2012 Olympic Games at Wembley stadium in London July 31, 2012. REUTERS/Paul Hackett LONDON (Reuters) - Britain secured a remarkable 1-0 win over Olympic gold medal contenders Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday in front of the biggest crowd to watch a women's football match in the country. LONDON (Reuters) - Britain secured a remarkable 1-0 win over Olympic gold medal contenders Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday in front of the biggest crowd to watch a women's football match in the country. The victory, thanks to Steph Houghton's brilliantly-taken second minute goal, meant Britain finished top of the group having won all three matches without conceding a goal and will now face Canada in the quarter-finals at Coventry on Friday. Brazil also qualified for the last eight and will play world champions Japan in their last eight match in Cardiff on the same evening. Britain, who are also emerging as real medal contenders, took the lead 90 seconds into the game when Brazil failed to clear a corner and the ball eventually fell to Houghton, who showed some superb skill to turn the defender and score from an acute angle. Left back Houghton also scored in the 1-0 win against New Zealand in Britain's opening game and in the 3-0 win over Cameroon. Her goal against Brazil brought 70,584 fans to their feet - a record crowd for a women's match in Britain, beating the old record of 53,000 which was set at a women's club match 92 years ago. It was also only 6,000 shy of the Olympic record of 76,489 set when the United States beat China in the 1996 final. The atmosphere in the stadium was totally different to the usual one at either an England international or Cup Final and was far more relaxed, with the crowd largely appreciating the skills of both teams in a very sporting, Olympian manner. And there was plenty to be impressed with as Brazil came back looking for an equaliser and going close when Alex Scott was forced to head against her own post after pressure from Marta and Cristiane. Britain though, were often quicker to the ball than Brazil and should have doubled their lead after 56 minutes when Francielle tripped Eni Aluko to concede a clear penalty. But Kelly Smith's left-footed spot-kick was a poor one, lacking pace and accuracy and Brazil keeper Andreia scrambled it away down to her left. 	News	News
4504	"Now imagine how many of those signs could go up in the line of Hurricane Sandy. Even as hundreds, perhaps thousands, are still displaced from their neighborhoods, an act-alike Facebook page has caught the attention of the media, and a warning -- it's equally touching and heartbreaking to visit. Hurricane Sandy Lost and Found Pets , established the day before Sandy made landfall in the U.S., doesn't recommend any particular charity deserving your dollars, nor take donations. (Refreshing a week before Election Day, isn't it?) It exists solely to create a place where people can post photos of lost and found pets in affected areas, as well as animals shelters in need and temporary shelters that allow animals. For example, all 76 evacuation shelters in New York City accepted pets, as did the city's subways, trains and taxi rides, according to USA Today . It's a good sign that lessons were learned from Hurricane Katrina, which left an estimated 250,000 pets stranded when pets weren't factored into the rescue plan, as explained by Modern Dog Magazine . Cats, dogs, a good number of birds are all listed among the missing from Sandy. But there are the happy stories, too, if you look. The photo used for this column , of a dog found in Patchogue, on the South Shore of Long Island, New York, is one of them.

Then you wrap your head around all the people mobilizing for the animals.

Further Information In the Freedom of Information Act, the duty to confirm or deny is clearly set out in s1(1)(a), which provides that, ""Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request."" Section 1(6) provides that it be called ""the duty to confirm or deny."" In relation to most of the exemptions, if complying with the duty would itself engage the exemption (whether or not the information is actually held), subject to the public interest test where applicable, the duty does not arise. The EIR do not set out the duty to confirm or deny in the same way. However, regulation 12(6) states that where the disclosure of information would adversely affect any of the interests referred to regulation 12(5)(a) (international relations, defence, national security or public security) and would not be in the public interest, a public authority can respond by neither confirming nor denying that the information exists and is held. This implies that, for all other exceptions, public authorities may not respond in this way. In other words, in practice, the duty to confirm or deny does exist for all other environmental information in all circumstances, including where the disclosure of the information itself is not required.

44258	"Cheats and Walkthroughs Cheats and Walkthroughs Cheats and Walkthroughs Whether it's high school or college that demands your attention, unless you're planning on flunking, you're going to have less time to play video games come September. It might be a good idea to finish up games from earlier this year so that you can spend your precious gaming time on the Fall releases that are about to flood your PC, consoles, and the rest of the your free time. Today, we're focusing on four RPGs and a dungeon crawler. These might seem like obvious choices due to the length of the gameplay, but it isn't only about time to completion. RPGs encourage getting into a rhythm as we learn the combat mechanics. The longer you put the game down in between play sessions, the more likely you are to lose the story thread and not remember what's going on. Here are five games we think you ought to get cracking on and finish before going back to classes, homework and projects. We're thinking about the players who have multiple Commander Shepards they've taken through the first two Mass Effect games, and who want to see the story in Mass Effect 3 from both the Paragon and Renegade angles. The experiences can be different enough to be worth the time, but the Mass Effect 3 campaign can run as long as long as 45 hours if you're doing all the side quests. Even if you're all set with the campaign, the co-op multiplayer is deep and has over two dozen different class/species combinations to rank up, not to mention the Reinforcement Pack system which requires a lot of earned credits to unlock and level up all the different weapons. You'll probably have time during the school year for the DLC packages that BioWare keeps releasing. If you still have big chunks of this game left to finish, now's the time to save Earth. Diablo III is a rinse-and-repeat game. You run through the story on Normal, then you run through again on Nightmare and it starts to get challenging. Hell is really tough and you'll need max level characters to stand a chance on Inferno. You'll get better loot the tougher the game gets, but it's going to come down to skill, not your gear, if you're looking to take down the big man waiting for you at the end of the game. Considering there are five different character classes, if you want to get the most out of Diablo III you're going to need to run each class through four different playthroughs. Add the time you're going to want to spend in the Auction House keeping your gear up to date and selling your excess stuff to make more gold to buy those expensive weapons and armor pieces, we're talking about a substantial commitment here. There's also a PvP release at some point in the future that you'll want to get max level and well-equipped characters ready for. When people talk about the size of this open-world fantasy game, Skyrim comes up pretty often, which should tell you everything you need to know. Dragon's Dogma can take up to 70 hours to beat if you go for all the side quests, so there's plenty of game even before we look at the pawn system. Pawns, or hirelings, are sometimes given to you by the game. Other times, you can pick up the minions created by other players if you happen to be online. This means experimenting with pawns and checking out what other players have done with them is part of the fun. You can take up to three pawns with you, so you can mix and match different classes to see what works best or is most interesting. Respecs are also easy if you want to change up your own style. Dragon's Dogma may ask for a lot of your time. But the creature animations are so good and the epic feel of the battles is conveyed so well that you're going to have every motivation to try different pawns and class styles, and really sink your teeth into those fights. This is one game you'll want to thoroughly enjoy, not burn through just to get to the end. Risen 2 might take you around 30 hours to beat - at the easiest difficulty setting. Some players have referred to the combat as ""sadistic."" It can take you half that time just to get your character up to a skill level where fighting becomes a little easier to handle, and it also gets interesting with voodoo magic and varied combat techniques. That might not make the game sound very attractive, but the unique pirate theme, the varied environment, the island explorations, and the amusing voice acting have made Risen 2 worth it for a lot of players. If you're going to tackle this game, it's going to require a little dedication and attention. Start on this game before the school bell rings. It might take up to 50 hours to complete a playthrough of The Witcher 2 , and then you're probably going to want to return to Act 1 and make some different choices. Story decisions in this game can be more meaningful than in most RPGs, and the repercussions of those choices can lead to vastly different experiences. The complexity of the story in The Witcher 2 at times can especially make this a game you want to dedicate yourself to versus putting it down for long breaks, and losing track of what's going on. This is also another game with punishing combat that adds to how long your playthroughs take and how much patience you need to marshal. Making different choices on a second playthrough can lead to such a different experience that it's not about an altered nuance to a scene or a new line of dialogue but getting entirely new scenes altogether and a completely different campaign. The replay value of The Witcher 2 is extremely high, so it's worth putting the time in. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Instruction

25917	"Altmeier should have been stuffed by Paxo Philip Booth 18 November 2011 Newsnight this week had, for them, a reasonably balanced piece on the proposed EU transactions tax on Wednesday evening. There were some people in favour and some against before an interview between Jeremy Paxman and the German ruling party Chief whip, Peter Altmeier. However, in typical BBC style, the proponents of the tax were put forward as people who wished to tax the rich and help the poor and the opponents as people who were acting in their own self interest and believed that the tax simply could not work. Not only that, it was pitiful in its failure to dig down to the real issues -- something, of course, which is a feature of its eurozone coverage. Let us dissect the broadcast, which you can watch here . (The time of the references to each aspect is given if you wish to watch them again). At 16:52, we are told that the UK has a responsibility to act in the interests of the EU as a whole (by a German politician) and not in the interests of the UK alone. Whether this is true is not something I am concerned with here. However, British self-interest was accepted as the basic premise of the case against a transactions tax. However, the opponents of the transaction tax believe it is a bad thing for any country or groups of countries that impose it. The fact that it hurts Britain most is unfortunate, but not the main issue. It is a bad tax for the EU! This issue was never pressed. At 17:47 we are told that the Pope agrees with the transactions tax. This is simply untrue and is incredibly sloppy journalism. We have no idea what the Pope's views are on the matter (understanding his general political philosophy, my suspicion is that, out of humility and an understanding of those things he knows he does not understand, he has no view on the matter). The idea was put out for discussion in a paper by the Justice and Peace Commission but it is quite possible that the Pope did not even read it before it was published -- and if he did we will probably never know if he approved of it or not. At 18:00 we had Max Lawson from the Robin Hood Tax campaign group tell us that it was great to tax casino banking to give the money to the poor. Good for him, he got his point over well. However, at no point in this long Newsnight piece, was there a discussion of who will bear the burden of this tax. It will be, of course, some combination of bank account holders, bank shareholders (future pensioners), savers who hold shares that are traded, and mortgage account holders whose mortgages are hedged in risk management processes, together with, perhaps, some rich bankers and hedge fund managers. The fact is that we have little idea where the burden of this tax will fall. Surely, this is a point that should be analysed on a programme such as Newsnight. Lawson said (and, again, all credit to him -- he did his job well) that there was a two to one majority in favour of this tax. It all goes to show that the better you disguise a tax the more people favour it -- this is not an especially moral position! We then have the interview with Peter Altmeier (17:50) where Paxo was on very poor form. He started by asking Altmeier whether it had been estimated how much the tax would raise. He said ""no"" and suggested that discussions were just beginning. Paxo got the same answer to a question about how many jobs would be lost and then queried -- but did not press when Altmeier moved on to a different issue -- whether he was aware that the British government was saying that the European Commission suggested that 500,000 jobs would be lost. A better briefed journalist would not have referred to George Osborne's reference to an EC report, he would have thrown the facts from and implications of the EC report repeatedly at the interviewee: especially as the interviewee was from Europe and justifying an EU measure. For example: There is an estimated fall in GDP 1.8 per cent as a result of the tax. Given this, and after allowing for the fact that other taxes would be replaced (e.g. stamp duty on share sales) the net revenue will be negative! As it happens, the estimate of 500,000 jobs lost comes not from the European Commission but from a separate EU report, but the point should still have been pressed. But this also just goes to show, journalists really should not use secondary sources -- or at least not politician's quotes of secondary sources. This is the second example in a single feature of a mistake being introduced into the discourse as a result of doing so. Indeed, there is much discussion in the public domain about the very issues on which Altmeier majored. Altmeier suggested that the tax would lead to more proper primary trading and less high frequency trading. Unfortunately, because a primary trade is passed through a series of counterparties, a primary trade could end up being taxed at nine times the rate of a single high-frequency trade. There may be an answer to this point -- but why was the point not pressed? The case for a financial transactions tax is alarmingly weak. I feel quite sure that if this had been a free-market measure justified by an economic liberal, an interviewee would not have had the same easy ride. www.robinhoodtax.org has a vote on the tax; I propose voting no although the vote is a foregone conclusion. I'd point out that Robin Hood took money back from tax collectors gave it to those they oppressed. This is a Sheriff of Nottingham tax! Submitted by len shackleton on Fri, 18/11/2011 - 15:28. You are right Philip. It is disappointing to see today that David Cameron has again said he favours such a tax if it could be imposed on a global scale. Even if everyone from the United States to North Korea imposed a FTT it would still be a very bad move. Interesting to look at the history of this proposal, which is now a million miles from the original Tobin idea. That was a Keynesian scheme intended to ""throw sand in the wheels"" of currency transactions in an environment where exchange rate instability was the perceived problem (just after Nixon had ended Bretton Woods). The money raised was to go the IMF to enable it to mitigate what Tobin expected to be a hugely unstable situation. He was wrong. Nowadays the tax is aimed at a much wider set of transactions, to deal with a completely different perceived problem, with the money paid into some as-yet-unexplained scheme to raise living standards in the Third World - despite fifty years of failure of large-scale international aid programmes. Submitted by Philip on Fri, 18/11/2011 - 18:39. I might add that the Justice and Peace Commission did not even definitely propose the idea, it suggested that it might be reflected on. It is disappointing that Rowan Williams could not even get his facts right about this matter. "	Opinion/Argumentation	News
27582	"They Saved Lisa's Brain was directed by Pete Michels and written by Matt Selman , although the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer . It featured the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle and was the first episode in which theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking guest-starred as himself. The Simpsons staff wanted Hawking to guest-star because they needed someone who would be smarter than all of Springfield's Mensa members, and because they had heard that he was a fan of the show. The episode features references to Star Trek , painter Vincent van Gogh and architect Frank Lloyd Wright , and mentions the theory of the universe being toroidal , the same shape as a doughnut . In its original broadcast, ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" was seen by approximately 6.8 million viewers, a very low amount for the series. Following the episode's broadcast, Selman made a controversial statement about East St. Louis , which was pronounced the least livable city in the United States in the episode. While the episode received mixed reviews from critics, Hawking's appearance garnered critical acclaim, and has since appeared in several lists of best guest appearances on The Simpsons . Hawking has since appeared in three episodes, and an action figure based on his cameos in the series has been produced. Although Hawking has stated that he enjoyed guest-starring on The Simpsons , he has also mentioned that his cameos have made many people mistake him for a fictional character. Contents A low-fat pudding, Grandma Plopwell's, is the sponsor of a Springfield contest that promises a luxurious trip to the most disgusting and dimwitted contest participant in town. Many Springfield residents enter the contest, but things do not go well when Rainier Wolfcastle (one of the judges) declares himself the winner for ""being seen with you freaks."" The contest ends in a riot and Lisa ends up hit in the face twice with pudding. Lisa denounces Springfield for its anti-intellectualism in an open letter that ends up in the newspaper (which no one reads). This impresses Springfield's Mensa chapter, which accepts her for membership after Principal Skinner shared her placement tests and she brought them a pie for their latest meeting. She joins Mensa alongside Comic Book Guy , Dr. Hibbert , Principal Skinner , Professor Frink , and Lindsay Naegle . After the pleasantries, Lisa finds herself at home alongside Mensa members, whose sense of humor is so brainy that it is said to be enjoyed by the "" Dennis Miller ratio"" of Americans. After being bullied out of their reserved gazebo at a park by some drunks and Chief Wiggum, they fear that Springfield's quality is down because of the city's stupidest residents having power over their civic institutions. The Mensa group goes to confront Mayor Quimby about the gazebo incident, until he escapes from the city by plane when he mistakenly thinks the group has evidence about his corruption. The town's constitution states that in the absence of the mayor, the town is to be governed by the smartest people in it. Now in control of Springfield, the group hopes that things will become better in town. Once in control, however, the group allows power to go to their heads. At first they efficiently implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years ) further expose the rifts inside the group. The angry Springfield townspeople, furious at the new laws, surround the intellectuals in an angry mob and bring an end to Mensa's rule, and would have seriously injured Lisa if not for the intervention of Dr. Stephen Hawking . The brilliant professor has shown up to see what the Mensa group is up to and makes it clear he is unimpressed. In the end, Stephen Hawking and Homer meet at Moe's for a drink. Homer imitates Hawking in an attempt to make him pay the tab and gets punched by a boxing glove on a spring, which is concealed in Hawking's wheelchair. In the episode's other storyline, Homer steals a gift certificate during the post-contest chaos and has erotic photos taken of himself to give to Marge as a gift. She enjoys them a lot, but gets distracted by the interior design Homer did in their basement. ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Pete Michels . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 9, 1999. Although the episode's first draft was written by Selman, the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer . In the episode's setpiece , Homer and Bart participate in a gross out contest, while Marge and Lisa are in the audience. According to Selman, the writers took inspiration from real gross out contests, which were ""sweeping the nation"" at the time. Before the contest in the episode, the spectators are given free samples of a pudding called Grandma Plopwell's. The name of the pudding was inspired by a brand of pies called Aunt Freshly, which the Simpsons writers usually ate at the time. [ 1 ] English theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking (pictured) guest-starred as himself in the episode. The episode features the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle , a sleazy businesswoman who has since become a recurring character in the series. While different versions of the character had appeared in the series before, namely in the season 9 episode "" Girly Edition "" and the season 10 episode "" Make Room for Lisa "", the character's final design was first seen in ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"". [ 2 ] The episode also mentions the character's name for the first time. Naegle's name was partly based on Selman's agent Sue Neagle, and Lindsey was chosen as the first name because Selman thought it sounded ""annoying"" and ""pretentious."" [ 1 ] Naegle is voiced by Tress MacNeille , who Selman described as a ""huge asset"" to the series, and stated that she ""breathes life"" into the character. [ 1 ] ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" features English theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking as himself. According to executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean , Hawking was asked to guest-star because ""we [they] were looking for someone much smarter than all the Mensa members [in Springfield],"" and so they ""naturally thought of him."" [ 3 ] Selman added that the Simpsons staff had heard that Hawking was a fan of the show, and that Hawking's family members wanted him to guest-star. [ 1 ] Bill Mann of The Press Democrat argued that Hawking was chosen to guest star in order to boost the series' ratings during the May "" sweeps "". Mann wrote that ""sweeps"" are ""used to set local TV ad rates for the months ahead."" [ 4 ] In her book Stephen Hawking: a biography , Kristen Larsen wrote that Hawking almost missed his recording session, as his wheelchair broke down two days before his flight to Los Angeles, where the recording took place. In order to make the necessary repairs, Hawking's graduate assistant Chris Burgoyne, aided by a technician, worked a 36 hour shift. [ 5 ] Hawking was 40 minutes late when he arrived in Los Angeles. When he met the Simpsons staff, he apologized, saying ""Sorry for being late."" [ 6 ] According to Selman, Hawking was very humble regarding the episode's jokes about him, and stated that he ""took a lot of shots"" at himself. The only note that Hawking gave regarding the script was that he did not want to be portrayed as drunk in the episode's last scene, in which he is discussing astronomy with Homer in Moe's tavern. [ 1 ] Because of his motor neurone disease , Hawking is unable to speak, and he communicates using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking writes a text onto the computer, which is then spoken by a voice syntheziser . Because of this, Hawking had to write all his lines on his computer, while the staff recorded them by placing a microphone in front of the computer's speaker. ""It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show,"" Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. ""Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he typed in himself and we recorded with our microphones as if had come out of a regular mouth."" [ 1 ] Some of Hawking's lines were difficult to record. In particular, the word ""Fruitopia"" was difficult for Hawking's computer to ""put together"" correctly, and it ""took forever"" to make the word sound right from the voice synthesizer. [ 6 ] In their book The Simpsons and philosophy: the d'oh! of Homer , William Irwin, Mark T. Conard and Aeon J. Skoble wrote that ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" in detail explores ""the possibility of a utopian alternative to politics as usual in Springfield."" They described ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" as an ""epitome"" of The Simpsons diverse comedic humor, and wrote that it can be ""enjoyed in two levels,"" as both ""broad farce"" and ""intellectual satire."" As an example of the episode's farcical humor, they referred to the episode's subplot, which, they wrote, ""contains some of the grossest humor in the long history of The Simpsons ."" At the same time, the episode is ""filled"" with what they described as ""subtle cultural allusions,"" such as the design of Mensa group's locale, which is based on American architect Frank Lloyd Wright 's house. Likewise, Lisa's challenge to Springfield calls attention to the ""cultural limitations of small-town America,"" while the episode also argues that intellectual disdain for the common man can be carried too far and that theory can ""all to easily lose touch with common sense."" They also argued that the episode, as well as the series as a whole, offers a kind of intellectual defense of the common man against intellectuals, which they opined ""helps explain its popularity and broad appeal [...] [""They Saved Lisa's Brain""] defends the common man against the intellectual, in a way that both the common man and the intellectual can understand and enjoy."" [ 7 ] One of Hawking's lines in the episode references the theory that the universe is shaped like a toroid. Shown here is a torus, a type of toroid. In the last scene in the episode, Hawking and Homer are seen discussing the universe in Moe's tavern. Scully stated that the scene was included because it ""was a chance to get the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place."" [ 8 ] In the scene, Hawking tells Homer ""Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it."" In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can teach us about physics, robots, life and the universe , Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a ""donut-shape,"" the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus . The generalization of a torus, any closed curve spun in a circle around an axis, is called a toroid . According to Halpern, Hawking's line references the fact that there are ""genuine"" scientific theories that the universe is toroidal. [ 9 ] One of the judges for the gross out contest in the episode's is Madeleine Albright , who was the current US Secretary of State at the time. [ 10 ] During the riot that follows the contest, a travelling exhibition of Van Gogh 's paintings is burned to flames. [ 7 ] In the episode's subplot, Homer hires a photographer to take erotic pictures of him. The design of the photographer was based on American portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz . [ 11 ] The song that plays during the photographing scenes is "" I'm Too Sexy "" by English pop trio Right Said Fred . [ 10 ] During the rules and regulations announcement, Comic Book Guy declares that sexual intercourse will only be permitted once every seven years in Springfield. This is a reference to pon farr , a term used in the Star Trek franchise to describe the psychophysical effect of the estrous cycle that affects the fictional race Vulcans every seven years. [ 3 ] The episode also mentions actress Geena Davis and cartoonist Mell Lazarus , both of whom are members of Mensa. [ 11 ] In its original American broadcast on May 9, 1999, ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" received a 6.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research , translating to approximately 6.8 million viewers. It finished in 54th place in the ratings for the week of May 3–9, 1999. [ 12 ] The episode's viewership was considered very low by the Boston Herald , who noted that it reached ""historic lows"" in the ratings. [ 13 ] In a scene in the episode, Comic Book Guy announces that Springfield is in 299th place on a list of the United States' 300 most livable cities. East St. Louis is in last place. A journalist for a ""local East St Louis [news]paper"" noticed this, and called Selman to ask him why they were ""taking a shot at East St Louis."" [ 1 ] Selman jokingly replied: ""because it's a crack-ridden slum."" [ 1 ] After the interview, he went on vacation in Greece for two weeks. [ 1 ] While Selman was on vacation, executive producer and the episode's showrunner Mike Scully received a phone call from The Simpsons publicist Antonia Coffman, who reported that Selman's comment on East St Louis had been taken ""very seriously"" by the newspaper. The Simpsons staff received several angry letters from East St Louis' residents, demanding an apology. Because Selman was out of reach, the other staff members had to take care of the controversy. [ 14 ] When Selman returned, Scully scolded him and told him that he had to apologize to the mayor of East St Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore . Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's , had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an ""Oscar-worthy performance."" [ 1 ] ""I was terrified,"" he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, ""[we had] a twenty-minute discussion in which [Wilmore] said that [his] children were teased at school [because of Selman's comments], and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..."" [ 1 ] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, ""Well, everyone participates, you know[...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?"" [ 15 ] Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw ""all the other writers laughing."" ""I was so relieved,"" he said, ""I was soaked with sweat[...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to get them in trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was."" As compensation for his involvement with the joke, Wilmore was given a role in the season 11 episode "" It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge "", in which he played a psychologist. [ 16 ] In 2002, Wilmore became a writer on The Simpsons . [ 14 ] On August 7, 2007, ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. Mike Scully, Matt Selman, Ron Hauge, Rich Appel, Marc Wilmore and Pete Michels participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. [ 17 ] Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, DVD Town's James Plath described it as one of the season's better episodes. [ 18 ] Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that, while episodes that revolve around Lisa tend to be ""less popular"" than others, he considered ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" to be ""well done."" [ 19 ] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a mixed review, writing ""I like the fact that 'Brain' pokes some fun at Mensa, one of the more smug, self-congratulatory groups to be found. The show manages a few good laughs as it goes after various pretensions."" However, he added that ""the show peters out after a while,"" and that it ""never becomes particularly memorable."" [ 20 ] A reviewer for Currentfilm.com wrote that, while the episode ""isn't without its charms,"" it ""just don't hold up very well."" [ 21 ] Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is ""great if you think palindromes are funny,"" and added that it was one of the season's worst episodes. [ 22 ] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide described it as a ""retread"" of the season 9 episode "" Lisa the Simpson "". They wrote ""Once we're past the How Low Will You Go show, the episode takes a nose-dive until the last few minutes."" They concluded their review by calling the episode ""Very, very tedious."" [ 10 ] Hawking's appearance in the episode was lauded by critics. Although they generally disliked the episode, Martyn and Wood wrote that Hawking's cameo ""saves [the episode] from being very boring."" [ 10 ] Plath called the performance ""very funny,"" [ 18 ] while Jane described it as ""great."" [ 19 ] Hawking reached seventh place in UGO 's list of The Simpsons 's ""Top 11 Guest Stars,"" [ 23 ] and finished in fourteenth place in ""The Simpsons 20 best guest voices of all time"" by Ryan Stewart of The Boston Phoenix . Stewart wrote that Hawking's line """"Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe intrigues me, Homer. I may have to steal it"" was a ""memorable"" quote from the episode. [ 24 ] Ethan Alter of The Morning Call described Hawking's cameo as one of the series' ten best, and wrote that Hawking's best line in the episode was ""I wanted to see your Utopia, but now I see it is more of a Fruitopia."" [ 25 ] Writing for IGN , Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski placed Hawking at number sixteen on their list ""Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances."" They wrote that he had a ""fairly major"" role in the episode, and that he had ""several great lines."" [ 26 ] After the episode aired, Hawking told the Simpsons staff that he ""loved"" all the jokes and in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, he stated that his guest appearances on The Simpsons were ""great fun."" [ 27 ] An action figure based on Hawking's appearance in The Simpsons has been produced, with the figurine's computer screen reading ""If you're looking for trouble, you've found it,"" a line from ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"". [ 1 ] Since ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"", Hawking has guest-starred three times on The Simpsons . In 2005, he appeared in the season 16 episode "" Don't Fear the Roofer ""; in 2007, he starred in the season 18 episode "" Stop or My Dog Will Shoot ""; and in 2010, he appeared in the Season 22 premiere "" Elementary School Musical ."" [ 26 ] However, Hawking has also expressed dissatisfaction regarding the impact of his appearance in the episode. In a debate with physicist Brian Cox in The Guardian , Hawking was asked what the most common misconception about his work was. He replied, ""People think I'm a Simpsons character."" [ 28 ] Writing for The Daily Telegraph , Peter Hutchison argued that Hawking ""feels he is sometimes not properly recognised for his contribution to our understanding of the universe.""

20620	"NRL plays a tactical game with radio rights 2GB are keen to keep their rights exclusive for all but the Monday night game which belonged to Triple M. Triple M are keen for more games than just Monday night and 2UE are keen to get back into the game and wrest the rights from arch rival 2GB. The NRL, of course, is keen to wring every last dollar and every last concession out of the deal. To them, coverage is almost as important as cash. With all three networks plus the ABC determined to land the best deal for themselves, no wonder negotiations (as of yesterday afternoon) are still going on. Sources say that while MRN and 2GB has put up the most cash so far in its bid to retain exclusivity, a consortium between Fairfax's 2UE, 4BC and Bill Caralis' Super Network offers the best coverage of NSW regional markets. Triple M, though, could be the dark horse in this three (commercial) horse race. It too could do a deal with Caralis and then add a slew of its own SCA stations to the coverage map in both NSW and Queensland led by Triple M, Brisbane. SCA Head of Content Craig Bruce was hesitant to divulge details of the SCA bid, ""I can't go into the specifics, obviously, that will be sorted over time."" But it's clear that Triple M sees football as pivotal to their blokey image, ""We have enjoyed our involvement with the NRL up to this point. And we target men. They love the NRL in both in Brisbane and Sydney and if we can be a part of  that, it would be a great thing for both Two and 4Triple M,"" says Bruce. When asked how many games he was looking to broadcast he would only say, ""More than one."" but then he adds, ""We have a model that obviously works really well with the AFL in Melbourne and we think we can do a version of that in Sydney and Brisbane and I guess time will tell what we end up with."" The obvious question then is, how many AFL games does Triple M, Melbourne broadcast? The answer is four. It shares rights with 3AW, SEN and the ABC. Logic suggests, then, if AFL works for Triple M in Melbourne with four games a week then that would be a good number of NRL games to call in Sydney, Brisbane and the regions. If Triple M get their four, it will be interesting to see who gets the other four. 3 Comments For too long, 2GB and Macquarie have masqueraded a weekend less than humorous six hour drivel as a rugby league program, onselling it to regional markets. The review of NRL radio rights presents the ideal opportunity for that exclusivity deal to be shut down for all time. Why not allow multiple commercial radio stations to cover the NRL, in much the same way as the AFL is handled? That way, decent rugby league coverage can be achieved without the garbage that the ""continuous call team"" presents all season disguised as rugby league. 2UE/4BC, 2MMM/4MMM and the so-called Super Radio Network between them will multiply the reach and steer us back to serious coverage of this great game. chadsterboi 02 Nov 2012 1:20 pm We need coverage in rural and regional area. In Newcastle the second biggest city in NSW we get ABC for all games, but no games on commercial radio on Sundays. Its a joke - we need to get 2SM and 2UE to team up and allow the game into these areas. Plus, it will give other callers an opportnity to have a go. "	News	News
25956	Preparing the next generation Key to the successful evolution of any family business is the development of the younger generation of the family members for the leadership, commercial and general business skills demanded of the family by the business. In addition, younger generations should understand the responsibilities that success can bring, and how best to ensure their positions of commercial influence and the benefits given to them by personal affluence, are deployed in ways which will give them the best chance of fulfilled, productive and happy lives. Key challenges include: Development of family members involved in the business and preparing them for future leadership if appropriate Educating the next generation to be responsible owners of the business Encouraging them to be responsible with wealth Developing a cohesive team in the next generation which can work together to arrive at consensus, allowing continued business success and family harmony. Challenges facing the next generation The next generation often have a tough act to follow. This, coupled with the normal challenges of family life, presents a particularly demanding set of challenges, including: Increased choices - not all will want to join the business straight from study, if at all The pressure of living up to expectations Sibling rivalry Knowing how to connect with the business if they are not directly involved Changing lifestyles - children in family Businesses are often raised in a culture of wealth and entitlement Loneliness and/or a lack of peers within the business. Negotiating such challenges successfully and supporting and preparing the next generation is key to enabling them to unlock their full potential and allow smooth transition of the family Business from one generation to the next. Trans-generational entrepreneurship The key to long-term business success lies in the ability to build and sustain an entrepreneurial family. Family businesses are the engine that drives socioeconomic development and wealth creation around the world, and entrepreneurship is a key driver of family business. Entrepreneurial thinking and leadership are fundamental factors in the creation of new enterprises and the sustained competitive advantages of corporations both large and small. The ability to create and foster an entrepreneurial mindset across generations is a major element of family business continuity and longevity and is instrumental in effective strategic execution, innovation and growth. In market economies (where resources are allocated by supply and demand), entrepreneurial family businesses are a primary source of job creation. In transition economies (in countries moving from a state-planned to a market-based system), the family unit is often the only intact socioeconomic institution capable of supporting entrepreneurial activities. The family also plays a leading role in new venture formation, often serving as the primary source of start-up capital, not to mention cheap labour and know-how. Another benefit of entrepreneurial family enterprises is that they tend to be community-minded and support philanthropic causes. What is entrepreneurship? The concept of entrepreneurship derives from Richard Cantillon, an Irish economist working in France whose theory was published posthumously in 1755. Cantillon recognised the entrepreneur as an individual who accepts an element of uncertainty in the course of profit-seeking business activity. A wide variety of organisations have adapted entrepreneurial concepts as a means to compete in a changing and challenging environment. Three types of entrepreneurship are noteworthy today: New venture formation : Creative human action that builds something of value from almost nothing through the pursuit of opportunity beyond the resources one actually controls Corporate entrepreneurship (?intrapraneurship?) : Activities inside a corporation where individuals champion new ideas ? from development to profitable reality. Social entrepreneurship : Generation, development and implementation of new ideas and behaviours that build dynamic capabilities and differentiate and organisation from its competitors. Regardless of what form it takes, entrepreneurship links people?s vision, commitment and passion to a common cause. A must for family business Over the next decade, as the Australian population ages, many family businesses are expected to change hands. Since the average life span of an Australian family firm is only 2X years, and a mere one-third of these businesses survive into the next generation, it?s imperative for business to foster entrepreneurship across generations to increase the chances that their businesses will be amongst the survivors Several key principals of entrepreneurship ? such as the focus on high achievement, wealth creation and community spirit ? can be useful in addressing the challenges that occur when several different family branches or generations are involved in the business. A family that is committed to these principles is well positioned to create and sustain individual and family growth and learning. This is especially important in today?s fast paced global environment, with entrepreneurship increasing and new family firms emerging around the globe. Entrepreneurship across generations Trans-generational entrepreneurial behaviour in family business goes beyond simply increasing sales, head count or profits. Family business entrepreneurs create and support a growth and learning orientated culture in both the family and the business, and they reinforce entrepreneurial behaviour in their relatives of all ages. They encourage successors to be alert to their environment so as to spot and take advantage of profit opportunities. At the foundation is a loving and learning family that fosters cooperative family dynamics between generations over time. Trans-generational entrepreneurship is built around two central principles: Entrepreneurial vision and mission : There must be a drive to create trans-generational wealth for the business and its owners. This is rooted in a growth orientation that motivates the family, the ownership group and their non-family managers to be forward thinking and to communicate and pursue specific strategic expansion plans for the business. Dynamic and adaptive family values : While there is a commitment to family traditions, the family must be able to adapt to changes over time. The family must be committed to open communication, the use of formal protocols and policies and conflict resolution. The entrepreneurial mindset Enterprising families work together to define the role and context of entrepreneurship in their family and business. They are committed to the long term and enlist champions among ownership groups, key family members and non-family managers. These families explore the history of entrepreneurship in the family business, including actual examples from the past and present, and discuss ideas for the future within this context. This process helps entrepreneurs understand the role the family has played and what it can do to advance and perpetuate success in the future. Enterprising families are ?people centric? ? they focus on teamwork and on the internal and external relationship building. In addition, the family business leadership identifies, agrees upon and pursues a clearly outlined strategic direction. This strategy emphasises entrepreneurial behaviours such as market expansion, technological advancement, and refinement of operational activities and processes. Research has shown that entrepreneurial families embrace five fundamental principles of entrepreneurship across successive generations Entrepreneurial leadership : The ability to anticipate future circumstances, maintain flexibility, think strategically and work with others to initiate change that will create a viable future for the business. Opportunity recognition : The capacity to imagine dramatically new ideas or to find new ways to differentiate existing products or services to create and sustain cost effective and profitable competitive advantage and customer satisfaction. Internal continuum of entrepreneurial activity : A people-centred strategy emphasising organisational systems, structures and practices that encourage innovation and creativity and do not present insurmountable road blocks to flexibility and fast action. Balanced strategic positioning : A strategic vision that is defined, translated, communicated and aligned operationally across the entire organisation through the balancing of performance metrics and compensation programs as envisioned from multiple financial and non-financial perspectives. Future-based orientation : People are encouraged to perceive opportunities and empowered to embrace change, control costs, enhance product/service quality, and improve offerings and services through innovation and learning. Creating and maintaining an entrepreneurial mindset is vital for socioeconomic growth and sustained competitive advantage in today?s dynamic marketplace. Entrepreneurs speculate, anticipate and direct resources in pursuit of profitable business activities under uncertain conditions. Trans-generational entrepreneurship promotes a common vision and mission among key family business stakeholders across generations. This inclusive, forward-looking strategy creates a set of adaptive values and protocols that promotes family unity and business acumen. Generation barriers For many family businesses, the ability to communicate through generational barriers is crucial for the ultimate success and longevity of the business. BDO has worked with family business across generations for many years and the company has repeatedly stressed the importance of fostering the powerful and synergistic release of cross-generational sharing, learning and performance. New Perspectives Businesses generally recruit along two distinct lines. Hiring youth allows companies to remain competitive and cutting edge whilst maturity provides access to knowledge and experience. With each new generation, the view of what is ?normal? changes. This separation of ideas coupled with the emotional ties found within family businesses and the gap between generations begins to widen. The most successful organisations in today?s markets understand the importance of generational integration and the value that each individual?s skill set and knowledge brings to the business. Similarly, a family business needs to recognise that each generation brings something new, different and valuable to a family firm. If you are a parent, you are probably the founder of your business and now have the opportunity to position your children as your business successors. Your role is not an easy one. Mastering and mentoring or teaching is somewhat like mastering the rhythm and beat associated with playing a musical instrument. Understanding the behavioural and motivational differences between generational sub cultures will help you read the music and enable you to play the instrument with confidence and finesse. If you are the children of a silent or baby boomer generation member you are more likely to be from either generation X or Y and have a more challenging role to fill than you imagined. How you handle the responsibility is crucial to the succession process and the future success of your family?s business. By understanding generational characteristics, a family business is more likely to develop an insight into specific generational ?trigger points? ? the things that motivate a member of a specific generation. By developing this understanding, families can begin to remove any conflict and hostility that exists between generations which ultimately benefits the individual, the family and most importantly, the business. The Way Forward Research has indicated that baby boomers enjoy collaborative learning and working in teams so utilising them in a mentoring capacity could be very beneficial. Family businesses need to recognise that mentoring forms a significant piece of a strategic plan to ramp up staff retention and increase the knowledge and skills of talented employees. Younger family members often talk about their disenchantment with the family business, describing the onerous demands or expectations placed on them by parents who have confidence in their abilities, but lack the time or skills to help them succeed. The result is frustration and a fear of failing, with many members of the X and Y generation planning to move on and look for a ?normal? business environment. This means many family businesses fail to successfully explore the potential of cross-generational sharing, learning and performance. By using the more experienced baby boomers with their extensive knowledge, impressive networks and broad-based business experience, you have the ability to buffer the next generation against frustration and create a focus for their career paths. Ultimately, baby boomers can assist successors in acquiring the skills-based knowledge necessary for transferring the management and ownership of the family business into the next generation. Whilst statistics show that many businesses do not survive the hand over to second and subsequent generations, understanding generational differences is the key to surviving the potentially life-threatening stage of business succession. Take the time to mentor the next generation because the only way to shorten the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next is to have someone with more experience to accelerate the succession process. Remember, each individual brings different skills and knowledge to the business and each generation brings something new, different and valuable to the family firm ? use the information available in your business to build solid intergenerational teamwork.

3903	Canada has among the highest rates of breast cancer in the world. The breast cancer risk to women workers, especially those in blue collar jobs, has been largely overlooked by scientists. In addition, workers and their organizations have not received much support in understanding the risks associated with working with chemicals and in taking steps to prevent harm. Addressing this gap, a team of researchers has been examining the occupational breast cancer risk for women working in the automotive sector in the Windsor area, a highly industrial region of Southwestern Ontario. Animal studies have demonstrated that rates of breast cancer are higher in those exposed to certain chemicals, particularly those that can disrupt the endocrine system. There is a growing body of epidemiological evidence showing that humans are likewise affected. Endocrine disruptors, thought to play a role in breast cancer, and carcinogens are present in many occupational environments. Exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals can be particularly significant for women during certain key windows of vulnerability. Such chemicals can be released during various plastics processing procedures, such as heating, pouring, grinding, assembly and decorating. The invited researchers, working with colleagues at the National Network on Environments and Women's Health, will speak about their research, and for the critical need for more attention to this area of study.

916	"Bailouts for banks. Subsidies for chosen industries. Tax breaks for the rich. These are some of the remedies that our government has used in its attempt to fix the economy and reduce unemployment. As we've seen, they don't work. The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness is now proposing that we increase the number of engineers that we graduate -- a strategy driven by fear of a mythical engineer shortage . Vivek Wadhwa is Vice President of Innovation and Research at Singularity University and Arthur & Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University. His other academic appointments include Harvard, Duke and Emory Universities as well as the University of California Berkeley. It's clear that we're just grasping at straws. Meanwhile, globalization continues to wreak havoc on employment. Eventually, it is going to cause entire industries to disappear and force American workers to compete with their counterparts all over the world. The only way we can keep Americans fully employed and maintain our global lead is by constantly improving their productivity and skills. In a bygone era, the skills you learned in school could carry you through your career. But today, lifelong learning is a necessity. Americans have to understand that education doesn't end when they graduate from college. That is when it begins. American companies must be provided with the incentives to invest in their workers as they used to. As recently as the 1970s, America's most respected companies would make significant investments in workforce training. IBM, for example, took non-technical workers and taught them technical skills. They then trained these technicians to be computer programmers, sales reps, or product managers. New recruits received a year or more of training before they were expected to become productive. Today, nearly all American companies, including IBM, expect new hires to be productive on day one. These employees are given a day or two of ""orientation"" at best. Companies routinely fire people whose skills are obsolete and hire replacements with the right skills to maximize quarterly revenue and profits. Employers often fear that if they spend too much on skill development, employees will become more marketable and leave. This logic is based on false assumptions. Industry learned this lesson in one of the most unlikely places: India. In the late '90s, India's IT industry began to grow rapidly. The growth was in response to demand from Western companies to help them fix the Y2K software bug. But Indian industry faced a severe problem: It needed to hire hundreds of thousands of engineers -- a far greater number than its engineering colleges could produce. In 1999, India graduated only 76,000 engineers, and most had received a low-quality education. Indian industry was forced to rethink the way it recruited, trained, and developed its workforce. It started by adapting the best practices of Western companies that were outsourcing to India. Then it started improving on these techniques and methods. India's top firms -- in industries as diverse as IT, banking, and pharmaceuticals -- built their own surrogate education system to train new recruits and retrain older workers.

14550	"How to Stay Focused When All You Want to Do is Give Up So you feel like giving do you? You're not alone. Everyone goes through this in life. For some, it is a daily occurrence, which ultimately leads to giving up. For others, the feeling of giving up strikes just as often, but when it does strike they push through it. Take a guess at which group of people are successful and are able to achieve anything they put their minds to. This is why learning how to stay focused is paramount, especially in the face of adversity when nothing seems to be going to plan or going you way. Staying focused is not hard, it is simple. You just have to remember a few things. How to Stay Focused -- 3 Steps 1.Ask Yourself Why Am I Doing This? For every task you undertake there must be some sort of end goal in mind. There may be some things that you actually want to do, such as losing weight. While others you would rather not be doing, such as working against the clock to meet a deadline for work. In either case, there is an end goal in mind. You clearly want to lose weight in order to have a body you can be proud of; something like that is easy to push through. On the other hand, working to meet a deadline can be hard to push through. But again, an end goal exists, although it may not be obvious at first, which is to earn money to support yourself and your family. So remember, when you feel like giving up and are unable to stay focused, ask yourself, ""Why am I doing this?"" This should easily get you back on track. 2.Eliminate Any Distractions Now more than ever, we live in an age where technology dominates our lives. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with phone calls, emails, Facebook updates, Twitter updates and so on. With all these distractions, it is no surprise that you find it difficult to stay focused. However, the solution is simple. All you have to do is exercise some self discipline. Close your inbox, log out of Facebook, switch off your phone etc. Only you can do these things so there is no excuse to get distracted. 3.Work in Bursts However dedicated a person may be, it is impossible to stay focused for hours at a time. In fact, the majority of people are unable to stay intently focused for more than 30-45 minutes. Therefore, it is a good idea to work in short bursts, making sure that you take 5 minute breaks in between. This only works on one condition though, which is that you must have the self discipline to stay completely focused on the task at hand. The temptation to visit your favourite website or check the news might creep in, but you must avoid giving into this temptation. After all, that is what the 5 minute break is there for. Working in short bursts brings an element of structure to your life. This undoubtedly makes it easier for you to concentrate. Yes, even on those days when you are tired and uninspired. By following the aforementioned tips, you will find that you are able to stay focused more easily than before. However, keep in mind that like anything else in life, the more you practice, the easier it gets.

20571	"The following Q&A is conducted with journalist Margaret Wente, a columnist who has been writing in the Globe and Mail since 1992. Wente, a two-time winner of the Canadian National Newspaper Award for column-writing, has written at length about issues facing higher education today. Sitting down with The EvoLLLution, she discusses the medieval model that higher education follows today, how it is providing a disservice to non-traditional students and explains how competency-based and online models are the wave of the future. In your opinion, what value does higher education -- and do higher education institutions -- provide to society? Higher education has typically been a training ground for the -- let's call them -- ruling elites of society and also for the scholars, the academics, the historians and the keepers of society's values. Typically, higher education has been confined to a very small number of people until quite recently. ... Even as late as post-World War II, only about well under 10 percent of the population in North America has access to higher education so the whole concept of mass higher education is an extremely recent phenomenon. ... Now we've changed our sense of access to higher education and now we accept that higher education should be available to anyone who is qualified and that money shouldn't be a barrier -- people should have help with tuition if they need it in the form of loans and grants and so on. We've also recognized that higher education provides access to a broad range of careers and professions -- that's the way in! Increasingly, that's the way into a whole number of professions including teaching, law, medicine, business and a whole range of other things that typically you didn't need a higher degree for but you do now. You mentioned in your February column, ""We're ripe for a great disruption in higher education"" , that higher education is still reliant on a medieval model. How does this impact its value proposition that it pushes people into careers? The value of proposition of higher education is changing very quickly. Let me give you one really, really graphic example. In the United States today, of current university graduates... only one out of two of them is finding a job that's utilizing his or her skills or education level. The other 50% either can't find work or are taking work that doesn't need their qualifications. ... It used to be that if you got that piece of paper -- that certificate, that degree, whatever it was -- you were pretty certain that your lifelong earnings would be considerably higher than somebody without that degree, and that's still true. But it's less true, it's less true than ever before. Not only that, the differences in what you will be able to earn with your degree are quite sharp. ... The differentiation between the hard sciences and the hard skills and the people who can offer hard skills, and the old line liberal arts degrees, is growing pretty fast. Especially in an age where employers increasingly demand hard skills before they're going to hire you. ... Universities and colleges, generally, have not been very good at all in coming clean with their students -- who are after all their customers, they have to attract students in order to get their grants, they have to put bums in seats -- they've been pretty bad at telling the truth about job prospects and job expectations. We also, of course, have an idea... that university education should not be geared toward any job outcome, it shouldn't be practical, it should just prepare you to think critically, whatever that means. But in the name of thinking critically, an awful lot of people... wind up with a piece of paper that's really not very useful. ... There have been devastating, devastating studies recently about what value university does or doesn't add, and the findings are pretty rough. They show, for example, that universities in fact don't teach students, on the whole, to think more critically. Don't teach them to become better writers and thinkers. And that value everybody assumes gets added really doesn't get added at all. So there's, again, another instance where the value proposition is breaking down. How do you think the competency-based model can improve the desirability of higher education for adult students who may be looking to return, or complete the degrees they started? Competency-based education makes complete sense for later learners and adult learners. The reason why is that it's not based on inputs -- and by inputs I'm talking about things like the number of hours you glue your bottom to a seat in the classroom, the number of credits that you get, the number of years or semesters that you spend in university. Basically, time input. ... That really doesn't do very much to qualify you for many practical things. ... In a competency-based model, you get your degree, your certificate -- you get your ticket stamped -- based on what you know and what you do, rather than the amount of time you spent studying it. ... Some people have the very radical notion that ""Why should we make people go to university at all? Maybe we should just say, 'okay, show up and write the test and do the qualifying exams -- and you can teach yourself if you want -- and we'll certify you! We don't care how you get there.'"" Which is of course a completely different model than the model that we have now, which is completely input-based. ... You focus on outcomes rather than process. Now this really makes sense for... the purposes for which adult learners go back to school. They have a very specific goal in mind, they're practical and they want to get there in the most efficient way possible. They also are not pursuing higher education for many of the reasons that younger people are pursuing it. They don't need the social environment. They don't need the extra-curricular life which is such a big part of university life for so many people. They don't need the sports teams, they don't need to go to the pub on Saturday night. They're really not interested in that kind of stuff. What they want is the learning part. Building on that idea of getting away from the brick-and-mortar, pep-rally-on-Friday approach to higher education, you've discussed online learning in the past and how eLearning will affect the traditional approach to higher education. How do you think online education will improve the desirability of higher education for adult students? Online education and eLearning are going to sweep through higher education and revolutionize it in ways that we cannot even begin to foresee. There are a lot of reasons why. One reason why is the brick-and-mortar model, as it exists now, is increasingly costly. ...The costs of university, just operating the place, are growing faster than the economy is. Especially in a world where public dollars are in scarcer and scarcer supply -- universities have to compete increasingly with healthcare -- anything that will help make university education, higher education more efficient, more effective and cheaper to deliver is going to be in very, very high demand. And the world of online education is, of course, beginning to make that possible. The possibilities are absolutely stupendous. For example, Stanford University, last fall, decided to offer a very high level course in artificial intelligence, taught by the two professors who are the leading minds in AI in the whole world. ... What they said was, ""we're going to open this up to anybody who wants to register for this course, in the world. You don't have to have any pre-requisites for this course, you don't have to write an exam to get into the course. We don't care what your math level is. You can just sign up and if you can pass it, then we'll give you a certificate that says you passed it."" ... There's an example of the democratization of learning that I think we're going to see increasingly as a model that can work. Think of the possibilities of having the best professors in the world lecturing on a subject like AI, supported by lots of teachers and helpers and tutors who can supply hands-on help -- that changes the whole model of university completely, just sets it on its ear. And of course it's very threatening to the current model so it's going to be very, very interesting to see how it's introduced. ... Western Governor's University; here's another model of how to democratize education and make it really, really good for adult learners. These are online courses, in a very narrow range of practical subjects. You sign up for the university, which is offered now in four states... the model is non-profit, here's the way it works. There's no classrooms, no bricks and mortar. All the courses are offered online, and you proceed at your own pace. So if you want to cram and get through the material in a big hurry and load yourself up with courses, and get a degree in three years, you can do that. And in fact, most people who do the online learning at this university get their degree not in four years, but in three or even less. ... They're taking these courses to get to where they want in life efficiently. The degrees are cheap, the quality of instruction is really, really good and the model so far seems to be working really well and is a whole lot more effective than the for-profit institutions like Phoenix, for example, who are packing them in as well. That's just another example of how online instruction is going to be revolutionizing the bricks-and-mortar model. What is holding back change in higher education, and when do you think disruptive models are going to become more prevalent? The disruptive models will become more prevalent because the universities will be driven by having to find lower cost methods of delivery. ... They don't have the money to sustain what they're doing now. The universities are also based on... a kind of medieval model where the wise man stands up in front of the class and delivers. ... We have a caste system in universities with the full professors at the top, who do a whole lot of research and maybe not very much teaching at all -- their teaching loads are very light. The teaching function is filled by very low-paid TAs who may not have had any background in teaching at all. ... In this model, promotion up to a full professor is based on the research that you do, not on the teaching that you do. And the research model, for a whole lot of what's churned out... is really, really broken. Especially in the humanities -- sociology and psychology -- where scholars churn out more and more research, which nobody reads, about less and less stuff. This is obviously not true, or not so true, in the sciences and other so-called hard disciplines. But the system is very, very broken in the humanities and so-called soft areas because society simply is not getting value for money. And we need good teachers, and instead we get people turning out research papers that are published in journals that people can no longer afford and certainly no one reads. So that model needs to change too. It's rapidly -- I hope! -- coming to an end, but there are huge protectionist forces at work. Universities are essentially run by the professors, and do they want to change this model? Of course not, no. Because in a more efficient and effective model, you'd have a whole lot fewer full professors, and a whole lot more teaching professors who mainly teach and interact with people. That essentially blows up the current model, and you can imagine that the current university establishment is deeply, deeply opposed to that kind of change and people who run universities, have in many cases very limited ability to change the current structure. Is there anything you'd like to add on where disruptive education is taking higher education and how adults could find their way back to the academy with a new model? We have a big advantage in this country, in Canada, because we do have the college model which I think serves adult learners very well. The colleges offer focused instruction and they tend to be pretty close to the job market, pretty in tune with the job market, pretty in touch with the job market and what the job market needs in the way of skills. ... Over time, though, I'd like to see people get through the system faster. It shouldn't take four to five or six years to get you where you want to go. And if you're an adult, going back, I think the next few decades are going to offer increasing flexibility and much better value for money. Because the new technologies will unleash a host of possibilities that we cannot even begin to imagine now. And not everything will work, ... but on the whole it's going to be a much easier environment for adult learners and it can't come soon enough! Subscribe to The EvoLLLution, Get Premium Content And Stay Up To Date 5 Responses to AUDIO | Disruption On The Horizon I can't say I agree with your idea that professors are the ones running the universities... I think the entire system is structured in such a way that everyone is very well-cushioned and no one wants to break with status quo. As you say though, these new models are going to sweep through higher education and change it in ways we can't even imagine. Tomorrow can't come soon enough. There are some pointed issues raised in this interview, some of which have are deeply entrenched in the ethos of the higher educational institutions and has been difficult to altered. There is a kind of stubbornness that pervades every aspect of higher education, whether it is on the legislative end, the internal governance, the oversight entities, faculty, staff and sometimes students who are seldom heard. This creates all kind of resistance to change in an era when the decider of the change is the environment and its inner working. The thing to note is that higher educational leaders are not the ones deciding whether to change -- they are commanded to change -- whether they like it or not. We are operating in a different era where globalization drives everything and if higher educational leaders don't get a handle on this reality, some of them might be driven out of existence. The thing is that education realities as we knew them must change so that they are inclusive, fresh, agile, aligned with workplace KSA needs, have built-in quality checks, include systems for continuous improvement and have a clear regard for people, place, process and practice alignment with the global realities. Institution must redefine themselves, know who they and operate with a clear sense of their unique mission. This requires leadership because it includes risk-taking and invasive change to this sitting elephant to move forward. This is a time to leaders to stop asking who will do it. It is time to move forward and do some that give the institution a sustainable future; it is only way forward. With regard to how distance education will improve the desirability of higher education for adult students, Margaret is spot-on that it will ""revolutionize it in ways that we cannot even begin to foresee."" The recent announce of a $60 million Harvard, MIT partnership to offer free online classes, is a great example of how the higher education business model can be disrupted. Here's another: MOOCs are probably the most obvious way that online learning has revolutionized education, but the potential for online goes well beyond simple ease of teaching and learning. We can take our student services online. We can hold face-to-face advising meetings with students from thousands of miles away. I think one of the more salient points from this is the but on competency based education. A little while ago, there was an article published here called ""Those Who Can, Do -- Those Who Can't, Teach"" (obviously, we've all heard the expression). This might sound a little harsh... but if this is true (and let's be honest, these expressions don't come from nothing), would professors have any interest in shifting to competency-based models? Because I think that would lead to a reduction in the imagined expertise we think our educators hold Comptency-based learning needs to be rolled out at every single college and university across North America, regardless of whether it caters to adults, 18 year olds or mechanics-to-be. It makes absolutely no difference to anyone how long you spent in school. In fact, I'd reiterate Ms. Wente's assertion that four years is too long to begin with. How can we assume that ""you spent X amount of time in class"" is equivalent to ""you can functionally complete X task""? We can't, and higher education institutions can no longer hang their hat on this promise. As Wente says, HEI's are lying, but not just to students. They're lying to students, employers and society in general. It's time we made the system fit the promise. "	Other	Promotion
27173	Pages Friday, October 31, 2008 This is not to say that I would not accept a popcorn tin from you. I will. But maybe do BOTH. What did you give for Christmas last year? A sweater? A CD, or DVD? Perhaps a decorative bowl? Maybe this year, you should give something that has some real meaning, like, say, LIFE. You can give the gift of life, and health, and cures for diseases, to any person you know who's expecting a newborn baby. You can do that by giving a Cryo-Cell Gift Certificate . Cryo-Cell is an innovative company that offers parents of newborns a chance to collect and store cord blood stem cells - -stem cells that could be useful in treating 70 different diseases ranging from leukemia to diabetes to cerebral palsy; their company can educate expectant parents about how this works and the benefits to their child from storing that cord blood. And you can help those parents learn by giving them a gift certificate in any amount ($50 increments) to help them store cord blood stem cells that may someday benefit their unborn child-- even saving his or her life. Doesn't that beat a sweater, or one of those popcorn tins? It sure does. To view all of the Cryo-Cell information you can go to their website, and you may want to click right over to the Current Offers they've got available. But what you really need to know is what I've already told you; they'll help parents collect (easily and conveniently and cleanly, in a non-intrusive way) the cord blood. They'll cryogenically store it for future use. And you'll have done something really nice, really meaningful, and really helpful for those parents.

Eventually, Charlie lets Alan in to his group, but Alan begins to irritate everyone and ends up getting himself tied to a streetlamp. Guest stars Elvis Costello , Sean Penn , Bobby Cooper and Harry Dean Stanton as themselves, who are part of Charlie's exclusive group. Title quotation from : Sean Penn, to Elvis Costello, about turning one of Sean's recent events into a song. Judith is dating Jake's pediatrician, Greg ( Ryan Stiles ), and Alan is upset at the thought of Judith being with another man – until Charlie points out that if she remarries, his alimony payments will end, so Alan attempts to befriend him. While giving Greg a massage, Judith walks in on them, and Alan snaps Greg's neck accidentally in panic – causing him to pay more money than he had to in the first place. First appearance of : Greg Melnick (later renamed ""Herb"") Title quotation from : Charlie, in response to Judith telling the pediatrician to ""not forget the garlic balls"". When Jake gets in trouble at school for giving his teacher, Delores Pasternak ( Missi Pyle ), the finger, Charlie decides to woo her as an attempt of saving Jake from being suspended. Jake then catches the two in the middle of the night. When Alan finds out, he insists that Charlie break it off, but later insists that Charlie not because Jake has been getting great grades on his papers. Charlie breaks it off with Delores, anyway, due to the fact she wants a commitment, and she punishes Jake by giving him double the amount of his regular homework. Title quotation from : Alan, reading out Jake's answer to the question, ""What is Sacajawea ?"" on his History test. Jake is very impressed with his mother's new boyfriend, Greg, after Greg teaches him various activities which annoys Alan. Meanwhile, Evelyn borrows Charlie's car to help her impress a Saudi prince she's trying to sell a house to and lends Charlie her electric car. Alan and Charlie then teach Jake how to drive in this car. Judith breaks up with Greg and Alan is there to support her; the two begin to have sex until Jake and Charlie walk in on them, but Jake doesn't believe Charlie when he explains that Alan and Judith were about to sleep together. Title quotation from : Evelyn, to Charlie, asking him to retrieve her $300 bra from his car in which she had sex. Charlie meets his match when he falls for a woman (Sherri, played by Jeri Ryan ) who's better at playing hard to get than he is. After repeatedly using him for sex, Charlie tries to get revenge on Sherri, but ends up punishing himself too. Meanwhile, Alan has a hard time teaching Jake to do his homework, and Jake is upset at the fact Charlie keeps eating all of his food. While out at a family meal, Evelyn lets out a secret of Alan's past – he shop lifted when he was younger. Alan denies having shoplifted a toy as a child and fears he has a dark side, until Charlie admits he planted the toy on Alan to stay out of trouble himself. Alan finds it impossible to forgive Charlie until Evelyn asks Alan to move in with her because of Alan's dislike towards his brother. Title quotation from : The anal Alan, after Charlie questions his habit of flossing after every meal. Charlie and Alan end up having to throw a party for Evelyn at the house. Berta hires her sister, Daisy ( Camryn Manheim ), to help out with the planning, but the two can't stop bickering. Eventually, Charlie has a talk with Daisy, and she agrees to help out. However, this backfires when the guests of the party focus on her singing rather than Evelyn. Evelyn then begins moaning at Alan and Charlie, as does Judith when she thinks they taught Jake to be sarcastic towards her. Alan meets a woman named Nancy at a grocery store, who fulfils every single one of his desires, forcing Charlie to take care of Jake. After only knowing Nancy for a few days Alan decides to ask her to marry him, prompting Charlie to try to talk him out of it, and he even gets help from the brothers' mother. Alan calls Nancy to propose to her, but she then tells him that her husband has returned from his vacation trip early—causing her relationship with Alan to terminate. Title quotation from : Rose, to Charlie, after seeing Alan chase Nancy around the house. (This was a deleted scene from the episode.) When Charlie leaves the house to avoid a date that he can't stand, he ends up at a coffee shop, where he reconnects with his old girlfriend Lisa (Denise Richards), now a divorcée with a child. Meanwhile, Alan walks in on Charlie's date in the shower and she frighteningly attacks him and Jake uses this situation to blackmail Alan; Jake tries numerous excuses to justify why he is getting bad grades. Title quotation from : Lisa, when Charlie asks her to act like a Catholic schoolgirl in bed. Charlie tries to get Jake's approval on a theme song that he is hired to write for a television show, which is based on a comic book of which Jake is a fan. But Jake doesn't like Charlie's idea and the two write a new song instead. Meanwhile, Alan and Rose begin to spend time together and eventually share a kiss; they later decide to remain just friends. After getting unusually turned down at a bar, Charlie learns from Jake that a website has been made dedicated to exposing his lifestyle. Charlie sets out to find who created the site, making amends to all those he stood up, but the website is still standing. It isn't until Charlie apologies to Rose that the website is fully shut down. Meanwhile, Alan thinks that Judith wants to get back with him after hearing her talk to her mother on Jake's webcam. Title quotation from : Berta, when explaining to Alan that she has several tattoos. Alan is jealous of Charlie when an old classmate, Jamie Eckelberry ( Paget Brewster ), who's now a beautiful woman, seems to be more interested in Charlie, before it is revealed that she hates him and worked hard to make herself a beautiful woman to rub his nose in it. She reveals that she used to be interested in Alan when they were younger, but shoots him down after he asks if they could try to go back to that now. Title quotation from : Charlie, when trying to prove to Jamie that Alan is a better man than he is, after Alan tells Charlie to talk him up. Alan invites Judith to stay at Charlie's place after an earthquake severely damages the plumbing in her house. When Judith goes out on a date, Alan becomes extremely jealous and somehow ends up letting Judith throw him out of Charlie's house. Charlie then sets Alan up with a beautiful woman he knows, which makes Judith jealous and leave the house. Title quotation from : Charlie, attempting to tell Alan how to say ""go faster"" in Polish. Alan and Charlie help Jake study for a History test which he passes. When Evelyn manages to make this into a bad thing and sucks the self-esteem out of Jake, Alan furiously throws her out and tells her she can't see her grandson. Later, Alan receives a call that Evelyn has been taken to hospital. He and Charlie realize that it's fake and pretend to go along with it by suggesting surgery. However, when she goes along with the ruse, it makes Charlie and Alan's efforts to expose her futile. The episode ends with Evelyn shown to be temporarily living with Charlie and Alan after the surgery. Title quotation from : A drunk Charlie, when saying to Jake what he likes to eat as a dessert. Alan starts to worry about a medical procedure that he is facing, and to get his mind off it Charlie suggests they go to Las Vegas. Berta overhears this and invites her friends over for a party. However, Jake becomes ill beforehand and then tells Judith everything on the phone. A furious Judith then comes over to scold the two, but Charlie and Alan decide to go anyway until Jake becomes ill again (causing Alan to realize he's going to face it sooner or later). Charlie and Alan then head downstairs after putting Jake to bed to find Berta hosting a party. Title quotation from : Alan, to Judith, after she disbelieves that Jake became ill. When Judith decides to take a vacation, Alan has to take care of Jake during the week. After a hard day at work, Alan forgets to pick Jake up from school, and then finds out that he has an important meeting at work the next day, meaning Charlie has to look after Jake. Charlie then forgets to pick Jake up from school as well. Title quotation from : Jake, as one of his questions to George Washington for his homework. After Charlie has back pain, he refuses to accept help from Alan, who decides to take him to the hospital, where he keeps hitting on his doctor ( Alicia Coppola ), unaware that he has dated her before.

While there Alan shows an interest in Sherri, and decides to ask her out. The problem is that Alan can't get over Sherri's relationship with Charlie, causing her to angrily break up with him. Title quotation from : The sound that Alan uses to name ""the planet"" that Sherri is from immediately after he says to Charlie, ""She's just like a regular person, except for, you know, being from the planet"". [ 20 ] Evelyn rings the house phone, and Charlie answers. Evelyn frustrates him in a matter of minutes. Meanwhile, Alan answers the door to Judith, who ends up frustrating him. Alan and Charlie then take their problems out on each other. The next day, they reconcile, until Charlie finds out that Berta threw out his expensive clothes. Rose steps in to resolve the issue, and they spend the afternoon discussing Charlie and Alan's problems with each other. Title quotation from : Charlie, when explaining to Rose why he told all of his friends that Alan was a shaved monkey. Evelyn reads in the obituaries that her second husband, Harry, has died. They all attend the funeral, including Jake who is excited at the opportunity of seeing a ""dead guy."" Charlie is excited by the opportunity of a newly single widow, and Alan is just happy to pay his respects to Harry. Evelyn tells her sons a secret: her husband had cheated on her, and she still loved him; it turns out that her husband then cheated on the girl with whom he cheated on Evelyn. Title quotation from : Alan, accusing Charlie of hitting on the widow at the funeral. Alan gets a new sports car which everyone claims is a woman's car. When asked where he got the money, Alan claims he ""found it,"" until finally telling Charlie that his mother lent him the money. Charlie warns that she'll want pay back, and sure enough she asks Alan to go on a double-date with her. She then doesn't show up, leaving Alan with his recovering alcoholic date, Trudy ( Chloe Webb ). After she passes out, he takes her home and leaves her in his car, but accidentally leaves the keys in the car and the garage door open. Trudy is then seen on the news driving his car down a freeway at high speed. Title quotation from : Alan, to Trudy, correcting her when she says that her father is doing ""some old hose bag"". Evelyn demands Jake spend a night at her place when she finds out he spent Spring Break with Judith's parents. Neither Alan nor Charlie are keen on the idea, but going to a bar after dropping off Jake quickly erases their concerns when a group of attractive women show up. Evelyn tries to get Jake to eat sushi and squab , which Jake doesn't like. She then makes him spaghetti, which she throws over him after he scares her, making her jump. Jake then takes a bath but leaves the tap on, causing the ceiling to break and the wave of water to come crashing down on Evelyn. Alan and Charlie then decide that Jake is ""the chosen one"" because he ""broke her"" (Evelyn). Title quotation from : Jake, experimenting in different voices the name of the food Evelyn offers him. Jake has to read a report of his weekend to his class. In the report, it is revealed that Charlie slept with an older man's (Norman) wife, who then came to the house to seek revenge on Charlie. Charlie and Norman eventually talk things out, and Norman becomes attracted to Evelyn when she shows up. Evelyn tells Berta, Alan, Charlie and Jake to go and see a movie. When they return, they walk in on Evelyn and Norman having sex. Meanwhile, Jake is oblivious to everything around him (even Norman's wife sneaking out of the house) because he has lost his Game Boy and can't find it. He eventually finds it when taking a pee in the plants. Orson Bean guest stars as Norman, the older man whose wife had slept with Charlie. Title quotation from : Jake, when asking Alan if his Game Boy smells funny. (It is implied that it is because Jake peed on it.) This season was the highest rated season of Two and a Half Men, with an estimate viewership of 16.5 million. Also, the episode ""Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab"", received the show's second highest viewership with 24.2 million viewership, only surpassed by the ninth season's premiere, ""Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt"" with 28.74 million.

25764	Buy & download fulltext article: In 1923 Air Ministry regulations explicitly excluded recruits who were not of `pure European descent' from joining the Royal Air Force. Similar restrictions were placed on the British army and Royal Navy in the interwar period. Such rejection was present but occurred less systematically during the First World War. Kushner analyses the intellectual foundations of this discriminatory policy and the problems of definition it created before September 1939. He then explores how and why policy was changed during the Second World War, asking whether greater inclusivity was based on expediency or a change in attitudes due to the fight against Nazism. In particular, the role of race science is highlighted, explaining the persistence in exclusion of those deemed non-European well beyond 1945. Finally, he argues that the implementation of a wide-ranging colour bar has still to be acknowledged or subject to sustained memory work within the armed services and British society as a whole.

9029	"We're in for a Long, Exhausting World Series It was a surprise to learn that last night's oh boy that happened fast ninth-inning ""comeback"" 2-1 win for the Rangers over the Cardinals in Game 2 of the World Series was the first time a team had lost a ninth-inning lead since Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. Sorry to bring that up, but that does seem like a long time. You mean to tell me that every single time a team has led after eight innings in the World Series for the last ten years they've won the game? That takes some of the drama out of it, don't it? Well, it did until last night. [ Cries. ] Of course, we haven't had a Game 7 of the World Series since 2002, and it kinda looks like we're in for one of those too. Jason Motte, the fireballing former catcher who might have been born with a beard, really only threw one bad pitch last night, a cutter that caught too much of the plate and was ripped by Elvis Andrus for a single in the ninth inning. This was right after a bloop hit by Ian Kinsler, and right before an error by Albert Pujols sent Andrus to second. Before you knew it, the Cardinals had gone from three outs away from a 2-0 World Series lead to a near-impossible situation: runners on second and third, no outs, and the meat of the Rangers' order coming up. We agree with those who say Tony La Russa, whose hot streak finally cooled last night, probably should have left in Motte to face Josh Hamilton; more than anything, the Cardinals needed a strikeout, and they were far more likely to get that from Motte, no matter how rattled he might have been, than from Arthur Rhodes, whose fastball could not dent a Buick. But it's not as if Rhodes and Lance Lynn, who came in after Rhodes gave up a sac fly to Hamilton, were lit up. They each gave up sacrifice flies, and that was all the Rangers needed. By the time La Russa made the switch from Motte, the damage was done. The real problem wasn't the bullpen, as much as it feels like it this morning. (For the record, it also feels like my brain is engulfed in flame this morning, as I type. October baseball, with the late nights and the screaming and the alcohol that comes with it, is hazardous to vital organs.) The problem was the fact that the Cardinals couldn't hit. Jaime Garcia threw seven brilliant shutout innings, but the Cardinals couldn't get him more than one run against Colby Lewis, a solid but hittable pitcher. Albert Pujols didn't stay and answer questions after the game -- a practice that annoys media people and only media people; no one else cares, at all  -- but his 0-for-4 night wasn't the only Cardinals issues. Pujols, Lance Berkman, Matt Holliday, and Yadier Molina, the Cardinals' four All-Star hitters, went a combined 1-for-13 last night. The only run scored thanks to another pinch hit by Allen Craig off Alexi Ogando; you'll be seeing a ton of Craig when the series gets to the American League tomorrow. But the Cardinals can't expect to win with those four guys going 1-for-13. That's what cost the Cardinals last night. Motte just caught some bad luck ... and threw one bad pitch. If you have been enjoying these tight, taut, quick, low-scoring games, that enjoyment is about to end. The series heads to the launching pad  -- such a great baseball term, ""launching pad""  -- and features some league-average starters facing some of the best hitters in baseball. The level of offense in this series is about to increase exponentially. As is the level of tension. The series, so close to a 2-0 Cardinals lead, is tied, and it's gonna be a damned opera every freaking night for the next week. We're in for an all-timer here, folks. It's not going to be easy for anybody. Gird your livers. "	News	News
21717	"Playing on the 'other' Gazza We  arrived  in  the  land  of  big  things  and  took  in  the  new  ground.  Metricon  Stadium  has  a  roof  like  a  crinkle  cut  potato  chip;  a  really  big  potato  chip.  It  curves  around  the  top  of  the  stadium  in  a  horse  shoe  shape  leaving  one  end  open  to  the  world  like  a  giant  front  door. What  does  Metricon  mean?  What  do  they  do?  I  believe  they  build  things. In  Queensland  they  are  trying  to  build  another  football  team;  the  Suns.  But  football  teams  are  made  of  people.  The  building  process  is  infinitely  complicated.  At  least  they  have  a  home. They'll  assemble  the  Suns'  squad  around  a  muscular,  sporting  freak.  A  man  who  can  swivel  and  baulk  with  magic  in  his  legs.  The  ball  sits  in  his  hands  with  the  same  ease  that  a  bunch  of  grapes  lay  in  the  grasp  of  a  Roman  Emperor  and  he  kicks  it  with  uncanny  precision.  He  can  also  run  this  bloke.  It's  an  interesting  gait  that  he  has;  hunched  at  the  shoulders,  low  like  a  prowling  leopard,  a  combination  of  burst  and  bust.  His  shiny,  sweaty  head  makes  him  look  even  more  poised  in  full  flight.  He's  my  little  bald  mate.  He's  Gazza. I'll  play  on  Gazza  but  not  the  one  I  know.  He  won't  be  wearing  the  blue  and  white  hooped  jumper  that  was  once  tattooed  onto  his  body;  he'll  be  wearing  the  jarring  red  guernsey  of  the  Gold  Coast  Suns.  It  sits  awkwardly  on  his  frame  like  a  hat  on  a  horse.  He's  now  our  foe.  But  how  can  he  be  an  enemy?  We  both  have  the  same  premiership  medallions  forged  out  of  blood  and  sweat  and  worn  around  our  necks  on  those  last  Saturdays  in  September  2007  and  2009.  We're  brothers.  Isn't  that  what  premierships  do,  make  men  brothers? But  once  he  puts  on  his  new  red  armour  we  must  try  to  bring  him  down.  We'll  batter  him,  pound  him,  and  exhaust  him  until  his  skill  is  blunted.  It's  an  outrage.  Scotty  wants  me  to  stay  goal  side  of  him.  I'll  do  my  best,  but  it  will  be  a  bit  like  staying  goal  side  of  the  equator.  You  can't  simply  corner  a  player  like  Gazza  for  the  same  reasons  that  you  can't  hold  back  water  with  an  open  hand  or  crush  the  human  spirit  by  erecting  a  wall. The  scoreboard  doesn't  matter.  We'll  win.  A  bigger  battle  will  be  unfolding;  the  battle  with  ourselves.  When  we  crunch  Gazza  we'll  be  crunching  a  little  piece  of  us,  when  we  sing  the  song  in  the  rooms  after  the  game  a  note  will  be  missing. The  fireworks  blast  off,  the  first  siren  sounds,  and  we  go  after  Gazza.  We  block  him,  cajole  him,  and  harass  him.  But  it  seems  the  Suns  have  the  planets  aligned.  Kids  with  pimples  and  blotchy  arms  kick  some  goals  and  we  look  old;  old  and  tired.  We  feel  old.  The  ball  is  falling  their  way  because  they  haven't  been  around  long  enough  to  question  its  shape.  Experience  tells  players  to  be  wary  of  the  oval  ball,  to  acknowledge  the  absurdity  of  the  unpredictable  bounce.  But  a  lot  of  the  Suns  have  no  experience.  The  ball  is  the  toy  and  the  paddock  is  the  stage  and  they  want  to  play. Names  are  placed  in  the  reference  library  of  my  mind  for  future  seasons;  Zac  Smith,  McKenzie,  Swallow,  Weller,  May,  Krakouer.  The  Suns  are  21  points  clear.  Incredible.  We're  scrapping  our  way  around  the  turf  like  a  walrus  on  the  sand.  Red  flags  and  music  bursts  greet  moments  of  joy  for  the  Suns.  In  the  first  half  they  have  nine  of  them. I  find  Gazza  at  the  centre  bounces  when  it's  my  turn  to  block  out  the  sun  in  the  light  towers.  With  each  attack  he  takes  longer  to  get  up.  Skill  is  succumbing  to  the  brutality  of  defence.  We  are  taking  turns  to  knock  the  stuffing  out  of  him.  It  seems  to  me  that  as  Gazza's  energy  is  sapped  so  the  shine  of  the  young  Suns  fades.  He's  the  barometer,  the  peg  in  the  ground  upon  which  the  Sun's  tent  will  be  hitched.  When  it's  loosed  so  are  they.  They  are  learning  about  the  value  of  physical  strength;  of  concerted,  unflinching  concentration.  But  they  are  learning  quickly. Johnno  plucks  the  ball  inside  our  forward  fifty  like  he's  picking  apples  from  a  tree  and  kicks  four  goals  in  the  third  quarter.  The  kids  with  pimples  and  blotchy  arms  fall  apart  like  wet  paper.  Pods  grabs  the  ball  out  of  the  sky,  we  win  it  in  the  middle  and  slice  through  their  hearts  like  a  fisherman  gutting  a  trout.  Thirteen  goals  to  one  after  half  time  kill  the  red  army's  joy. He  went  to  Queensland  for  the  challenge,  for  the  opportunity  to  be  part  of  something  new,  to  lead  a  team  of  youngsters  to  the  dais  on  Grand  Final  day.  He  plays  in  a  team  whose  front  door  is  wide  open,  welcoming  the  locals  to  be  involved  in  the  story.  One  day  they  might  get  there  and  if  they  do  Gazza  will  have  another  family  of  premiership  brothers,  but  I  still  think  he'll  call  Geelong  home. The Suns actually impressed me a lot (even though the Cats were awful early). They'll be good in a few years, especially up there. The young fella McKenzie is the best kick of the football I've seen since Jarman. I agree re Trent McKenzie. Played his early junior football at Altona before coming across to Williamstown for a couple of years prior to getting selected by the GC. I think he is a relative (nephew?) of Williamstown Team of the Century player Brett McTaggart. Seeing the comraderie between Gazza and Geelong players after the game reminded me again to not soak up the media's views verbatim. There was genuine love and respect, built from years of knowing and trusting one another. These are profound and resiliant qualities. For all the superficial analysis of whether someone is following the money there has been scant regard given to what the players truly know and think of each other. We got a glimpse after the siren sounded. I also saw the sign and wasn't so impressed. But I suppose if you are at risk of losing more players to interstate clubs, and you aren't confident that your offering is going to be sufficient to make them stay, you have to provide more. Especially if history has already shown star players and successful coaches are very keen to leave. You have to introduce additional incentives for players. However, if I was Chappie, I would want to see some photos before making any decision. I found the whole game difficult to take. Seeing Geelong players trying to tackle Ablett instead of blocking for him just didn't look right. Seeing Ablett running at full speed in the opposite direction to the Geelong goal looked even worse. At least we won. Not looking forward to the day when the Ablett Suns actually beat us. Regarding Chappy: I think he was distracted by that sign. He had three shots at goal and missed them all. Dips, very creative way of telling the yarn. I think R. Kane's point re the media constructing the terms of the discussion is a good one. More on that from me tomorrow, once I have a few things out of the way today. I am also enjoying the AF style of jousting. Very parliamentary. Menzies: the member ofr Woop Woop has the brains of a sheep. Speaker: retract that statement. Menzies: the member ofr Woop Woop does not have the brains of a sheep. Gold Coast did well for the first half and could be a a very good team in four or five years. As a Geelong supporter, I was pleased with the Geelong players treatment of Ablett during and after the game. I agree with Rick Kane's comment on the media. Most of the mainstream media coverage of AFL football is trivial and celebrity nonsense. On the question of Gary Ablett, I believe he was given an offer that he could not refuse; it was reported to be $1.8 million dollars per year for five years with most of it to be paid in the first few years. Ablett gave great service to Geelong for nine years and will be remembered as a great player. The Gold Coast offer to Ablett reminds me of what the great Bob Rose once said. He left Collingwood in the late 1950?s to coach Wangaratta Rovers in the Ovens and Murray League for more than double money. Apparently, He was earning 400 pounds a year at Collingwood and Wangaratta Rovers offered him 1,000 pounds a year. He said it was like winning Tattslotto. I have great memories of watching Rose play for Wang. Rovers, especially the 1962 O & M League grand final; he was a fantastic footballer. Mark -- Bobby Davis retired from football because the media offered him a better deal. I think he was only 28. I've heard a few commentators saying that Geelong players showed too much love to Gazza after the game.If Gold Coast were at the top of the table and a September rival this might be valid, but given they are not I thought the scenes after the game were very uplifting. JB Can't see why Carlton should be more upset than Geelong about mercenary behaviour if Judd were to go. After all that was how you got Judd in the first place. Phanto, your comments about Magpie players going to GWs are becoming increasingly shrill. Is this a sign that you are finally realising that none of our key player are leaving? Daisy Thomas, after his brilliant last few weeks, will be getting a lot more money next year, but he will be getting it from the Pies not the Giants. If every one at Collywood is to get remuneration commensurate with their superstar premiership player status next year (when ten premiership players will be out of contract) there will have to be some salary cap pressure unless there is some special deal akin to the you don'thave to travel clause. Those who miss out, and some will have to, will move on and subsequently the list will be weakened. It's not rocket science. Currently injuries are a challenge at Collywood as they are at all clubs. You don't want grumpy monkies going elsewhere after they fill in for the injured superstars only to be dropped when the finals campaign that they underpinned starts. I am sure that Collingwood will eventually lose players through salary cap pressure but they will not lose their top players. A lot of experienced players left at the end of last year. That decreased salary cap pressure. Two out of Tarrant, Davis and Johnson will be veterans next year (and the third may well retire if we win a second flag). Many of our best players are young and can be offered structured contracts because they will be at the club long enough to collect if the contracts are backended. Even though our seconds ""lack depth"" we do have a few players struggling to force their way into the firsts who would look good at GWS. With free agency looming and Collingwood having a lot of young talented players there might be problems holding players in the future but it won't happen until long after the Gold Coast/GWS special concessions have passed that looks like you are shifting a bit. Pleased to have been of assistance in this important break through in attitude adjustment. We can add another quality to the list for Pies supporters: strategically flexible. I still strongly believe that one, or more, of your big boys will go soon. It will be interesting to see how much Collingwood bleat about the salary cap pressure on stars and how many they are able to keep. More importantly, will the top tier take reduced contracts to be part of an era, or will they take the crazy money? I am not bitter about Gary going, as that has allowed many who were in his shadow to bloom in the light (thinks, James Kelly). I was impressed by the fact that the game plan against Gazza was so subtle and profound and above all else, effective. Never has he had 30 touches to so little effect, and the give+go which was the foundation stone of his game was utterly obliterated. I am proud that we didn't need to go the cheap shot to make our point, and that the context of the contest was highlighted both by he and Bomber Thompson sitting together at Bob Davis' funeral service, and by the expressions of respect and genuine undying cameraderie after the game. Kudos to Gary for that as well. The willingness of key players to committ to, and to receive long term committments from the club also speaks volumes of a deep club culture that is vastly more appealing than the superficial flirtations evident in certain some other clubs. Stars such as Selwood, Bartel, Scarlet and Kelly are now, and will always be Cats. The incredible imbalance of footy reporting and representation was inadvertently highlighted in a segment of The Marngrook Footy Show tonight. Andrew Krakouer was the special guest. After highlighting several of his great marks and extraordinary goals Gilbert McAdam took pause. He raised the issue of when Krakouer made a x sign with his arms after kicking a goal. The issue had been the subject of great debate in the mainstream footy media when it occured. McAdam said, ""Andrew, you brought a tear to my eye when you sent a message to your brother. It really took my breath away. I knew you as a kid and with what you've been through, it was just ..."" and he trailed off. Andrew replied, ""I am honoured that you would say that"". He went on to explain that he wasn't trying to offend anyone. He had spoken to his brother earlier in the day and his brother had asked him to give him a sign when he scored a goal. ""It was for my brother, no one else"". The conversation was touching and genuine. You almost felt like you were eavesdropping. In all the discussion about Krakouer's gesture, I haven't heard one commentator say that it almost brought him/her to tears. Wow! That's a story, that's footy right there. Brothers, family, struggles, hard work, luck, belief, and within the corporate controls of the product we know as Australian Rules, individuals will still find individual ways to show the undying determination that the circle be unbroken. I reacted as you did Rick. I hope some of the tabloid reporters who tried to get a cheap ""outrage"" story out of Krakouer's gesture were watching the Marn Grook show tonight, but I suspect even if they were they wouldn't have ""got it"" Rick -- great point you make. I take no offense at all if a bloke wants to make some sort of gesture so long is its not an obviously insulting one. The other great gesture of course was Nicky Winmar's jumper lift -- what a profound impact that had. And Damian Oliver's signal to the heavens after his Melbourne Cup victory in memory of his brother. This all goes to one of my great gripes with the modern media -- they want to make the news not report it. They sit in anticipation of a bloke like Krakouer doing something that they can jump on. They even made a story of the banner held up at Metricon Stadium last week where a bloke was suggesting to Chappy that he would let him roll with his wife in the hay. How pathetic. Was it bad taste? Probably but is there no humour anymore? As the great Neil Young sings on his magnificent album called Greendale: ""They (the media) don't have any respect, so they'll get none of mine."" Or as little Elvis (that's Elvis Costello) said about radio: ""I wanna bite the hand that feeds me, I wanna bite that hand so badly"". I was aghast when I saw the sign from the Gold Coast game but more angered that Channel10 or 7 or whoever chose to screen it. It's one thing for a dickhead to make a throwback banner that maybe 10,000 might see, it's another thing for the TV station to screen it for upwards of hundreds of thousands. There is also the messaging behind screening the banner (which was not solely done in good humour) and that is to reinforce a balance of superiority of the more cultured (gentrified) states against our more simple new friends. Ie.- They have a lot to learn (from us). It was a cheap gag but an even cheaper shot. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

38792	Self employed lone parent Hi everyone, here's my situation: I'm a lone parent with 2 small kids and I've been offered a job in Central London as mother's help/nanny. Since I have a Bachelor's Degree in Preschool Teaching and I have experience in childcare, how much do you thing I should charge per hour? The thing is that I will be self employed and I don't really know how much your salary is reduced, so I was wondering what rate should I tell my employer? By the way, she agreed to pay my travelling expenses as well, which will be 25,50 pounds per week (I will be working 16 hours per week and I will pay aproximately 250 pounds per week in childcare for my kids). Nannies / mothers help are not self employed. You will be doing a part time job just like anyone else. Your employer will I expect, tell you when to arrive, when to leave, what to do. What makes you think it's something that you can do as a business? Nannies get paid various salaries depending on location and experience. You may be looking at somewhere from 7 to 13 per hour calculated out to an annual salary. You will be paying 200 a week for childcare for your own children. That means that your job will need to pay more than that. Assuming no other income (such as income support or other benefits), then to get a take home pay of 200 a week, I make it that you have to be earning 13.92 gross an hour, if you work 16 hours a week. PAYE Calculator which will do Net to Gross Working in childcare is not going to pay you enough in my view for you to afford childcare for your own two children. It may be more financially viable once both children are in full time school, so you are able to work a significant number of hours during which you are not paying for childcare. Perhaps you can get some funding towards the cost of your own childcare, such as childcare element of working tax credit. However that funding may be available now but it might not in future and will be affected by how much you earn. Are you being forced to find a job? Thanx everyone for your advice but i've decided not to take this job because it turns out that i will be paying 300(!) per week for childcare and only getting 160. Yes, i'm entittled to working tax credit because i'm a lone parent, but still that wouldn't be enough... My children are 3y and 20m but the nursery hours won't much (for the 3y old) because it was an afternoon job 15:00-20:00. Anyway, other than that, we had a disagreement about my employment status which she was insisting that i would be self employed but in the HMRC website says that this is not a matter of choice, so according to my circumstances i was going to be employed.

36743	Ruth Singer recaps some of the interesting points of the last week's Linguistics in the Pub , an informal gathering of linguists and language activists that is held monthly in Melbourne A number of linguists in Melbourne have recently begun documenting child language in the field. In the November 2011 LIP we discussed what you need to think about if you want to document child language and why you might document child language as part of a broader language documentation project (see blog at http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2011/11\\... The most recent LIP, led by Lauren Gawne and Birgit Hellwig last week, revisited the topic of child language documentation. This allowed those who have recently returned from the field to discuss some of the problems they faced and how they dealt with them. In particular, we looked at the gap between what is possible in remote fieldsites and some of the assumptions in the field of child language acquisition about what type of data is needed to study child language development. The quantity and frequency of data that can be collected in remote fieldsites is quite different to what can be done in the developed world. The limitations can be quite simple. For example, not being able to get accurate information on children's ages. To kick off the discussion we looked at ethics, from a personal point of view. The previous LIP on child language was criticised for focussing too much on the requirements of institutional ethics boards at universities, schools etc. So we discussed what types of decisions researchers had made to satisfy their own ethical concerns. A number of researchers said that they had no plans to make their recordings public. This goes against the current trend to make recordings of endangered languages as open as possible, given community consent. Just to give an example, I have decided to keep access to my recordings of child language closed, until the children are 18. If they are happy for me to open access to their recordings after they are 18, I will do so. However since I am currently recording children in groups at least 3 people, it is likely that in many cases I will not be able to contact all participants so the recording will remain closed. One of the issues we returned to a number of times in the evenings is that our recordings are often made in open environments, which means that many people wander through the field of view. This is in contrast to mainstream child language data, which is usually made in a room through which only a limited number of people pass by. It was mentioned that the CHILDES language database is a great example of an open access archive but it lacks much data from endangered languages. CHILDES contains data recorded from many different studies of child language acquisition. However to upload data to CHILDES you must have the consent of every person who appears, even if just walking past. This is not going to be possible for many recordings of endangered languages in remote areas. It is often difficult to find a room to record in and even if one is found, it is likely that many people will pass through it. Some of the other assumptions about child language acquisition research that can prove difficult in remote settings: that a mother and child pair form natural conversational partners (they may rarely engage in idle chit-chat) that adults typically play with children (it may be the case that children typically play with other children, not adults Since it is often difficult for a mother-child pair to engage in conversation in front of the camera, some suggested structured tasks, such as those used at Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Although others pointed out that this makes it difficult to study language socialization, because you are asking people to engage in a culturally foreign activity. Others suggested identifying local games that could be used in language acquisition research. One big problem in applying the standards of child language acquisition research to remote contexts is the difficulty of obtaining recordings of the same child over regular intervals. Many of the linguists attending the LIP session work in Papua New Guinea and Australian Aboriginal communities. They pointed out that children and often their whole families move around much more than they had expected. The set of children living in a community may barely overlap from one fieldtrip to the next.  In addition, some child language researchers recommend making recordings every 2 months or so, and it is not possible to do this in remote settings. The limitations are partly financial and partly due to the time needed for the linguist to travel to the remote location from their home. There was quite a bit of time devoted to the technology used to record children, who are rather more mobile than adults. One researcher recommended the use of teddy-bear shaped backpacks for children. These can carry the heavy transmitter of the radio microphone. Everyone agreed that noise is a big issue. Even if there is no wind, which small radio microphones don't handle well, children's motion invariably causes noise. One researcher only recorded in areas without many leaves as the noise of these being crushed beneath children's running feet was too loud. Birgit Hellwig discussed some of the data from her recent 2 month fieldtrip to Papua New Guinea which she did with child language acquisition specialist Evan Kidd (ANU). She said that by the end of the 2 months, the community they were visiting had more or less gotten used to the cameras and exactly what it meant to have child language researchers in the community. One thing that Birgit emphasised is that what participants need to do is not as obvious to them as we might think. Birgit gave a lovely example in the use of the frog story task. The frog story 'Frog: where are you?', is a short children's picture book without any words. Children were asked to tell the story in their own words. It became apparent during the course of Birgit's 2 month fieldtrip that changes in how children told the story from week to week were related to narrative practices in the community. The story was circulating in the community, just as any story does, and changing slightly over the course of time. Rather than each new child that particpated in the task telling the story afresh, 'in their own words', each told it as it was in its current form in the community. This resulted in remarkable convergence between tellings that were recorded around the same time. It became clear from the discussion that we can't expect to do research on child language in the same way as it is done in more controlled environments. We will not get comparable quantities of data for each child. However, whatever we do record is likely to be really interesting. We only have data on child language for a small number of languages, so anything will help.

15825	"My Dad used to sing a song to my brother in about 1938, which had the opening lyric ""There was a china man with pig tail spic and span ha ha ha ha he he..."" Unfortunately that's all I know of the song and would really like to find out the name of it. Any help would be appreciated, thank you. There was a man from Chinatown his name was Licka Lacka Lee Law Chan His head was tall and his feet were small and this little man had no nose at all Licka Lacka Lee Law Hey Indora Icky Picky Pikey OK They rolled him in the park one day and frightened all the kids away They rolled him here, they rolled him there, they rolled him in a bamboo chair. Licka Lacka Lee Law Hey Indora, In-Di-Ora, Icky Picky Pikey OK There was a Chinaman With pigtails spick and span Ah hah ha ha ha ha Who never would go out When there was rain about Ah hah ha ha ha ha For rain, he used to say, Washed pigtails all away Ah hah ha ha ha ha ha ha So indoors he would stay On every rainy day Ah hah ha ha ha ha My Great Grandma used to sing this song to me and I would dearly love to find the lyrics. She sang it something like this: In China there lived a China man, his name was Ching-a-rie-Ching-a-rie Chan, His legs were long and his feet were small, this ChinaMan couldn't walk at all...singing, Ching-a-rie, ching-a-rie Chan, riddle me this and (?)... Scallopy, wallopy chinaco My grandfather used to sing this one to all the grandchildren back in the 70's & 80's :) Chick a chaloo chaloo chapan wallapa wallapa China Man... There once there was a China man, his name was Chicka chaloo chapan His head was big and his feet were small, so the poor China man couldn't walk. Alas the China man to die and in his coffin he did lie They sent the coffin to Japan and that was the end of the China man. my grandma taught me a version of this song, though it went a little different: in all japan there lived a man: his name was chika-racka-chi-chai-chang. his legs were long, his feet were small, the poor old man couldn't walk at all, and they were singing; chicka-racka-chi-chai-cho-chocalorum-win\\... the servants used to carry him out on their backs and the folks did shout: ""here he comes! there he goes! the poor old chap with the funny funny nose!"" and they were singing: chicka-racka-chi-chai-cho-chocalorum-win\\... Ok so my version I was thought when I was young is nothing like this.... The once was a china man called chickaraca chickaraca chichickalora bombilora willy willy wack ohko ohko tiddy fi tiddy fi chinese talk they took him on a motor car told him not to go to far the word was said he fell on his head and that was the end of the china man Once in China there was a funny man his name was chikaraka chou chai chan his body was long his legs were short the poor little man could hardly walk, chikaraka chou chai chan chatty borra umdiddle ora alow wallow waxi oki doki hit him on the boki itchi gotchi itchi gotchi twinkle, There are more verses to this but can't remember them and there seems to be many different versions to this?? There was a poor old China man, his name was Chinka-chaloo-chahan, His teeth were short, his nose was long and this is the way he walked along. Chinka-chaloo-chaloo-cha-pan, al-up-ee, al-up-ee, chinka-cha-lol-up-ee, Chinka-chaloo-chaloo-cha-pan, al-up-ee, al-up-ee, Chinaman. At last, this poor o;d man he died, and in his coffin he did lie, They sent his coffin to Japan and this is the way his epitaph ran. Chinka-chaloo-chaloo-cha-pan, al-up-ee, al-up-ee, chinka-cha-lol-up-ee, Chinka-chaloo-chaloo-cha-pan, al-up-ee, al-up-ee, Chinaman. there was an old man from china town his name was inki pinki poo pa chan he had long legs and a turned down nose...the poor old man with the turned up toes. inki pinki poo-pa chan chickalo-ra bobtailo-ra paddywaddywack oko doko witamonatoko wittama dittama cheerioko Lots of different versions of this song! My mother would sing a version of this when my brothers and I were children - 1950's. She also loved to sing Johnny Rebeck to us. These are the words she taught us: There once was a Chinaman, who lived in old Japan, His name was Chick-a-rie, Chick-a-rie Chan. His feet were long, his toes were short And this is the way the Chinaman talked, There once was a man a funny little man His name was kinko kine-a- man His legs were tall and his feet were small And the poor little msn couldnt walk at all Sing ching- GA-lora, ching- GA-lora ching- GA-lora hidey - pok- aWAY! There once was a man, a funny little man, his name was Chingco china man His legs were tall and his feet were small, and the poor little fellow couldn't walk at all. Sing chingalor chingalor chingalora hidy chuckaway Iddy oddy ocka, hit him in the poka Iddy oddy ocka , um pa pa Hi, Stephen- Well, the song is certainly racist. Whether the thread is racist or not, is another matter. Whatever the case, racist or not, the song in question is certainly a real folk song and a very good example of the folk process, how a song may take many different paths and develop many different versions. But you're right...I cringe every time this thread comes up on the Forum Menu. Thanks for your constructive answer. I agree that Mudcat is not racist and sometimes very progressive. However a lot of people happen upon this site and a thread like this doesnt give a good first impression when they look at Mudcat. My own personal view of such playground songs is that they can lead to bullying and worse. I would really love to know the origin of this song too. Again, to me it was a silly weird song my mother used to sing back in the 60's and 70's when my sister and I were very young. Our version very similar. In China once there lived a man, His name was Chik-a-lee Chik-a-lee Chan His feet were long and his toes were short, And this is the way the Chinaman talked... dad sang us this song handed down to his family from the ballarat goldfields there once was a jolly little chinaman with a nid nod nid nod nid youve never seen such a little chinaman with a nid nod nid nod nid, down to the woodshed he went one day ,went one day,went one day to gather little sticks together so , so just to gather little sticks together so and his dear little wife she would say oh! with a nid nod nid nid nod nid nod nid nod nid nid nod nid nid Once in China I met a funny man his name was Chicaracka Chu Chi Chan His arms were long - his legs were short the poor old man could hardly walk Chicaracka Chu Chi Chai Chickanora punchinorra ala wala winkle Chicaracka Chu Chi Chai Chickanora punchinorra ala wala winkle This old man he went to sea to see the sights of the Kangaree The ship got lost and so you see The poor old man got drownded Chicaracka Chu Chi Chai Chickanora punchinorra ala wala winkle Chicaracka Chu Chi Chai Chickanora punchinorra ala wala winkle My grandad taught me this song, I am reading it at his funeral next week. I remember telling this poem to a pair of chinese exchange students asking them to translate it as I really thought it was in the chinese language! (well i was only 11) :0) There once was a China Man, His Name was Chicka Lacka Lee Chaw Chan, his head was big and his feet were small and this little china man, he couldnt walk at all.... ere's how i heard it in the 50's at camp china man had a wife led him such an awful life cut his pigtails off so long sold them for a chinese song chikerack a chee chy cho chickalarro bungo lorro piggy wiggy wago hoco poco hit em on the coco chitterbee chitterby chee chi cho We had a version of this song which has passed through the generations...we wanted to research tongue twisters for a project that my son is doing and I am amazed at all the versions I have found on this site. In China there lived a Chinaman, his name was chickaracka-chee-chan-chan. His feet were long and his legs were small and the poor little man couldn't walk at all. So they took him up to the top of a hill And they rolled him down like a rolling pin. With a.... Chicka-racka-chee-chan-chor-chickalorum, pongo-lorum,many-pee-cat, Cat go to go etty-ketty-catty-go, aye Japan Chinaman, chinese coo. From what I remember my mom used to sing to me when I was 4 or 5.(I'm 70 now) In China there lived a little man, his name was Chingling, chingling Chan. His legs were short, his feet were small, this little man couldn't walk at all. Miska Hi was short and fat, she had money & he had none, under her window he would go and play a tune on his little banjo. Miska Hi with notes of love, held her washboard high above, let it fall on Chingling Chan and that was the last of the China man. If this thread offends you...why do you click on it? It doesn't just..come up. This was just a little song my mom used to sing to us kids. Was curious when & why it originated. There was no bigotry or racist comments in it...click on something else or get a life. Ginner, the song stereotypes and ridicules an ethnic group - that fits the classic definition of bigotry to a ""t,"" even though you and your mother think it cute. We don't suppress songs like this because they have historic and folkloric value - but that doesn't mean we can't complain about them. Songs like this aren't cute - they're nasty, obscene, and bigoted. Although it's a song that comes from a history of ethnic bigotry, it's still worthwhile to study the song and its versions. Such songs are often true examples of the ""folk process"" because they aren't the kind of songs publishers would publish. This song became a pop song called ""Chickery Chick"" in the 1940s, with lyrics that had nothing to do with anybody of any ethnic descent. Here's an article about the song from Time Magazine, December 3, 1945: In the '70s, collegians at Amherst set the l00-year-old jingle to music and sang it over pots of ale, when they wanted to prove that they could walk a musical straight line. One of the many versions ran like this: In China there lived a little man His name was Chingery-ri-chan-chan, His feet were large and his head was small, And this little man had no brains at all. Chingery-rico-rico-day ekel tekel Hap py man. Kuan-a-desco cartty-o gallopy-wallopy-china-go. Last week this old tongue twister, with new and even less intelligible lyrics, was the fast-climbing No. 2 seller in Billboard magazine's poll of record sales. It was well on its way to join Mairzy Boats and the Hut Sut Song in the jabberwocky Valhalla of the jukebox. Twenty-nine-year-old Arkansas-born Jo Proffitt had changed the Chinaman into a chick, and called it Chickery Chick. She sent the lyrics to Tin Pan Alleysmith Sidney Lippman, who added some new notes. Now it describes a chicken who got bored with saying ""chick chick"" all day, astounds his companions with some jived-up poultry poetry: Chickery-chick cha-la cha-la, Check-a-la-romey in a ba-nan-i-ka... . Tin Pan Alley actuarians estimate that the U.S. will need about three months to get over it. CHAPTER XXI. CUPID'S LAST APPEARANCE. A picnic supper on the grass followed the games, and then, as twilight began to fall, the young people were marshaled to the coach-house, now transformed into a rustic theater. One big door was open, and seats, arranged lengthwise, faced the red table-cloths which formed the curtain. A row of lamps made very good foot-lights, and an invisible band performed a Wagner-like overture on combs, tin trumpets, drums, and pipes, with an accompaniment of suppressed laughter. Many of the children had never seen anything like it, and sat staring about them in mute admiration and expectancy; but the older ones criticised freely, and indulged in wild speculations as to the meaning of various convulsions of nature going on behind the curtain. While Teacher was dressing the actresses for the tragedy, Miss Celia and Thorny, who were old hands at this sort of amusement, gave a ""Potato"" pantomime as a side show. Across an empty stall a green cloth was fastened, so high that the heads of the operators were not seen. A little curtain flew up, disclosing the front of a Chinese pagoda painted on pasteboard, with a door and window which opened quite naturally. This stood on one side, several green trees with paper lanterns hanging from the boughs were on the other side, and the words ""Tea Garden,"" printed over the top, showed the nature of this charming spot. Few of the children had ever seen the immortal Punch and Judy, so this was a most agreeable novelty, and before they could make out what it meant, a voice began to sing, so distinctly that every word was heard: ""In China there lived a little man, His name was Chingery Wangery Chan."" Here the hero ""took the stage"" with great dignity, clad in a loose yellow jacket over a blue skirt, which concealed the hand that made his body. A pointed hat adorned his head, and on removing this to bow he disclosed a bald pate with a black queue in the middle, and a Chinese face nicely painted on the potato, the lower part of which was hollowed out to fit Thorny's first finger, while his thumb and second finger were in the sleeves of the yellow jacket, making a lively pair of arms. While he saluted, the song went on: ""His legs were short, his feet were small, And this little man could not walk at all."" Which assertion was proved to be false by the agility with which the ""little man"" danced a jig in time to the rollicking chorus: At the close of the dance and chorus, Chan retired into the tea garden, and drank so many cups of the national beverage, with such comic gestures, that the spectators were almost sorry when the opening of the opposite window drew all eyes in that direction. At the lattice appeared a lovely being; for this potato had been pared, and on the white surface were painted pretty pink cheeks, red lips, black eyes, and oblique brows; through the tuft of dark silk on the head were stuck several glittering pins, and a pink jacket shrouded the plump figure of this capital little Chinese lady. After peeping coyly out, so that all could see and admire, she fell to counting the money from a purse, so large her small hands could hardly hold it on the window seat. While she did this, the song went on to explain: ""Miss Ki Hi was short and squat, She had money and he had not; So off to her he resolved to go, And play her a tune on his little banjo."" During the chorus to this verse Chan was seen tuning his instrument in the garden, and at the end sallied gallantly forth to sing the following tender strain: It never occurred to me that it was bad. I just thought it was full of nonsense words and the rythem was catchy. My version is COMPLETELY different from all that I have read here. My grandmother who was born in 1918 sang this to me when i was little. In china once there lived a man. His name was Chickala Chickala Chan. His fingers were long and his toes were short. And this is the way the poor china men talk. Wow, I had no idea there were so many versions! Here's how it was sung to us as kids: There was a Chinaman; lived in Japan His name was Chickala Chickala Chan His legs were long and his knees were knocked And this is the way the Chinaman talked A chickala chee chileye chilo A chickala Romeo and a banana go Walaka walaka chance to see In a banana go alchio The Chinaman he did up and die and in his coffin he did lie They sent him back to old Japan and this is the way his epitaph ran (Refrain) P.S. This version of the song goes back at least four generations in my family. My Great Grandpa worked in the coal minds. I have Irish and Chinese blood. Talk about a double whammy. This Song was not passed down in my family to be derogatory. I think it would be sad if we ever take political correctness to the point where we are afraid to laugh at ourselves. As long as you are fair about it, humor can just as easily unite us. I have never listened to this song, and thought, hay man, that??s me. Even as a Child I didn??t make that leap. I know I tease with my friends all the time, but the intent is never mean. This is just a nostalgic and historic breakdown of a song. This is not a political statement. I am an American, but I??m not going to take Yankee Doodle out of context. There lived in China a very fine man His name was chee karaka cheek you can his legs were fat and his feet were small The chinese man he couldn't walk at all. Chee karaka, chee karaka, cheek you can Cupa laura, cupa laura was a very fine man. Banga, hoola, izzy kizzy kizzy was a chinese moon. She was a lovely kind and gentle person and no racist comment was every intended. It was a fun tongue twister - plain and simple. I've been looking for lyrics to this song for a number of years. I never knew there were so many versions or that it went back so far, but I guess that is common. I believe my mom and her sister learned this song in camp back in the 30's/40's. My mom used to sing this ""silly song"" to me when I was a kid (60's/70's) and I loved it. Of course, we didn't worry about political correctness back then. I've never been successful in finding any reference on the internet - probably because of the differences in the version that they sang: the refrain of which went something like: Sadly my mom passed away recently, but I'll have to see if my aunt can still recall or rederive the lyrics that they learned. I think my mom was hesitant to sing this song to me in recent years because my own daughters are Chinese and she didn't want to give the wrong impression. Ironically, it wasn't until my own daughter learned the song ""Chickery Chick"" in music class this year and came home singing it that I was able to make the connection. I'd never heard of that song, but it was apparently a pop hit in the 40's. I'll be sure and post ""our"" version of the song if my (now 85 year old) aunt can remember it. Once there was a Chinaman His name was Chika Chika Chan His body was long his legs were thin Huliga Muliga Chinaman. Chinaman he did die. In a coffin he did lie Took his body to Japan To buy some tea for the Chinaman. Hickory choo, choo July, Hockery Rooney In a pialli pialli padu It doesn't agree Huliga Muliga Chinaman.

13260	"get connected Connect with neighbors and improve your neighborhood's safety on the 29th annual National Night Out on Tuesday. For more information visit, www.natw.org/nno/about.html , or to go to WhitePages at neighbors.whitepages.com, to look up and get in touch with neighbors or to use the site's Block Party Invite and RSVP System to coordinate get-togethers. WhitePages partners with the National Association of Town Watch to make reaching out to neighbors easier. JENNY BRITT admits she doesn't know her neighbors in Ghent on the Square in Norfolk - not the ones upstairs who occasionally used to leave loud music on when they left their condo, or the ones who walk their dogs when she walks Scooter, her Welsh corgi. Ironically, though, she knows the neighbors' dogs' names. With a bid on a single-family home under consideration, Britt and her boyfriend are hoping with a move comes change. ""I'm trying to be better when we meet (neighbors) by saying their names over and over in my head,"" she said. ""I have a lot of work to do."" Britt shouldn't be embarrassed by her admission; She's far from alone. According to a survey conducted online in June 2011 by Harris Interactive on behalf of WhitePages, 41 percent of participants could identify their neighbors' first names, while 27 percent knew their neighbors' pets and 24 percent their neighbors' kids. WhitePages provides contact information for millions of people and businesses in the U.S. Activities and gatherings such as the annual National Night Out by the National Association of Town Watch - being held Tuesday - started in 1984 to promote neighborhood involvement in crime and drug prevention, strengthen police-community relations and encourage camaraderie among neighbors. Since its inception, the event has grown to involve more than 37 million people from more than 15,000 communities, according to Town Watch's website, natw.org. ""In our fight for a safer nation, National Night Out has proven to be an effective, inexpensive and enjoyable program to promote neighborhood spirit and police-community partnerships,"" said Matt Peskin, the association's executive director and National Night Out creator. ""If you look at the 1940s and the 1950s, neighborhoods were safer places because people knew each other. Neighborhoods today are not as tightly knit as they used to be, even with Facebook and other social media tools at their disposal."" For Brenda Armitage, a real-estate agent with All Pros Realty in Virginia Beach, a close call with tragedy ignited her passion to connect with neighbors. Six years ago, Armitage's then-3-year-old daughter was hit by a car on her bike in front of the family's Carolanne Farms neighborhood at the Beach. Armitage began advocating for the neighborhood children by trying to get a sign installed warning drivers to go slow because children were at play. This effort led Armitage, a mother of three, to revitalize Carolanne Farms' civic league, organize block parties, and start an annual luminary event called ""Share Your Light Night"" and an annual Fourth of July parade in the Kempsville neighborhood. ""Create a village,"" said Armitage. ""The meaning of your life day-to-day is enriched"" by neighbors, she said. Armitage also advocates the use of social media to communicate with neighbor. It's successful, she said. On Facebook, the Carolanne Farms - Arrowhead Neighbors page is rich with comments; 357 people are members. Neighborly posts include a missing-dog notification, an inquiry about a reliable auto mechanic, a yard-sale post and a warning that cars had been broken into and registrations, or a phone, stolen. ""Honestly the most effective communication tool is Facebook or email,"" said Armitage, who recently used the Neighbors' page to find a tiller and a teenager to help her whip her flower beds back into shape. ""In a community everybody has a set of skills that can be utilized,"" Armitage said. Armitage's passion carries over into her profession. During a recent sale of a house in Indian Lakes, she asked the neighbors selling their house to compile a list of four neighbors on either side, and eight across the street, plus other information, like which neighbor kids baby-sit, which mow lawns and other pertinent information for the buyers. It's all about making an effort, she said. But not every neighbor is cooperative. There's the neighbor who doesn't pick up after his or her dog, or uses the leaf blower at early hours, or blares music in the middle of the night. Denise Holden, who lives with her family in Hunt Club Forest in Virginia Beach, has seen - and heard - it all. ""I was block captain, and as soon as people found out I was in the civic league, they would bring me their issues,"" wrote Holden on Facebook. ""At first, I tried to be helpful, and then I thought, 'Why am I always the bad guy?' "" The department's inspectors have the power to decide if something is bad enough, and fine the home owner if the problem continues, she wrote. ""I used them to get rid of some drug dealers"" because it's much ""faster to go after the house,"" Holden said. Cities' animal control divisions also are a good source, she said, because they try to help smooth things over with neighbors and animal lovers. ""You are insulting someone's 'family' when you complain about their barking dog,"" Holden wrote. And, of course, there are the police. ""If you're unsure, if you don't feel comfortable talking to someone, the best thing to do is pick up the phone and call us, and we'll send somebody out there, and we'll go out and talk to them,"" said Sharon Brady, custodian of records for Emergency Communications, Citizens Services 911 Division with the Virginia Beach Police Department. But, Brady said, it's much better to have a rapport with your neighbors so you don't have to call the police to mediate. ""Strike up a conversation with them,"" Brady suggested. But, ""if you're uncomfortable, and you don't know them well enough, send a police officer, it's what we do."" While Holden said she has called the police about things like fireworks being shot over their house and kids egging cars, she and her husband know ""almost all of our neighbors, even vacation with them. We remember birthdays, celebrate events, and borrow mowers."" Holden said you'd be surprised at what having a good, old-fashioned conversation can do. ""Let them know what's important to you,"" she said. ""Inviting (neighbors) over for a beer in the driveway works wonders!"" As for Jenny Britt at Ghent on the Square, connections and relationships are important. That's why, if the house sale off Lafayette Boulevard in Norfolk goes through, she will make the effort to get to know her neighbors. ""To not have a connection to people who are right next to you is strange to me,"" Britt said.

17181	"Over 3,000 Leaks Found in Study of Boston's Natural Gas Pipelines Benefit From the Latest Energy Trends and Investment Opportunities before the mainstream media and investing public are aware they even exist. The Free Oilprice.com Energy Intelligence Report gives you this and much more. Click here to find out more. The city's aging natural-gas pipeline system is to blame, according to a new study by researchers at Boston and Duke Universities. Their findings appear this week in the journal Environmental Pollution . The new study comes in the wake of devastating fires fueled by natural gas during Hurricane Sandy. Potential damage to gas pipeline pressure regulators, caused by flooding in Hurricane Sandy, has raised ongoing safety concerns in New York and New Jersey. ""While our study was not intended to assess explosion risks, we came across six locations in Boston where gas concentrations exceeded the threshold above which explosions can occur,"" says Nathan Phillips, associate professor in Boston University's Department of Earth and Environment and co-author of the study. Nationally, natural gas pipeline failures cause an average of 17 fatalities, 68 injuries, and $133 million in property damage annually, according to the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. In addition to the explosion hazard, natural gas also poses a major environmental threat: methane, the primary ingredient of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas that degrades air quality. Leaks in the United States contribute to $3 billion of lost and unaccounted for natural gas each year. ""Repairing these leaks will improve air quality, increase consumer health and safety, and save money,"" says co-author Robert B. Jackson, a professor at Duke. ""We just have to put the right financial incentives into place."" Phillips and Jackson's teams collaborated with industry partners Robert Ackley of Gas Safety, Inc., and Eric Crosson of Picarro, Inc., on the study. They mapped the gas leaks under Boston using a new, high-precision methane analyzer installed in a GPS-equipped car. Driving all 785 road miles within city limits, the researchers discovered 3,356 leaks. The leaks were distributed evenly across neighborhoods and were associated with old cast-iron underground pipes, rather than neighborhood socioeconomic indicators. Levels of methane in the surface air on Boston's streets exceeded fifteen times the normal atmospheric background value. Like Boston, other cities with aging pipeline infrastructure may be prone to leaks. The researchers recommend coordinated gas-leaks mapping campaigns in cities where the infrastructure is deemed to be at risk. The researchers will continue to quantify the health, safety, environmental, and economic impacts of the leaks, which will be made available to policymakers and utilities as they work to replace and repair leaking natural gas pipeline infrastructure.

13781	When the convenience of being able to leave gear securely locked up in vans and trailers causes the odd headache. The condensation on all my gear was terrible last night as i loaded from a cold van in the a very warm and humid marquee. One of my active speakers had a fault light on for a couple of hours and a lighting fixture failed, water was dripping off it so god knows what the pcb was like. Power leads were rigid and Lamps are also replaced more often, its not too bad if you can let things acclimatise but thats not always a luxury A dehumidifier is brilliant in a van or trailer (as long as the trailer is fairly airtight). Just run it on an extension cable. Unfortunately it won't solve the cold gear coming into a warm moist venue and the resulting condensation. Never mind the humidity, it's the temperature difference that's the real problem. If you have the space in the van, get yourself one of those paraffin pancake style coldframe/greenhouse heaters. They are very safe and stupidly cheap to run. Although this will raise the humidity slightly, this is more than outweighed by the fact that the warmer air can hold on to far more moisture. That heater burning direct in the van will make a lot of moisture that'll condense onto -- and inside -- the gear. I was rather assuming the O/P was taking the gear from a warm environment (home?) to a cold one (van) and then to a warm one again (venue). If the van is pre-heated by any means at all to something near the destination temperature then there will be no condensation. Water vapor is only released from saturated air when it becomes colder. If the equipment stays sensibly at the same temperature it will not cool the air, therefore there will be no condensation. Within reasonable limits it doesn't matter how much moisture the heater generates. While the walls of an unlined van will get quite wet (being a lot colder) anything completely within the enclosure and being kept warm will be fine. Finally, the actual dew point is a combination of humidity and temperature difference. You can play games with that fact. Re: Its that time of year [Re: Folderol ] #1018619 - 14/11/12 08:11 PM Edit Reply Quote Quote Folderol: I was rather assuming the O/P was taking the gear from a warm environment (home?) to a cold one (van) and then to a warm one again (venue). I think assuming this is dangerous. Quote Folderol: If the van is pre-heated by any means at all to something near the destination temperature then there will be no condensation. In the process of preheting with a wet heat source, water will condense onto the equipment being heated. I bet the gear will inevitably be somewhat cooler than the atmosphere from the heater. And even if the gear isn't cooler than the hot gasses from the heater, there will be times when the gear does get cooler, and then the 100 percent saturated air will give up it's moisture. Including inside the gear. Quote Folderol: Water vapor is only released from saturated air when it becomes colder. Water vapour is a gas. It condenses and this makes condensation. Quote Folderol: If the equipment stays sensibly at the same temperature it will not cool the air, therefore there will be no condensation. Gear, and our environment does not stay sensibly at the same temperature! So there will be condensation. Quote Folderol: Within reasonable limits it doesn't matter how much moisture the heater generates. Sorry, I want no water anywhere around. Quote Folderol: While the walls of an unlined van will get quite wet (being a lot colder) anything completely within the enclosure and being kept warm will be fine. Sorry, can't accept that. Water coating the inside of the van will evaporate, the humidity of the air inside will be 100 percent so any (even minute) changes in temperature and air pressure will result in condensation. Quote Folderol: Finally, the actual dew point is a combination of humidity and temperature difference. You can play games with that fact. I think you are playing games! One more point... apart form the fact that the world is much more complex than just one idealised aspect of theory. Burning hydrocarbons releases not only water but carbon dioxide, which when dissolved in water forms carbonic acid. Apart form being an acid, with all that implies, carbonic acid is a conductor. And that conductor will be present in switches, ribbon connectors, potentiometers and so forth, which often have different metals in contact ... which will result in galvanic corrosion and much electronic havoc. Please, people do not use wet, acidic heat to 'solve' a problem! Keep it simple, and assume nothing! By all means warm the gear up, but with nice dry heat. 	Forum	Instruction
31932	"In one day the average person loses between 2 to 3 quarts of water through their urine, sweat, and normal breathing. If a person doesn't replace that lost water, then dehydration begins to occur. At 2% dehydration, thirst is perceived. At 5% dehydration, a person becomes hot and tired, and strength and endurance decrease. At 10% dehydration, delirium and blurred vision become a problem. At 20% dehydration, a person dies. Pause and reflect on that for a moment. A person loses 2 to 3 quarts of water every day as a result of their normal body functions. Which means if a person doesn't get any fluids for about three days, they will die. Most people have never thought about the above because they have NEVER been personally confronted with a extended shortage of fresh safe drinking water at any time in their lives. Some More Facts About Water Water is VERY heavy. One gallon of water weighs about 8.5 pounds inside a thin-walled clear plastic water jug. You can't carry enough water with you between locations to last for very long. If one person consumes 2.75 quarts of water each day, then one person will need 250 gallons of water per year. A family of four will need 1,000 gallons of water per year. One-thousand gallons of water weighs about 4.25 tons. (And that does NOT include water for washing your hands or for washing dishes.) With the passage of time, bottled water will gradually become unfit to drink for a variety of reasons. However, it can be reprocessed to make it fit for human consumption. Several different options are discussed below. If commerce were disrupted by either a natural or manmade disaster, one of the first things a person should do is evaluate their water situation. This involves three different but related issues: 1. How much water is on hand right now? 2. Where can more water be obtained? 3. How can that water be made safe to drink? Drinking Water Available Immediately If you are at home when the emergency occurs, then immediately check to see if the faucet water pressure is still on. If it is then fill every possible container in the house that will hold water and not leak. For example: pots, pans, plastic containers, drinking glasses and drinking cups, bowls, and every sink and bathtub. If the water is off, you still have three sources of clean drinking water: 1. Ice cubes in the freezer, and 2. Water inside your water pipes, and 3. Water inside the hot water heater. Even if the water pressure is off, there is still some water inside the water pipes in your home or apartment. That water can be drained from the water pipes (using gravity) by opening the LOWEST cold water faucet in your home, which will usually be on the first floor, or the basement, or an outside water faucet. However, you will also need to open the highest cold water faucet in your home to allow air to enter the cold water pipes so the water can flow out the lowest water faucet into your collection container. This will drain all the water out of your cold water pipes but NOT your hot water pipes. Most hot water heaters contain 40 gallons of clean water. However, BEFORE you remove that water you MUST turn off the power or turn off the gas to your hot water heater, or you could start a fire. Then open the faucet at the bottom of the water heater to gain immediate access to 40 gallons of reserve clean drinking water. This is enough emergency water to last a family of four for 20 days if they ONLY drink the water and don't wash with it. This is the BEST source of reserve drinking water for the average family because it is constantly being used and replaced inside the hot water heater prior to the emergency. Therefore it will be fresh and clean at the beginning of an emergency. (Note: Some hot water heaters do NOT have an easy access water value at their base. Prior to an emergency you should take a look at your hot water heater and determine if you can get to the water inside your heater. If you can't, then you might consider having a plumber install a standard water faucet value in the water line at the bottom of the hot water heater.) Another source of water is canned foods because many canned foods are packed in water. When you open a can, serve the water in the can with the food. Never throw the canned water away if you are low on water. Water that isn't safe to drink is toilet tank water and water inside the mattress of a water bed. If you had the foresight to plan for an unexpected emergency, then you should have a stash of clean empty 2-liter plastic soda bottles stored somewhere out-of-sight. They are really nice for storing water because they are free (after you drink the soda), they are made of food grade plastic, they don't leak, they have a screw on cap to keep the water clean, they have an extremely long shelf life, and they are a convenient size to handle and use. The major disadvantage of the 2-liter bottles is that they don't stack well on top of one another. If you have empty one-gallon plastic water jugs then you should also consider saving them for a future emergency. However, clean empty plastic milk jugs are NOT a good option because they will deteriorate with the passage of time and begin to leak. After inventorying your water, the next step is to ration your water. During normal times, one person consumes about 3 quarts of water per day. No one I know drinks that much water each day. However, all of us drink some water, plus a variety of other fluids (coffee, tea, soda, juice, or whatever appeals to you). During hardship conditions, a person can survive on two quarts of water per day (two quarts is one-half gallon). If water is really in short supply, then one quart per day will keep a person alive, but they will begin to slowly dehydrate. Everyone knows better, but after an extended period of time with little or no water, a person will drink all the water they can when it suddenly becomes available. If you do this, you will get sick. Force yourself to S l o w - - d o w n. Drink one cup of water every 10 minutes. Give your system a chance to absorb the water and send it where it is needed most. Don't overload your system and kill yourself. Where to Find More Water You have inventoried and carefully rationed your water, but the emergency continues longer than you anticipated and you are running low on water. Before your water completely runs out, you should start replenishing it. Let's examine a number of different alternatives. Well Water If you live in the country, or if you have a water well on your property, then you already know there is water in the bottom of that well. Drilled wells can be anywhere from about 25 feet deep up to a thousand feet deep or more. For approximately $1,000 it is possible to purchase a heavy-duty manually-operated complete hand water pump for wells that are 200 feet deep or less. It is not possible to hand-pump water from wells much deeper than about 200 feet. However, there is a very CHEAP way to get water out of almost any well, regardless of its depth. If you know your electricity is going to be off for an extended period of time, and you are out of drinking water, and you have no other way to get drinking water, then you can manually remove the water from your well. There are many different well configurations but a typical one is illustrated in the picture on the right. First you MUST turn off the electrical power at the main circuit breaker box, even if the electricity is off. Then disconnect the electrical wires at the top of the well and protect them so they do not touch one another or any other object. You may also need to disconnect the plastic pipe or hose connected to the top of the well piece. Next you will need the correct size wrench to remove the large bolts which secure the top piece to the well. After removing the bolts, remove the top piece and you will probably find three things: a very long flexible heavy-duty hose, a water-resistant rope, and some electrical wiring, all of which go down into your well and are attached to the well pump in the bottom of the well. You can gradually pull up on the rope (or the flexible hose if absolutely necessary) and it will bring the well pump up out of the well. Don't pull on the electrical wiring because it is not intended for that purpose. After removing the well pump you will have exposed the entire shaft down to where your water is. Depending on the depth of the well, the diameter at the bottom of the well shaft will probably be a little smaller than the visible diameter at the top of the well shaft. Therefore, select a container that is at least 1 or 2 inches smaller in diameter than the well opening at its top. The container can be almost any length up to about 18 inches. The container should have a large mouth on top to allow water to enter and air to escape. One option would be an empty two-liter plastic soda bottle with its top cut off. The next step is of critical importance. Untie the wet end of the well rope from the well pump. Tie the opposite dry end of the rope to a secure object. This will keep the rope from falling into the well if you lose your grip. Then securely attach the wet end of the well rope to the container. If the container somehow works itself loose from the rope, then you will NOT be able to get the container out of your well shaft. Also remember the container is going to be HEAVY with water when you pull it up. One option would be to make a strong net and put your container inside the net. Then tie the rope securely to the net. Then put a relatively heavy clean, sterile object in the bottom of the container so the container will sink when it reaches the water level. Then slowly lower the container on the end of the rope by hand until it reaches the bottom of the well. You will know you have hit bottom when the rope has some slack in it. Wait for the container to fill with water and then pull it up. Repeat as often as required. When finished, carefully cover the exposed well head to prevent foreign materials from entering and contaminating your well water. Rain Water For the average person, the best source of replacement drinking water will probably be rain water. Although this is an excellent source of safe drinking water, it is unpredictable in regards to timing and quantity. However, for most people, this is probably the cleanest source of replenishment drinking water they will have access to on a regular but intermittent basis. Regardless of where you live in the world, if you can catch the rain water BEFORE it comes in contact with anything, then it is safe to drink without any special treatments. Even when you take acid rain into consideration, this is still a true statement. However, if there is a nuclear, chemical, or biological war at some point in the future, then rain water may not be safe to drink for some period of time. You will have to use your own judgment in that situation. One of the portable commercial water filters described below would be appropriate in those types of unusual and hazardous situations. If the air contains smog, pollen, or any other unpleasant stuff, then the rain will usually clean that stuff out of the air during the first 20 to 30 minutes of a good rain shower. Therefore, when it begins to rain you should wait about 30 minutes and then start collecting the clean rain water in a container. (Note: If you are seriously low on water and you are forced to collect the rain water during the first few minutes when it starts to rain, then you should process that water through one of the filters described below.) Be creative. Think about what you have available that you can put outside to catch and hold rain water, or channel rain water through a partially open window into a big pot. Remember that it usually rains one-inch or less each time it rains. You need a large surface area to collect enough rain water to drink. A drinking cup or glass will not be enough. Even a 5-gallon cook pot is too small to just put outside by itself because it will only collect one-inch of water in the bottom of the pot. Something like a child's inflatable swimming pool would be ideal, if your family already owns one. A 6-foot diameter pool would collect about 17 gallons of water if it rained one-inch. An 8-foot diameter pool would collect about 31 gallons of water if it rained one-inch. (Note: One gallon of water = 231 cubic inches of water.) Or you could secure a clean 10' by 12' tarpaulin (or a clean thick sheet of plastic) in a manner where it slopes downward into a ""V"" shape towards a large 5-gallon pot (or other large container). Tarpaulins are commonly called tarps. With this size tarp you could collect about 70 gallons of water if it rains one-inch in your area (if you keep emptying and replacing your 5-gallon pot). However, you will need to secure your tarp very carefully because it is frequently very windy during a rain storm. Determine the primary direction in which the wind is blowing and then secure your tarp facing the wind at an upwards angle so the wind will blow a lot of the rain onto the surface of your tarp where it can collect and be channeled down into your water storage container. In many areas it usually rains LESS than one-inch each time it rains, so it would probably be a good idea to use several tarps to collect rain water when it does rain. Many different tarp sizes are available, but for collecting rain water a tarp between 6' by 8' up to about 10' by 12' would be ideal. Smaller tarps don't cover enough area nor do they have very many other practical uses. Larger tarps are too heavy and they also have a limited number of other useful applications. If you are trying to decide between an inflatable swimming pool or a good tarp, then the tarp would be the better choice. It is usually less expensive, more durable, easier to transport between locations, easier to set up and take down, requires less storage space when not in use, and it will provide an overhead shelter if you need to do some unexpected camping. When camping, the two most useful items are a good hunting knife and a high quality tarp. Another option for collecting rain water would be to put clean bed sheets outside your windows. Let them get drenched in the rain, and then bring them inside and ring the water out of them by hand into a pot. Then stick them back out into the rain again. This is NOT the best method, but it will provide some drinking water. If you live in a tall apartment building with a flat roof, then you might consider collecting rain water on the roof of your building using the large tarp or heavy-duty plastic sheet described above. If you live in a house, you could collect the rain water from your roof gutters at the end of the down spouts. However, since the rain water has already been in contact with your roof, you will need to process it using one of the methods described later. The easiest way to collect roof rain water is to remove a few feet from the bottom of the gutter downspout and then put a large plastic container (or water barrel) directly beneath the shortened gutter downspout. The first few minutes of rain will wash a lot of stuff off your roof and down your gutter, so don't position the water collection container below the downspout until after it has rained about twenty-minutes. If you are camping, then you will probably be sleeping under a weatherproof tarp, or you will have a rain fly above your tent. By using a little creative thinking, you can frequently set things up so the rain water runs off your shelter into a big pot or other container. This requires a little ingenuity on your part depending on what you have available, but I mention it because some of you will figure out a way to make this idea work for you. Regardless of which method you use to collect the rain water, you will need to save the majority of your rain water until the next time it rains. Once again, if you have anticipated the possibility and seriousness of this type of unexpected emergency, then you should already have a reserve supply of clean, empty two-liter soda bottles or empty one-gallon plastic water jugs in which to store and save your rain water. If it doesn't rain, then you could go outside at dawn and collect the morning dew. How? Take a clean thin dish cloth or thin wash cloth and wipe it gently over the damp grass and other non-poisonous flowers and shrubs. Periodically ring the water out of the cloth into a bowl. Repeat. This is very hard work that yields very small quantities of water. However, if you are low on water, this may be your only way to stay alive. Bring the snow or ice inside your house and melt it down into water. You will be surprised at the small quantity of water you get from a big bucket of snow. If you are in the woods, put the pot of snow near the campfire and wait for it to melt. If you have a black plastic trash bag, then put some snow inside the bag and place it in the direct sunlight to melt the snow. If necessary, you can put the snow inside a small or medium size container. Then put the capped container inside your clothing (but not next to your skin) and your body heat will gradually melt the snow into water. If you are concerned about the cleanliness of the snow, then you can boil the resulting water for 1 or 2 minutes before you drink it. Never melt snow or ice inside your mouth. It will NOT relieve your thirst and you will dehydrate more quickly. Always melt the snow or ice first and then drink the resulting water. Ground water is almost always contaminated. If you live in the country, then ground water is lake, pond, creek, stream, or river water. In the city, it is water flowing beside the sidewalks during a heavy rain. If no other source of water is available, then you may be forced to collect the only water you can find. But don't drink it until you purify it. Even if the water looks crystal clear in a glass, it can still contain tiny organisms that will make you sick. You don't need a severe case of diarrhea or a high fever during difficult times. Like the old saying goes, it is better to be safe than sorry. All sorts of animals, bugs, and birds live in the woods. When they get the urge to use the bathroom, they let it go wherever they happen to be at the time (as long as it isn't inside their nests). Later, when it rains, that waste material washes down into the nearest pond, lake, stream, creek, or river. Think about that if you are tempted to drink ground water without purifying it first. The chances are pretty high you will get sick even though there is no industrial pollution anywhere in the vicinity. You MUST purify ground water using one of the methods which will be described later. Water that is flowing swiftly over rocks is normally much cleaner than water in stagnant pools. If you have a choice, collect your water from a fast moving stream and then purify the water using one of the techniques described later. Immediately after a rain the water in most streams and creeks will be muddy for a short period of time. At the very beginning of a rain shower you should check your water containers and fill them up if necessary before your normal water source (creek) gets really muddy. When it rains, the water does two things. Some of it travels along the top surface of the ground and ends up in creeks and streams. But a lot of it soaks into the earth and some of it makes its way down to the natural water table in the area. The earth is an excellent water filter. If the water table is 100 feet or more beneath the surface, then the water there is usually safe for human consumption without any treatment. That's why people in the country drill deep wells - they want clean water that doesn't need treatment. The next question is, how does a person get to that deep water out in the middle of the woods? Do NOT waste your time trying to dig for it. It isn't worth the effort. The best way is to find where a spring heads out. Let me explain. Because of gravity, water seeks the lowest possible level. You can usually find a stream or creek at the bottom of most hills or mountains. When you find one, begin walking upstream. Every now and then you will find a tiny feeder stream flowing into the main stream. The main stream will continue along the foot of the hill. Follow the tiny feeder stream up the side of the hill. Sooner or later you will eventually come to its source. It will just emerge from the ground. This is called the ""head of the spring."" The underground water table in this area is very close to the surface of the earth at this one spot and this particular exit point just happened as a result of nature. The water at the head of the spring hasn't had a chance to become polluted with lots of animal waste so it is the purest water you will find in the woods. The head of a spring is normally a reasonable distance up the side of a hill or mountain. If there is any level ground near the spring head, this is usually an excellent place to set up camp. You avoid both the peak and bottom of the hill (high winds and flooding waters), and you are near a really clean reliable source of good water. Usually (not always) this spring water it so clean it doesn't need to be boiled. I only know of one way to determine if the spring water contains harmful micro-organisms (called pathogens). Take a small water sample to your local water authority (county water service) and have it tested. They will tell you if it is fit for human consumption without being treated. There is one more important consideration. After a really good rain shower, there are usually many, many feeder springs running into the main stream at the bottom of the hill. The water table rises and it leaks out all the holes near the surface of the earth. After a short period of time, most of these holes run dry because the water table falls back to its normal level. Therefore, the best time to look for the head of a spring isn't after a good rain. At that time they are easy to find but most will be undependable for the long haul. Wait until you have had a few good sunny days and then look for a spring head that is still running strong. Most rain water will flow into a stream or soak into the earth. However, some of it will be caught in large natural depressions in boulders and other large rocks. Depending on the size of the depression (and other factors such as how long the water is in the shade each day, and how much of the rock is above ground to absorb the sun's rays, etc.) the rain water may not evaporate for many days after a rain. If you are trying to become familiar with a particular area of the woods, then you should mentally note these large depressions in a rock when you see them (even if they aren't filled with rain water at the time). After a long dry spell, many springs and steams will run dry. If you are really desperate for water, then try digging in the lowest part of a dry spring or stream bed. Sometimes you will hit the water table two or three feet below the surface. All of God's creatures need water to live. If you follow a heavily worn animal path downhill in the woods, it will probably lead to water. If you hear frogs in the distance, they are probably real close to some water. If you hear geese or ducks in the distance, they are probably real close to some water. Follow the animals and you will have a pretty good chance of finding where they get their drinking water. (Note: Bees also need water and they will build their hive in close proximity to a water source. If you see a bee, observe where it goes when it leaves the flower. It will either be heading to another flower, or to its hive. When returning to its hive, bees always fly in a straight line, or the proverbial bee line. Remember, the bee's hive is near some water.) Put a large plastic bag around the leaves of a non-poisonous bush or shrub in the early morning and secure the open end of the bag to the wood branch with a string. During the heat of the day the green vegetation inside the plastic bag will release water vapor which will collect on the inside of your plastic bag and gradually drain down to the lowest edge of the plastic bag. When you check your bag at the end of the day you will discover about one-ounce of water (or less) in the lowest corner of the bag. Therefore, for this method to be of any practical value, you would need to have a lot of these bags attached to a lot of different plants every day. I have read about solar stills but I have never personally experimented with one. However, I am passing this information on to you so you will know everything I know about water. You will need a large plastic sheet or tarp to make a solar still. Dig a conical hole about four-feet wide at the top and coming to a point about two-feet deep. The bottom of the hole should be in the very center (equal distance from all sides). The slope of the sides isn't critical. Put a medium size pot at the very bottom of the hole. Then lay your plastic sheet over the top of the hole and put a medium size rock (about one-pound) in the center of the sheet just above the pot which will be directly underneath the sheet. Put heavy rocks on top of your plastic sheet all around the outside of the hole to keep the sheet from touching the inner sloping sides of the hole. The center of the sheet should be about 18 inches below the surface of the ground but about 6 inches above the pot. Wait 24 hours. Water vapor will form on the underside of your tarp and drain down to its lowest point (beneath your one-pound rock) and then drip into your pot in the bottom of the hole. On hot days and cold nights you can collect about one-pint of water per 24-hour period. I read somewhere that you can put moist green non-poisonous vegetation (leaves) near the bottom of the hole (but not in the pot) and this will increase the water yield from your still. Solar still water is naturally distilled and it might be safe to drink without any treatments (such as boiling or chlorine). However, to avoid the possibility of getting sick it is a good idea to process the still water using one of the methods detailed below. You will have to move your solar still every two or three days because you will have pulled all the available water from that hole until the next time it rains. If you want to buy a plastic sheet to take with you when you go camping, then you can find them in the house paint section of most stores, including WalMart and most hardware stores. They are used by painters as drop-cloths to keep paint off the floor. They come in a variety of sizes and thicknesses. For durability, the 2-mil thickness is probably best. I have never built a solar water still but I have used these plastic sheets before. The 3-mil stuff will last longer but it is heavier and therefore you will burn more calories carrying it around in your backpack. The 1-mil stuff is lighter but it is very easily damaged (torn). Note: I occasionally receive an email telling me that I omitted the long thin plastic tube that most survival manuals normally show extending from inside the water pot up along the side of the hole and out from under the plastic tarp. The purpose of the long thin plastic tube is to allow you to drink the water from the pot without disturbing your solar still setup. I intentionally omitted that tube or ""long straw"" for safety considerations. If I were using the above solar still to generate my drinking water then I would want to visually examine that water before I put it into my mouth and swallowed it. Therefore I did not include the ""long straw"" in the above drawing or in my description of how to build a solar still. What Makes Water Unsafe to Drink? For educational purposes only. This is NOT intended to be used as medical advice. There are three different types of waterborne pathogens that make water unsafe to drink: protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. Protozoa : They live in insects, or in cysts when on the outside of an animal. Examples of common waterborne protozoa are amoeba, giardia, and crypto(sporidium). Protozoa range in size from 1 to 100 microns, with the average being around 16 microns. They are easily removed from water by boiling. Because of their large size most of them are also easily removed by commercially available water filters (with the exception of the very small crypto). Some are relatively resistant to both chlorine and iodine chemical treatment methods. It has been estimated that 90% of the surface water in the United States is contaminated with protozoa. Bacteria : A one-celled organism that can exist in the air and in water. The average size of bacteria is between 0.2 to 1.5 microns with some as large as 10 microns. They are easily removed by boiling, by chemical treatments, or by most good water filters. Fortunately, not all bacteria are life threatening. However, the most common life-threatening waterborne bacteria are dysentery (diarrhea), typhoid, (vibrio)cholera, campylobacter, E. coli, and salmonella. Viruses : The most common waterborne viruses are hepatitis, yellow fever, polio(myelitis), rotavirus, and norwalk. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria. The average size of a virus is from 0.004 to 0.100 microns. They are easily removed by boiling or by chemical treatments. However, because of their extremely small size, they can pass through most water filters. However, some viruses will cling to other larger particles in the water which can be filtered out. The incubation period prior to becoming extremely sick as a result of ingesting one of the above pathogens varies from a few hours to a few weeks, depending on the pathogen itself and the concentration ingested. Common symptoms include fatigue, fever, cramps, diarrhea, dehydration, and nausea. If not properly treated by a medical professional, these pathogens can eventually result in a person's death. If you are in a remote area or if you can't get to a doctor quickly, then stay warm, drink plenty of safe fluids, and rest. You can help control the diarrhea with over-the-counter antidiarrheal medicines, and you can take over-the-counter pain relievers to help reduce the fever and minimize other associated discomforts. However, you should plan to get to a medical doctor as soon as possible. How to Make Water Safe to Drink Pure clean water should be used: 1. to drink, 2. to make a beverage, 3. to cook with, 4. to brush your teeth, 5. to wash your hands and face, and 6. to wash your eating dishes and cook pots. After you have purified your water using one of the following techniques, do NOT recontaminate your water by allowing it to touch a pot, or spoon, or anything else that has been in contact with the unpurified water. If your source of water is relatively cloudy or muddy (high turbidity) then allow it to stand in a large pot for twelve-hours to give the foreign particles an opportunity to settle to the bottom of the pot. Then slowly and carefully scoop the water out of the top of the pot without disturbing the sediment on the bottom of the pot. Regardless of which of the following methods you use to purify your water, the first step is always the same. Begin by pouring your water through a standard paper coffee filter, or through a clean pillow case, or through a piece of denim cloth material. This will trap and remove any large impurities in the water. The same coffee filter can be used over and over again for several days (unless the water is muddy or dirty). After you have pre-filtered your water, then you may use one of the following options to purify your water. The following alternatives are presented in order from the cheapest to the most expensive method. Boiling is the BEST method for killing ALL the pathogens in the water. Even the most expensive commercially available water filter can't make that claim. Therefore, let's examine this method very carefully. Water boils at approximately 212?F at sea level at a barometric pressure of approximately 30.3 inches of mercury. The boiling point of water decreases as the barometric pressure decreases. Therefore, the changing barometric pressure in your area has as much impact on the boiling point of water as the altitude at which you live. The following table illustrates this relationship: The Boiling Point of Water at Different Altitudes at Different Barometric Pressures Altitude 30"" Mercury 29"" Mercury 28"" Mercury 27"" Mercury Sea Level 211.5 ?F 209.8 ?F 208.0 ?F 206.2 ?F 2,000 Feet 208.0 ?F 206.2 ?F 204.4 ?F 202.5 ?F 4,000 Feet 204.4 ?F 202.5 ?F 200.5 ?F 198.4 ?F 6,000 Feet 200.5 ?F 198.4 ?F 196.3 ?F 194.1 ?F 8,000 Feet 196.3 ?F 194.1 ?F 191.8 ?F 189.4 ?F 10,000 Feet 191.8 ?F 189.4 ?F 186.9 ?F 184.3 ?F All pathogens die rapidly at 185?F. Some pathogens die at lower temperatures. By the time the water has reached its boiling point (even at low barometric pressures), all the pathogens in the water are already neutralized. Therefore, bring your water to a boil and let it hard boil for 1 minute. Or hard boil for 2 minutes on top of an extremely high mountain at very low barometric pressures. Boiling for more time doesn't help, and it results in more water being lost as steam, and it makes the water taste flatter. All pathogens are already dead by the time the water reaches its boiling point. There is no benefit to a pathogen being ""more"" dead. Wait patiently for the water to gradually cool to a comfortable drinking temperature. How to Improve the Taste of Boiled Water: 1. Stir the water to add oxygen back into the water. 2. Or pour the water from one clean sterile container into another sterile container several times. 3. Or add a little salt to the water. 4. Or add 50 mg of Vitamin C to a quart of water. 5. Or add Kool-Aid (10% Vitamin C) or Tang (100% Vitamin C) to the water. Now let's look at some other ways to improve the quality of your drinking water. But don't forget, Boiling is Best, if you intend to actually drink the water in the next 24 hours or so. However, if you plan to store the water for an extended period of time, then one of the following methods should be considered. The water should not be too cool. The water temperature should be 70?F or higher. If necessary, put the water in direct sunlight to raise the water temperature. The effectiveness of chlorine at killing pathogens diminishes rapidly at lower temperatures. Add the required number of drops of chlorine liquid bleach (Clorox or store brand, unscented) to the water and wait one hour for the bleach to kill all the tiny organisms. If you can detect a faint chlorine smell in the water at the end of one hour, then it is safe to drink. If you can't smell the chlorine, then add the same amount of bleach a second time and wait another hour. If you can detect a faint chlorine smell, then the water is safe to drink. If you still can't detect the smell of chlorine, then discard the water because it contains too many germs. (Note: Always start with the minimum recommended amount of bleach and add a little more if necessary. Too much chlorine is harmful to your body.) The water should not be too cool. The water temperature should be 70?F or higher. If necessary, put the water in direct sunlight to raise the water temperature. The effectiveness of chlorine at killing pathogens diminishes rapidly at lower temperatures. Put 1/96 of an ounce (a pinch between thumb and finger) of 68% Calcium Hypochlorite granules into one gallon of water. Wait one-hour. If you can detect a faint chlorine smell in the water, then it is safe to drink. If you can't smell the chlorine, then add another ?pinch? and wait another hour. If you can detect a faint chlorine smell, then the water is safe to drink. If you still can't detect the smell of chlorine, then discard the water because it contains too many germs. (Note: Always start with a small amount of Calcium Hypochlorite and add a little more if necessary. Too much chlorine is harmful to your body.) The shelf life of liquid bleach (sodium hypochlorite) is much shorter than the dry 68% Calcium Hypochlorite granules. Therefore, if you wish to store hypochlorite for emergency purposes, the best choice is the dry granules. Liquid Bleach: If you have dry 68% Calcium Hypochlorite granules, and for some reason you need liquid bleach, then you may dissolve one-ounce of 68% granules in one-pint of water and you will have a 5.25% liquid bleach solution. Relatively Clear Water - Use 4 drops of iodine per quart of water or 16 drops per gallon. Cloudy Water - Use 8 drops of iodine per quart of water or 32 drops per gallon. The water should not be too cool. The water temperature should be 70?F or higher. If necessary, put the water in direct sunlight to raise the water temperature. The effectiveness of iodine at killing pathogens diminishes rapidly at lower temperatures. Add the required number of drops of iodine to the water and wait one hour. Iodine has a printed expiration date on the bottle. When that date has expired, the iodine will have lost some or most of its original strength. Therefore, iodine is generally not the chemical of choice for long-term survival situations. Caution : Iodine water treatment methods can NOT be used by pregnant women, or nursing mothers, or individuals with thyroid conditions. In addition, long-term exposure to iodine can contribute to liver damage. Although iodine is one way to purify water, it is NOT a preferred method. Any of the above methods is superior to the use of iodine. Most commercially available water purification tablets are based on the use of either chlorine or iodine as their primary active ingredient. Both chlorine and iodine have a relatively short shelf life before they begin to lose their full strength and effectiveness. If you happen to have some of these tablets and they have passed their expiration date, then you should replace them. The best overall method for improving the quality of water, but also the most expensive, is to use a commercial water filter, but not one that permanently connects to your home water system because it requires water pressure to function properly. The one potential disadvantage of commercial water filters (not purifiers) is that they cannot remove 100% of ALL virus pathogens. Fortunately, waterborne virus pathogens are NOT a common problem in most areas. Therefore, unless there has been an outbreak of viral diseases in your area, then waterborne viruses will probably not be a problem with your water supply. However, if there has been a recent outbreak of viral diseases, then add the appropriate quantity of chlorine to the water, wait one-hour, and then put that treated water through one of the following filters. Commercial water filters are normally purchased for one of three reasons: 1. To improve the taste and quality of the normal home water supply. 2. To provide drinking water during a short-term emergency. 3. To provide drinking water for long-term survival. Many people add a variety of water softeners, water filters, and water purifiers to the plumbing in their homes to improve the quality of the water normally available at their place of residence. These filters depend on water pressure and/or electricity to function properly. Neither water pressure nor electricity can be depended on during either short-term or long-term survival scenarios so these types of water filters will not be discussed here. Short-term emergencies, such as hurricanes or tornados, are extremely serious but life gradually returns to normal after the danger has passed. Unless your area was completely demolished, most services are restored in days, or weeks, or sometimes a little longer. Long-term survival, such as a World War being fought within your nation's borders, is a more challenging situation because you may not have any outside help or assistance for an extended period of time. Your survival will depend completely on the resources you had available before the situation developed. Some water filters perform very well during short-term emergencies, but they are not designed for long-term survival situations. Other water filters are specifically engineered for long-term survival scenarios. Fortunately, those same filters will also function exceedingly well during short-term emergencies. Consequently, the following recommendations are for long-term survival water filters, which will also serve in a short-term emergency if required. In a long-term survival situation, the primary source of life-threatening pathogens entering the water supply is through human waste (fecal matter). Since the normal sewage system is not functioning the way it was designed to, human waste is NOT disposed of properly. It is frequently thrown into the streets to get it out of people's homes. The next rain washes significant amounts of that human waste into the nearest water collection area. Disease, sickness, and death soon follow. Even if you are in or near a crowded camping area during a long-term survival scenario, the same tragic drama unfolds. To survive in a situation such as this, you need to filter all your drinking water and then boil it. (Note: The proper way to deal with human waste while camping is to bury it.) Three different water filters will be discussed below. None of them require water pressure or electricity. The first model is a Swiss Katadyn Pocket Water Filter. Its advantages are that is more affordable, lighter weight, and extremely portable. It comes with one 0.2 micron filter element that will yield one-quart of drinking water per minute and the filter has a maximum rated life of 13,000 gallons of water under good conditions. Its disadvantages are that it must be hand pumped, and if its one filter is damaged in any way then it makes the unit of questionable value. However, if you perceive a survival scenario where you will be frequently moving between locations by walking or by bicycle, then it is probably your best choice because it is both small and light weight. (Note: There are several other cheaper Katadyn water filters available, such as the Hiker and the Guide, but they are NOT designed for long-term survival scenarios.) The second model is a British Berkefeld Big Berkey. Its advantages are that it uses gravity to filter the water, and it comes with four 0.9 micron nine-inch filters. Each filter has a maximum rated life of 12,000 gallons of water under good conditions (or 48,000 gallons of water from all four filters). It weighs about 9 pounds and it has exterior dimensions of about 8.5"" diameter and 20.5"" tall. It may be used with one, two, three, or all four filters installed. In a survival situation, one filter will provide about six-gallons of drinking water per day. That would leave three unused filters in reserve as replacements when the first filter wears out, or if anything should happen to the first filter. The stainless steel gravity Berkefeld water containers are extremely nice units. However, the quality of the current Berkefeld water filters that are used inside those stainless steel containers may not be as good as they were in the past. Therefore, beginning in October of 2012, I cannot recommend the purchase of the Berkefeld water filters. The third model is an American AquaRain Model 400 Water Filter. It advantages are that it uses gravity to filter the water, and it comes with four 0.3 micron filters. Each filter has a maximum rated life of 10,000 gallons of water under good conditions. It weighs about 10 pounds and it has exterior dimensions of 10.5"" diameter and 22"" tall. It can be used with one, two, three, or all four filters installed. Expected Life: Up to 13,000 gallons of water from ONE filter depending on the quality of the incoming water source. The maximum filter life can be achieved if the incoming water is pre-filtered through a clean cloth before putting it through the Katadyn filter. British Berkefeld ""Big Berkey"" Gravity Water Filter with Four 9-inch Super Sterasyl Candles Note: As of October 2012 I no longer recommend the purchase of the Berkefeld water filters. I am leaving the following information on my web site so you will know that I did consider them acceptable prior to October of 2012. Used by missionaries around the world. No water pressure required. No electricity required. Stainless Steel Construction. Output: 6 gallons per day from ONE filter, or 24 gallons per day using all four filters at the same time. Water is filtered automatically by the use of gravity. Lower Tank Holding Capacity: 2.4 gallons. Expected Life: Between 2,000 to 12,000 gallons PER FILTER of pure water depending on the quality of the incoming water. The maximum filter life can be achieved if the incoming water is pre-filtered through a clean cloth before putting it through the Berkefeld filter. Six month warranty on the water filters. Filter Elements: Four 0.9 micron Nine-Inch Super Sterasyl Candle Filters Self-disinfecting due to fine particles of silver evenly distributed throughout the Sterasyl filter which prevents the growth of bacteria. Sterasyl Candles form a barrier to all particles 0.9 microns or larger in size. Super Sterasyl Candles have an activated carbon filling which removes chemical and organic compounds from the water, reduces herbicides and pesticides, eliminates unpleasant odors, and improves the taste. This unit may be priced and sold with either 7"" or 9"" Sterasyl Candles. Verify you are getting 9"" filters before you buy. This unit may be priced and sold with either Regular Sterasyl Candles or Super Sterasyl Candles. Verify you are getting four 9"" Super Sterasyl Candle filters before you buy. This unit may be priced with the black filters. The black filters are better but they do not have the life expectancy of the Super Sterasyl Candle filters. All Sterasyl filters will remove: More than 99.99% E. Coli Bacteria More than 99.99% Cholera Bacteria More than 99.99% Fecal Coliform Bacteria More than 99.99% Shigetta Bacteria More than 99.99% Salmonella Bacteria More than 99.99% Typhoid Bacteria 100% Giardia Protozoa 100% Cryptosporidium Protozoa Reduces turbidity more than 99.7% Does NOT remove 99.9% of all viruses. Does NOT remove dissolved minerals or chemicals. Therefore it can not be used to desalinate sea water. The durable filters element may be cleaned many times with a Scotch Brite pad, purchased separately. Shipped with two rubber hole plugs to permit the use of two filters. To use more than two filters at the same time, remove the rubber hole plugs. To use only one filter, an additional cork or hole plug will need to be purchased separately. Expected Life: Between 2,500 to 10,000 gallons PER FILTER of pure water depending on the quality of the incoming water. The maximum filter life can be achieved if the incoming water is pre-filtered through a clean cloth before putting it through the AquaRain filter. Does NOT remove dissolved minerals or chemicals. Therefore it can not be used to desalinate sea water. The durable filters element may be cleaned up to 200 times with the included cleaning pad. Shipped with two silicone hole plugs to permit the use of two filters. To use more than two filters at the same time, remove the silicone hole plugs. To use only one filter, an additional cork or hole plug will need to be purchased separately. At the current time all three of the above water filters are saturated with fine particles of silver to prevent and retard the growth of pathogens. Early American pioneers frequently put a silver dollar into their water barrels and they left it there because they had learned from experience that it helped to reduce the number of health related problems within their families. The following is just my opinion about the potential advantages and shortcomings of the above water filters. It is nothing more than my opinion. I no longer recommend the purchase of the Berkefeld water filters because their quality does not appear to be as good as it was in the past. However, their stainless steel water containers are extremely nice. Therefore if you have one of their stainless steel containers then I recommend that you consider purchasing some AquaRain replacement water filters for that unit when your current supply of Berkefeld water filters have been used up. Each company that sells a water filter will tell you why their particular water filter is better than their competitors. But each company will usually only be comparing the specific features of their filter that are better while not mentioning the features where their filter is weaker. The AquaRain filter does have the advantage of a carbon core. The inner carbon core filter does help to improve the taste of filtered water. However, if you wish you may add an external carbon filter to the Katadyn filter. In other words, if your water has taste problems, then after putting it through the Katadyn filter you could then pour that water through a separate carbon filter. There is no simple one best answer about which water filter company makes the best filter. At this time I cannot recommend the Katadyn filter or the AquaRain filter as being the best one on the market. Each filter has advantages and disadvantages. However, if you only talk to a sales representative they will focus their sales pitch on the advantages and downplay the disadvantages. In a life-threatening emergency I would first hard boil my water for one minute and then I would let it gradually cool down to room temperature. Boiling would kill the pathogens in the water. Then I would use either a Katadyn or an AquaRain water filter to further enhance the quality of the water. Then I would feel safer about drinking the water. How to Build an Affordable High Efficiency Homemade Water Filter for about $50 A replacement water filter cartridge with an O-ring and a wing nut such as the ones made by AquaRain (approximately $45.00). A good quality water filter will process about 10,000 to 12,000 gallons of water before it wears out if you pre-filter the water through a clean cloth before putting it through your water filter. One good water filter will provide about 7 or 8 gallons of drinking water each day. When you order your water filter please be sure to specifically request that they ship the filter with a new ""O"" ring and a new ""wing nut"" for the bottom of the filter. With a new water filter, and an ""O"" ring seal, and a ""wing nut"" you can install your filter on anything that will hold at least one-gallon of water, and is also at least as tall as the filter itself. For example, you could install a water filter in a food grade 5 or 6 gallon plastic bucket, or a plastic tote container, or an empty one-gallon plastic water bottle (after you cut the top off the bottle). The container must have a flat bottom surface at the position where you will install the water filter. Simply drill a one-half inch diameter hole in the bottom center of the container and then put the ""O"" ring tight against the filter on the inside of the container and then screw the ""wing nut"" to the filter on the outside of the container. Then put the modified water filter container over another clean container that will catch the filtered water and fill the water filter container with water. Then relax and wait for gravity to move the water through your water filter into the lower container. If you are filtering out radioactive particles then position your water filter system far enough away from your living quarters so the tiny radioactive particles that will get trapped inside the water filter cannot slowly poison your family members. Radiation only kills living organisms. It does not kill non-living things such as water or canned food. However, if you ingest water or food that contains radioactive particles then you will get sick and eventually die. However, if you remove the radioactive particles from the water then the water will be safe to drink. How to Distill Water Equipment Needed: Pressure Cooker (any size). Copper Tubing (12 to 15 feet). Cooling Bucket (2 to 5 gallons). Clean Cook Pot or Clean Water Bucket. The copper tubing should have an inside diameter that matches the outside diameter of the steam exhaust port on your pressure cooker. Leave about four-feet at both ends of the copper tubing relatively straight. Wrap the center of the copper tubing into a coil around any cylindrical object that is a few inches smaller in diameter than the inside of the cooling bucket (item 3 above). Remove and aside the cylindrical object after you have successfully coiled the middle of the copper tubing. Instructions for Distilling Water: Follow all the standard safety instructions for a pressure cooker. Pour some water through a clean cloth to pre-filter the water and remove any large impurities. Fill the pressure cooker between 1/2 to 3/4 full of pre-filtered water. Put the pressure cooker on the stove top but do NOT turn on the heat yet. Put a cooling bucket on a chair near the stove. Fill the cooling bucket with cool water. Place an empty clean cook pot or clean water bucket on the floor. Attach one end of the copper tubing to the steam exhaust port on top of the pressure cooker. Place the center coil of the cooper tubing inside the cool water in the cooling bucket. Place the other end of the copper tubing in the clean cook pot on the floor. Turn on the heat to the pressure cooker. The water inside the pressure cooker will gradually turn into steam and travel up through the steam exhaust port into the copper tubing. The steam will enter the cooling coil and cool down and become water again. It will then flow into the cook pot on the floor. You may reduce the heat to the pressure cooker after water starts flowing into the cook pot on the floor. Do NOT touch the pressure cooker or the copper tubing while either one is HOT. The above procedure will make distilled water but it uses a lot of energy. Other Methods of Making Water Safe to Drink There are a variety of other methods for making water safe to drink, such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet. However, those methods are better suited to normal situations that don't involve long-term survival and the possible absence of electricity. A Practical and Inexpensive Method for Replenishing Water while Hiking If you have enough Katadyn Pocket Water Filters for everyone in your group, then you may skip over this section. However, if some of the people in your party don't have their own Pocket Water Filter, then the following information may be of use to you. To begin with, it is not practical to attach items to the belt which holds your pants up. If you do, those items will pull your pants down as you walk and rub blisters on your hips. Not only is it painful, but it is also very annoying. Therefore, let your normal belt (or suspenders) hold your pants up. Then use another belt for your knife, pistol, first aid kit, and canteen, but don't put that belt through the belt loops on your pants. A belt canteen is usually preferred to a shoulder strap canteen because the shoulder strap wears a blister on your shoulder in a very short time, even when you keep changing shoulders. Most canteens are made of light-weight plastic. You can find them at most Army-Navy Surplus Stores. They also usually carry the canteen pouch and the equipment (canteen) belt. Sometimes you can also find a collapsible metal cup that will fit on the bottom of the plastic canteen and fit inside the cloth canteen pouch. The handle of the metal cup is on a hinge and it will fold down and under the cup out-of-the-way. ( Note: If you decide to visit an Army-Navy Surplus Store, then ask for an ""Alice"" type belt with shoulder harness suspender straps. It will cost a little more money but if you do ANY hiking you will probably never regret spending that money. If you purchase the Alice belt, then you should also check out the different types of small equipment bags they sell which attach to that belt. Each small bag can be used to store something different, such as first aid supplies, dehydrated or freeze-dried food, personal care items, or small miscellaneous survival gear such as snare wires and fishing tackle.) When full of water, the canteen weighs about 2.5 pounds. However, as you walk you will periodically drink some of your water. And if the unexpected occurs, then you may not be able to return to your primary area of safety before nightfall. Therefore, you should also carry the means to replace your drinking water if necessary. If you add a clean cloth (folded inside a heavy-duty freezer bag) to the inside of your canteen pouch with your canteen, then you will have a method to pre-filter your water. The heavy-duty freezer bag can be used to collect the water, even from a very shallow area. The water can then be poured from the freezer bag through the cloth into your metal cup. This pre-filters the water and removes any large impurities. You then have two options. If you have water purification tablets, then you could put the appropriate number inside the water in your cup and wait the specified time. Then you can pour the water into your canteen. Or you could start a fire IF you have a small butane lighter. Of course you would also need to find some combustible material but in most areas that is not too difficult. Then you can heat the water in your metal cup over the coals from the fire until the water boils. Let it boil for 1 minute (or 2 minutes if you are at the top of an extremely high mountain). Then wait patiently for the water to cool to a safe temperature. Then pour the safe water into your canteen. You would either boil your water OR you would use your water purification tablets, but you would NOT do both at the same time because they both accomplish the same basic objective. Of the two methods, boiling is best because it positively kills every pathogen in your water source whereas the purification tablets will not be successful against all viruses. The cloth canteen pouches sold at most Army-Navy Surplus Stores have a small pocket attached to the outside of the canteen pouch. This exterior pocket can be used to store your bottle of water purification tablets which should be placed inside a plastic sandwich bag. And it can also be used to store a miniature butane lighter in a separate plastic sandwich bag. The purpose of the sandwich bags is to protect those items from the condensation moisture from your canteen which will saturate your canteen pouch, or from the rain if it should start to rain unexpectedly while you are hiking. Water Conservation Recommendations for Personal Hygiene Activities Bathing If you are low on water then don't waste it bathing. I know cleanliness is important but most of us overdo it in the United States. Just wash your hands, face, and feet periodically. Use the two-pot method for bathing. Fill one pot with water and use it as the first rinse after washing your hands with soap, or after bathing with a sponge or wash cloth. Fill another pot with water and use it as the second rinse. Don't discard the wash water in the first pot until it is too dirty to be safely used, and then pour it into the back of your toilet tank so you can use it to flush your toilet, if your sewer system is still working. Then use the second pot as your first rinse and start a new pot of clean water as your second rinse. (Note: The average person probably won't appreciate the true value of their feet until they are confronted with a difficult situation. Then they will suddenly realize that their long-term survival depends on the condition of their feet.) If you have water pressure and you prefer to take showers, then take a military shower. Close the bath tub drain or put a flat round flexible plastic drain cover over the shower drain. Turn the water on , quickly get soaking wet all over, and then turn the water off . Use some soap to wash your body, and use some shampoo on your hair while the water is off . When you have finished washing and shampooing, turn the water on and quickly rinse the shampoo out of your hair and the soap off your body. Then turn the water off . If you practice this method you will discover you can take a good shower with only three or four gallons of water, and you can then use the shower water that is in the bottom of the tub or shower to flush your toilet, if your sewer system is still working. Teeth Brushing Always brush your teeth at least once per day. It doesn't take much water, just a little in a small cup. If you still have water pressure, then do not let the water run while you are brushing your teeth. (Note: Also do not let the water run while you are shaving.) Instead turn the faucet on and put about 2 or 3 ounces of water into a small cup. Then turn the faucet off. Only use a little toothpaste each time and not the amount you normally use. Your toothpaste will last four to six times longer this way with no compromise in dental hygiene. If your sewer system is still working then spit the used mouthful of toothpaste into the toilet bowl. If your sewer system is not working, the spit the toothpaste into the trash can. Rinse your mouth thoroughly after brushing with a small amount of water and spit it into the sink. (Note: If you have a limited amount of water then you do not want to run the risk of having your toothpaste slowly accumulate inside your sink drain and gradually dry out and form a soap block that prevents your drain from working properly. That is the reason you should consider spitting the toothpaste into the toilet stool or trash can.) Washing Dishes Use the three-pot method to wash your eating dishes. Wash your dishes in the first pot of water with dish soap. Rinse the dishes in a second pot. Rinse the dishes again in a third pot. When the dish water in the first pot gets really nasty, pour it down the front of your toilet stool to flush it, if your sewer system is still working. (Note: Dish water usually contains too much food residue and grease to put it in the back of the toilet tank but it can be poured into the front toilet bowl to help flush the stool.) Then put dish soap in the second pot and use it as the initial wash pot. Use the third pot as your first rinse. Add a new pot with clean water as the final rinse. Hot water, or even warm water, makes it easier to wash your dishes by hand. However, the effort and energy required to heat the water may sometimes exceed the extra manual effort required to simply scrub the dishes a little harder by hand in cold water. That trade-off decision will need to be made by each person based on their own personal circumstances. (Note: Warm water doesn't kill germs. Boiling water kills germs. However, warm water does make grease removal from the dishes much easier. Or you could use enamel coated camping dishes which clean up nicely even in cold water. However, long-term exposure to citric acid will stain the enamel coating on enamel dishes.) Washing Clothes If you are using a standard electric washing machine then do not discard your washing machine water directly into the drain. Move the drain hose to a position above a large empty water container to catch the used wash water. After the first wash cycle, allow the wash water to drain into your water storage container. This soapy wash water can be used in the back of your toilet stool to flush your toilets, if your sewer system is still working. After the washing machine rinse cycle, allow the rinse water to drain into another water storage container. After the washing machine spin cycle is complete, remove your clean clothes, and then transfer the rinse water back into your washing machine. This water is relatively clean and it only contains a little soap residue which will be of use during the next wash cycle. If you will follow this method you will not be wasting any water to wash your clothes, because all of the water will eventually be used to flush your toilets. The Common Household Toilet Stool If your sewer system is not working then you may use the two pot method for human waste collection and disposal. You will need two large five-gallon containers with lids. When you need to use the toilet, then do so inside one of the two containers. Liquid waste should go into one container and solid waste in the other container. Then immediately replace the lid so most of the odor remains inside the containers. Your local public health authorities will tell you where and how to periodically dispose of this human waste to prevent the spread of a multitude of life threatening diseases. If your sewer system is working then you may use your toilet. Most new toilet stools are very water efficient and they only require the absolute minimum amount of water per flush. If you have an older toilet stool then it probably uses between four to six gallons of water per flush, which is excessive. However, you can easily reduce the amount of water required per flush. Fill a clean empty 16 to 24 ounce plastic bottle (soft drink or water) with small rocks or pebbles as full as you can, and then finish filling the plastic bottle with water. Replace the bottle cap tightly. Carefully remove the top piece off the rear of your toilet tank and place the full weighted plastic bottle inside the tank. If necessary, secure it with some wire or string inside the toilet tank so that it does not interfere with the normal flushing operation of the toilet. Then flush the toilet to make sure it flushes properly. If you still have some space, then you may add a second and a third filled plastic bottle inside the toilet tank. Just be careful that you do not interfere with the normal flushing operation of the toilet. (Note: Or you could put a brick inside a plastic freezer bag and put it inside the toilet tank instead of using a plastic bottle. Or you could simply replace your old toilet with a new water efficient toilet that uses about 1.6 gallons per flush. ) Only flush human waste and used toilet tissue down your toilet stool. Do not put makeup removal tissues or any other type of used paper in your toilet stool. Instead dispose of these other types of used paper products in an ordinary trash can. Flushing the toilet each time you use it is NOT a good idea under hardship conditions. In the country when people occasionally find themselves short on water they follow a very simple rule: If it is yellow, let it mellow. If it is brown, flush it down. Conclusion Our bodies are mostly water. Most of the earth's surface is covered with water. Unfortunately, most of it isn't fit to drink. But without water we will all be dead in about three days. Therefore, any information you can acquire about how and where to get drinking water takes you one step closer to being an independent, resourceful human being in God's natural order of things.

39398	good day and thank you for taking the time to read and try to help my situation. i have a pair of gtx-580 gpus that i preffer to do the crunching, rather than the cpu. and it does seem to be doing what its supposed to. but since i restarted doing this a month or so ago ive played w a lot of projests, 1 at a time even and it seems as tho im only getting a tenth of the credit that the other projects show me (on stats tab). is it just me or should ther be somthing i can do to better help this project, rather than let me resources go to other projects i would very much like to be a better cruncher for setti. other project tend to be overly generous with the credits when it comes to crunching numbers. Also the Seti@home WU's are a bit more complex than most other projects. S@H does give credits for exactly how much work is done. Others typically just hand out credit without regard to the amount of work done. This keeps people crunching for them when otherwise people would just abandon them ____________ Proud member of TSWB.

30478	"The Nature of Conflict A conflict is the moment of truth in a relationship-a test of its health, a crisis that can weaken or strengthen it, a critical event that may bring lasting resentment, smouldering hostility, psychological scars.  Conflicts can push people away from each other or pull them into a closer and more intimate union; they contain the seeds of destruction and the seeds of greater unity; they may bring about armed warfare or deeper mutual understanding. How conflicts are resolved is probably the most critical factor in all relationships.  Unfortunately, most people try to resolve them by using only two basic approaches in which someone wins and someone loses, both of which outcomes are ineffective and harmful to the relationship. Few persons accept the fact that conflict is part of life and not necessarily bad.  We look on conflict as something to avoid at all costs.  We often hear husbands and wives boast that they have never had a serious disagreement-as if that means theirs has been a good relationship. Parents tell their children, ""All right, there is to be no arguing tonight at the dinner table-we don't want to spoil our dinner.""  Or they yell, ""Stop that arguing, right now!""  Parents of teenagers can be heard lamenting that now that their children are older there are many more disagreements and conflicts in the family.  ""We used to see eye to eye on most things.""  Or, ""My daughter was always so cooperative and easy to handle, but now we don't see things her way and she can't see things our way."" At home or at work, most of us hate to experience conflict, are deeply trouble when it occurs, and are quite confused about how to handle it constructively.  Actually, it would be a rare relationship if, over a period of time, one person's needs did not conflict with the other's.  When any two people (or groups) coexist, conflict is bound to occur just because people are different, think differently, and have needs and wants that sometimes do not match. Conflict, therefore, is not necessarily bad-it exists as a reality of any relationship.  As a matter of fact, a relationship with no apparent conflict may be unhealthier than one with frequent conflict.  A good example is a marriage where the wife is always subservient to a dominating husband or vice versa, or a boss-subordinate relationship in which the subordinate is so deathly afraid of the boss that s/he does not dare cross him/her in any way. Most people have known families, especially large families, where conflict crops up constantly and yet these families are wonderfully happy and healthy.  Conversely, we often see newspaper accounts of youthful criminals whose parents indicate complete astonishment that their boy could do such a thing.  They say they never had any trouble with him; he had always been so ""cooperative"" which is usually a euphemism of ""obedient."" Conflict in a family or a work group, openly expressed and accepted as a natural phenomenon, can be far healthier than most people think.  Members have the opportunity to experience conflict, learn how to cope with it, and be better prepared to deal with it in later life.  And family conflict may actually be beneficial, provided that the conflict in the home gets resolved constructively. This is the critical factor in any relationship:  how their conflicts get resolved, not how many conflicts occur.  It is the most critical factor in determining whether a relationship will be healthy or unhealthy, mutually satisfying or unsatisfying, friendly or unfriendly, deep or shallow, intimate or cold, peaceful or violent.* 'E.T. has helped me so much with positive and authentic communication, not only in the workplace but in my personal life.

36702	thanks , i actually went looking for this one a few weeks back and gave up when i found the links in the original announcement were broken. i have been up and down the firmware revisions in the past with out much luck. these older ones from memory have issues with the 7day epg and the more recent general crashing a few times a day. anyhow im just hoping that one of these firmwares when released cures the once/twice daily crash and has a useable 7day epg for scheduled recording. maybe i just wish for too much 22nd nov 2011 is the mcas my box is on, thats the only version that didnt freeze every few seconds with my austar 5.4 card. I have been turning my system completely off at night and letting it do it's complete bootup in the morning and have not had hardley any crashes. If I try to change to another Internet ch on 'internet tv' before the one I am loading starts or stops I get it locking up but in the normal mode it has been very good.

13437	01 October 2012 Some Kind of Wonderful progress... Last week I spent the most time working on my monthly cottages project Finished this one... and made a start on the next one. I did get the chance to finish off a couple more blocks for the SKOW quilt. The kitty cat... I enjoyed stitching this and it turned out to be quite easy to needle turn. The next one I made to replace the shoes block in row 4 as I'm not really a fan of high heels. I am a fan of bees though so I made a beehive with some embroidered buzzy bees... I enjoyed making this one too! Not a lot of sewing time over the weekend. On Saturday Catherine and I went to see the new Resident Evil film which we've been looking forward to for ages. Lots of Alice in action but the story was quite lacking I thought. On the way home we detoured via Abakhan fabrics (it was a detour too as it's in completely the opposite direction) so that I could pick up a few supplies. I didn't actually go to buy fabric but really - what stitcher is going to walk into a fabric shop and not even take a peek at the fabric? I came out with this... because I just couldn't leave without it! I have no idea what to use it for but for now I'm enjoying looking at it :) It was a bit pricey compared with Abakhan's normal fabulous prices but I notice that it's actually made by a New Zealand company so perhaps that's the reason. It's called 'A Stitch in Time' by Nutex. I really like it a lot! 	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
2808	Since the simple concept of the website first became a major part of our lives years ago, a lot has changed. In the past, websites were designed mostly to show off the latest in this new technology and all it could bring to the table. However, times have begun to change and have found people becoming more used to the internet and the level of convenience it offers. As a result, websites are becoming sleeker and more efficient. They're more focused on functionality than they are flash and show. When it comes to visuals, we're seeing more attention being paid to a streamlined finished and a minimalist point of view as well. Here's how we can expect these trends to continue into the bright new year of 2013. Interactivity Will Be Huge Web design and mobile technology are changing a lot about people's expectations in regards to the media they absorb, as well as the resources they rely on. Every year, human beings evolve more toward a personalized lifestyle where everything is customized for them. Web-based radio and television stations not only play people the music they most want to hear, but they make personalized recommendations in regards to what they might want to check out next. Mobile phone apps effortlessly customize themselves according to the user's location, preferences, and usage history. As a result, people are expecting the same from the websites they use to an increasing degree. In 2013, website designers who truly wish to stay ahead of the game will be contouring their designs to fit this preference. More websites will be utilizing scripts that recommend not only onsite content that might fit the user's needs, but also location-based recommendations such as localized price quotes or local service-finder plug-ins. Increased Focus on Social Media It doesn't take a genius to see that social media is something that's here to stay. At this point, interfaces like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google Plus are a lot more than simple ways to stay in touch with family and friends. They're platforms we rely on for news, advice, core social interactions, and much more. This is only expected to become more the case in the years to come, so naturally website design is expected to showcase social media-based interactions to a much greater degree. This trend is also expected to reach and influence web content and services provided by web-based businesses as well. Fluid Design Options We're already seeing a huge increase in the role multiple devices and interfaces are playing in regards to how people access the internet. Website designers are moving away from the old-school static design and adopting methods that are more responsive in nature. This allows for a given site to load well and be usable via any interface whether that's a standard desktop system, a sleek new iPad, or a mobile phone. That said, more web designers will be making the switch from the tried and true HTML4 and old-school CSS options and upgrading to CSS3 or HTML5. Sites designed using these programming interfaces are actually able to function more like mobile apps and tablet apps. This allows the site to be viewable, usable, and enjoyable to use across a multitude of different devices and interfaces. By the end of 2013, it's actually probable that few web designers worth their salt will be using anything else. In short, the year 2013 will find us moving boldly forward and building upon existing trends in a big way. How exciting it will be to see where web design takes us next!

22537	"@Saelan- Its a straight phone pic of the light around 8:30 this morning, full-frame. I use Squaready app to make borders, then I instagrammed it. No filter, if I remember correctly. I almost never use photoshop beyond basic wee adjustments -- -straightening, color correction, etc. I'm currently in love with this shot. And the ikebana pic from Kyoto a few posts back. We were at the art museum for the Chagall exhibit and stumbled on a big calligraphy and ikebana exhibition upstairs. More interestingly, on the 6th floor, there was a calligraphy workshop for monks. Alex is great! I wrote about his work last year in BlackFlash 28.2 . Unfortunately the text isn't online but I'm working on setting up a proper site for myself with all my writing archived. Stay tuned. We should point out before moving on that in each of these forms of immaterial labor, cooperation is completely inherent in the labor itself. Immaterial labor immediately involves social interaction and cooperation. In other words, the cooperative aspect of immaterial labor is not imposed or organized from the outside, as it was in previous forms of labor, but rather, cooperation is completely immanent to the laboring activity itself . This fact calls into question the old notion (common to classical and Marxian political economics) by which labor power is conceived as ""variable capital,"" that is, a force that is activated and made coherent only by capital, because the cooperative powers of labor power (particularly immaterial labor power) afford labor the possibility of valorizing itself. Brains and bodies still need others to produce value, but the others they need are not necessarily provided by capital and its capacities to orchestrate production. Today productivity, wealth and the creation of social surpluses take the form of cooperative interactivity through linguistic, communicational, and affective networks. In the expression of its own creative energies, immaterial labor thus seems to provide the potential for a kind of spontaneous and elementary communism.

7319	"TCPglobal - news, views and issues on total cost of printing Issue #1208 - As we see the launch of the much-talked-about Windows 8 by Microsoft today, we have to say, ""It's a really good thing Microsoft does not make printers!"" Why? Simply because Windows 8 is sadly lacking its Windows! User interface designer and software developer Dave Maude takes a look at some of the technicalities of Windows 8 that seem to have been overlooked in the media so far. Now, if you ask any of my family or friends, I'm sure they would tell you that while I like what Apple does, I am by no means an Apple fan-boy, a Linux nerd or a Microsoft geek, but that I am a huge techie. Having used a variety of different operating systems across multiple platforms in near equal moderation in the past, I see strengths and weaknesses in each. So what are the strengths of Windows when considered in the company of Mac OSX and Linux Ubuntu for example? Well, in the Mac we have simplicity of use and ease of maintenance meaning Apple's recent mantra of 'It just works', more often than not seems to compare well with the technically more complicated Windows and Linux. But, then again, Linux does have extraordinary flexibility and the app store with centralised update management ensuring security updates are managed at an OS level for third party apps as well. I am aware Mac OSX is moving in this direction but the availability of Mac apps on the app store is still somewhat lacking. So where does Windows benefit? Well, that would have to be in its ubiquity. There is no other single operating system family that is as widespread in its contagion in both the business and personal computer markets. I mean, you only have to look at the fact that Windows 7 has sold 600 million licenses globally since its release to realise that as much as Apple might consider itself to be the messiah of the digital age, Microsoft still has dominant market control with roughly 84% of the market. So, let's put that into perspective. There are circa 2.27bn global internet users, meaning that more than 664 million worldwide users of the internet are using a version of Windows older than Windows 7. That's a lot of upgrades, even when not taking into account all the Windows 7 users, most of whom are more likely to be early adopters of Windows 8 than those still using Windows XP. Now, with this in mind, wouldn't you think Microsoft would concentrate most on what would work best for the nearly 2 billion users of their current operating system when putting together the user interface architecture for its new Windows family member? I hate to be the bearer of bad news to anyone, let alone just under 2 billion people, but I'm here to tell you that Microsoft was not thinking about you, the Windows user, when they developed Windows 8. Instead they got hooked on Apple juice and developed for the much hyped 'post-pc era'. Now, clearly you can't argue that mobile computing is not extraordinary in its success and the speed by which it seems to be developing. It is just recently reported that over 100 million Android devices were sold during Q2 2012. So we shouldn't ignore this sizeable market either. But Microsoft's fatal error is to attempt to develop a one size fits all operating system for both tablets in the mobile computing sector and desktop PCs. You may ask, why is that such a problem? Surely my iPad or Galaxy Tab can do most of what my desktop PC can do! Or maybe you're even one of the few who have completely abandoned desktop computing for your shiny new tablet. But consider this; using your finger or even a stylus to design the next Airbus colossus; or attempting to touch-type that 20,000-word report on a touchscreen device for your boss due by the end of the week; or writing the code for the next Windows operating system on a 10.1? screen. It is just not efficient or effective! Desktop computing, in its current guise, is here for a long time -- certainly until something more convincing comes along. So what really is the matter with Windows 8? Well, you may have encountered the Metro interface, whether on a Windows phone, xBox or Zune HD and most writers are blaming the downfall of Windows 8 on this new UI that Microsoft seems to be putting all its weight behind. Now, you might be a fan of Metro, or you may hate it, but I'm here to tell you, it's not the problem! You see, Windows in every incarnation up until Windows 8 has controlled its application UI through the use of windows. Can you see where the name came from? And yet, except for the get out clause with the desktop app where you can run all your legacy software that hasn't yet been written for the Metro interface, the new Windows doesn't work around windows at all! In fact, even the desktop app that looks and works suspiciously like Windows 7, but nowhere near as well, is actually slow and clunky to use. Clearly the company is trying to push all developers to build apps specifically for the Metro UI rather than using the previous windows-based UI. It is possible that Microsoft could have used the existing windows-based UI with a Metro layer instead of the Start Menu, somewhat like Apple does with Launchpad. But no, it has Metro with a windows layer, which in all likelihood will disappear with time as it manages to migrate users and developers onto Metro alone. The problem with that is it's not the way we use desktops. When I am developing software, designing a new user interface, surfing the web or writing this article, I have many apps open all at the same time in their separate windows, allowing me to transition between one and the other quickly and easily, viewing multiple windows at a time, including the desktop if needed. All of a sudden Microsoft is saying, ""You know that 30 years of computing experience you have where you've learnt to work efficiently and effectively using the windows interface we have spoon fed you from the beginning of the personal computer? Yeah, those windows thingies. Well, forget it -- we've got rid of them for something we think is more stylish and useful to someone using a touchscreen! Even though we know you use Windows primarily on a desktop!"" So, Windows has been undermined by its lack of windows! Microsoft's fascination with the post-pc revolution, the tablet market and possibly its arch-rival Apple has resulted in it developing an operating system that is too simplified to be effective as an OS for desktop computers and too complicated really to beat off Android or iOS for the tablet computer either. It's such a shame really, as I would have loved to see how Microsoft could take Windows to the next level for desktop computing after Windows 7. Instead it seems Windows 7 is going to be the Microsoft operating system of choice for quite a while. In much the same way as people are ready to throw the baby out with the bath water when it comes to print in the 'new digital age', Microsoft is willing to throw away something which is proven to work in order to embrace a new 'post-pc era'. The value of print in the office and windows on the pc is still fundamentally important until a new technological substitute comes along as a worthy replacement. Certainly at the moment there is no worthy replacement of print and the same goes for windows. "	Opinion/Argumentation	News
33426	"In fact the counties with the highest percentage of income from federal programs are for the most part rural, white and concentrated in the southwest, south and Appalachia -- where people tend to vote for ""anti-big government"" Republicans. What's going on? There has been a small library of books devoted to wrestling with this question. Republicans have in recent decades successfully used social ""wedge"" issues -- gun control, abortion, culturally ""elitist"" liberals, etc. -- to win support from socially-conservative lower-income white voters. (Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum -- now leading Mitt Romney in the polls -- may have gone a bridge too far on this with his comments on contraception and prenatal screening . The guy does say what he thinks.) But there is perhaps a less-recognized reason. As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman writes : Cornell University's Suzanne Mettler points out that many beneficiaries of government programs seem confused about their own place in the system. She tells us that 44 percent of Social Security recipients, 43 percent of those receiving unemployment benefits, and 40 percent of those on Medicare say that they ""have not used a government program."" Presumably, then, voters imagine that pledges to slash government spending mean cutting programs for the idle poor, not things they themselves count on. And this is a confusion politicians deliberately encourage. For example, when Mr. Romney responded to the new Obama budget, he condemned Mr. Obama for not taking on entitlement spending -- and, in the very next breath, attacked him for cutting Medicare. The truth, of course, is that the vast bulk of entitlement spending goes to the elderly, the disabled, and working families, so any significant cuts would have to fall largely on people who believe that they don't use any government program.

27641	"Nothing about the neat stacks of books and rows of chairs at the powerHouse Arena in DUMBO suggested it had been in three feet of water until recently. Yet the bookstore and event venue was still in the midst of a dramatic recovery from superstorm Sandy when an enthusiastic crowd gathered on Monday's night for the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35 program, held just two days before the National Book Award is presented in lower Manhattan (look for coverage here tomorrow). The atmosphere was festive and lively jazz music was playing as past NBA winners and fellow bibliophiles gathered to recognize the year's 5 Under 35 honorees. Each year, five previous winners and finalists of the National Book Awards select five young writers to receive the award. This year's judges included Tea Obreht, an NBA finalist last year for her novel ""The Tiger's Wife,"" and Edith Perlman, also a finalist last year for her book ""Binocular Vision."" And it was a night of celebration in more ways tha one: powerHouse CEO Daniel Power highlighted the venue's resilience in the face of Sandy's rampage and his commitment to bring great books to the community no matter the challenges. Musician Neko Case, the master of ceremonies, opened with a talk on the difference books made in her life when she was a child growing up in Washington State. The rural setting of her childhood, where condoms and other trash floated down the nearby river, did not contain much promise for her life. ""When you're a kid you don't know that's not all there is,"" she told the bespectacled crowd gathered before her. ""That's where books come in."" Anya Ulinich, who was an honoree in 2007 for ""Petropolis,"" moderated a panel discussion, with each writer reading a page from his or her novel. (Honoree Hayley Tanner, author of ""Vaclav and Lena,"" was unable to attend due to the birth of her daughter the day before.) Discussing the most difficult thing the writers faced while writing their stories, Claire Vaye Watkins said of the personal nature of her writing, ""People said 'Aren't you afraid someone you know will read this?'"" Her collection of short stories, ""Battleborn,"" was selected by 2011 NBA finalist Julie Otsuka. Watkins went on to explain that she hopes people not only read her work, but also grow to care about her characters. Ulinich broached the topic of sensitivity when one writes about one's family. Justin Torres' autobiographical ""We the Animals"" in particular contains a candid account of the author's family when he was growing up in Brooklyn, drama, fights and all. The book was selected by 1990 NBA finalist Jessica Hagedorn. ""Did you make any compromises in the book?"" Ulinich asked. ""I'm going to sound like the biggest [jerk] in the world if I say no,"" laughed Torres. ""Yes, all over the place."" Lastly, Ulinich asked the panel about their writing process. Jennifer duBois, whose novel ""A Partial History of Lost Causes"" was selected by 2011 NBA finalist Andrew Krivak, replied, ""I write a few tweets on Twitter,"" to the amusement of the audience and the agreement of her fellow scribes. The night was full of laughs and tears, jokes and jazz, and most of all hope, a touching resolve that no matter what storms may come, those who love books will still gather to share and celebrate their affection for the written word.

40436	I recently moved to the takaka valley a short distnace from the killdevil track. I love that trail just the way it is, fantastic challenging technical singletrack. However my conscience was telling me that my twice weekly rides was probably having the most impact of any user and I owed it to the trail to do my bit, as I said I love it the way it is but there were a couple of areas in the first section where the water runs down the track causing erosion and leaving a rut for mtber's to erode further. So I thought I'd take a shovel up and divert the water and fill in the ruts. So I did that on Sunday and decided to leave the shovel up there for future maintainence, foolishly I left it in plain view of the track naively thinking that someone else might put the tool to good use. So i was gutted to ride up there today to find the shovel gone! 3 days later! I don't want to speculate on what sort of user decided that what I was doing was deprimental to the point of being malicious enough to steal/throw the shovel in the bush, BUT IT REALLY SUCKS! I don't give a rats ass about the shovel but why? Fortunately this event has inspired me to continue making a small effort for the good of all users of the Killdevil hikers and bikers alike so I'll take another tool up there but this time I'll hide it. I've never done any trail building/maintainence before so would appreciate any feedback about what I've done, or what I shouldn't do. Those that have riden KD will know how awesome it is to have this facility open, for those that haven't I fully rate it as some of the best technical riding in the South Island Check it out. To whoever took the shovel I hope karma comes and gets you and fall over on your face on a slippery rut! bikeplay07 wrote: I've never done any trail building/maintainence before so would appreciate any feedback about what I've done, or what I shouldn't do. Good on you for making an effort! Couple of things. 1. It is usually good to get permission from the people who are currently in charge of doing maintenance of the track (DOC I suspect) to assist in maintaining the track. If you talk about making it safer and more enjoyable for users they would hopefully give you permission. It may have been the current caretakers of the track that removed your tool. 2. If you have not had trail building/maintenance experience I would suggest getting some trail building training with people who do a lot of trail building. There might even be some people/clubs around your region who are building. Often if you offer to go help build they will teach you all sorts of techniques and methods while you work. Otherwise get your hands on the trail building bible from IMBA. http://www.imba.com/resources/trail_bui ... tions.html Ground Effect often have copies of this, and I am sure that other copies can be found around New Zealand. Awesome! Another enthusiastic track builder/maintainer in the Top o' the South Twice a week up Kill Devil . Jeez, I did it once and it damn near killed me! Mind you, it was in the middle of Summer and all of my water was gone halfway up If the GB guys haven't nabbed you already, come over & join us @ Kaiteriteri on a Sunday morning. Happy to show you the principles of track-building (per IMBA) and share what we're learning about how to save'n'restore our steep downhill tracks. Now I better nip out there and hide all of the tools I've left scattered along our latest track... Dude, I've had a lot to do with DOC in my life and if I approach them for permission to maintain this trail I bet it will become a paper trail the length of the national downhill course before I get to pick up a shovel...Anyway I doubt DOC has touched KD for a few years, anybody know often? Thanks for the info about the IMBA trail building guide, I'll get myself a copy... I have so little time to ride that I struggle with the concept of dedicating time and energy to a trail i might only ride annually, but I FULLY APPREICATE the efforts that those put it into other trails, but the idea of doing the repairs at KD is because of my impact, and hopefully for others to enjoy. Probably one of those Forest and Bird types who think they own/control every bit of bush in NZ... ... ave you tried looking for shovel. most dickheads will throw them further into the bush. Try to estimate how far the average left wing radical could throw a shovel,(its not far, as they usually only write letters to DoC and Newspaper editors) then walk a circle on that radius. But good on you mate ...your doing a good deed, and some dick has poked nose in. bikeplay07 wrote: Anyway I doubt DOC has touched KD for a few years, anybody know often?

Yep waingaro forks hut is primo, its great to see the hut maintain its heritage feel. Since posting I've heard that DOC go up there annually with the scrub bar, but never touch dirt. how eroded does it have to become... if i requested permission i would have to get a concession. Don't get me wrong DOC do a great job with my the meager income they get from my taxes . I'm taking another shovel up there tomorrow... Yep I have done the Kildevil quite regularly over the last few years and have never seen any maintenance on the track itself but then it has been there for over a hundered years.the good thing about the Kildevil is that it is so well built that it never really needs maintenance it is just as good everytime I have done it and long may it last. Everytime i ride it i nail something that i didnt the time before ...

25978	"Matthew Caws of Nada Surf Published on September 18th, 2012 Music lovers the world over will know Nada Surf for their incredible 90?s breakthrough hit 'Popular', but after nearly two decades in the game these legendary New York rockers have proven they're much more than one hit wonders. Now the trio -- along with rock vet Doug Gillard -- have finally returned to Australian shores to celebrate not only the recent release of their seventh full-length record 'The Stars Are Indifferent To Astronomy', but also their entire back catalogue for the first time ever, and luckily Moshcam will be filming their show at the Annandale Hotel this Thursday . We caught up with frontman Matthew Caws to find out more about the tour, their kick-ass new album and whether Aussie fans can expect to hear 'Popular' during their Down Under tour dates. How is the tour going? It's been good! We are just finishing a little break right now, there has been a lot of touring this year. Everyone [in the band] is spread around -- Daniel [Lorca] is in Spain, Ira [Elliot] is in New York and I'm in England. I've been spending time with my friends, making music and going to see it. It's part of relaxing, It's how I got into this business [laughs]. Nada Surf will be in Australia soon, is the band looking forward to it? Absolutely! It's been a very long time, eight or ten years since we were last there I think.. Yeah, what's with that? I don't know! I guess it's kind of pricey to go there. But I'm not too sure what the reason was, we're just psyched to be coming back! And the fans here are psyched to get to see you perform too. Yeah! There is a difference in playing to fans in places where you hardly ever visit, that would be Australia for us, and Ireland for some reason. So, we feel a different kind of excitement about those places, and maybe part of it is 'we better not mess up because we hardly ever go there' [laughs]. Nada Surf has been going for quite a while now, what do you think is the key to the band's longevity? Well...we're friends, Daniel and I were friends before we were in the band. Also, it comes down to audiences in a way because early on we had some typical record company up-and-down experiences. For one, we had a war of attrition to get our second record back so we could release it ourselves, coupled with having a first single that did really well but didn't really represent the band. But even though that stuff happened early on, it's been fun to play. Honestly. Even during those times it always felt really good and the audience has made it seem like nothing was ever really wrong! There have been a lot of changes in the music industry over the past few years, and a lot of it has to do with technology. Is it more daunting to put out a record nowadays? Well the potential for how it is going to sell has dropped enormously. On the other hand, it's more daunting in the sense that many more people put out records but it's much easier to let your fans know that something has been released. Before, if you didn't get your record into a store, the people following you would never know it had been released. That's certainly not the case anymore. You can be much closer to your audience. So I think for music, all this new technology is great, but when I think about what having all this information at our fingertips is doing to our brains...that's kind of made things a little scary. Watch the video for 'Popular' below How much pressure does the band feel to write another 'Popular'? Well, not really. There is always pressure to have a hit because it does such great things for you. Of course, there was, but that song was such a fluke. I made up most of the words on the spot; I was sort of inspired by a book I was reading from. It was such a weird set up -- I mean, it's a talking song! But I try to write a hit every single time I write a song; it's just not always based on reality [laughs] it's based on 'well, if I lived on another planet and radio was like this, id play this song'. Does the band ever get sick of playing it live? No we're not sick of it at all! We don't play it every night because there are some other songs that we are much more likely to play every night. But I still think it's hilarious and I'm quite proud of it! The new album is called 'The Stars Are Indifferent To Astronomy', where did the title come from? It's a saying my father used to say to his students to make a point about man's relative insignificance. I think it's an interesting point in these times, there are people trying to deny that climate change exists, and climate change is going to do what it's going to do. Those people don't believe that it's real are not going to be saved by their disbelief. I think we are largely out of touch with nature these days, unfortunately. Nature is clearly important to you, and there is a lot of outdoor imagery on the new album. Is that the reason behind it? Yeah, but there is also a close to home reason for writing about nature. I wanted to try to stop writing about myself as much. One after listening to 'The Weight Is A Gift' and then 'Lucky', a bunch of times I had this moment where I thought 'I only have two songs, I just keep writing them again and again!' [laughs]. So I made an effort this time to take that out of the picture if possible, so that's why nature in particular features heavily on it. But there is lyrics like ""this new peace/ I can feel it now"" so there is still your own personal touch on this album... Oh yeah! It's only a matter of degrees, its only changed about five per cent. It's what comes naturally. But I think I've opened the windows a little bit! In 'Looking Through' the lyrics read ""one more year/ of someone trying to figure it all out"".  Is that another personal message, is the band still trying to figure things out? It is personal, but it's more just myself. The band is quite healthy; if we sang about the band it would be the most boring thing ever! [Laughs] Watch the video for 'Waiting For Something' below You made most of your records outside of New York, what made you set up shop in Daniel Lorca's [bassist] loft for this one? We had been going out-of-town for years to avoid distractions, but we found that what we sounded like in band practice didn't sound like we did on or records, and part of it was getting the record ready in one city and going to another to record it kind of... costs you something. You lose some muscle memory. So this time we practiced in his place and then set a drum track to it in the nearest studio. We rolled our amplifiers literally three blocks down the street and tracked it. We didn't have to check in and relearn our arrangements, it came out naturally. We hear the place is referred to as 'The Sitcom'... Yeah! It's called that because I used to live there a while ago, then Ira used to live there with Daniel. And I guess they used to have some pretty legendary parties. Daniel is just a great host and cook, so it starts off with just ten people and then it becomes forty people... yeah he just likes entertaining [laughs]. So can fans in Australia expect a mix of old and new songs when you play here? Yeah, we will probably play slightly more new ones than old ones. But we will make an effort to go back enough to make fans happy. We are a quartet now because we have Doug Gillard now, we were a trio last time we were Down Under. It's a real kick because we sound so much fuller, the band feels so good right now. We're really stoked about getting back there. So will 'Popular' be on the set lists? Probably! We'll see! Nada Surf's brand new album The Stars Are Indifferent To Astronomy and back catalogue available now through Stop Start/EMI "	Other	News
46498	"Projects to reduce carbon emissions and create sustainable communities may seem ambitious for small community organisations. But community groups across the UK are proving that they can make a contribution to sustainable development when they get support. With the transition movement providing inspiration and funds, promoting sustainability and environmental initiatives have become a realistic prospect for small organisations. And a project carried out by the University of St Andrews ffound that local authorities' resources and expertise can help communities deliver their ambitions. The project, led by Rehema White, a lecturer in sustainable development, looked at the barriers preventing communities and councils from working together on sustainability. It also tried to bring both parties together. ""Community groups often perceive local authorities as an obstacle to engagement in green activities"", says White. ""But in reality, community groups and local authorities share many common goals. This project aimed to design a strategy for them to work together more effectively."" Participants in the project included North Howe Transition Toun (NHTT) , which at the time was developing plans for a cycle route linking remote communities with nearby transport hubs. Members of the group attended seminars organised by the university which introduced them to Fife council and other local stakeholders. Delegates were encouraged to meet, talk and establish mutually beneficial contacts. White says that staff from the council saw what community groups were doing, including NHTT's plans for the cycle routes, while community members discovered previously unknown council initiatives and areas of expertise. Few people in the community groups realised for example that Fife, with private partners, already collects methane gas from landfill to heat local housing, while the council was not aware that NHTT had received non-council funding to appoint and train local 'energy champions'. Crispin Hayes, director of NHTT, says the seminars were useful in taking the cycle routes project forward. ""There were several people at the council who wanted to move forward on these things. There was a fair bit of negotiation with landowners, some of whom were very intransigent. The council's help with that has been very useful."" Hayes says that the fact that the council had a maintenance budget was helpful because NHTT only had access to capital funding at the time. ""What enabled this project to happen was for the council to take charge of the maintenance in the long term."" Another example of a successful partnership between a council and the community is in north London where a tiny organisation in Muswell Hill teamed up with Haringey council on a 250,000 carbon reduction project. The council worked with Muswell Hill sustainability group (MHSG) on the bid to the mayor of London's low carbon zone fund. The bid built upon the vision of local people to make Muswell Hill a sustainable community and the broader ambition of the council to achieve a 40% CO2 reduction across the whole borough by 2020. The low carbon zone project, which covered more than 800 homes, was used by the council as a pilot to test how best to engage communities on this agenda. The project originated from the community, who had approached the council with the idea of bidding for the funding. A steering group was set up once the fund was awarded to oversee the project, coordinated by a council officer and made up of members of the Muswell Hill sustainability group, the social enterprise EN10ergy, resident and community volunteer representatives and traders' associations. By the end of the project, 650 doorstep conversations were held and 450 households went on to have a free home energy audit and installed a number of energy saving measures such as light bulbs and chimney balloons. Another 200 residents went on to install larger measures ranging from draught proofing, loft and cavity wall insulation and replacement boilers. Community owned solar panels were installed on the roof of the local Marks and Spencer store and on a local church. The feed-in tariff money received from the panels and sale of shares to local people provided an on-going source of finance for sustainability initiatives, including low cost loans for carbon reduction measures. Peter Thompson, a member of MHSG, says the council played a key role in working with the business community, providing meeting space and launching the low carbon loans. However, he says that it is important for community organisations to retain control in the areas of publicity and communications, rather than allowing the council to puts its stamp upon promotional material. Thompson says he was impressed with the calibre of the council employees he worked with. ""Where we were disappointed is that everything needed, like loan, had to go to legal, finance and it just takes so long."" Thompson's frustrations, seemingly common complaints about large public sector organisations, are shared by Crispin Hayes. But he says that these problems can be reduced by finding the right people in the council. NHTT did this through the University of St Andrews seminars and by following their own leads. ""The key thing with working with the local authority is identifying a person that will get on and champion your project. They have resources and abilities that complement your group's."" Thompson says that the low carbon zone project has taken his organisation from being a little group ""making nettle soup"" to delivering a big budget project. He advises other groups that it is essential to have a partnership with the council on a project of this scale. ""They can do things that you as a little group can't."" "	News	News

24052	"The much discussed decision of the English Court of Appeal in Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England [2003] EWCA Civ 474 led to a risk that not all employees of a company or organisation will be considered part of the ""client"" for the purposes of legal advice privilege. There is however little subsequent guidance in the English case law as to whether, and if so when, such a narrow interpretation of ""client"" might be applied in other cases. It is therefore noteworthy that the Hong Kong Court of First Instance has applied the decision to restrict the ""client"", on the facts of the case before it, to the group legal department (comprising two in-house lawyers) and the Board of Directors of the relevant organisation: CITIC Pacific Limited v Secretary for Justice and anor (unrep, 19/12/2011, HCMP767/2010). Background In Three Rivers the court took a restrictive view of who from within a client organisation constitutes the ""client"" for the purposes of assessing the application of legal advice privilege, which protects from disclosure lawyer/client communications for the purposes of giving or obtaining legal advice. The court held that, on the rather peculiar facts of that case, the ""client"" did not encompass all employees of the Bank of England but was limited to a particular group of three individuals (the Bingham Inquiry Unit) who were given specific responsibility for coordinating communications with the Bank's external lawyers. So far as we are aware, however, there has been no subsequent case in which the English court has taken such a narrow view of the ""client"" for the purposes of privilege. Further, the Court of Appeal's decision was given less than an enthusiastic reception by the House of Lords in a later judgment on a different point in the Three Rivers case  (see [2004] UKHL 48 ); although their Lordships declined to express an opinion on the issue, as it did not arise for consideration in the appeal, Lord Carswell stated that he was ""not to be taken to have approved of the decision"" and reserved his position on its correctness. There had therefore been some speculation that the Court of Appeal's decision on the ""client"" point might be limited to its own particular facts. Judgment In CITIC , the Hong Kong court took the view that the group legal department was the ""client"" of the external legal advisers on the basis that it ""comprised the persons, or was the entity, delegated, either expressly or by implication, to instruct/communicate with the plaintiff's legal advisers"". The remaining employees of CITIC therefore fell to be regarded as ""third parties"" for the purposes of privilege, so that communications with or by such employees would not be privileged, even if intended for submission to the legal advisers and/or prepared at the request of the plaintiff or the legal advisers. The court accepted, however, that members of the Board of Directors of CITIC were not to be regarded as ""third parties"" for these purposes, as it was clear that the group legal department acted under the direction of the Board. Appeal pending We understand that the court's decision has been appealed, and that judgment on the appeal is awaited. Although this decision is not binding before the English courts (and nor will any decision of the appeal court),  it will nonetheless be of concern to commercial clients in perpetuating the uncertainty caused by the Three Rivers decision for commercial organisations which can only act through their employees and, potentially, increasing the risk that a restrictive view of the ""client"" will be applied in future cases.

14559	Despite the growing importance of young, entrepreneurial ventures in modern economic systems, many such ventures fail quite early in their lifecycles. While both evolutionary theory and organizational learning theory yield important insights for the literature on young venture survival, questions remain as to why ventures facing similar environments experience differential rates of survival. In response, I propose a theory of entrepreneurial agency – defined as the emergence and/or transformation of firms, markets, industries governed by the evolving interaction of temporally situated, intentional strategic action with a malleable external environment – to complement prevailing viewpoints on the causes of young venture survival. My central thesis in this chapter is that to develop more comprehensive explanations of differential survival rates, a theory of entrepreneurial agency – illuminating the transformative potential of entrepreneurial action – is necessary to complement evolutionary perspectives in the literature on firm survival. With this objective in mind, I construct a theoretical model linking diverse perspectives on the duality of human agency and theories of environmental selection, and offer several theoretical and empirical suggestions to guide future research.

Thanksgiving Edition Okay, so obviously... if you are regular follower of our blog, you shouldn't be surprised that a Turkey won't be a part of our table this or any year. We do do the standard Tofurky roast , but we're not fans of their stuffing or gravy. I do have two standard stuffings/dressings that I usually make. One is a Roasted Chestnut Stuffing (that I love, but isn't a fave of the rest of the family) and an Apple Pecan Stuffing, which I'll be making for this years feast. I adore a good mushroom gravy and that will be a part of our table again this year, as well. A potato dish is usually a given, and something with yams, as that is a favorite of my Mums. This year we are going with an apple pie and pumpkin cookies (instead of the ritual pumpkin pie). 4 comments: I'm still trying to figure that out. A few years ago I made Tacos and haven't lived it down since, but everybody liked them. lol Those pumpkin chocolate chip cookies look really good so I am going to try your recipe. The pictures aren't mine (didn't have any of mine, but I'll take some this year and share), but the recipe's are. LOL! And everyone absolutely raves about the pumpkin cookies, so I definitely recommend them for your table (or any ole' time). :) Hmmm.... taco's for Thanksgiving?! Actually, I may try that next year.

21246	"Autumn / Fall around the house .... and church To be honest, here in Ireland there is now a whole lot of seasonal decorating beyond Christmas . I am probably the exception to the rule, as I have embraced Valentines Decor, Spring/Easter Decor , Beach/summer decor and of course Fall/Autumn decor. Consequently, available and affordable seasonal products (beyond Christmas) are not readily available in local shops, if you are going beyond Halloween fake spiders and cobwebs. This year I wanted to add a new item of autumn home decor, and found this twiggy pumpkin on ebay. So, to date,here it the total sum of my autumn decor so far ....... ta da.......! and another view ..... of it sitting on our hearth. In the coming weeks I will no doubt add a bowl of autumnal crispy leaves, pine cones and conkers. However, our church ( Seymour Street Methodist, Lisburn )  has a traditional Harvest Service and Harvest Supper at this time of the year, and the church is beautifully decorated This post then seems the perfect opportunity to share the creative talents of my friend, Heather, and her talented team. The overall theme of the displays was thankfulness for God's creation and being good stewards of what we have been given. Each window had it's own mini display, with an appropriate verse, and often some thought provoking statistic about how we waste the earth's resources. Join me on a tour of Seymour Street Methodist, Lisburn. This was the dairy themed window The display included a traditional hand-churn, which some of the older ladies told me they used to make butter and cream many years ago. There was one window display which included a knitted tea cosy, and a dainty cake stand. There was a more contemporary display of breads and grain, with ""WASTE"" spelled out in toast! The combination of the natural beauty and colours, and the old stain glass windows and pews make a beautiful contrast. In case you are wondering - these photos were taken about an hour before the morning service. An hour later the church was packed, with extra seats needed in the aisles. I will leave you with the display at the front of the church, and our Harvest banner In case you are wondering about the what happens to all the fruit, vegetables, flowers and other produce, after the Harvest celebration they are distributed to the elderly, sick and families in need in our local community. Do you decorate your home, or church, at this time of year? I would love to know, so please share in the comments below. 2 comments: I think that pumpkin is sweet - there are some fantastic displays at the farms in our area, I've not even had time to photograph them this year, and as my husband who does not ""get it"" - he reminds me I've photographed the same scenes every year for the past five to ten... but to me my interest is renewed each year and I find myself wanting to ""hold on to it"" all the more via photos.

45201	Age of Reason, Part First, Section 1 IT has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion. I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject, and from that consideration, had reserved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow-citizens of all nations, and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it, could not admit of a question, even by those who might disapprove the work. The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true. As several of my colleagues and others of my fellow-citizens of France have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith, I also will make mine; and I do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself. I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy. But, lest it should be supposed that I believe in many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe. It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to qualify himself for that trade, he begins with a perjury. Can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this? Soon after I had published the pamphlet Common Sense, in America, I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The adulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties, every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first principles of religion, that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world; but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would follow. Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more. Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God, communicated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Moses; the Christians their Jesus Christ, their apostles and saints; and the Turks their Mahomet, as if the way to God was not open to every man alike. Each of those churches show certain books, which they call revelation, or the word of God. The Jews say, that their word of God was given by God to Moses, face to face; the Christians say, that their word of God came by divine inspiration: and the Turks say, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from Heaven. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all. As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the subject, offer some other observations on the word revelation. Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated immediately from God to man. No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication, if he pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells it to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it. It is a contradiction in terms and ideas, to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second-hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication ? after this, it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner; for it was not a revelation made to me, and I have only his word for it that it was made to him. When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hands of God, they were not obliged to believe him, because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so; and I have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so. The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them; they contain some good moral precepts, such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver, or a legislator, could produce himself, without having recourse to supernatural intervention.

24938	"Saturday, November 03, 2012 Every time I check my blog, I am shocked that so much time has passed since my last post.  I spend so much time Pinning, Instagramming and Tweeting that I forget the reason I started all of those social media accounts: this silly old blog!  And even beyond that, I forget the whole reason I started this blog: I love writing, I love to capture memories in words and pictures, and I love feeling like I have a place that is purely my voice. So, what do I feel like saying? I got accepted into Chico State, and I will finally be attending there in January.  I am so excited, and truthfully, very nervous.  I'm ready and excited to be taking upper division art classes, but I am also anxious about having to produce so much art. I have been painting and drawing a lot more than I did over the summer, and I'm trying to get back in the groove and keep my skills sharp. I'm taking my last math class ever (statistics), two art history classes and step aerobics, and because it is the middle of the semester, I'm feeling overwhelmed.  That's just the way it goes as a college student.  There are times where you have little to do and it feels so easy, and then suddenly everything is due or there are a million tests to study for.  I am so thankful for the opportunity to go to school (like really, really thankful) but I will be so ready to be done in two years or so. Sometimes I feel crazy for doing this to myself and my family.  And sometimes I feel like it would be crazy not to.  I think of the picture I'll have of me, in my cap and gown, with Mark, and Maggie and Liam surrounding me, and all it symbolizes, and dammit, I want that picture.  I want my kids to remember how hard I worked, and that I expect them to work just as hard.  I know it will be worth it.  And I just keep saying that to myself, over and over. Friday, October 12, 2012 Halloween is coming up quickly, and I have had a lot of fun celebrating the season in different ways. One way? Making over one of our family portraits into a Monster family portrait! Let's just say that I absolutely love it!  I plan to print it out, frame it and bring it out every October! This year, I am going to add some text and use it as a digital greeting card on Facebook and such. I started with the original photograph, taken by Amy Brown of Amy Brown Photography , at my thirtieth birthday party in June.  Then, I went to my favorite free photo editing site, Pic Monkey .  I use Photoshop and Lightroom occasionally, but, to be honest, I have moved to using Pic Monkey for most of my photo editing.  I also use Pic Monkey to make all of my banners and buttons for my blog, as well as making signs or subway art. Right now, Pic Monkey has a completely new, and absolutely beautiful, set of editing tools geared towards Halloween.  They have options for vampires, ghosts, zombies, etc., as well as textures and images to add.  I spent about an hour and a half messing around and trying out everything and in the end, I ended up with this! How did the kids feel when they saw this picture?  Well...there were mixed reviews.  Liam absolutely loved all of it, but Maggie was disturbed by Mark's zombie-ness and she said,"" I'm a....goat.""  I had to correct her and say,"" No, you're an awesome monster girl with horns and super powers!"" and then she was on board. So, try it!  If you any questions, or maybe even want me to monsterize a  photo of yours, let me know. Have fun! Wednesday, October 10, 2012 I recently came up with this simple recipe when I was craving peanut butter and chocolate. These peanut butter brownies are incredibly easy and are pretty enough to serve at any party.  Here's how to make these yummy, easy treats! Well, my version is the busy version and I started with a boxed brownie mix.  I made the brownies according to the directions and put them in an 11 x 7 inch pan, which made them thin, but not too thin. Next, I placed about 1/2 a cup of peanut in a microwave safe bowl and softened it by heating it on high for approximately 15 seconds.  I have also skipped the microwave part, and it still worked fine, but the peanut butter was harder to squeeze out of the bag.  Which brings me to the next step: Put the peanut butter in a ziploc and cut off a small portion of one of the lower corners.  Work the peanut down into the that corner.  Now you are ready to introduce peanut butter to brownie. Squeeze out four to five horizontal lines of peanut butter. If you have extra leftover, like I did, just go back and add it to the lines. Now, comes the trick to make these brownies pretty. Drag a butter knife from top to bottom, going through all the lines. Move across the pan, dragging your knife vertically through the lines and (this is important!) alternating whether you start at the bottom or top of the pan.  I keep a paper towel handy to wipe my knife after every pass, it makes it easier to do and is a little cleaner looking. When you're all finished, the brownies will look like this.  They are a little messier than after they have cooked, as the peanut butter flattens out.  The good thing is that you don't lose the pattern as they cook, as the peanut butter doesn't spread very much.  Bake them according to your normal brownie recipe, mine took about 30 minutes to cook. Here's the beautiful finished product.  And trust me, they are even yummier than they look. This is such an easy way to upgrade boxed brownies, and everyone who has tried them loved them!

43596	"Share Article You can't get rid of this beauty problem but Zoe can help you hide it. Zoe, how do I get rid of my big pores? No matter what I do, they seem to look huge after a few hours after applying my makeup! Karen Karen, first, let me reveal a terrible truth: you cannot get rid of your big pores, or change their size. What you CAN do, though, is ride bikes and eat ice cream, so it all evens out. Sorry, that was a truly pore response. I can do better. (Zzzzing!) Karen, while you can't change your pore size (it's genetic) or stop them producing more oil than necessary, or creating pimples or blackheads, you can certainly minimise their appearance and sheen, by using a skilful artillery of pore-minimising products, designed by clever people who understand that while bigger, oilier pores generally mean your skin will age slower and wrinkle less (WIN!), it's frustrating having them glaring out from your skin every day (um, lose...) Skin care: -       Cleanse. Properly. The key to keeping pores in check is making sure they're clean. The dirtier they are, the more visible they are. Use something gentle, so as to thoroughly clean but not to overstimulate -       Exfoliate at least 2-3 times a week. Too much can aggravate the pores and make them produce more oil. Cute ! Something with light amounts of AHAs or salicylic acid is good, (although can be drying -- see what suits your skin best), or a gentle cleanser/scrub combo might be the way to go. Olay's Deep Cleansing Pore Minimising Cle anser and Scrub at night is a good option. -       After cleansing, TONE. Definitely tone. So important. This ""closes"" the pore and tightens it without drying it out (and if it is drying it out, switch products). Lancme Pure Focus is popular, as is Biore's Triple Action Toner. -       Use a serum that is tailored to the business of pores (remember: always choose a serum that targets whatever your biggest and most pressing skin concern is... or you can layer a couple) -- Clinique does a great one in their Pore Refining range -       Masks that draw out impurities (things like sunscreen, makeup and grime can clog pores and make them more visible) should be a weekly routine -- something like the St Ives Mineral Clay Mask or the much lauded SkinCeuticals Clarifying Clay Mask is perfect. Clay is the way, in other words . Clay is the way. -       Use a foundation that is mattifying (or even pore-minimising, as some are touted.) Something that will adequately conceal the appearance of larger pores and keep oil under control is best. Revlon Colorstay and Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse are great, and the bareminerals matte powder is ideal to finish/set with. -       Keep blotting papers on hand (or a powder compact of mineral powder, something lightweight like) to touch up throughout the day. I know that sounds like a lot of work, Karen, but that's only because it is. If it's too daunting, then at least do the exfoliating, the toning and use the primer. ....I now open the floor to anyone with similar skin who has some great solutions!

It's the only thing that works really. Either strong ones on prescription or over the counter creams like Eau Thermal Avene's Ystheal + that actually have enough active ingredient to work. Ok, had those vertical lines between the brows done 48hrs ago for the first time. Result = gone! Ah-mazing!! Still enough mobility to look natural, but lines disappeared. I'm sold. FYI -- I'm 40 with pretty good skin and lines that were treated where light -- moderate in severity. I had massive horrible pimples around my chin when I went for an eyebrow wax on Wednesday. I bought two Ella Bache products -- an exfoliant and a deep cleanser -- and the next day my pimples were way way less angry and red and very reduced and much more able to be covered up with make up. It was really noticeably better, and knowing my pimple timeline they weren't ready to reduce without assistance. Also love Ella Bache Great Tan, got a number of compliments yesterday with my tan. I am a big fan of Ella Bache! I also suffer from dark under eye circles, and after reading this article I use both of these products -- amazing. my last YSL Touche Eclat pen last 18 months, so while it may seem a big investment, it is well worth it! I was flicking thru The new issue of Cosmetic Surgery Australia and there is a new laser treatment called Spectra. It had before and after pictures of a nose full of blackheads and large pores ,the after picture after 3 treatments flawless. This is not an advertisement just an observation. I was amazed I have had horrendous enlarged pores for the past five years...I have had two sessions of Variable Pulsed Light treatment from my beauty therapist for sun damage/broken veins on my face and the huuuuuuge additional benefit has been that it is eliminating the massive open pores-result!!! My skin also feels a little bit more toned and less saggy in the areas that I've had done. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone with large 'open' pores...now I can apply foundation without it all gathering in my pores and I love it. If you had large pores you would notice because they are noticeable when large. For me it was an age thing. I never noticed my pores until recently (I'm 35) and they are definitely larger in some places than others. Hope that helps I had big pores ever since the onset of puberty! Nothing seemed to reduce them. Now I am 47 and heading towards menopause and they've disappeared. I now have blemish free, poreless skin for the first time ever! Alas I also have the wrinkles that come with age and skin that is less elastic than it was in the days of large pores. Oh well, guess you can't have it all! My pores are heaps smaller by doing the following: clean my face with water in the shower, rubbing 4 drops of Rosehip oil into my skin after shower, then finishing with a liberal dose of moisturiser. I was adding a wipe with toner inbetween wash and rosehip, but it made me break out, so I've dropped that step altogether. I have oily/combination skin and was under the assumption that the rosehip oil and moisturiser combo would exacerbate the problem, but it's been amazing. I've seen a massive improvement in my enlarged pores, but I'm guessing from reading all the posts that what works for one person doesn't necessarily for the rest. My pores fall on the larger side, and I have found the number one, cheapest and most effective way to minimize them is to be hydrated from the inside out. If I've had too many coffees and not enough water it is dotted all over my face There's a reason all those famous beautiful people swear by 8 glasses of water a day, it can't make me look like them but it can help me look my best. I find oil cleansing the best thing for enlarged pores. It cleans them out more effectively, making them appear less visible. Some sort of chemical exfoliant is good too. I tend to avoid scrubs because I'm so prone to redness and rosacea. I actually find the rosacea treatment I use (Finacea from the chemist) is good for pores because of the Azelaic acid in it. That or Glycolic acid is great for clearing the pores. It won't change the size but it makes them look less like moon craters. Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch primer is excellent under foundation for a smooth base but I find it breaks me out a little with regular use. I save it for special occasions. A good powder can actually hide pores a bit. I notice my Kanebo Sensai Loose Translucent powder is excellent for diffusing minor flaws. I have a question completely off topic. I have pretty bad fore head lines. I have tried all different products to help. I am not really comfortable with botox and have heard of some kind of laser you can get. Does this work? Don't be scared of the Botox, it's honestly the best thing for forehead lines. I would advise you to have a couple of peels and maybe some IPL for collagen boosting before having a few Botox injections. Problem solved. I have oily skin and enlarged pores and my ENTIRE WORLD changed a few weeks ago when my sister introducted me to Benefit's POREfessional. It's like spack filler for your face....yet light as a feather, soft as silk and doesn't clog the aforementioned crater sized pores. Beyond amazing. Get out amongst it people! I use the Napoleon Pore Minimiser & Mattifyer. (sp???). I bought it the first time for my wedding in 2006, and have used it ever since for when I know I'll be out all day and dont want to look like I've fallen in the deep-fat fryer. Not cheap, but works well for my oily skin. Ha! Love the deep-fat-fryer call! I recently went on a long haul flight to NYC and holy hell, you should have seen me by the time I arrived. Like an oil slick had morphed into the place my head should have been. NIGHTMARE. I read online a few years ago about using 'milk of magnesia' as a primer....after some quicking searching on the ol' googly-web i discovered that the ausiie equivalent is Mylanta. Yep....that white stuff that people use to stop the burpies and burnies in their chests. Being the scpetic that i am i had a friend who works at the World Health Organisation run the ingredients to see if any were dangerous and it all checked out fine so i gave it a whurl.....used it as a primer for 2 weeks. HOLY MOLY i was amazed. pores? refined. oil? controlled. make up? STAYED IN PLACE ALL DAY. It's a little drying for my skin so i only use it for special occassion or 'all day' make up required days. it's $5, it's available everywhere and it will change your world.....or at least...your pores. I tell anyone and everyone who will listen to me. I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm 26 and always tend to have an oily sheen on my forehead but a dry chin. I had a facial a while back and the beauty therapist said the oil was there because my skin is dehydrated. Anyway I was just wondering if anyone could recommend a good moisturiser/sunscreen combo? When your skin is dehydrated you want something with high amounts of hyaluronic acid in it -- as your skin needs more water, not oil. I highly recommend something like the Medik8 Hydr8 B5 Serum (Skinceuticals do a similar one) which you can purchase from online stores such as adorebeauty.com.au . I have a similar skin type to you -- and find that a serum like that, followed up with a good oil free sunscreen -- my personal fave is the Kit 30+ Face Sunscreen (also has hyaluronic acid in it) -- works really well under makeup (oil free foundation). Hope this helps! I have changed to Jurlique sensitive products -- *no more redness * no more oily oily oily t zone * no more shine during the day * no more blackheads * my skin is so so smooth and make up looks great. Sometimes you just have to be gentle. Like kanga123 I don't exfoliate anymore, I do have the Jurlique daily exfoliating cream but I rarely use it anymore -used to use it one it twice a week when I first switched but now, only when I feel extra dirty, and it's really just a soft mushy oatmeal type cream. I don't use anything harsh anymore -- best thing I ever did was change to Jurlique and go sensitive and gentle. I am almost finished with my laser hair removal (full legs, buttocks -which was fine and blonde but the legs did part of my buttocks so I wanted it even, full Brazilian, peri-anal, full arm, underarm, face -- gets rid of the blonde hair too) -- I sooooo love not shaving ( I now was my hair once a week-all it needs and with no epilation required I get an extra 20 mins sleep in!!), and once that's done I will be investing in a series of gentle laser treatments. The laser tightens, tones, and removes deep and surface pigmentation ( its shown that its pigmentation that's ages us not wrinkles). I think it depends on what problem you are trying to fix -- although I agree with your overall sentiment. I used to use harsh OTC products and my skin was often a bit red, sensitive etc. I switched to Jurlique and whilst it certainly calmed things down, it didnt really fix any problems either. Now I use a basic QV or cetaphil moisturiser/sunscreen in the morning and a retinal/vitamin C combo at night and my skin glows. I'm also having a series of peels done (professionally) to treat me last remaining issue, pigmentation. Once its all done, I think I'll be able to get away with just a tinted moisturiser rather than foundation, because my skin tone will be naturally even! =) Oh and laser hair removal is awesome. I havent shaved my legs in almost a year! Can't speak for anyone else but I'm having my bikini lasered and it is $99 per treatment, and is meant to take between 5-8 treatments to get rid of most of the hair. I'm up to treatment 4 I think and the results are pretty good. There are various specials if you do more than one area/pay up front, etc. airfree which has various salons around has a great special on atm till 4th sept, I just booked 6 brazilian +underarms for $59 each, or you can just try one @ $69 to see if you can handle it and then get the rest at the package price. I apologise in advance since this question is completely off-topic! But does anyone have any recommendations for a mascara for sensitive eyes, preferably from a brand that doesn't test on animals, and won't flake off (it's for a long wedding day). I've heard that 'tubing' mascara is supposed to be good? Thanks in advance, from your hopeless-at-all-things-make-up-anxious-a\\... Have you considered, if it is specifically for a long wedding day, having eyelash extensions or false eyelashes? I'm guessing from your request about sensitive that this may be a no go zone but I get eyelash extensions and I LOVE them. $80 for a full set, $40 for refills every 3 weeks. But no mascara purchase, no eye makeup remover purchase and it looks amaze even when I roll out of bed looking like holy hell. Tubey mascara is wonderful! I have a sample of Clinique's bottom lash mascara (hehe bottom lashes...) and the staying power is wonderful, and it doesn't flake at all. I'm not sure about sensitivity or their animal testing policies though. Tubing mascara is all this dame will use. Normal mascara is such a pain in the arse to remove; I can't go back now. I oscillate between Clinique Lash Power, Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined and MAC Opulash (for more volume.) I use a BB cream as my foundation most days. Do you still recommend a primer underneath? Or will a primer make the BB cream slip off? I have a lovely Becca primer (pore minimizing and mattifying), which I use under foundation when I go out at night. Also, I've managed to get my adult acne well and truly under control with a topical (prescription only) cream, but I still have blackheads (especially on my nose) clogging up my pores. Any suggestions on how I can control/get rid of them. When I squeeze them, I just create a flaky mess on my face, as my skin is so delicate. would a primer not defeat the purpose of the BB cream? BB cream is like a treatment moisturiser + foundation -- the moisturiser/treatment side would need to penetrate the skin, whilst a primer provides a barrier to stop that, and allow the foundation sit evenly on the skin? ersonally, I'd drop the primer, when you're wanting the treatment aspect of the BB cream to work -- maybe use it only when you're specifically applying the BB as a foundation instead? Avon's Mattifying Skin Perfector -- is great if your going with full makeup. For everyday I use Estee Lauder Skin Refining Pore Minimiser under my moisturiser and then just a dusting of powder. (Although I have it on good Authority that the Clinque version is the same and cheaper -- so I'm going with that next time) I have a question. The beauty therapist that did my eye lashes recently said that there is no point using any skin care products sold mainstream because they only have 2% active ingredients, and are bad for your skin. She said that it's only the products that beauty therapists prescribe (which have over 2% active ingredients) that will do anything for your skin. I'm pretty sure she's just trying to sell me expensive products, but does any one know if this is true? She said that the reason you get redness on your face is because your skin gets 'stripped' from bad products, and only oil based cleansers (that are prescribed) will help... I've been told something similar regarding skin care products and I was advised that I should be using stuff like Dermalogica, MD Formulations etc and not the mainstream stuff. I know Zoe is a super busy lady, but if she has time it would be great to know if this info is correct or if the mainstream products are just as good? I think her statement is far too generalised -- but there is some basis of truth in there. Certain ingredients (especially vitamin a and vitamin c) do require certain strengths to actually cause effect on the skin. The easiest way to see whether you're getting your money's worth is to look at the ingredients list -- the top 5 ingredients are what you want to look at and what you want to include the ingredients that you want, if that makes sense? Those 2 ingredients also need to be in a stable enough formula (particularly vit c) or else they don't have an effect on the skin as well. This doesn't necessarily mean that mainstream products are useless -- it's just that the brands with a scientific basis to their formulas generally create more effective products. My advice? Do your research -- google reviews of products, read beauty blogs, look out for what products a beauty editor would actually spend money on herself -- we all know they get sent hundreds of products ALL the time to trial and test -- so knowing what they actually would spend their own money on is oh so valuable! I would also suggest that if you can only splurge on one skincare item -- make it a serum. They're the strongest/most effective skincare products (designed to go deepest into the skin for maximum effect) to deal with pretty much any issue -- so in my humble opinion, they're well worth spending a bit more on. Plus you only need a drop or two -- so they do last you a good few months or more! At nearly 30 and with still very oily skin and t zone breakouts, I made a switch from my supermarket brand stuff to MD Formulations as the suggestion of a beauty therapist. I have since bought more from strawberrynet at a much better price, and will keep doing it. Some places may try to con you into spending more money for the sake of it, but most should happily offer you an alternative in your price range. I now have much clearer skin, only hormonal chin breakouts and am properly hydrating my skin for probably the first time in my life! there's also something to be said for weaker solutions over stronger solutions if you have sensitive skin also -- stronger is NOT always better! and beauty therapists can be known to spout codswallop in the name of a sale / further booking. I had one tell me I must have had a reaction to a product that was cheap, and 'her' product, because it was so 'quality', wouldn't cause a reaction....umm no lady, my skin was sensitive/allergic to a particular ingredient, cheaper or more expensive/quality wouldn't make a difference. Just because they deal with creams and lotions, doesn't make them a scientist I'm a beauty therapist and I can say that, by and large, this is true. The professional brands that I work with contain the highest proportions of active ingredients that have been proven to cause change within the skin. Good skincare should have scientific evidence to back this up (we keep studies on file if clients are interested). Whereas when you look at a cheaper skincare, you can clearly see just by looking at the ingredients list that the active ingredients do not form a high percentage of the product. Unfortunately, the obvious side effect of this is that prescriptive skincare is more expensive than generic. It's just a reality, given the research & development that goes into the ranges. Not to mention the ingredients! Peptides, for example, are INCREDIBLY expensive to engineer and manufacture -- hence why there is hardly any cheaper skincare containing peptides (and if it does, I would bet that they are in such miniscule amounts that they can't create any change). Prescriptive skincare tends to have more sophisticated delivery systems also. Cheaper skincare is usually molecularly too large to penetrate the upper epidermis, let alone to the dermal layer. This doesn't mean that cheaper skincare is ""bad"" for the skin, it just means that it lacks the activity which is required to change or correct particular skin conditions. Prescriptive skincare is just far more active -- that's impossible to dispute. And I have to say that I do take offence to the suggestion that beauty therapists are just trying to spruik expensive products. We will always make suggestions for products that you can work with to achieve your skincare aims -- that is our responsibility. Would you go to a gym where the personal trainer didn't suggest exercises for you to do at home in between gym visits? Thanks for the advice! What you have said makes sense. I like the point that there are only a few ingredients that have been proven effective. Sorry if I have offended you -- I don't think her whole motivation is to sell me stuff but I think it would be a bit naive of me to assume that me handing over hundreds of dollars for those products isn't in her best interest as well. I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, I think I am going to take the advice of researching it for myself so I understand it all properly. I agree with 'Large-pore Sarz.' Benefit's POREfessional is magnificent. I don't use it every day as often I just go with a bit of tinted moisturizer and bronzer, but when I use foundation, I will always pop a smidge of POREfessional on and it mattifies and smooths everything out nicely for a really good base. I recently returned from traveling Europe and whilst in Italy I found heaven in the form of foundation! KIKO Milano have a foundation which is sebum balancing anti shine and it is bloody fantastic! The coverage is amazing and it lasts all day and minimises pores awesomly (along with their Primer) plus it was the equivalent to about $20 AU unbelievable! Sadly I cannot purchase it here, so if anyone out there is traveling around Europe (particularly Italy) look out for this product it is amazing! I went to a presentation by dermatologists and they said that exfoliators CREATE skin irritation and open pores making them larger. They likened it to a mortar and pestle. So they said it's the biggest gimmick in the beauty industry and highest selling product. So they urged everyone in the room to throw them out. And I did. And it's been 3 months and my ""big pores"" on my nose are no longer! Don't worry, I questioned my own skin as well. I even googled images of 'large pores' to see what they meant. From what I can tell, the pores on my nose are somewhat 'big', but they never bothered me before so I'm not going to let them bother me now. "	Instruction	Instruction
774	"At the End of the Day Lyrics [THE POOR] At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor It's a struggle, it's a war And there's nothing that anyone's giving One more day standing about, what is it for? One day less to be living. At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill One day nearer to dying! At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and There's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day! [The foreman and workers, including Fantine, emerge from the factory] [FOREMAN] At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread [WORKER ONE] There are children back at home [WORKERS ONE AND TWO] And the children have got to be fed [WORKER TWO] And you're lucky to be in a job [WOMAN] And in a bed!

[GIRL (Grabbing a letter from Fantine)] And what have we here, little innocent sister? Come on Fantine, let's have all the news! [Reading the letter] Ooh...""Dear Fantine you must send us more money... Your child needs a doctor... There's no time to lose..."" [FANTINE] Give that letter to me It is none of your business With a husband at home And a bit on the side! Is there anyone here Who can swear before God She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide? [They fight over the letter. Valjean (M. Madeleine) rushes on to break up the squabble.] [VALJEAN] Will someone tear these two apart What is this fighting all about? This is a factory, not a circus! Now, come on ladies, settle down I run a business of repute I am the Mayor of this town [To the foreman] I look to you to sort this out And be as patient as you can- [He goes back into the factory] [FOREMAN] Now someone say how this began!

28999	"Thursday, October 25, 2012 The written word A lot of my time lately is spent with The Princess. Not that I mind.  That little chick is hilarious and we like to get our nails done and do girly stuff together.  Having her as my constant companion is a gift in many ways. But the truth is, I miss my guy.  He spends oodles of time with his Dad.  They go to football games, baseball practice, basketball practice . . . everywhere together.  I know that E loves having him as a constant companion, too.  It works. And I also know that the older he gets the less I will see of him. The sad little glimpse into the future, however, is not working for me so much.  With school, work, sports and life I only see my guy for a few hours every week. I know that is more than I can expect even a few years from now but I am missing that sweet face and warm heart of his.  We're going on a date tomorrow night.  I can hardly wait.  And if I didn't think he'd get all weirded out I'd say every single thing on this page to him, but he is a ten year old boy.  I am pretty sure that he would be uncomfortable with my sharing how madly in love with him that I am.  So, as a keepsake, I will use the written word.  I truly hope one day he'll read all of it and know how much he was loved. Every single day. For my son, You have ALWAYS been too good to be true.  You were the happiest, easiest baby in the history of the world.  That is an absolute fact.  Every day of my life since February 19, 2002 I have said Thank you to God for the gift that you are. I have talked before about how it terrifies me that life with you is so good, but of late I have just decided to take everything one day at a time and be genuinely grateful for every day that we have. Life is going really, really fast for us right now.  Daddy and I are awfully busy raising you and your sister and being us, and you are so very busy being ten and living life to the fullest.  I love that part more than you will ever know.  It delights me to see you running off to practice and putting on your belt as you go or holding your sister's backpack while she climbs out of the car just before you turn away and walk into school. The spoiled selfish girl in me wants to tell you to stop and come hug ME and spend time with ME, but I love you too much to ever hold you back.  I love to watch you go and find your way, but I miss you so much. You are SUCH a boy with your smelly socks and your wrinkled shirts that you cram into drawers when I ask you to put them away, but I am told by someone at least once a week how kind and polite you are. Wow .  A few weeks ago the umpire at your baseball game, Mark, came to the fence and said ""who's kid is that?""  That's sort of a weird question, but I claimed you unconditionally.  He said, ""He has really great manners.  He is so polite every time he's at bat.  I've never met a kid that's more polite."" I can forgive the toothpaste on the mirror every time because there are a million reminders in the world that you are doing much better things than cleaning up behind yourself. Sometimes when I am watching you from a distance and catching snippets of your conversations with friends I can imagine you much older and even further out in the world.  I visualize you trekking across a college campus chatting with your buddy on the way to class and just being a slightly larger version of your wonderful self.  I wonder what profession you'll choose.  Your sense of humanity is larger than life and you have a genuine heart for service.  You are super squeamish so I'm not thinking that being a surgeon is in your future, but think maybe physical therapy is or even a career as a high school teacher and coach.  Oh Punky, you would be such a fantastic teacher.  I selfishly want you to make more money than that, but that's just plain shallow.  You would really make a wonderful teacher. You have so many amazing qualities that I could write a giant novel just about you and your goodness.  You're a great student, a talented athlete, a gentle soul and a wonderful Christian.  You do everything well and there are some things you are exceptional at.  Sometimes I get so focused on the doing of all that we do that I forget to stop and enjoy what we do.  I really enjoy being your Mom.  I enjoy talking with you about the Pendragon books and how that call at second base could be different.  I enjoy hearing how much other people appreciate the young man you are becoming.  I enjoy watching you play with your cousins and hearing you talk to your family.  I enjoy you.  I cherish you.  I adore you. Thank you for all of the terrific things you are and the hope of the things that are to come.  It is such an honor to have you for a son. What a beautiful wonderful letter to your son. And yes, it would be so easy to forgive a lot of those little things at home- as when he is out he is doing so much good and being so good. And what an awesome compliment to get from the umpire! Thank you so much for linking up- sorry I was so slow getting to this. My parents have been in town- so been spending time with them. LinkWithin Mr & Mrs Montoya We are each other's second half ~ sometimes better, sometimes not so much. We're always honest and we're always a team. We are just trying to put one foot in front of the other without stepping on anyone's toes. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation

It was, in the literal sense, a den..you know the type that animals crawl into to hibernate for the winter? A real cave...dark chocolate walls, a desk that was one of the first furniture purchases i ever made, an IKEA bookcase that had fallen apart before we even moved into our home 11 years ago. Why, you ask, did you move a broken bookcase to a new home? Good question!!  It was also the room that became home for anything that didn't have another resting place. Anyways, i could go on, but i'll save that for my home reno post... Suffice it to say that is was hard to feel the creative juices flow in my workspace. So, my project has to been to create a room where i can work and feel inspired.. Where i'm surrounded by colour, by ""happy"" trinkets and by things i love. An obvious place to hang your thoughts and ideas on is a cork board. I also knew i wanted it to fit with the vibe of my room. So, when i spied a damaged mirror frame in Homesense, i got pretty excited!! This is such an easy DIY project..all you need is a frame, a can of spray paint and a roll of cork!

9747	"My USA trip is looming and I am in organization mode! I have a 14 hr trip to LA with a 3 hr stop over followed by a 6 hr flight to NYC. What I would love to hear is what things you guys take on board with you whether it be personal/toiletry items or items for entertainment, comfort or other purposes. Thanks. :) Spoochie 17-05-2011, 10:24 PM I have just experienced my first long haul flight. Ear plugs to be worn under the headphones. It's kind of like having noise cancelling headphones. Baby wipes/wet ones and roll on deodorant. I usually shower 2 - 3 times a day and just felt gross when I landed. On our stopover in Dubai I raided the duty free perfume testers! I didn't take anything for entertainment as the in-flight entertainment on Emirates was amazing. Lip balm! If you wear contact lenses consider taking some eye drops as your eyes may dry out quite a bit. Have fun! indi_c 18-05-2011, 07:05 AM Books Magazines Ipod Snacks If you fly any of the major airlines, you will get the TV's so that should keep you occupied for awhile. savvychic 18-05-2011, 08:05 AM It gets so dry on a plane: A refreshing facial spray Face, lip,hand moisturiser And I make sure I have clothes that will be comfy in the climate I land. And defintely wear comfy clothes! Layers are good because I never know if it will be warm or cold on the plane (it changes everytime!), and it helps you suit both the climate you are leaving and the climate you are going to. Also think about footwear - your feet can get quite swollen / uncomfortable in certain shoes, so depending on what shoes I am wearing, I will take comfy socks to wear and take my shoes off. Lipbalm in a tube or stick so I'm not using my finger Hand cream Hand sanitiser A pasmina A smallish book A magazine or two Chewing gum A bottle of water but think that's prohibited on flights to the US An eye mask and ear plugs I will have my iPhone with a relaxing playlist of instrumental music and ocean sounds - I find this works better to block out the noise of the engines. Lavender oil A sudoku book and pencil I don't generally worry too much about entertainment if I'm flying with a major airline as their on-flight entertainment is usually awesome. Pinky Bee 18-05-2011, 10:01 AM If you're flying united you'll need industrial earplugs as their 747s rattle and hum so loud it's difficult to sleep. Also USD as all US carriers don't give you anything when traveling domestic despite being full service airlines apparently. I always take: Earplugs Neck pillow Eye mask Iphone loaded with movies and tv series Change of socks and underwear, nothing worse than sweaty socks and jocks after 14hrs of sitting in a warm cabin Sassafras 18-05-2011, 12:07 PM Oh gosh, what don't I take onboard long haul flights! I hate flying and get really antsy, so I try and keep as occupied and comfortable as possible - Lipbalm - Face moisturiser - Concealer and cream blush (for when I land) - Eye drops, contact lens solution and case - Spectacles - Magazine and a book (so I can swap when I get bored) - iPod - Socks - Chewing gum or mints - A small vial of perfume - Eye mask - Neck pillow - Large shawl - doubles as a stylish scarf and extra blanket as it gets so cold on board - Pantyliners so I feel nice and clean - Face wipes - Pen for completing immigration forms - Snacks like a container of Pringles, Skittles, snakes etc - Macbook / iPad - Hair clip so I can throw my hair up in a high bun on board, and when I get off the plane, I take out the bun and my hair is nice and volumised so I don't look too horrendous. I always wear leggings and a comfortable shirt and cardigan with ballet flats. Slip on/slip off shoes are essential if you're travelling to USA, as you'll need to take them on and off during security checks, and don't wear a belt if you can help it, because they're a pain to put on and take off. OfficeGirl 18-05-2011, 12:29 PM My list is pretty much the same as Sassafras'. I also keep sunglasses handy for when the morning sun comes streaming in thru someone else's window. AgentM99 18-05-2011, 12:35 PM Thanks everybdoy! Sassafras, I am a bit like you but my motto for this trip is travelling light so I am trying to get it down to ""essentials"". Might need some luck with that! :) beverly 18-05-2011, 01:37 PM Less about necessarily onboard essentials, but in addition to what other's have said, I always bring a full extra set of clothes and must have items you need in case your bag gets lost/delayed when you land. For this reason, I will usually bring either a full set of clothes that have elements I can also sleep in, and/or an extra singlet/item that is just for sleeping, as well as an extra set of underwear and any toiletry essentials (in travel size obviously). In terms of other tips for long haul flights, go to seat guru and scope out your flight detail so you can see if your seats have any extras like powerpoints, or plugs for USB/consoles. I almost always travel with a laptop, but particularly in the case of long haul flights, I always check whether I'll have a powerpoint to see if I can charge up any devices I have. Mod-ern Girl 18-05-2011, 03:55 PM I take pretty much what everyone else has said. However if I wanted to travel light my absolute essentials would be: I call these things shoe socks, but they are almost a jiffy kinda thing I picked up in target. they feel like a sock on, but have a VERY thin rubbery sole. If you get these you don't have to keep putting your shoes on to go to the toilet. You don't want to walk into the toilet in socks (think turbulence + tired men = you don't want to know :sick: ). I personally like the sound of the plane engines so I'm never worried about the noise! I transfer into small bottles facial moisturiser and cleanser, small soap, mini toothpaste, deodorant just in case plane is delayed/luggage lost. For the same reason I pack underwear and a singlet/t-shirt. I also pack things that I don't use but that I want to keep safe eg. jewellery, laptop/netbook, iPod My ears become really painful during landing so I don't risk ear plugs. PetitePrincesse 18-05-2011, 04:41 PM i am a fairly light traveller - there's nothing worse than being in transit and lugging your non-wheelie carry on bag around. my rule is if i got stranded, what would i need as an essential? other than what other people have said... mirror stilnox little bag of nuts and dried fruit. i never eat it, but it's nice to the have the option. otel products and the beauty counters are your best friends for long haul trips. i usually take the l'occitaine hotel shampoo and conditioner (they are teency weency bottles, but go a long way), hotel soaps, sample foundation sachets and the teeny hotel colgate tubes. i decant all my beauty products into little clear bottles. i always have a clear plastic make up bag for all my lotions etc - manicare does a great one that comes with clear bottles for around $15. makes life so much easier at security, especially when everyone around you is scrabbling in their bags getting everything out or has their things in nasty plastic freezer bags. i wear my glasses, and lots of layers, leggings and thongs. rimmellover 18-05-2011, 06:17 PM *iPhone + usb charger (many airlines have sockets for you to plug the USB in to) *Pashmina *Travel pillow *Eye drops *Lip balm *Pen *Chewing gum (it can help your ears pop on ascent/descent) *Water bottle (either buy one once past security, or take an empty one and fill up) *Passport etc (obviously) Some people will take a change of clothes (trackies etc) so they can wear nice clothes for the airport at each end. I'm not so much a fan of this, as I have no issues walking through an airport in my trackies, and afteer a 14 hour flight the toilets can be kind of gross to get changed in. I do, however, take a change of clothes in my carry on, just in case my luggage goes missing, so I have a day or so to organise replacements. I also take my makeup and anything I would be devastated to lose/have broken. Make sure you take the chargers for your electric equipment on board with you too. I also have standard handbag contents (tissues, panadol, etc). I don't know if it is your first long haul flight or not, but you will soon get to know what you need, as everyone has different needs (some people HAVE to have socks with them, whereas I can't stand them). My best tip is to have your passport etc in your handbag, then have a carry-on within a carry-on. I had my backpack (so I wouldn't have to deal with two rolly bags), and in the bottom I had the change of clothes etc that I wanted to have with me but wouldn't actually need. On top of that stuff, I had a Woolworths-type bag with the stuff I wanted at my seat. Once I boarded, it was easy to pull the top bag out of my backpack and have at my feet, store my backpack in the overhead lockers, and still not overcrowd my handbag to the point of being non-functional Madam Mina 18-05-2011, 07:45 PM My list is pretty similar to others I think. I have a large soft leather Witchery bag that I use that can either be a big handbag or an overnight bag I think this one of my favourite things I own. List: Pashmina Camera Small laptop iPod Hand sanitiser Moistuiser Cleansing water Wet ones Eye drops Mini toothbrush Mini floss Tiny bottle of mouth wash Concealor Lip balm Valerian (herbal sleeping pills) Deodorant Perfume Book Magazine Change of clothes Pen Panty liners Neurofen Important travel documents Reading glasses Sunglasses Local currency for when I arrive Anything of value that I don't want to lose or really need when I get there like jewelery and medication All chargers and power cords Phone Noise canceling headphones (these are the best things ever) Hand Sanitiser Remember for international flights you will be subject to the liquids and gels regulations (and domestic flights in the US). So anything you want to take on that is a liquid or a gel must be less than 100mls and they all must fit in to a clear plastic sandwich bag. Some airports (I'm looking at you Hong Kong and Bangkok) will even take liquids bought in the airport off you so be careful what you buy duty free. AgentM99 18-05-2011, 07:56 PM I have had a few long hauls flights before but I want to streamline both carry on and checked luggage so rather than chucking stuff in on the day I am trying to be more organised this time. :) geezer 18-05-2011, 08:13 PM Wow some people take a lot...I always get organised at the very last minute and never use half the stuff I take on board. My best tip is to have one larger on board bag with a change of clothes, toiletries, documents etc that you put in the overhead and then a little bag with the things you'll use during the flight which you can put under the seat. That way you don't have to get up to open the overhead and go searching through it. You can stuff the small bag in the bigger carry bag when you get off. ETA, Just realised Rimmellover said pretty much the exact same thing before me. General Pashmina or similar that can be used as a scarf and blacket thick socks good headphones iPod Thick book (Agatha Christie collections are good- like the 3 in 1 editions) mag or two Gum and mints museli bars or nuts to snack on (and throw away before customs at the other end) water bottle (that i can fill once I've gotten through security) Change of underwear Pack of cards (If I'm travelling with someone) Eye mask and ear plugs for sleep Tissues (and vicks inhaler if I've had a stuffy nose recently as it's inevitable it'll get worse on the plane!) I get seriously dehydrated on planes (even on domestic short-haul flights) so am a bit overly prepared hydration wise!. But i do think it's important to feel clean and hydrated, thus the face wipes and wet ones and the moisturisers. Course, much of what I've listed others have listed as well! I also pack face powder and mascara for freshening up at the other end :) sunshowers 18-05-2011, 09:55 PM Forgot to add! I carry my passport, tickets, foreign cash and cards in a travel wallet and my iPod is my iphone- so i have that with me too! I don't take much as I always have my computer and camera, which take up room. So aside from that I usually only have wallet, passport, water, book, ipod, lipbalm, toothbrush/paste. These days most long haul flight shave a decent amount of stuff to watch and I spend most of my time doing that, but a book is good for the stopovers. I don't usually bother with spare clothes, unless I have something specific I need to be dressed for. What I hate most is having too much hand luggage to lug around during stopovers or in transit. puripuri 22-05-2011, 11:36 AM Depending on the airline I'm flying I take different things. For example if I'm flying Brunei airline, I don't need to take socks, eye mask and toothbrush with me because they provide. For most of the other airlines, I carry with me; In the future I would like to take these following things with me; NECK PILLOW!!!!!!! Eye drops change of clothes, something really loose and comfy Eevee 24-05-2011, 02:42 AM I should consider myself to be a seasoned long-haul traveller by now (I'm due to fly to Paris next month for the third time within this last calendar year, not gloating I promise :p), but I'm very minimalistic when it comes to carry-on luggage. I baulk at the thought of carrying any additional weight so I only bring the bare essentials with me onboard any long-haul flight. Before flying, check what amenities your airline provides (in-flight entertainment, USB port for your iPod or laptop etc.) as this'd help you decide what to bring. Whenever I travel solo, I try to pack as minimal as possible. I normally use my Neverfull (MM) as my flying handbag, and a very slim Incase sling bag (http://www.goincase.com/products/detail\\... for my Macbook. I was just gping to post about dry shampoo. I bought a travel size Batiste one but then wondered whether you can take aerosols on board? mzbabydoll 24-05-2011, 02:19 PM From past experience of over-packing my carry on luggage, I like to keep it light! - A good book is a must for me - Passport/itinerary, all the necessary paperwork and a pen - Tissues - Lollies - Jurlique rosewater mist - Camera and iPhone - Sunglasses That's all I can think of and usually on the way home I'll chuck in any shopping items that can't fit into my suitcase :) Eevee 24-05-2011, 03:18 PM [QUOTE=Eevee;6708667] 70g Cedel dry shampoo I was just gping to post about dry shampoo. I bought a travel size Batiste one but then wondered whether you can take aerosols on board? Yep you're allowed to bring aerosols in your carry-on on long haul flights as long as it is 100g (net weight) or less. That's why the 70g Cedel one works well for me :) rimmellover 24-05-2011, 05:41 PM ^ If you're carrying them on-board, make sure you have the lids on them - if they are lidless when you go through security they will make you throw them out (I think it something to do with explosion risk or some jazz) AgentM99 24-05-2011, 05:55 PM Thanks rimmellover. I now remember that happened to me once. A brand new KMS lidless spray - chucked out by the check in chick. I always carry a basic change of clothes/underwear - ever since they lost my suitcase (permanently) en route to a holiday in Hawaii. Nothing worse then arriving somewhere sans luggage, all sweaty and gross and having to wander around a mall exhausted looking for a change of clothes to buy.

Nothing worse then arriving somewhere sans luggage, all sweaty and gross and having to wander around a mall exhausted looking for a change of clothes to buy. I always do this whenever I fly too. I have a bag delay rate of about 2 a year (so it's probably about 1 in 75 flights), so I expect airlines to occasionally lose my bag, especially when I have a connecting flight. The inconvenience of having to drop what I planned to be doing and shop for basics is not something I can entertain. I have one or two days' worth of change of clothes, two days' (at least) worth of toiletries, hair brush, and other essentials in my cabin bag regardless of how short the flight is. This is partially because I sometimes go hand luggage only for short trips, but even when I check my bag in, I always have those basic kits. TheRealMe 11-07-2011, 01:33 PM I have one or two days' worth of change of clothes, two days' (at least) worth of toiletries, hair brush, and other essentials in my cabin bag regardless of how short the flight is. Since my luggage got lost a few years ago (and it took a week to get it back), I take a change of clothes and my toiletries with me in my hand luggage. Even if my luggage is not lost, this also makes it easier for a quick change at my next destination without having to unpack everything. missE** 11-07-2011, 01:39 PM Are the aerosols allowed in checked in luggage? Yes aerosols are allowed as long as the lid is on. jbie 15-07-2011, 09:51 PM - lots of inflatable pillows, like 3 or 4! makes a big difference in getting comfy for sleep, to support every part of your body - pashminas, maybe 2, to use as blankets - socks for warmth - comfy clothes - refillable bottle of water - snacks - books and mags, laptop for movies - lip balm, moisturiser - eye mask 336 15-07-2011, 09:57 PM Hand sanitiser Ipad 2 books magazines ipod wanttobeafairy 15-07-2011, 10:15 PM I always do this whenever I fly too.

And one change of clothes, and if possible shoes. This time, after a longer flight than I'm used to, I'm determined to take a nasal spray with me too, my nose got so dry and I felt awful. I also found it impossible to sleep this time, do inflatable pillows help? USB 2.0 16-07-2011, 05:13 AM You fly a lot!:-o150 flights a year?? Yes, approximately that. I also found it impossible to sleep this time, do inflatable pillows help? Sorry, I don't know! Unless I have a flat bed to sleep in, I don't recline at all on short haul flights, and not recline beyond about 1/4 of the full recline on a long haul to sleep because I really don't like intruding into the space of someone behind me especially if they are tall, yet I sleep OK, so I'm one of those people who can literally sleep anywhere! Staying awake on a flight is more of a problem for me. I did buy an inflatable pillow one time but couldn't be bothered carrying it or blowing it up, so I haven't actually used one. If you want an extra pillow, do ask the cabin crew though. They are usually able to give you another one. Also, if your head rest has 'bendy wings', I recommend using them too, so that your head doesn't flop around when you sleep. lolligirl 16-07-2011, 07:16 AM I make sure I am wearing warm comfy clothes as I always get cold on planes, and pack the following: - travel socks that I pop on once I am seated - book - scarf in case I get super cold - a set of clothes and underwear in my bag in case I want to get changed on the plane or as soon as I get off, and also for the worst case scenario of if my check in bag went missing! - makeup wipes - small bag of makeup - fruit salad What will I take next time - hardly anything!!!! I downgraded seriously on the flight home and managed just as well. :) Miss-G- 19-07-2011, 09:45 AM I always always always take a hairbrush on a long haul flight - you get serious seat hair and it's so nice to step off the plane looking neat. corrie_v 19-07-2011, 09:57 AM Hairbrush change of underwear deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, lipbalm, face wipes, hand sanitiser cardigan or other to keep you warm socks crossword puzzle book or similar with pens chewing gum sunglasses tissues ear plugs: without fail I will be seated near a screaming child I think inflatable pillow use is debatable...

No idea why.. I'm a really keen reader generally; the atmosphere of a plane means as soon as I open the book I want to fall asleep or do something else!

Should I only take what I need, and for example leave my camera charger in my checked baggage? What do you girls do? As someone who is home less than being away, I have learnt to minimise things I carry around with me. I bought a spare battery for my camera so that for a two-week trip, I don't need to carry my camera battery charger. Depending on the length of your trip, it may be an option for you. I also have compacted everything as much as possible, including just having a USB phone charger for my phones. That way, you only need one USB mains unit or a laptop to charge it. My Apple charger is small so I don't need to worry about it too much, and I have one world adapter that is probably one of the smallest I can get, and also a single adapter for the country I am visiting for my MacBook Air because it's tiny anyway. All of these come in my cabin bag because I cannot risk having my checked baggage delayed even for a day with it, or I cannot work. I also carry a USB cable x 2 (one is for the phone), Ethernet cable, USB-to-Ethernet adapter for Mac, SD card reader, USB light, and a Bluetooth mouse. All of these fit into a cable bag measuring 5x5x20 cm. They also live in my cabin bag as I have ones for home use anyway, so that I don't have to worry about leaving it behind at home. The rest (batteries, chargers, medical (panadol/nurofen)) are in the checked baggage.

Travel plug converters: check that they are a design where they have a 3 rd (Earth) plug, some power points won't work unless they can sense a prong in all points of the socket. *CaT* 28-12-2011, 01:59 PM for travel adaptors, i find a universal one that has at least one usb point the best. that means i don't need to bring the adaptors for my ipod/iphone/camera chargers, just the cord. and the iphone & ipod can use the same cord as well i've had ones where it was a pull out all the different ends depending on which country it was. i'd advise against these because i ended up losing the european adaptor in the hotel i stayed in. pulled it out of the wall, but the european adaptor part stayed in the socket... the ebay one above, where it's all in the one piece and slides out as you use it is much more efficient. although the one i bought at HK airport had 2 usb ports and they were on the main part, not a separate attachment like in the ebay version quick_dry 29-12-2011, 09:10 AM if you forget your charger and the room you're in has a flat screen TV, look for a USB port somewhere on it - it won't be as quick as a decent charger, but it usually works in a pinch.

I'm seldom comfortable (even in Business Class) because I get sciatic nerve pain down the back of my right leg. Consequently, I always have the urge to wriggle around/stretch or walk around the plane. And drink lots and lots of water! I never bring lollies on the plane, or drink alcohol during a flight, because they make me feel bloated and dehydrated. Besides, it's too many empty calories for sitting down for 14 hours.

No.2. Cork floating floors are intended for indoor use (as with any other flooring system such as laminate flooring). Installing floating floors in humid areas such as bathrooms or laundry rooms is not recommended. Cork tiles (glue down flooring) should be used in such instances. Installation: Step 1. Step 1. Lay the planks lengthwise with the direction of sunlight. Check for color harmony and consistency in the flooring. This can be done when allowing your materials to acclimatize beforehand. Manage abrupt patterns by relocating planks. This allows for a more natural transition between color variances in the cork. See ill. No.3. Step 2 . Installing over a concrete sub-floor usually requires some form of moisture barrier. This can be in the form of polyurethane sheeting. Most hardware stores will be able to direct you to the right product for the job. This is especially true when working in a basement or any other room that is below-grade. Step 3. Measure your room and divide by the width of a flooring plank. This will determine the number of the planks needed to cover the floor. If your measurements leave you with space of more than 2.5inches on you long wall (63mm) you should start with a partial board (cut the board to size) in the first row to ensure the stability of the floor. Step 4 . Leave a 3/8inch (10mm) expansion gap between the flooring and each wall, or other obstacles such as a door frame or cabinetry, using spacers (scrap wood or waste product works well). Working left to right in the room: ""brick"" or stagger your planks to reduce the visual appearance of the seams. The tiles along the edge should be the same width along all the walls. This is where your ""pre-placement"" of your planks is going to pay-off. Place the first plank in the left - hand corner of the room (leaving your spacing to the wall) with both tongue sides facing the wall . Complete the first row by angling the planks together one at a time. Try to install the tiles so that they form a single line when you click them together. See Figures A & B. See Ill. No.4. Step 5. Start of second row: Insert the tongue ridge of the next plank to the groove of the first plank at a 20-30 degree angle to the floor -- this is where you will place the cut plank from row 1 to ensure the staggered seams. Press downwards with your hands allowing the plank to ""click"" into place and lay flat on the floor (Figures A & B). Fig. B Fig. A Should you need to ""straighten"" a row or ""tighten"" the seams you can use a scrap of the planking as a ""tapping block"". By using the tapping block (which you have so cleverly created with a piece of scrap tongue and groove flooring) and your rubber mallet you will save the edges on the flooring from any damaging blows. See ill. No.5,6. . Step 6 . Once you have reached the end of the row, you may have to use have to use the crowbar and mallet to tap the last piece into place (space against the wall will be tight). See ill. No.7 See ill. No.8. Step 8 . Proceed the same way for subsequent rows. See ill. No.9. Step 9 . The last row: Hopefully the gap between your flooring and your wall will be uniform along its length.  You can ensure the gap is uniform by measuring at both ends of the room. Measuring: Overlap (matching seam to seam) one plank over your flooring (see Ill.10 ).  Place a second plank (make sure it is snug against the wall) on top of the overlapping plank.  You should be working with the depth of three planks -- one on top of another.   Mark your measurements onto the overlapping plank (the one sandwiched in the middle).  You will cut the width of your last row to the measurements you have just made. Make sure you maintain the tongue and groove of your flooring and that you cut the CORRECT SIDE!!! Remember: Measure twice, Cut once! Maintenance: For daily maintenance, you can use a damp mop to clean the cork floors. Too much moisture can cause warping which is not covered under warranty. Quickly wipe spills from the floor to protect cork from excess liquid. Use door mat to prevent sand and dirt or other abrasives. 4. It's wise to use felt pads under the legs of furniture to avoid scratching and permanent denting. When moving heavy objects try to lift instead of pull. If this is not possible, then using pieces of heavy cardboard under the furniture, while moving it, will help keep your floor from being scratched. SEALING: Our cork products have been surface-sealed with three layers of water based polyurethane. To facilitate installation, the seams are not sealed from the factory. After installation we recommend you re-coat the entire floor. This will seal the seams to protect the joints against dirt accumulation and water spillage. Apply 2 coats of floor grade water based polyurethane for light residential use or 3 coats for heavy residential or commercial use. Follow sealant manufacturer's application instructions.

39162	Hi Everyone - I recently moved and doing that I got a miniskip and threw away everything crappy - and that included my two catstands. I have been looking in pet stores for some and the ones I have seen are very bad quality and there are so few to choose from. Does anyone know a place with a good variety of good quality catstands? I am willing to drive where-ever. I'm not after anything fancy - just sturdy and nice, with good quality materials You could try Kieron at Sammy's Cat Poles http://www.scratchin...sts.com.au/  He may be able to custom make you something in your choice of colour and take it to the end of year show at Hampton Park and you can collect it from him there. Thanks, I do to find one I can buy and take home. I need one now - Bailey is using my bed as a scratching post! The funky ones...so cute, so expensive, but so beautiful and just a little tempting! I'll check petbarn out. We bought Tink's cat post at Robbo's Pet Barn in Dandenong.. they had a good selection there at reasonable prices. That was three years ago now, the post is used constantly and is still like new, so that might be somewhere to try. I'd go with Satcmo's recommentation for Sammy's. They are great build quality at a good price and my cats love them. Contact them, you may be able to get something quickly. Alternatively, Mega Pet Warehouse on Maroondah Hwy Ringwood have some right up the back of the shop. They do have some great ones (well did last time I was in there) but they are pretty expensive. So depends how quickly you need something and how much you want to spend. The show at Hampton park is on Sunday week, so not far away. If you want good quality and a good price you are best contacting Sammy's....maybe give them a ring (check website for a phone number. Most stuff in the shops is rather overpriced and the quality is not always the best. Sammy's stuff is excellent. I have lots of it and it lasts well. I picked it up from her in Mulgrave which saved 30 dollars or so in postage. If you can pick it up, it really is great value. The quality seems fine and it didnt take me long to put together. They come flatpacked too! So you don't need a large special sized vehicle. The only downside was that she only does pick up 11am to 4pm Mon-Friday. But I sent a friend down to pick it up for me.

336	"International Arapawa Goat Association International Arapawa Goat Association IAGA Profile: David Hughes ~ Tutukinoa Arapawas Some of David's bucks I don't remember the year but it was in the early 1990s. Patsy and I had gone to a Rare Breeds Conservation Society auction at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch with a friend who assured us it would be an interesting day looking at the animals and having a picnic lunch and a few wines. We were not yet rare breeders and had no intention of buying anything. But then we saw this magnificent goat! He had spectacular horns and was extremely friendly. When we went over to his enclosure he put his front feet up on the rails so that he could be patted, scratched and talked to. We kept returning to see him. What was he, we wondered, and what would he cost? This was a rare breeds auction so perhaps he was worth thousands? We made enquiries and found out that he was an Arapawa goat and that he probably would sell for a couple of hundred dollars or so. We figured we could manage that and nervously I got ready to bid. It was all over very quickly and we had paid a mere $28 for a truly beautiful animal who was to change our lives considerably! We decided to call our goat Pegasus. Then Michael Willis asked us if we would take two females under the caregiver scheme that was operating at the time. We got a mother and daughter and named them Gog and Magog. When Gog produced twin boys we took them to the next Rare Breeds auction and sold them because we couldn't use them for breeding. A reporter for a farming paper was there and took a photo of me with one of the kids to accompany an article she was writing. When the article appeared the caption underneath the photo described me as a ""farmer and breeder"" much to the chagrin of my father-in-law who had owned a large sheep station and didn't think such a description fitted someone with ten acres at Lyttelton! Young Belltopper One morning I found Magog dead in her shelter. She wasn't even lying over and looked as if she had settled down for the night and had a heart attack or brain haemorrhage and died instantly in that position. We were very disappointed but Gog helped raise our spirits by delivering twin girls that we named Magog II and Belltopper. They were to be the last kids Gog produced because she died before she could kid again. This was a huge blow to our confidence and I'm sure that if anything had happened to Magog II and Belltopper we would have given up. Fortunately both thrived and produced many kids before they were too old. We couldn't put Pegasus over his daughters so we got a male goat we named Chewtobacco and a doe we named Little Glory from a breeder in Timaru. Chewtobacco got to mate with the girls and Pegasus spent his time head butting lumps of concrete for fun. One day he snapped off half of one horn, which rather spoilt his looks. Our herd grew only slowly. We began corresponding with Betty and Walt Rowe at the Arapawa Wildlife Sanctuary who were responsible for helping save the breed from extermination. We were hoping to get some goats from the island but this proved difficult because there were restrictions on stock movements at the time as hydatids had been found on the island. In the end we worked out a system with the government ministry whereby a permit would be issued to pick up suckling kids when they became available and we would then bottle raise them when we got them home. In 1998 I made my first trip to the island going out on the mail run and bringing back a buck kid and doe kid. Betty called the buck Precious and we named the doe Kaipipi. Bottle feeding the kids was great fun and it also established a bond with the goats that will never be broken. David feeding some of his female Arapawa goats A second trip to the island resulted in three more doe kids coming to Lyttelton and we also got two bucks locally. We thought that with these additions we would make real progress with our breeding. However, despite our best efforts, we were spectacularly unsuccessful at breeding females. In the 2001-2003 seasons we had 38 kids but fewer than a quarter were female. We knew that this was not just a matter of luck because the pattern was the same each year -- plenty of males and very few females. We lacked an explanation until we were shown a textbook on goats that identified the problem as an iodine deficiency and suggested the remedy was to feed seaweed meal, which we did. In November 2003 I again went to Arapawa Island and brought back more goats for our property. The next year produced more female kids than in the previous four years combined, and the number of females equalled the number of males, thanks to the seaweed meal. In the past several people had asked for goats but we didn't have enough to let any females go. Now we were in a position to start establishing other herds with people keen to get involved and hopefully these beautiful animals, of which there are only about 300 world wide, can have a secure future. We currently have over 75 Arapawa goats but also have Arapawa pigs and Arapawa sheep plus other breeds of sheep, goats and pigs as well as ponies, donkeys, rabbits and poultry.

40742	There is still a need for this kind of festival -- Exclusive interview with Jackie Crozier, LadyRock founder Have you been wondering exactly why LadyRock and GoGo were cancelled this year? Do you want find out the reasons behind such drastic decisions made?  We do too! We recently caught up with Jackie Crozier, LadyRock's very own festival director to talk about what issues they faced, the history of Pride and ultimately, why they had to cancel. 2012 has seen the quick rise and the even quicker demise of the lesbian festivals.  3 became 1 in quick succession, after GoGo in the south and LadyRock in the north succumbed, L Fest was the only one left standing, right in the heart of England.  After hearing about the saddening news that LadyRock was forced to cancel due to the economic climate, then hearing about GoGo falling at the same hurdle, it made me think... what makes lesbian festivals such a fickle mistress to tame whilst gay pride events stand the test of time? One of the main reasons that come to mind is the history behind Pride.  After the Stonewall riot in 1969, we've celebrated our community and what makes us special with such ferocity and love, it's relatively easier to set up an event with this at its core. Festivals always hang in the balance due to schedule clashes.  It's safe to say we've got a lot going on here in the UK with that little sporting event happening in the summer.  Olympics is it?  I actually can't wait to see the drama unfold on the smurf turf, yet I was ready to make my way down to a lady fest or two as well.  Read on to find out why we've been stripped from our selection mere weeks before the events were set to take place this year. LadyRock was in its first year, yet had to cancel... what issues did you face? In general, as featured throughout mass national media this year, 2012 has been an unfortunate time for festivals. In terms of issues specific to us, there really were not that many (at least that were apparent). We were thrilled with our line-up and had fantastic feedback for it. As a new brand we felt strong as an organisation, our team worked hard and we were receiving good press, both locally and nationally. Ultimately festivals are cancelled because of ticket sales and, in relation to ours, I would perhaps say that we had not made ourselves public early enough. Whilst we had made an impact in the festival, LGBT and north west press sectors, you have to remember that we only announced the event and its full line-up around twelve weeks or so ago. In hindsight, we should have had more time so that people could get hold of their tickets and tell their friends about the event. Unfortunately we were stuck as to which months we could hold the festival in. What was the ultimate issue that forced you guys to cancel the festival? Aside from planning -- and I hate to sound like a stereotypical Brit -- but the weather we have had for the past two or three months has been horrendous, particularly in Manchester. The image most have of festivals is heat, Ray Bans and cans of Strongbow, whilst all we've seen since February has been rain, hooded jackets and hot chocolates. Had we been in sun bathing weather for two months, who knows what could have happened... In general, as I said before, many UK festivals have been cancelled this year. National events such as the Queen's Jubilee and The Olympics have meant many individuals re-think their 'big weekends' and celebrations around patriotism (which I fully support). I know the word is batted about so much but, in addition to this, the recession is constantly worrying people into where they spend their pennies. This has obviously affected us in the same way it has done other festivals. Do you think the cancellation of LadyRock and GoGo was related or two separate issues? I think related in the general ideas I just mentioned, as we are both smaller festivals, but not in respect of us being 'women's events'. Whilst we are most definitely a 'niche' event, there is an obvious need for our kind of festival on the market. This is visible from media types that relate to women and moreover, lesbian issues, as well as a clear market audience. Whilst it has been a tough year both for us and our friends at GO.GO, 2012 wasn't unsuccessful because of lack of want, but for all the aforementioned reasons. Why do you think Prides have stood the test of time and grown over the past few years? Pride events are pivotal to our society, both nationally and further afield, but in major UK cities their message and meaning has most definitely progressed over the years. Manchester Pride began as a small event well over twenty years ago. It was a 'bring and buy' sale to raise money for HIV/AIDS organisations. In addition to that, Pride Marches took place to try and make a statement: regardless of homophobia and hate, which surrounded the gay community, it would not back down. It was a message of strength and, for other gay people, it was about hope. Fast forward to 2012, and you can see and understand the journey even if you were not there to witness it first-hand. There is still money being raised for HIV and AIDS groups, but it goes towards helping people live and sustain a comfortable life. Other funds are raised looking for a cure, which we would hope is not so distant. In addition to this, Pride money is going towards LGBT community groups -- sports teams, arts groups, help centres and radio stations -- which we just could never have imagined all of those years ago. Similarly, our Pride Marches are a cause for celebration. They still voice an aggressive strength and a deep-invested passion for equality, a fight against hatred and the feeling of alienation, but there is such a positivity around them. In Manchester, hundreds of thousands of straight men and women come to watch the parade and support our community. Major brands, celebrities and institutions take part to show their support for us -- it is astounding, really. Pride events will always be relevant, whether we are pushing further towards equal rights or celebrating the long journey we have come. As well as that, the LGBT community is notorious for loving a good party... And, for that reason, the entertainment elements of Prides (fringe events, singing, comedy etc) make for a fantastic show. So yes, the events have grown in size and capacity, but the passion and need for them has always been just as integral. I am so proud of our community and all of those who support it -- we are doing a fantastic job and setting a wonderful example for the world. We really do show that 'It Gets Better', as they say... Are you heading off to any this year? As a huge supporter of Pride events around the world, I would love the chance to see LGBT communities celebrating in as many places as possible. Things are understandably extremely busy for me at the moment but, if I am able to, then you will definitely see me pop up at a few Pride events in 2012... You and the team had a lot of stuff organised, such as merchandise etc... What's going to happen to that stuff now? As true ladies and rockers, we have always been particularly prepared as a team. When organising a festival -- which I've now become quite used to -- there is no other way to be. In terms of merchandise, we purchased by order, and so have not been left with too many excess items. For what has been sold -- hold onto it -- because I have no doubt you may be needing it in the not so distant future... Will LadyRock return with a vengeance in 2013? 'Onwards and upwards' is our motto. The LadyRock brand is far from gone, and it will just come down to time control and more planning to ensure the event comes together as it should next time around. We are still extremely visible via social media; our Twitter account will remain very much active, keeping followers up-to-speed with all things music, Manchester, female, LGBT and festival related. In and amongst that, there will certainly be teasers in terms of where the brand is headed and when you will next hear from us... So watch this space, and make sure to follow us for the ride, as it's set to be a good one... 	Other	Promotion
31950	baby gender selection and prediction, girl or boy, how to have baby girl or baby boy, plan your baby, how to choose your baby gender, how to have a girl, how to have a boy... How to Choose Baby Gender You Desire? So you've decided to have a baby. Good for you! And for any number of reasons you may have decided that you would like to have a baby of a certain gender. And maybe you've decided that you want a baby girl. Certainly there are any number of good reasons why you might want to have a girl. That's completely up to you. It's your own business. But you'd probably be happy to know there are many ways how to have a baby girl. There are a few factors in life that help to determine the gender of children that we don't have any control over. Factors such as age, hobbies, and professions can influence the gender of children. For example, younger people tend to have more boys than girls. Meanwhile men who fly a lot or deep sea dive tend to have more girls than boys. There's actually a scientific reason for this. Male sperm and female sperm have different characteristics -- male sperm are faster but more fragile while female sperm are slower but tougher. These characteristics are what lead the sperm to be influenced by the above factors (age, flying, etc.). However, knowing these facts can help you to know what you should do in order to conceive a child of the gender of your choice. In fact, knowing these facts should determine when you have sexual intercourse and the positions you use to have sexual intercourse. That's how to have a baby girl. For how to have a baby girl you want to make sure you are having intercourse at the right time in your cycle. Normally women ovulate fourteen days before their next period. So you need to plan when you have intercourse according to when you are going to ovulate. Of course that's easier said then done because it's not always easy to predict when ovulation will occur. Another way how to have a baby girl is to use position during intercourse that will help the odds of having a girl. There are positions that will help you have either a girl or a boy. Knowing how sperm act should help you determine which positions you use. It's not that tough to learn how to have a baby girl. First you need to know the different characteristics between male and female sperm. Then you need to plan when you and how you have sexual intercourse accordingly. If you do that then you can dramatically increase the chances of having a baby girl. 	Instruction	Instruction
2834	"(Based on a chapter in a forthcoming PhD thesis on equal pay. Written 28 November 1999. A companion piece is included in the book Rebel Women , which you can read about on our Booknotes page.) Introduction This article is a case study of the actions undertaken by the major union in the Australian metal industry (the Amalgamated Engineering Union -- AEU) to campaign for equal pay for women. It deals with the years 1969 to 1972, a period bounded by two important decisions by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission granting forms of equal pay to women workers. A substantial literature now exists dealing with the content and the effects of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's 1969 and 1972 equal pay decisions. Before looking at the specifics of each decision it is worth spelling out their common features. Most importantly, both were hedged about with qualifications. Both decisions retained the concept of the ""family wage"". Wage-setting continued to be underpinned by the notion of the male breadwinner and dependant female. In order to lessen the impact on employers, the increases that were granted were to come into effect in instalments over a number of years. Both claims were initiatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), both were opposed by the employers and the Liberal-Country Party government, and both failed to address the fact that there was no minimum wage set for women. The effect of this last factor meant the lowest-paid male in 1973 got $60.80, while employers could still pay women as little as $34.50. The effect of the 1969 decision was to grant ""equal pay for equal work"", i.e. that where women did ""equal work"" alongside men they should receive equal pay, but that otherwise equality did not apply. The ninth principle outlined in the Commission's decision spelt this out very clearly -- equal pay was not applicable ""where the work in question is essentially or usually performed by females but is work upon which male employees may also be employed"". The restrictive character of the 1969 principles was illustrated by its application to female classifications in the Meat Industry Interim Award in December 1969. Commissioner Gough granted equal pay to about 120 women out of 2,000 employed under the award. By the time of the 1972 equal pay case, figures could be produced to show that only 18% of women workers had benefited as a result of the 1969 decision. When the unions approached the Commission again in 1972 it agreed to widen equal pay to ""equal pay for work of equal value"", but the effects were still limited. Whereas before 1972 male and female jobs were compared to see if they were basically identical, after 1972 work was compared to see if it was very similar in content or tasks, rather than any attempt being made to evaluate the work more generally. A further negative outcome of both decisions was the attempt by employers to reclassify (or re-name) women's jobs in order to avoid the consequences of the rulings. This was particularly widespread after the 1972 decision, with one survey finding that over 60 per cent of employers had reclassified women's jobs onto a different (and lower) scale to men in similar work. Despite the restrictions inherent in the decisions, women's wages relative to men's did increase after 1969. However, just as it would be mistaken to attribute the equal pay decisions to the enlightenment of the Commissioners (rather than to the pressure of the trade unions), it would also be wrong to give them the credit for the actual wage increases that were achieved. The granting of increases was by no means automatic. Unions were required to ask to have the test case rulings applied to the awards that determined the wages of their particular members. Different unions achieved diffferent results. Through industrial pressure the AEU was able to get a ruling to phase in equal pay for women metal workers over a two year period. As a result of further industrial action at the workplace level, 90 per cent of women members of the union had equal pay by the start of 1972. ""Equal pay on the instalment plan"" In November 1969 the AEU officials sought to have the ""equal pay for equal work"" ruling of that year applied to their women members. The union lodged an application with the Commission for equal pay under the Metal Trades Award ""to remove discrimination between males and females on 'substantially similar' work"" by eliminating reference to the female rate. In a hearing before Commissioner Winter at the end of 1969, metal industry employers would not agree that any of the classifications where women were employed came within the nine points of the 1969 equal pay decision. Instead they demanded a lengthy and costly inspection and work value inquiry. In March 1970 they argued that women must be doing exactly the same work as males in the classification, and where the workforce was predominantly female, there was no case to answer. Despite this being a virtual restatement of the Commission's original decision, Winter found in favour of equal pay at the process worker classification, to be phased in by January 1972. The report ""Union break through on equal pay"" indicates that the AEU lodged its claim for over 300 classifications, although women were employed under only a small number of them at that time. In April 1970 the union's journal was able to report a success which reflected ""the degree of activity which has been marshalled by the metal trades unions and shop stewards in support of this principle"", i.e. not just by the women members. When the employers lodged an appeal against the decision in March, the union's response was that ""we should each resolve that if necessary industrial action would be taken to ensure all females under the Federal Metal Trades Award receive equal pay with males"". The employers' appeal was dismissed. The union then campaigned shop by shop for immediate implementation of Winter's decision, and was able to spread it to other classifications covering women workers. Emphasised throughout was the role of industrial action in securing this successful outcome: ""Following the Arbitration Commission's decision granting equal pay on the instalment plan for female process workers, a considerable amount of activity was developed in those plants where we have female members ... On several jobs, women stopped work on the day of the appeal and a large number of workshops sent representatives to the Court in order to express their opposition to the employers' appeal"". After rejection of the appeal, some employers tried to absorb the equal pay increase into existing over-award payments. This too was successfully resisted. In addition, ""large numbers of female workers in unorganised shops became interested, and as a result our female membership has increased by 300 over the last two months, and a number of new shops organised. We now also have an increased number of female shop stewards ... a feature of the activity was the readiness of the women concerned to take industrial action to support their demand"". An interesting comparison can be drawn between the gaining of equal pay in the metal industry and the experience of those unions that did not pursue the issue industrially. Some unions, such as that of the bank officers, attempted to gain equal pay through solely legalistic rather than industrial means. This was a failure. If the letter of the 1969 decision had been applied (as it was to the bank workers when their union went to the Commission in November 1969), women in the metal industry would also have received nothing. Yet about 90 per cent had equal pay by the start of 1972 as a result of the campaign. In those areas where there were still inequalities, industrial action continued. John Halfpenny, Victorian State Secretary of the AEU at the time, explained that ""The over-award payments assumed great importance because at a certain time they actually constituted about 30 per cent of a metalworker's wages ... When equal pay was established in the award ... the employers' attention then turned to the over-award payments, to make sure they remained unequal ... [That was] basically outside the Commission's jurisdiction to arbitrate on"". When asked how the union had dealt with this, he replied, ""Collective bargaining they call it nowadays"". For example, at Email, the electrical appliance manufacturer, a series of stopwork meetings by members, most of them women, won increased over-award payments of $3.50 a week for women and $1 for men. The extra money for women was part of a union-wide campaign for equal over-award payments. Similar action at the same workplace and at K.G. Luke won further differential increases which leveled up over-award payments between the sexes. By contrast, the union which covered workers in the insurance industry was even more timid than the bank officers' union. Having been refused negotiations about equal pay by the insurance employers in 1969, and disheartened by the Commission's rejection of the bank officers' application of that year, their leaders failed to take any further action over the issue until July 1972. As a result, women insurance workers did not get even a semblance of equal pay until late 1975. Why look at the metalworkers? The AEU's relative success is interesting in the light of a number of features of the union. Most important is the significance of the union in Australian industrial relations more generally. Tom Sheridan in his history of the AEU, Mindful Militants, gives a number of reasons for the AEU's standing as a pacesetter in wages and conditions, particularly by the late 1960s/early 1970s: the distribution of metalworkers throughout the economy (by 1970 metal trades unionists were 17 per cent of all unionists), and the traditional role of the fitter's rate as representative of all craftsmen's wages. So metalworkers are important, even though this period also starts to see the decline of their industrial centrality with the growth of white collar militancy. In the early 1970s, whatever happened in the metal industry was a standard to which other unions aspired. What this meant in relation to equal pay was all too clear to the metal industry employers. One reason given by them in their appeal against the granting of equal pay was that ""because the Metal Trades Award is involved the decision is likely to have an influence on proceedings in relation to other awards"". The second significant feature is that in class terms, the AEU was very combative. By the 1970s the union was virtually synonymous with successful industrial militancy. Sheridan talks of ""the overall success of AEU members' non-stop offensive in these years [1960s/70s]"". In addition the AEU (and its successor from 1972, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union -- AMWU) had a much stronger workshop orientation than most Australian unions, with a tradition of independent rank and file action. This tradition of fighting at the rank and file level also influenced the way the union approached the question of equal pay. The final factor of note in the metalworkers' union's campaign for equal pay is the composition of the union's membership. In March 1969 the AEU's female membership was approximately 2,000 out of 84,000 (2.4 per cent). In December 1974 the AMWU had 186,121 members of whom 16,000 (8.5 per cent) were women. It is again possible to draw a useful comparison with the insurance industry (approximately 50 per cent female in this period). If equal pay is regarded as an issue in which the ""gender interests"" of women workers are counterposed to their male counterparts, we should expect a stronger response from unions with large female memberships, and a correspondingly weak one from unions such as the metalworkers'. Yet the differentiating factors were not the number of women in the industry, but the industrial strength and militancy of the union (and also their politics, in a more general sense). Women in a union like the AEU were able to make greater advances than those in relatively less well-organised areas of the workforce, even though they were numerically marginal to the union as a whole. The campaign itself -- the ugly, the bad and the good Nonetheless, there was a contradiction between the positive result on equal pay and sexism inside the trade union. One place this could be seen was in the pages of the union's monthly journal. As late as 1975 the AMWU was still emphasising the importance of the ""family living wage"" as the basis for wage campaigning. The union also contained some backward (or at best contradictory) attitudes to women's right to paid employment. For example, the same issue of the journal (July 1968) contains two such reports. The first, regarding National Instruments in Melbourne, involves the discovery that women process workers had been doing tradesmen's work for four years. The initial response of the organiser was to demand that the company take the women off this work. The second case is more overt. The organiser's complaint after the retrenchment of five night shift workers at CAC in Melbourne (including three men with families) was that ""while retrenching these employees the Company was retaining the services of married women, whose husbands were working in other establishments"". Such attitudes were reflected both in writing and visually in the Monthly Journal , with articles such as ""Choosing a career for your son?"" (about job opportunities in the metal industry), and numerous sexist cartoons and advertisements (see appendix). The June 1972 front cover shows a photograph of a huge mass meeting in which not a single woman can be seen. In other words, the AEU did not embark on the campaign for equal pay as fully-formed opponents of sexism. John Halfpenny went so far as to say that, ""In the very early days of the equal pay campaign, the majority of women didn't support it and the majority of blokes didn't support it. The majority of women didn't support it because they thought they'd lose their jobs, and the blokes didn't support it because they didn't think the women were worth as much as they were."" Sylvia Bramston, who became a shop steward as a result of equal pay campaigning at National Instruments, confirmed the opposition to the equal pay fight that existed amongst women as well as men. Her account of attempts to get equal conditions for workers of both sexes at National Instruments gives some indication of the resistance that activists could come up against (as well as evidence that it could be overcome: We needed a woman shop steward where we worked ... When the men were negotiating with the company, the women's angles were never brought up. One of the big arguments, which nearly led to a total national industry strike was ... [getting] concessions [fares] on the aircraft because we worked in the aircraft industry ... The men got it for their dependents, but the women didn't. I couldn't take my husband because he was not dependent on me. The men could take their wives, and our argument was that most of our fellows were married to professional women -- school teachers, doctors, accountants, they were all working, they were not dependent on them. Therefore, our argument was, OK you can prove your dependency and you can get the perks. Of course, needless to say the boys switched sides. Before that they'd been very much against us getting it, but they then switched sides and supported us and we ended up getting the same thing as the fellows. However, it would be wrong to ascribe all opposition to the equal pay campaign simply to the acceptance of sexist ideas on the part of male or female metalworkers. Sometimes other problems intersected. Explaining why some sections of the workforce played more of a role than others, Halfpenny points out the negative role of other divisions in the workforce: ""Some sections of what are now the metalworkers weren't that involved, like the boilermakers -- there weren't any women boilermakers ... There were women sheetmetal workers, there were women engineering workers but without any real exceptions they were all process workers ... It was difficult to get too many workplaces where the tradesmen would stand up for the women process workers to get equal pay -- because they wouldn't even stand up for the male process workers."" Militancy and politics Yet the union still campaigned vigorously for equal pay. The following section attempts to identify the countervailing factors to sexism inside the union. The first of these is what might be called the ""background militancy"" of the union, reflecting a basic level of class consciousness directed in the first instance against the employers in the industry. As mentioned earlier, by the time of the equal pay decisions the AEU was virtually synonymous with successful industrial militancy and rank and file activity against employers. One sign of this was the willingness of well-organised workplaces to take significant industrial action over what would appear by the industrial relations standards of the late 1990s to be quite minor issues: We worked a lot of overtime because we had to keep aircraft flying, and you'd work until ten o'clock at night. You used to get a lot of vandals into the car park, so they built a car park with wire mesh around it with barbed wire on the top and a gate and a security guard, and they used to lock the gate in the morning, open it at lunchtime, lock them again, open them at night ... Well, the big argument was over the morning. We were supposed to start work at eight o'clock. At five past eight they locked the gates and that was it. And if you wanted the gate to be opened you had to go in, get the security guard, park your car, come back and clock on. Now it could take him twenty minutes to come out, which meant instead of being five minutes late for work, you ended up being half an hour late for clocking on, and of course you'd get docked. And they did it with just a notice on the wall, they didn't talk to anybody about it ... Well, one person got caught and of course all hell broke loose. When the shop steward went up to talk to the management, he was rude to him, so ... it was 'Right, everybody is out' and we just dropped our tools and walked out, and we were all standing out on the pavement. And I think we were out for about a week over that. While the Monthly Journal (and former officials like John Halfpenny) might attribute successful militancy to the ""splendid leadership"" provided by union officials, it was much more often the case, as the journal's own pages attest, that strike action occurred spontaneously. One of the best indicators of this phenomenon in the metal industry was the letters sent by union organisers to the higher echelons on the trade union movement, asking for endorsement of disputes that had already taken place and been won at the workplace. Reflecting a common class position across the gender divide, this tradition of militancy was shared by women workers, and was not confined to issues such as equal pay. In the same period in which overt sexism was common in the Monthly Journal , there were also reports which in some senses contradicted that sexism. For example, a strike at Iplex Plastics in Elizabeth, South Australia was described as ""one of those disputes which deserves a particular mention"". The mainly female workforce held a stopwork meeting about various complaints. Management used non-union labour to operate the machines during the stopwork, leading to a strike by all three shifts. Approximately 250 of the workers were AEU members but there were also ""30 or 40 hard core non-unionists"". A mass meeting then decided that ""all the claims were less important than the fact that non-unionists still operated inside the plant"". A further mass meeting was then held on 6 August 1970. Many of the workers involved had no previous experience of industrial action, and particular women shop stewards played a key role in organising rosters for pickets and so on, leading to a successful outcome. Sometimes the women's lack of industrial experience could make them more volatile: It was quite remarkable really ... Johhny Halfpenny was in then as State secretary and we warned him and said, look, handling women in the workforce is a totally different thing to handling the fellows. And he said, ah she'll be right, she'll be right. And the first time they all went out on strike they rang him up and said, right, you better get out here and do something, we're all out on the footpath. It was one of the big factories up in Lilydale ... Reynolds Chains ... the women all went out there and poor old Johnny nearly went grey over that because they said, look, if we're going to strike, we're not striking for nothing. We came out because we want it, and if we don't get it we're not going back, and that's all there is to it! No argument. They gave him a very hard time. Nonetheless, it was in action around equal pay that sexist ideas were most undermined. The AEU had a history of strike action over this issue before the 1969 decision. At the National Instrument Company (mentioned earlier as an example of the union's contradictory attitude to women working), women had been used to do tradesmen's work in the ""Gyro Section"". The women were all union members, and ""no complaint could be lodged about the way the work was done"". The AEU organiser saw that this was undoubtedly tradesmen's work. It was in this section that Sylvia Bramston had managed to get a job when she returned to paid work when her youngest child was eight. Imagine her surprise when The first thing the fellow said was, look, you know, don't take it personally, but we're all going on strike because you lot are coming in. The technicalities of it was that the company was trying to break the work down from skilled tradesmen's work into small sections, and bring in process workers -- women at that -- which were paid ... a pittance really, to do just sections of the work, and of course the tradesmen, who had to do a four years' apprenticeship, were objecting strenuously to it. So we joined the union and went out on strike with them, which meant that ... if they sacked us, then the boys were going to give us their support. So anyway, we kept our jobs. Although the organiser's initial response of trying to get these women put onto other, unskilled work had all the makings of a serious split in the workforce, the dispute was resolved along lines that reinforced class solidarity and common interests amongst the workers at the expense of their employer. There was ""an immediate demand ... that if the female workers were to remain in the section they would have to be paid the full tradesman's rate"". A number of meetings were held on the job. The District Committee endorsed ""the decision of our members to cease work immediately"" if the dispute was not resolved. Management then agreed that the full tradesman's rate of $53.20 would be paid to all women workers in the section. In itself, this could still have been used to set women against men, by ""pricing women out of the job"". To counter this, the union also indicated that if women were moved from the section, ""we require the same consideration to be given to them as to tradesmen working in the section"", i.e. that they were to be paid at the tradesman's rate even if working elsewhere in the plant. A general meeting of employees in the area unanimously accepted the offer, meaning a $14 a week wage rise for the women. Like the numerous local disputes about equal pay featured in the industrial reports of the Monthly Journal , the National Instruments case reveals one piece of very concrete evidence of the undermining of sexist attitudes: male workers could be convinced to stop work, and therefore lose money, to gain benefits for their female co-workers from which they themselves did not directly gain. This kind of common activity came into conflict with at least the worst of the sexist attitudes found in the union. From the outset, there had been ""some [work]places [where] there was good support ... some places [where] the blokes wouldn't go back to work till the women got equal pay"". As decisions on industrial action forced workers to confront their prejudices, a more egalitarian spirit began to prevail. Just as sexist attitudes had been reflected in the Monthly Journal , so too were the changes. After 1972, no more of the sexist cartoons appeared, and women started to figure, as a matter of course, in photographs of mass meetings and picket lines from 1974. Between February 1969 and December 1972 the journal published thirteen editorials or major articles on the fight for equal pay. This was more significant coverage than for any issue besides across-the-board wage increases through the metal industry award. Other changes in ideas about women's role were reflected in the way the union organised. In September 1969 the Victorian branch of the union held the first working women's State conference. Twelve members took time off work to attend, and their wages were made up by job collections. The two major issues at the conference were the forthcoming equal pay claim, including ""intensive activity outside of the Arbitration Commission in support of any application"" with demands also being made on individual employers, and demands for childcare. On the negative side, most of the speakers at the conference were men. In January 1970, Sylvia Bramston, who had been a leading force in winning equal trades rate for some women members at National Instruments, became the first woman to work full-time for the AEU on organising and campaign questions, as she was sent around Victoria to recruit and organise the equal pay campaign for three months. As the union stepped up its industrial action around equal pay, more women were drawn into membership, and into shop steward positions. As indicated earlier, it was not only male workers who needed to be convinced of the virtues of fighting for equal pay. Sylvia Bramston explained the transformation of the views of many women workers, and the degree to which class conflict played a role in chnaging consciousness: It was a case of building the women's confidence ... you've been doing this job for x number of years, you're good at it. Do you think somebody, just because he wears a pair of pants, can come in and do it better than you, with no experience? You've got to build your confidence, you're worth something. Don't think you're going to get a huge amount of money, because the job's not changing. But if they're going to bring a fellow in to put him on your job ... and pay him $10 extra just because he's a fellow, why shouldn't you have the $10 extra? ... If they belonged to the union ... and they decided to sack everybody, then they had the union behind them to fight their battle. So, in lots of cases you'd find a couple who were enthusiastic enough, and you'd get them all equipped up to go and recruit the others, and eventually they'd get themselves organised. Sooner or later, management would do something stupid, which would get everybody's backs up, and of course they'd all sign up, and away you would go -- because they always did. Such was the union's concern about involving women members in this period that it even led them to under-estimate what successes they did have. For example, the 1971 Conference's having only seven women delegates out of 300 was described as indicative of the problems of women's representation when in fact it was close to the percentage of women in the union. But as the Monthly Journal recognised when reporting on a one-day school for women shop stewards and active members in April 1973, women still remained seriously under-represented in the union hierarchy. Nonetheless, those changes that did occur seemed to be welcomed. By the time of the appointment of a second woman organiser in Victoria in 1975, the journal could claim that the appointment, while popular with women members, ""also met with wide support amongst members of the union generally"". There is a second important factor in explaining the AEU's relative success in the fight for equal pay. It is the ideas about the role of trade unionism that were not just held by the union's leaders, but put into practice by its members. The articles and leaflets that the union produced supporting the claim for equal pay included arguments about how male workers would benefit as well as the women. In other words, a conscious attempt was made to look at the issue in class terms. In addition, efforts were made to connect the issue of equal pay with the view that unionism was about broader social issues beyond the workplace. The level of politicisation of the union was allied with its industrial militancy. The AEU in this period supported a series of such campaigns with stopwork action. These ranged from a student-organised march against poverty in 1969, to job meetings, collections and workplace resolutions in support of Aboriginal land rights claims in 1970, or a stoppage at Dunlop's Port Melbourne tyre and rubber factory because it was a ""notorious polluter"". One of the things that we were good at in the AEU and the metalworkers was converting minorities into majorities, like with issues like equal pay, like the Vietnam War, like the whole idea of anti-nuclear testing, support [for] the anti-apartheid movement ... they were leadership-driven. In the workplace there would be dissent, or opposition. We often used to have arguments ... [e.g.] 'Peace is union business' ... [On those sort of issues] we would always make a decision...and go to the membership to get endorsement for it...we'd go in there and argue for a decision to stop [work to stop the war] ... in some places we didn't have to do that because the shop steward was there ... some we won, some we lost ... we got a good response, and I think that was a bit of a turning point [1971]. The AEU's campaign against the Vietnam War was its most sustained political involvement of this kind. By mid-1970 thousands of factory meetings had been held. The following year about 30 meetings of AEU members in Victoria voted by large margins to strike for the next major anti-war demonstration. Unions such as the AEU which took an interest in broader social and political questions (and were prepared to take industrial action over them) were an essential component of the success of the movements which developed outside the workplace about these issues. The equal pay campaign itself is an example of this, but similar conclusions can be drawn about the unions' role in the anti-Vietnam War campaign in Australia, and the boycott of the 1971 Springbok rugby union tour. The actions of the AEU around equal pay cannot finally be understood without reference to the broader political and industrial context. The activities of the union both helped to create this climate, and were in turn affected by it. Conclusion Class conflict, rather than either ""gender solidarity"" between male workers and employers, or a conflict of interest between male and female workers, was the key factor in the fight for equal pay for women working in this industry. The gender-centred approach which pervades the literature on this area is inadequate to explain either the existence or the nature of the metalworkers' union's campaign for equal pay. Claims such as that made by Thornton and Dixson that union officials colluded with employers in reclassifying women workers to keep them on lower pay scales, or Bennett's suggestion of a common desire by men of both classes to keep equal pay increases small, simply do not fit the metalworkers' case. Ryan and Rowse's idea of an alliance of employers and most trade unionists (I assume they mean male trade unionists) to preserve prevailing male images of women's rights and duties is contradicted by the changes that the equal campaign wrought on the way metalworkers saw these things. Power and O'Donnell's notion of equal pay as a way to keep women out of men's jobs was a possible outcome. However, as the National Instruments dispute shows, it was not the only outcome. Where a common class antagonism to the employer prevailed, gains could be won from which workers of both sexes benefited. The equal pay campaign in the metal industry did create the contradictions between sexist ideas and class identity which Ryan and Conlon point out. But there is no reason those conflicts had to be resolved in favour of sexism. Equal pay was an issue that was fought out along class lines. At the most basic level, it was the trade unions that prosecuted the struggle for it, and it was employers that continually resisted it at national, industry and workplace level. The degree to which unions were successful in gaining equal pay for their women members depended on their general level of militancy, and the political views that informed it. Drawing a comparison between the metalworkers' and the clerks' unions, John Halfpenny drew the following balance sheet: The metalworkers, the old AEU, were very committed to and very active in the equal pay struggle. The clerks union ... was under the influence of the National Civic Council, Bob Santamaria and what have you, and they basically had...a very conservative ... view of the world that women shouldn't be working anyway, they should be home looking after the kids, so don't give them too much money, it'll only encourage them to stay at work ... They were not active ... I mean, they weren't active about much at all, but certainly given that most of their members were women, and this was all about equality for women, then they were remarkably silent.

22069	Calling all Carinas: Toyota's on the search to find UK's oldest Toyota has launched a nationwide search to find the oldest British-built Carina still in daily use. The first Toyota Carina rolled off the production line at the Japanese firm's Burnaston factory, Derbyshire, in December 1992 and was the first Toyota to be built in the UK. Some 17,000 Carinas were built there until production halted in 1997 to make way for its replacement, the Toyota Avensis. Two decades on, Toyota GB is launching a competition to find the oldest Carina still on Britain's roads. The firm is using Twitter, Facebook and good old emailing to track down the oldest examples. Owners are being asked to email their name, address and as many details about their Carina to toyota.contact@tgb.toyota.co.uk. Owners of the oldest examples will be invited to tell their car's story and have it photographed, and will have the chance to win the use of a new Toyota Auris for a week. Meanwhile Toyota enthusiasts are being asked to spot the oldest Carinas either by posting pictures on Toyota GB's Facebook page, or by tweeting using the hashtag #firstGBToyota. Unsure of whether your Carina is a British one? The 17-character code on the vehicle's identification plate -- found under the bonnet, just below the windscreen wipers -- will help. If the code begins with an S, your's is a Burnaston-built vehicle, while J signifies imported Carinas. Related Articles Need car buying advice?

31667	Men's lacrosse looks to make playoff push Hawks need just one win in final two games to clinch playoff berth WATERLOO, Ont. (October 17, 2012) - With the season coming to a close the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks men's lacrosse team finds themselves in a position to make the playoffs for the first time since the rebirth of the program. With only two games remaining, the team finds themselves sitting in fourth place in the standings. As the top five teams from each division make the playoffs, the team is in a great position. However, the team is in a very tight battle with Toronto, McMaster, and Laurentian for the final two positions. Brock, Guelph and Western have all clinched playoff berths with their dominate performances. Laurier must win one of their remaining two games to find themselves in a position for the ever elusive post-season berth. This will be no easy task for the Hawks as many starting players have suffered significant injuries. Starting attackman George Jimas has missed most of the season following his appendectomy and is not likely to return until next season. Starting Long Pole Andrew Jenkins will miss Wednesday night's game versus Western as he is suffering from a separated shoulder. His return is questionable for the season's final game versus McMaster on Sunday. Other injuries include drawman Sean Fennell and Eric Beauregard who both suffer from lower body injuries. With these injuries the Hawks must certainly battle through adversity to achieve their goal of a post-season appearance. The coaching staff however, are still very optimistic that this is possible. With the team's first potential playoff berth a mere two games away, the Hawks could certainly benefit from the support of the entire student body. Come out and watch the Hawks fly past the Marauders this Sunday at the University Stadium. Admission is free. Game time starts at 7pm. 	News	News

There were four farm cadets who were in the final stages of interviewing for a job. The interviewer told them that he would ask each of them the same question, and whoever answered the question the best would be the one hired. All applicants agreed that this was fair, so the recruitment interviewer asked the first cadet the question, ?What is the fastest thing in the world?? The young man thought for a moment and replied, ?That would have to be a thought.? ?Why do you say that?? asked the interviewer. ?Well, a thought takes no time at all?it is in your mind in an instant, then gone again.? ?Ahh, very good. thank you,? replied the interviewer. Next the same question was posed to the next cadet, ?What is the fastest thing in the world?? The young man paused and replied, ?That would have to be a blink.? ?Why?? asked the interviewer. ?Because you don?t even think about a blink, it?s just a reflex. You do it in an instant.? The third young man was asked what the fastest thing in the world was, and after hesitating for a brief moment, he replied, ?I would have to say electricity. Why? Because my dad can flip a switch at the house, and immediately the light will go on down at the cowshed.? ?I see, very good,? replied the interviewer. Then, the last young man was asked, ?What is the fastest thing in the world?? ?That?s easy?? he replied, ?that would have to be diarrhoea!? Rather stunned, the interviewer asked, ?Why do you say that?? ?Well, last night after dinner, I was lying in my bed then suddenly I got the worst stomach cramps ever!

He also invited Colin, the only aborigine in the neighbourhood. He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns, oysters, from the BBQ and flirting. At the height of the party, the host said, 'I have a 15ft man-eating crocodile in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who has the balls to jump in.' The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash, everyone turned around and saw Colin in the pool fighting the croc, jabbing the croc in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, doing all kinds of stuff like head butts and chokeholds, biting the croc on the tail and flipping the croc through the air like some kind of Judo Instructor. The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Colin and the croc were screaming and raising hell? Finally Colin strangled the croc and let it float to the top like a dead goldfish. He then slowly climbed out of the pool. Everybody was just staring at him in disbelief. The host says, 'Well, Colin, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.' 'Nah, you're all right boss, I don't want it,' said Colin. The rich man said, 'Man, I have to give you something. You won the bet. How about half a million bucks then?' 'No thanks... I don't want it,' answered Colin. The host said, 'Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was amazing. How about a new Porsche and a Rolex and some stock options??

Alright as promised... *** Joan, a rather well-proportioned & near-sighted secretary, spent almost all of her vacation sunbathing on the roof of her hotel. She wore a bathing suit the first few days, but always removed her glasses for an even facial tan. After several days she decided that no one could see her way up there, so she slipped out of her suit for an overall tan. She'd hardly begun when she heard someone running up the stairs; she was lying on her stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear. ""Excuse me, miss,"" said the flustered little assistant manager of the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs. ""The hotel doesn't mind your sunbathing on the roof, but we would very much appreciate your wearing a bathing suit as you have for the past week."" ""What difference does it make?"" Joan asked rather calmly. ""No one can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel."" ""Not exactly,"" said the embarrassed little man. ""You're lying on the dining room skylight!"" Don't judge someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes... that way when you do judge them you're a mile away... and you have THEIR shoes! 'I didn't ask for any details', the solicitor interrupted. 'Just answer the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?' Paddy said, 'Well, I'd just got Bessie into da trailer and I was drivin' down da road.... ' The solicitor interrupted again and said,'Your Honour, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he was fine. Now several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question. ' By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Paddy's answer and said to the solicitor: 'I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favourite cow, Bessie'. Paddy thanked the Judge and proceeded. 'Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my fav'rit cow, into de trailer and was drivin' her down de road when this huge Eversweet truck and trailer came tundering tru a stop sign and hit me trailer right in da side. I was trown into one ditch and Bessie was trown into da udder. By Jaysus I was hurt, very bad like, and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moanin' and groanin'. I knew she was in terrible pain just by her groans. Shortly after da accident, a policeman on a motorbike turned up. He could hear Bessie moanin' and groanin' too, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Den da policeman came across de road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, 'How are you feelin'?' 'Now wot da fock would you say?'

20700	"Our house has had so many bugs since October, colds, vomitty and shitty bugs. The grand finale has been my boy getting Chicken Pox through nursery... which also meant us cancelling his Christening and party. Poor little bugger, he's not been that ill with it but he's scratching his back like a bear on the sofa arms and floor. Think he's over the worst of it now. You may recall stupid hippy friend of Mrs K's, who has bladder caaner. She had a small (almost said ""wee"" there but couldn't bring myself to pun that badly) tumour removed last year, but refused any treatment. She's instead been trying to cure it by drinking her own piss and aplying piss soaked bandages to herself. It's some hippy remedy she read about, or something. Unsurprisingly the cancer's back and has spread all over her bladder and tubes and things. It's not operable without removing her bladder entirely. So stupid hippy friend of Mrs K's is refusing chemo AGAIN. Reasoning this time is that chemo is that it's ""only 60% effective and is bad for your body"". Whereas cancer is like fucking Berrocha, clearly. The worst thing is she's a single mum and has a 7 year old daughter. Who's goign to be an orphan pretty bloody soon, at this rate. The internet has a lot to answer for. _________________ The very existence of flamethrowers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, ""You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done.""

She took every option available to her, which most likely gave her an extra 6 months, but looking back i'm not sure the added suffering was worth it.

A lot of people have a real misunderstanding about chemo, and think that it's 'one thing' that everyone has. Chemo regimes differ wildly, as do their impact on your general health and well-being. Some people undergo chemo and suffer not a great deal more than lowered energy levels, some end up with the chemo killing them before the cancer does. A good oncologist should really be able to explain what's going to happen to your quality of life whatever choice you make about treatment options. _________________ ApplePieOfDestiny wrote: If you want to play with the big boys, you've got to bring .... er .... big boy's toys.

You are right, chemo isn't a one size fits all solution. Part of the problem is that it isn't an exact science, they'll start light with a few drugs and see what happens, then adapt and increase if necessary. Plus with the added variables of different people reacting different ways to the mix of drugs, and difference cancers reacting in different ways, and it is all a bit of a crap shoot. The oncologist can give a rough idea, but it will only be rough. Also, they are predisposed to look on the bright side and give people hope, as in some ways that is more important for quality of life. Stage 1, 2 and 3 I would go for whatever treatment was offered. Stage 4 would be very dependant on survival rates and the type and location of the cancer, for me. One thing I would like is for a choice to go when I want and as painlessly as possible if I was in that situation, as the last few days of life for a cancer patient are utterly horrific for all concerned and I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy, but legally that isn't an option. Awful to hear of anyone suffering from cancer, but to not take any treatment and with a young child to take into considereation that's unreal. I'd say she's doing the child a favour. I assume I'm missing a subtlety here. _________________ The very existence of flamethrowers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, ""You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done.""

41886	Last night I joined the record breaking 70,584 supporters who packed out Wembley stadium to watch our Team GB women's football squad beat Brazil 1-0, top their group and book their place in the quarter finals of the 2012 Olympics. Having never been to see a live football match I didn't know quite what to expect but it blew all my expectations clean out of the water. Mexican waves stormed around the stadium, Team GB chants echoed all around and the whole place was swathed in a blanket of red, white and blue. The expectation and excitement was palpable and when the team came onto the pitch for the first time the whole stadium erupted. And within two minute of the first whistle we were off to a flying start, as Steph Houghton smashed the ball straight into the back of the net. The match was tense and exciting throughout, with Brazil getting plenty of chances, but Team GB dominated, perhaps partly thanks to their extra player - the crowd, who roared every time they got the ball. There were some hairy moments, thanks to some aggressive tackles from the Brazilians, all greeted with yellow cards, and boos from the stands. At one point Kelly Smith was even awarded a penalty after a dodgy tackle in the box, but it was saved, so the team continued in search of a second goal. But in the end they didn't need it. When the final whistle blew we had won the match 1-0 and topped our group - the volume went up, the flags fluttered and the stands celebrated a fantastic night for women's football. Soaking up the atmosphere, and watching our girls rocket their way to the quarter finals wasn't just a great night out, it was another reminder of how fantastic our home-grown female athletes are, and here at Zest we're really hopeful it will see a change in coverage and respect for women's sport.

27144	"Interview: Zak Waters September 3, 2012 Comments Off I have written about Los Angeles native Zak Waters a few times already here, but now that he has teamed up with boy wonder Madeon to bring us ' The City ' the time has come for us to learn more about him trough an interview. Definitely also check out his ' Walking On A Dream ' remix and the perfect summer anthem ' Skinny Dipping In The Deep End ', which I have personally played a lot, below. 01. Can you introduce yourself to the readers that haven't heard of you yet? Hello, hello! I'm Zak Waters. I am here. 02. How was your summer? Summer was great for me. We started it off nice and stressful with shooting the video for ""Skinny Dipping."" It was also tons of fun though. I mean whats not fun about spraying an entire jacuzzi full of people with champagne? But, try wrangling about 60 drunk extras...lesson learned. Other than the video, I've spent the majority of the summer in a studio, went to the beach once! Hey thats pretty good for someone like me. I'm really into working instead of doing fun things. It's a problem sometimes. I'm in the process of learning how to do that thing called ""relaxing?"" 03. Your top 3 favorite tracks of the moment are? No particular order. And I tend to obsess over songs, so some of these tracks are months old, but I just haven't been able to move on yet! 04. You teamed up with Madeon which resulted in the upcoming single 'The City'. How did you guys meet? I sure did! Long story short, a couple years ago now, my writing/producing partner Jarrad Kritzstein was working with a UK artist Rachel Furner (now Tich). Her A&R person had suggested that this 16 year old kid do a production of the song they wrote....So obviously we went and found this kid, we were like ""who the hell gets a 16 year old to produce a song, this is ridiculous..."" But then we LISTENED, and looked at each other in awe. We were blown away. So then we started talking to him, we emailed back and forth. Talked about what plug-ins and synths we were using etc... you know music geek stuff. We had kinda went back and forth for a while with the possibility of him doing a remix for me, and then me singing on one of his tracks. Then one day about a year ago, I received ""The city"" in my inbox asking me if I wanted to take a stab at writing to it. So i did. and now here we are!! 05. What inspired you when writing the lyrics? Well, the track was always called ""The City."" Hugo (Madeon) had this vision of some far away place. Hence the sound effects in the intro. He had told me he visualized someone opening the door to some magical hidden place. I loved that! So I stuck to that, and thought of ways to ground that idea with something that still felt mysterious but also real and relatable. 06. How was it to work with the only 18-year old French producer? Its amazing, age aside, I still think he is one of the best producers I've ever heard, let alone worked with. But even outside of music, he very intelligent and extremely well spoken. So there's never any trouble for us understanding each other even though French is his first language. I'm extremely proud and excited to be a part of his journey. 07. Are there any other producers who you would like to work with in the future? Tons! Always really wanted to work with Benny Blanco, Teddy Riley, Babyface, Justice, Daft Punk, deadmau5, Danger Mouse, Timberland.... to name a few off the top of my head...I'd like to somehow mix all of those production styles together! Thad be cray! 08. You also have a solo album coming up, what can you tell us about that? I Do I do! Well Jarrad (Kritzstein) and I have been working on it for the last 8 months or so, taking a little break to start shooting a music video for the next single and then getting back to it! Aiming for January release..next single will be out in october though! 09. What inspired you when writing the tracks for the album? Oh man...so much...I'd say when we started this record I really wanted to just do what I wanted. We were a little constrained when doing ""New Normal."" Being signed to a major still, we were always trying so hard to write a ""HIT."" This time around me and Jarrad both had grown so much as producers, and I had really absorbed a ton of music between finishing new normal and starting this new one that I really wanted to explore with this record. I'd say at the core, the place were these songs come from is the exact same. Still very early funk and soul inspired, but our palate of sounds has grown far beyond that. Before I wanted to stay away from anything too indie sounding or anything too R&B. Now its all fair game. That being said this record will have a wide range of vibes and be pretty eclectic. I know...scary.... but I'm very proud of and excited to share it!! "	Other	Opinion/Argumentation
12203	"White church weddings went up by four per cent, according to figures last month, after new rules allowed more couples to marry in a church of their choice rather than their closest parish church. When greatly increased fees for Church of England ceremonies were first suggested last year, CofE leaders said they would mean an end to 'Ryanair' weddings in which couples faced bills for an endless stream of extras. But the Ryanair principle has now crept in again, so a couple who pay the new fees will still face charges for extras they cannot avoid, such as the services of the verger and the bill for heating the church. The Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Right Reverend John Packer, told the Synod: 'There may be some modest increase in the overall fee income of the Church of England as a result of the proposed fee levels.' He added: 'Overall fee income probably contributes around 35million to running the Church of England, of which around 15million goes to the cost of stipends.' The stipend or salary recommended by the Church for a vicar is 22,180 a year. The new fee system, however, will charge couples for the services of clergy at a rate equivalent to 47,320 a year. The fee for a wedding will go up from 296 to 415, a price which includes the reading of the banns for three Sundays in advance of the ceremony and a certificate to show the banns have been read. The increase of just over 40 per cent is nearly 10 times the current rate of inflation according to the Consumer Prices Index, the measure favoured by the Treasury. The 415 includes the time of clergy, prices at 22.75 an hour, and a further 32.75 an hour for use of church buildings. But the verger and the heating bill come extra. Many couples will also wish to have an organist, likely to charge between 100 and 150, and sometimes double that if the wedding is being filmed. FEE CHANGES 'NOT INTENDED AS NEW INCOME STREAM', CLAIMS BISHOP A new fee system to cover weddings and funerals was designed last year, after lawyers discovered a glitch in ecclesiastical wedding law which meant the Church needed to pass new regulations through Parliament. A new fee system has now been approved at Westminster, but the scale of the fees was not made public until today. Bishop Packer, above , said: 'We really do need to make some progress. The figures have emerged out of a process of seeking to establish some reasonably consistent relationship to the actual costs incurred by the Church at diocesan and parish levels in providing authorised ministry. 'These figures are all arrived at in a similar way, with the same assumptions about costs underlying them. These assumptions include, broadly speaking, 22.75 an hour for authorized ministry, and 32.75 an hour for the use of buildings. The figures are based on a fair amount of discussion and research.' The bishop said: 'There may be some modest increase in the overall fee income of the Church of England as a result of the proposed fee levels. But there are so many variables that it is hard to be absolutely sure and in any event these proposals are not, and were never intended to be, a means of creating significant new income overall.' A choir may be another 100 or more, and a similar bill must be paid for bellringers. Flowers are a further cost on top. A funeral service will go up from 102 to 160, and a funeral including burial in the churchyard from 298 to 420. The price hikes come at a time when numbers of weddings in the country are at a historic low. Church weddings dropped to just 56,700 in 2009 as many couples chose the alternative of a civil ceremony in 'approved premises' such as a stately home. But numbers went up in 2010 to 58,700 as the reforms which allowed couples a much wider choice of churches took effect. Manchester Synod member the Reverend Canon Simon Killwick said the fee increases would turn couples against marriage in church. 'Such a fee increase seems to me hard to justify in times of financial austerity and even harder to justify in poor inner-city parishes, 'he said. 'The Church of England ought not to be seen to be making a big increase at this time and ought not to be making it difficult for the poor to access these services at a time when a simple ceremony can be had at a register office for around 100.' He warned that the Church of England could not rely on the power of vicars to waive fees in cases of hardship. 'That places the clergy in the invidious position of attempting to means test parishioners and people do talk. The poor don't want to be patronised by fees being waived, they want their church to be affordable to them. 'It would be a crying shame if poor people end up being married in register offices because the Church of England has priced them out of their parish church.' Share this article: Comments ( 125 ) May I set something straight. There is no charge for a christening (also called baptism) in the Church of England. Also , at the church of which I am vicar, couples have never paid more than the basic fee, plus - if they want it, charges for organist (100) , choir (60) and bells (60) The organists fee is part of his legitimate income? The choir fee is pocket money for our choir children (5) each, and any left over pays for music for the choir . The bellringers get 10 each, which in some cases hardly pays their travel expenses. If you had to buy these people in independently they would cost much more. I spend a total of about 2 days with couples preparing for marriage, and there is a great deal of work planning and coordinating. The church must also be heated, lit, insured and maintained for 365 days a year if it is to be there on the one day that couple want it, and this is not cheap. I would rather the basic fee hadn't been increased, but I don't think it is unreasonable. For many unchurched people who don't really believe in a personal G-d, it's amazing how many of them WANT to get married, have their kids baptised, or have their funerals, in church because it seems like the ""Right Thing To Do""! Even a humanist (read; Atheist) family wants our vicar to include Christian Themes in their relative's funeral for that reason. Saying that, there are Legal Fees that NEED to be paid for the church's services (e.g heat & light; the vicar's time/labour; Govt's cut). By and large, the other fees are entirely at the DISCRETION of the vicar and, for many, usually undercharged, or even waived in some cases (ancillary services - often given for FREE by churchgoers!). Everything else has to do with the fripperies and trappings the couple want to have, as well as the Reception or Wake afterwards. Families and couples need to have a careful and detailed talk with the individual vicar of their chosen church. Otherwise, the strap-line of this story is a bit OTT! There are several ordained Ministers of Religion who will marry you for free....but charge you 3.50 for the Wedding Certificate. If you are Roman Catholic, the Catholic Church used to ask you for a Donation towards costs. There are plenty of 'Free' churches around. This does not mean they will not ask for money but that they do not belong to a Grouping of Churches such as Church of England or Methodist and usually call themselves 'Evangelical'. They fix any charge or donation with you before hand. Of course if you are a regular Member of a Church, the Minister or Priest will know you and not charge you the usual rate. The Choir and Bellringers may also be free although they do appreciate a drink in the local afterwards. They aren;t charging for the sacrament of marriage, they are quite reasonably charging for the venue and the costs of running that venue for the wedding - a lot of commercials venues such as hotels and castles charge a whole lot more. However for funerals I feel local parishioners should have 'mates rates' and incomers charged somewhat more. The infants and children of parishioners should also be christened at a reasonable level, non church goers can fork out more. I'm not Christian btw I'm a Pagan, but why shouldn't the C of E make some money out of what are no longer religious events but purely social ones in a pretty setting So the price of a wedding now still costs less than the sculpted ice swan that turned up for one recent wedding I attended. Add in a small fee to pay for the choir, organist, bellringers, which comes to way less than say, the cost of buying a band in commercially for an event. Church wedding is very good value still. Just to be clear: clergy (even retired ones) don't get to keep the fee - its split between parish and diocesan costs - so the fees go towards the upkeep of buildings and subsidising others things. EG my church is running a homeless shelter this winter. We're funding that ourselves (no subsidy from government or council, though they have just asked us to provide extra places...) and the weddings we've done this year will help pay for it. Hatching, matching and despatching should be part and parcel of a vicar's/priests normal duties. Having to pay a priest to perform a wedding or christening or funeral is disgusting. Religion is a nonsense anyway - most churches are drab, draughty, miserably places at the best of times. Getting married in a bright, cheerful and warm hotel or other location is far pleasanter. If you don't believe in God why get married in a church, you are just making use of the building so you should pay for the privilege. Same goes for funerals if the deceased didn't believe in God why do the relatives go for a vicar to take the funeral service, because of what other people might say if they didn't or hoping the deceased may be sent on his way to eternal life. Simple if you don't believe find some other way and not the church! "	News	News
45867	The long haul I've been having the longest bout of creative constipation in a while.  Not inspired to write nor take photographs.  This can be a problem if you're a blogger.  Or sheer relief to some depending on your point of view . If the past is anything to go by this is a classic symptom of me being stuck in a comfort zone or overly distracted by other things more interesting or rewarding.  I fear that it this time it may be a little bit of both. The good news though is that I have finally relieved the kitchen garden of it's winter carpet of weeds, grasses and other infestations, all the result of a hell raising warm and wet winter party. My finger tips and nails may take weeks to heal from hours of scratching and scraping but the reward of seeing the garden ready for planting makes my heart swell. The chickens are deliriously happy too with the spoils of my excavation providing rich peckings for them.  The hard yards done I can treat myself with the construction of two new raised beds.  A mini extension to the garden for salads and strawberries and place to experiment seed raising on a larger scale. The kitchen has become less of a battle ground of late with the arrival of a new and rather special baking book . Or I should say books.  After weeks of grazing a wealth of gluten free, paleo, no sugar, guilt free and natural food blogs I finally bullet and invested in books that truly cover off the no wheat, low carb, no sugar requirements of our eating regime.  So I've been knocking out breads, cookies, cupcakes and biscotti that feel like the treats that baking goods are supposed to be.  With my baking confidence returning I finally feel that I can start some food blogging again and also feel more optimistic about keeping up with the new lifestyle for the long haul. I've settled my restless mind over recent weeks with a couple of books that I thoroughly recommend for others to read. Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel.   They really are as good as the hype and publicity.  It's been a long time that I've read books with such intricacies and flow that keep you turning the pages.  Except in my case I was listening to them both as audio books.  We have the real books and in time I shall enjoy them all over again and turning the pages for real.  I've just started reading The Corrections on my kindle which if is as good as Franzen's more recent novel Freedom I know I am in for another enjoyable read. As I looked out of the window seeking an inspired thought for this post the winds are pounding and the rain is pouring again.  Spring in New Zealand has acute meteorological schizophrenia. Two days glorious, one day grey and then comes the big hitter with enough misery to drive you indoors and around the fire.  And then the cycle starts all over again.  Although it happens every year it still feels like an injustice.  A good time though to knuckle down and sort the photographs out, do some editing and heaven forbid actually prepare some images for printing.

We're trying to eat our way through the winter crops to make room for the next garden residents -- a load of seedlings just bursting to get into the ground.

2659	"US President Barack Obama said the United States ""will not countenance"" Iran developing a nuclear weapon but claimed there was still time for Tehran to come to the negotiating table. President Obama, speaking at a news conference a day after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said there was a window of opportunity to settle the dispute with Iran over its nuclear programme diplomatically. ""We will not we will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon. My policy is not containment. My policy is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, because if they get a nuclear weapon that could trigger an arms race in the region, it would undermine our non-proliferation goals, it could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists. And we've been in close consultation with all our allies, including Israel, in moving this strategy forward. At this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity where this can still be resolved diplomatically,"" he said. Mr Obama said the announcement of six-power talks with Iran offered a diplomatic opportunity to defuse the crisis. He said the notion that the United States needed to make a choice in coming weeks or months was ""not borne out by facts."" Mr Netanyahu assured Mr Obama on Monday that the Jewish state had made no decision on attacking Iranian nuclear sites, sources close to talks in Washington said. He, however, gave no sign of backing away from the option of military strikes. ""Israel is a sovereign nation that has to make its own decisions about how best to preserve its security,"" Mr Obama said. Amid mounting speculation that Iran's nuclear sites could be attacked in coming months, the president appeared to point the finger at the Republican presidential candidates when he said that American politicians ""beating the drums of war"" had a responsibility to explain the costs and benefits of military action.

45232	"With many cycle commuters due to ride home in the dark this evening for the first time in months after the clocks went back at the weekend, a road safety charity has called on the government to adjust the UK's time zone to bring it forward by an hour in both winter and summer, which it claims would lead to a reduction in the number of road traffic casualties. According to the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), crashes are more likely to take place in the evening and it say that analysis of data from the Department for Transport (DfT) suggest that its proposed change to daylight hours could help prevent 80 deaths and more than 200 serious injuries each year due to fewer hours of darkness in the evening. It adds that the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured last November was 5 per cent higher than the monthly average for the year. IAM chief executive Simon Best commented: ""Making evenings lighter would save lives. While an extra hour of daylight would help to make the commute home much safer for all road users, children, cyclists and motorcyclists would benefit most."" ""We want to see a three-year trial of the new daylight system. If the trial period proves the new daylight hours have a positive effect on road safety, it is clear that it is the system we should keep. With convincing evidence of the potential benefits, it is only right that we pilot a new system."" During 2011, according to road.cc's analysis of data contained in the DfT's Reported Road Casualties Great Britain 2011 , published last month, some 437 cyclists were killed or seriously injured during the year between the hours of 7am and 9am. The peak two-hour period for cyclist casualties on weekdays, however, was between 5pm and 7pm, with 500 reported deaths or serious injuries, while there were 375 such incidents in the two hours immediately preceding that time, from 3pm to 5pm. However, the same report also shows a drop in the casualty rate for cyclists killed or seriously injured per billion kilometres travelled for November compared to October, with the winter months of January, February and December lower still. The casualty rate peaked in the period from April to September. Bringing the clocks forward by an hour throughout the year would also bring the UK into line with most of Western Europe, with Portugal and the Republic of Ireland the only EU Member States to share our time zone. I'm sure there are a lot of other measures which would improve road safety more than this, 20 mph speed limits, harsher penalties for motorists etc. This is just going to make it darker in the mornings. There is a reason we're not on CET: we're not in Central Europe. It's plausible that only more experienced cyclists continue to cycle through the cold.and dark months, so rate could be lower generally but still worse for these people when it's dark. I've no evidence for this though. Yes, the Spanish and Portuguese have one timezone for the mainland and a different one for the Canaries and Madiera. But the point is that there is no reason why a country should have only one timezone England could have CET, and if they want it, the Scots (and Welsh, and N Irish) could stick to the current arrangement. And I could cycle home in light. But if it was darker in the morning then the casualty rate would probably change again. We did try not moving the clocks back at some point in the past and it wasn't followed through with for whatever reason. Might be interesting to look back at the stats for that period. Whichever way you slice it there are only so many hours of daylight. Given the fact that people tend to be more in a rush in the morning and children/teenagers (generally the most vulnerable road users) have to go to school early and come back earlier than adults usually, the way it's done now is probably better. The only change I would like would be another hour of daylight in the evening in the summer months (say May to August) when it gets light very early in the morning, so have 2 changes a year instead of 1. This would put us in sync with most of the rest of Europe for a certain period at least. The stats for the last time we had double summer time showed that overall casualites went down everywhere - including in Scotland. The reason commonly cited for this is that although it was darker in the mornings - people were also less tired and more alert to danger, whereas when it's dark in the evenings they are more tired and less alert. I can remember double summertime - it was fantastic. It wasn't abandoned because it was unpopular or unsafe it went because the minority Labour Government of the day needed the support of the Scots Nats and that was a sop to try and get it. It was a real benefit to the vast majority of the population and these days you'd have to assume that the benefits to the tourism industry would far outweigh any potential losses incurred a small part of the farming industry. Tony - I agree completely. And now the Scots have devolution, and possibly will opt to go the whole hog and be a different country altogether, there is no reason to have 1 timezone from Dover to Orkney. Sorry to keep pointing this out. This gets brought up every year. Problem is, it is only the very south that 'benefits' anywhere north of Manchester and Northern Ireland will be plunged into darkness until late morning. This was experimented in the early seventies late sixties and nothing came out of it. It would mean more sleepy, distracted, rushing drivers around on the a.m. run and all for that extra hour in the evening. Also for the likes of myself - people starting work at 5 and 6 am would be travelling to work all the year round in the dark. IAM would be better pressing for a safer environment for all road users. Personally I don't think scrapping the current setup will make roads any safer. Tony, I think that 40 years on, our lifestyles are more hurried and pressured. School run then work etc. I may be wrong, but it's my observation that over the years that driving skills have become poor to say the least. I also remember the experiment except for me I had to travel to school in the dark. My primary school over those few years put a stop to us cycling to school I remember the experiment 40 years ago too. I grew up in Scotland and we had to put up with those dark school journeys. It is all very well to talk about changing what we have at present but I've never been convinced by the safety claims made by those wanting to change the system. Rather than messing around with time zones, why don't we just start and finish work an hour earlier, eg: 8 - 4 instead of 9 - 5? That way you still get lighter evenings for the ride home and we don't bugger everything up. And farmers can continue blocking up the back roads at whatever time of day they feel like... The simple answer to this is to tow Britain south until it is level with Portugal. We get a better climate and less extremes of light and dark at the height of summer and in the depths of winter. I like the idea in principle but I think there might be a few technical issues to be considered. Surely those issues could be overcome with the collective brainpower of road.cc? It would definitely be worth it. We could solve all the airport expansion issues too - no need for extra runways if everyone holidays in the UK's newly desirable climate. Why change it around when it works as it is. The accidents wont fall as its driver / rider error not the dark (although there are occasions of bad light causing accidents). Airport expansion - there's a good topic. Why, when we have brilliant airports in the north, manchester and newcastle to name 2, do we need more runways in the south. There was a survey done whereby something like 40% of people from manchester flew through heathrow due to the flights not flying from manchester. Simple, ge tthe airlines to relocate some flights and this takes the pressure off heathrow and no more runway needed. Jobs in the north would be created and the toffy nosed southerners would get their way. There is more than enough room for extra flights at both Newcastle and Manchester not to mention the liokes of L'pool and Glasgow. Anyway i have moved off topic a bit so i'll shut up now. Moving the clocks around doesn't make any difference to the fact that THERE'S LESS DAYLIGHT. It's winter time, it's what happens. Move them forwards, it's just pitch dark in the mornings instead. You can't create extra daylight! I used to work on a shift system (8am - 8.30pm on the days that I was working) so for about 9 months of the year I needed lights while riding to/from work - changing the clocks made no difference whatsoever. This same old drivel gets trotted out every year by one campaign or another. It's been put on hold now until 2014 anyway once the Scots have had their referendum on independence. It has been tried before, it didn't work then and won't work now. From a biological prospective it is also nonsense, but then when have motoring lobbyists ever bothered with inconvenient things like evidence or science. "	News	News
35013	"Microwaves ... Do you have one ? ...What do you use it for ? I have a small microwave which I have to say I rarely use . When I use it mostly it's just to heat a little bit of milk for some coffee of hot chocolate , or very occasionally to reward something  and that's about it ! I sometimes wonder if it's worth taking up the space on the shelf . When the children were small we had a larger microwave that we would use for making microwave meringues .. These were always a touch of magic that the children loved to see , we would put in this little blob of a fairly solid mix looking similar  a blob of fondant icing and after a very short while in the microwave out would come those pillows of light meringue ... Their faces were always full of amazement no matter how many times they saw this happen. Re: Microwaves ... Do you have one ? ...What do you use it for ? Yes, I couldn't live without my microwave.  Firstly, it's the best way to reheat left overs, especially soups and stews.  Even roast is better to reheat in a microwave because it stays moist unlike if you stick it back in the oven. I also steam veggies in microwave safe baggies, they come out perfectly.  I melt butter, warm up a cup of water for my tea, warm up my coffee if it's gone cold, and many people swear that it's the best way to steam fish but I haven't done that myself. It's also a good way to defrost in a hurry, but not meats!  I defrost soups and stews mostly. Re: Microwaves ... Do you have one ? ...What do you use it for ? It's a place to throw my car keys on top.... I use it for: warming leftovers (sometimes) melting butter And once in a blue moon......steam veg..like once or twice a year. same with hot dogs....I rarely buy them and when I do I usually but them on the stove in water Re: Microwaves ... Do you have one ? ...What do you use it for ? I use my microwave quite often, but mostly for defrosting warming up leftovers heating up milk melting butter I also cook milk rice in it when I am making a milk rice casserole. Since I have Jamie's 30-minute-meals I also use it to cook potatoes (never done that before!) when I've been working until late and still want oven roasted potatoes as a side. Apart from milk rice and potatoes I've never cooked anything else in the microwave. Oh, I made popcorn in those special microwave bags once or twice, funny, that! Re: Microwaves ... Do you have one ? ...What do you use it for ? I use mine for defrosting in emergencies (when I've forgotten to remove the food from the freezer early enough - which is becoming more frequent) but mainly for grilling as there is an electric grill element incorporated into the unit. I have never used it for cooking. Edit: I tell a lie - I use it for ""starting"" jacket potatoes (1.5 mins per potato) prior to putting them in the oven. "	Forum	Opinion/Argumentation
21968	This paper reports findings from a study into how marketing academics and MBA students view segmentation. The research indicates that both respondent groups view segmentation as being more valuable in helping to understand customers than improving business performance. For MBA students there appears to be no relationship between their reported marketing knowledge and the value attributed to using market segmentation. The findings for academics suggest inconsistencies in how they interpret the value of segmentation and appraise the usefulness of analytical and evaluation approaches.

37358	"Pasquale Buzzelli, 34, was on the 22nd floor when the North Tower collapsed after an American Airlines plane was flown into it A structural engineer, who became a legend after 'surfing' down a wave of falling debris during 9/11, has spoken about his miracle survival and how having children has helped him rebuild his life. Pasquale Buzzelli, 43, who working as a structural engineer for the Manhattan Port Authority, was one of the last to evacuate the North Tower as it began to collapse. He claims that he had reached the 22 nd floor when the building collapsed beneath him and he was carried down through a blizzard of debris to the seventh floor, where he was rescued by firefighters. At the time his wife Louise was pregnant with their first child Hope, now ten, and they have since had a second daughter Mia, seven. He suffered survivor's guilt for years afterwards but has finally come to terms with the grief thanks to his family. Mr Buzzeli said: 'Time heals all wounds and you start to experience joy,' he said. 'With the birth of Mia I was finally able to experience those feelings and not feel guilt. In that sense I've realized that the best way to honour those that didn't make it, is to be the best person that I can be.' His story is told in the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 documentary 9/11 The Miracle Survivor which is screened next week on the 11 th anniversary of the disaster. Holding the battered briefcase he was carrying that day, he said: ' I haven't opened this up in quite a few years. I came across it in my basement a couple of years after 9/11. I don't even keep it in the house as it's a constant reminder of that day. Its basically rode down the building with me and its battered and torn and just a reminder of how lucky I was to survive.' His story of survival has divided experts. Shiya Ribowsky, who led the investigation into 9/11, said: 'You know I have a healthy scepticism which is in no way a reflection on this man's character. 'In forensics there are certain statistics about the likelihood of surviving a fall and once you get above five stories then statistics are pretty grim. So you're talking about an exceptional situation. You're talking the wings of angels here.' Time heals all wounds: Pasquale and Louise with their two young daughters Hope, ten, right, and Mia, seven The battered briefcase that fell 15 stories with Buzzelli acts as a constant reminder of the terror that unfolded on the day However Professor Thomas Eager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has studied the physics of the collapse and believes that the hurricane force wind pushed him down 15 stories. 'His description of a rollercoaster clinched it for me in believing the whole thing,' he said. Mr Buzzelli, who now works in emergency planning for the Port Authority, was in an elevator on his way up to his office the 64 th floor of the North Tower, when the first plane struck at 8.46am. But instead of evacuating the building, he felt a duty to remain at his desk. He and his colleagues at the Port Authority, were watching the news when the second plane hit. They finally began to exit at Stairway B, reaching the 22 nd floor at 10.28am when the tower began to collapse. Wife Louise Buzzelli thought she was never going to see her husband alive again after watching the North Tower collapse on TV Wedding bells: Buzzelli managed to survive the traumas of 9/11 and go on to have two girls with wife Louise The couple also added a second daughter Mia to the family 'I thought something heavy is falling through the stairs or part of the building is collapsing and falling through,' he said. 'I just dove into the stairwell, went into a foetal position, covered my face and hands and buried myself as close to the wall as possible to protect myself from anything falling through. 'It was then that I felt the wall that I was next to and the base of the floor crack open and give way. That's when I knew that that was it: the entire building was going. I said to myself: ""My God I can't believe this is. I'm going to die. I thought of my wife, my unborn child.' Pasquale's wife Louise, who was seven months pregnant with their oldest daughter Hope, now ten -- they have a second daughter Mia, six -- watched in horror as the tower collapsed. 'I knew it was over then at that point,' she said. 'I couldn't watch anymore. I couldn't believe that I was there watching this, carrying our first baby. I was a widow and I watched it and there was nothing I could do.' The debris that carried Buzzelli down to the seventh floor eventually ended up among this mess But, incredibly, Pasquale began to freefall down the stairwell until he landed on the seventh floor. He regained consciousness three hours later, surrounded by twisted metal, with a badly injured ankle. 'I was totally numb,' he said. 'I felt nothing at all. I just opened my eyes and saw blue sky.  I really thought I was dead until I started to cough and I started to feel pain in my leg. At that point I started calling out: ""Help. Help."" Back at Ground Zero, firefighters Mike Lyons and Mike Moribito, who disobeyed orders to search the wreckage, found Pasquale as he was beginning to fear he would be burnt alive. 'He looked like he was in a castle,' said Mike Moribito. 'He was sitting there in broad daylight like a king on top of a hill. I can remember it as clear as day.' Within hours Paquale was in an ambulance on his way to hospital. His first thought was to call his wife Louise. The South Tower burst into flames after being hit at 9:03am on September 11 Where to start? Overwhelmed firefighters were faced with the gruelling task of pulling out survivors from the wreckage ' I picked up the phone and said: ""Hello?"" she said. 'I heard his voice and he said: ""Louise it's me."" And I said: ""Oh my god Pascale. It's you.""  And everyone in the house just screamed. However Pasquale began to suffer from survivors' guilt and it was only a reunion with Mike Lyons, who was also suffered traumatic stress disorder, that brought him out of his depression. Mike's girlfriend Kathryn traced Pasquale and they now meet regularly. 'Time heals all wounds and you start to experience joy,' he said. 'With the birth of Mia I was finally able to experience those feelings and not feel guilt. In that sense I've realized that the best way to honour those that didn't make it, is tot be the best person that I can be.' 9/11 The Miracle Survivor is screened on Channel 4 at 10pm on Monday September 10 and 11.10pm the following night. An e-book We All Fall Down: The True Story of the 9/11 Surfer by Pasquale and Louise Buzzelli is published on Amazon on September 8.

Andrea Booher and Michael Rieger, photographers for FEMA spend over 8 weeks capturing the stories of ground zero and created a two photo CD set of image that were sent to all they photographed with the condition they copy and share images. I remembrance this very vaguely as I was young at the time. It only really hit me just what a tragedy it was a few years ago. I am now 20 and I am visiting New York next year to pay my respects. I can't even begin to imagine what it was like for the victims, families and people of New York and of course the brave heroes that played their part on that day. Tragedies like this make me feel so silly about getting angry or upset about the little things in life. As long as a plane isn't hitting the office I am a happy lady. The anger I have for the people that did this is undescribable. My hearts are with the people that sadly passed away. Sleep well xxxxx watch the Zeitgeist on Netflix. this was a set up, they tried to bomb the towers years earlier but didn't use enough explosives. i remember seeing people hanging out the windows and jumping to avoid burning to death. i remember hearing dispatch calls on myspace that people posted that I still remember to this day and they send chills down my spine. u could die any day at any age, and you have no say in the matter. luck had nothing to do with this. just destiny. the world is a fup. To those who don't believe this really happened or don't believe it should still effects some of us, I'm very saddened. I am the Red Cross volunteer who not only lost many friends that day, I volunteered tirelessly for months afterwards to help survivors and victim's families & friends. I also helped bring Pasquale together with his FDNY rescuers. Pasquale & Louise Buzzelli have dealt with some really difficult times in the past 11 years & just want this story to be put in the books, not only to let people know about ONE positive story from that awful day, give credit to the real heroes who, quite frankly didn't want to be found & get extra attention, but to also keep this day from sliding too far back into people's minds where it may be forgotten. I was there at the Family Assistance Center where people from all over the world came to deal with their loss. Let it not be forgotten that these terrorist attached The WOLRLD Trade Center....NOT just the United States. -Kathryn Carey So much respect for the survivors and victims of 9/11... The world should never forget them... God,, i remember being 10 years old and coming home from school and seeing the second plane hit the tower. I was gobsmacked. I didnt know any of these people but i do think of them every year, and their families. My country lost 67 victims, We all think of them too, we remember! May they all RIP!

41497	"Join the ""urban chicken movement"" and raise your own backyard flock. Chickens are both fun and useful to keep. Don't expect to keep a breeding flock with noisy roosters, but your hens will earn their keep and provide enjoyment by laying eggs for you. Chickens can provide you with healthy, home grown eggs and meat, quality nitrogen-rich fertilizer, pest control and companionship. Perhaps surprisingly, a reasonable number of chickens can adapt very well to the constraints of an urban environment; indeed, it's even possible to keep chickens indoors through the use of diapers. Here's your guide to keeping chickens in the city. Check local laws and regulations . It may be illegal for you to own chickens in your city location, so start out by calling the local animal control office or your local municipality and asking what the laws are in your area. More and more ordinances are available online as well, so it's worth doing a search. Since roosters are perceived as noisy, they usually tend to fall under your city's noise or nuisance ordinances. While hens are normally very quiet, they may still be subject to nuisance ordinances. Check the city code before you get your birds and become attached to them! Some cities limit the number of chickens you can have on a given amount of land. In areas that were recently rural or have a strong farming culture, no law or license may be required to keep chickens. If chickens are illegal in your area all is not lost. Many people have managed to get pro-chicken ordinances passed, such as Madison, WI and Ann Arbor MI. However, you may need to be prepared to practice some activism in order to lobby your local authorities. 2 Research the breed and number of chickens you want to keep before you buy them ! There are several ways to choose the chicken breed, such as for their egg-laying prowess, their meat potential or just because they're pretty (sometimes all three reasons coincide). Be aware that many breeds also come in ""bantam"" size (like ""toy"" breeds for dog) that are roughly a quarter of the size of large breeds. The Buff Orpington makes a good choice for beginners and comes in both large and bantam sizes. Some friendly layers like Rhode Island Reds or Barred Plymouth Rocks are always a good choice. They are both meat and laying birds and they tend to be easy birds to keep, since they have a very mild temper. Another popular breed are Cochin bantams. These are good layers, are very sweet and make great pets. For beginners, dual purpose breeds are probably a sound first choice. There is a ton of information available on the hundreds of breeds of chickens. Surf online to look for chicken breeds, urban chicken, and city chicken just to start with. There are many online forums comprised of your fellow chicken owners, and they are a great resource for advice, chicks, adults birds and supplies. Some hatcheries also have online forums. 3 Visit other urban dwellers who keep chickens in their backyard and see what they're doing . Ask them for advice and suggestions. If you're the only person you know who is interested in doing this, visit the closest farmer who keeps chickens (especially if you've never had chickens before) and watch and learn. Pay a visit to your local farmers market , see who's selling fresh eggs, and start up a conversation! 4 Build your chickens a good coop out of strong materials. Build your chickens a good coop out of strong materials . The coop is a place where the chickens will spend the night, lay eggs, and get out of the bad weather. There are many different types of coops. If you're handy, you can easily build one using a design you find on the Internet, or something you already have lying around. There are many different types of successful chicken coops that imaginative people have created, made from things as strange as an old pickup truck bed cap to a dog house . The key is to make your coop a safe place for the chickens to lay their eggs and sleep. A rule of thumb is 4 square feet inside the coop per chicken (2 square feet per bantam) and 10 square feet of outdoor space (8 square feet per bantam). The coop should have good air flow and a low roost for your chickens to sleep. Good ventilation is crucial but ensure that there are no drafts. Be aware that hens create a lot of moisture, including high levels of ammonia and carbon dioxide which must be removed regularly, as well as ensuring these elements are vented out. Use removable perches; this is so that they can be taken out and disinfected regularly to kill off mites and other parasites. Build nest/laying boxes where your chickens can cozy up and lay their eggs. The box should be large enough to hold a hen (around 12 inches/30cm square) and include a small lip at the front to help stop eggs from rolling out once laid. A little bit of straw, sawdust or pine needles (not hay as it's not absorbent enough) to make litter for the nest goes a long way. You only need one nest box per four hens. Keep the boxes dark. If you build laying boxes that can be accessed from outside as well as in, you won't need to go inside every time to collect the eggs. The floor should be lined with untreated pine wood chips (cedar can be toxic to chickens), sawdust, straw or pine needles and cleaned once a week. You can use dropping boards to catch droppings under perches; these are easier to remove and clean. Litter collected from the hen house can be turned into great compost for your garden! Prepare adequately for your chickens for the whole year. They will need shade in the summer and heat in the winter . If you live where there are cold winters you may need to set up a heat lamp in the coop or a water heater and make sure you have chosen a cold-hardy breed of chicken. Protect against burrowing vermin such as rats and mice by burying about 6 inches (15cm) of the fencing wire below ground level and curling it outwards. Then when pests try to dig under the wire to get in your coop, they run into the wire instead. Predators are very patient and have all night to get themselves a good chicken dinner, and chickens sleep very soundly. Check the finished coop carefully for dangers such as protruding wires and nails. Chickens are very curious and it's cheaper to prevent accidents than it is to take them to the vet. 5 Give your chickens room to roam . If you have a safely fenced yard or an off-street area, let them wander freely during the day. If you give them a good spot to get out of the weather and up off the ground, they usually won't go very far from it. Often chickens prefer not to go anywhere they can't see their coop from. If you can't let them roam free, try making a little run for them out of hardware cloth (strong, welded wire fencing that has small, square openings -- -- most hardware stores have it by the roll), or if you have to, you can keep them in the coop with a small run attached to it. Don't use chicken wire, as it is way too flimsy and is easily torn into by predators such as dogs, and even humans. Spend a little extra money on good fencing materials and save yourself the heartbreak of finding your birds torn to shreds one day. 6 Purchase food for your chickens before they arrive . Feed supply stores are a good source as well as the Internet . You should have a bag of pelleted poultry feed (for large breeds) or crumble (for bantam breeds). Be aware that the health of the eggs is determined by the health of the feed; for example, protein-rich eggs come from protein-rich feed, while a hen intended for eating will put on weight eating a good balance of protein and carbohydrates. A laying hen needs to eat around 100g of feed each day. Put the feed in a covered feeder and replace it regularly, as it does go stale. Allowed to roam free, chickens are effective weed eaters and insect control -- -- set them loose in your veggie patch. Fresh and cracked corn is a favorite as well as tomatoes, apples and anything baked. You can try growing your own corn, wheat or barley to feed to chickens; all are good sources of protein, although corn is lower in protein than the other crops. Chickens love table scraps. A good rule of thumb: if it's healthy for you, it's usually healthy for your chickens (with the exceptions noted next). However, only feed as many table scraps as the chickens eat within a quarter hour; any more than this and they'll neglect the healthy balanced feed they should be eating. Steer clear of giving your chickens onions and garlic, as it can flavor the eggs. Also, chocolate, raw potatoes, and avocados are toxic to birds and your chickens should never eat any of these food items. Also, never let your chickens eat damp feed; it may have grown molds or toxins which can kill them. Chickens should have access to grit. This is held in their gizzard and helps grind down coarse grain. Use common sense and keep pesticides, antifreeze and other chemicals out of your birds' reach. Clean up uneaten food before it spoils and stinks up their home. 7 Find your chickens. Find your chickens . There are many ways of finding local chicken farmers. Ask around at farmers markets , health food stores and feed supply stores. Check the classifieds for a livestock section. The other option is to purchase your chickens online. Your county fair, 4H Clubs, county agriculture extension service, etc., all are good starting points. You can even buy fertile eggs to incubate and hatch on your own! Hatching your own chicks is an amazing experience, especially for kids. If you decide to do this, be well prepared and do your research -- -- it's fairly easy but you need to be prepared for those little balls of fluff. 8 Keep everything clean . Once every week or two (depending on how many chickens you have in how little space), clean out the coop, wipe down the perches, and scrub down their feeders. If the hens are laying, thoroughly clean their nest boxes, especially if an egg cracked at one point. Keeping their environment clean will reduce the risk of disease and parasites and it'll also keep your neighbors from complaining. 9 Watch your chickens . Check the feed and water every day. Observe them regularly and look for changes in behavior and habits that will alert you to ways you can improve their habitat: Are they eating their food and drinking their water? Always make sure the food and water are fresh, cool, and clean. Are they huddling together in a particular spot? It might be too cold for them, or there could be a draft. Are they breathing heavily? Check that they have enough shade to find a spot where they can cool off. Are they losing feathers? The proverbial ""pecking order"" may be in effect. If any of the hens are bleeding, consider separating the victim until the hen has healed, as other chickens will continue to peck at the wound. Are they all there? Count your chickens every day, especially if you have more than ten. Find an avian (bird) vet before you need one. 2AM Sunday morning is no time to be stuck running around trying to find someone to treat your chicken! (However, this is only important if you have show quality chickens. Find the local livestock veterinarian for mass problems. Otherwise, chickens take care of themselves pretty well if they have enough food, water, and space.) Find a ""chicken sitter"" if you ever plan on being away from your home for more than a day. Chickens need to be tended to at least twice a day (to let them out of the coop or put them in, to check their food and water, etc.).If you're not around to do it, you need to get in touch with someone who's responsible and comfortable with this task. Buy a book on keeping chickens for reference. You'll find yourself referring to it frequently at the beginning. Over time, you'll find yourself updating it! Tell your neighbors what you're doing. They're less likely to get upset over a wandering chicken in their yard every once in a while if they know where it came from. Better yet, turn them into allies by giving them free eggs! You will likely end up with more eggs than you will know what to do with. Protect the outdoor run from hawks or other predatory birds by draping bird netting over it and tying it down. Bird netting is very cheap and, without it, you may be inviting hawks over for a daily feast. If there is no one in your area to buy chicks from, try mail ordering them. Keep in mind, you may have to order quite a few, but this will allow you to order just hens and you don't need a rooster for good eggs! Try to keep your chicken hobby as cute and clean as possible. No one likes living next to an ugly, smelly mess. By ordering plans to build a cute ""city friendly"" coop or purchasing a ready-made one, you fend off a lot of problems before you begin. Check online for plants in your yard that may be toxic, as chickens love to eat greenery and your garden is 'on the menu'! It follows that you should never use pesticide spray on or around plants that chickens may eat, and never use slug and snail killer pellets as they will kill your birds. Chickens naturally scratch and dig in the dirt with much gusto, so don't expect them to steer clear of your prize-winning petunia patch. If you don't want them to eat it and/or dig it up, fence it off. Be careful what you use to clean the chicken coop with; ensure that it is non-toxic. Also, when cleaning, consider wearing a respiratory mask to protect you from any airborne parasites, especially if you are sickly or liable to respiratory illnesses. Always wear gloves when cleaning out bird droppings. Roosters are loud! All male chickens love to crow and they do it in the morning, noon, night and every chance they get in-between. Keep that in mind if you have close neighbors. Hens, on the other hand, are not as noisy, but they do cackle loudly here and there. Chickens can carry diseases just like any other outdoor animal, so if you have very small children, make sure you monitor their contact. Tell them to wash their hands after petting them, and never kiss a chicken. Educate yourself on chicken health, including common diseases and parasites, many of which can be carried in by wild birds. Consider what you will do with unwanted birds. If you're hatching your own chickens, about half of them will be roosters. They can't be kept together because they'll kill each other and harm the hens as well. Likewise, if your main reason for keeping chickens is for the eggs, remember that chickens can live 8-10 years but only have a productive life (one egg every 1.5 days) of about 2-3 years. It's not easy to find homes for roosters and unproductive chickens, and usually your only option is to sell them for meat. However, keeping older chickens is often an option. They don't eat quite as much, but still produce delicious eggs. The roosters make good chicken jerky if you're ambitious. Be aware that rooster meat is pretty tough and would rarely make something like fried chicken taste good.

21659	"Theory is a group of ideas meant to explain a certain topic, such as a single or collection of fact(s), event(s), or phenomen(a)(on). Typically, a theory is developed through the use of contemplative and rational forms of abstract and generalized thinking. Furthermore, a theory is often based on general principles that are independent of the thing being explained. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word has its roots in ancient Greek , but in modern use it has taken on several different related meanings. A theory is not the same as a hypothesis . A theory provides an explanatory framework for some observation, and from the assumptions of the explanation follows a number of possible hypotheses that can be tested in order to provide support for, or challenge, the theory. Someone who develops theories is called a theorist. One modern group of meanings emphasizes the interpretative, abstracting, and generalizing nature of theory. For example in the arts and philosophy , the term ""theoretical"" may be used to describe ideas and empirical phenomena which are not easily measurable. Theory abstracts. It draws away from the particular and empirical. By extension of the philosophical meaning, "" theoria "" is a word still used in theological contexts to mean viewing through contemplation — speculating about meanings that transcend measurement. However, by contrast to theoria, theory is based on the act of viewing analytically and generalizing contextually. It is thus based upon a process of abstraction. That is, theory involves stepping back, or abstracting, from that which one is viewing. [ 1 ] A theory can be "" normative (or prescriptive), [ 2 ] meaning a postulation about what ought to be. It provides ""goals, norms, and standards"". [ 3 ] A theory can be a body of knowledge , which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge. [ 4 ] As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to ""practice"" (from Greek praxis , πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ""doing"", which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself. A classical example of the distinction between ""theoretical"" and ""practical"" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked. [ 5 ] In modern science , the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories , a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature , made in a way consistent with scientific method , and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science . Such theories are described in such a way that any scientist in the field is in a position to understand and either provide empirical support ("" verify "") or empirically contradict ("" falsify "") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, [ 6 ] in contrast to more common uses of the word ""theory"" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which is better defined by the word 'hypothesis'). [ 7 ] Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses , which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and scientific laws , which are descriptive accounts of how nature will behave under certain conditions. [ 8 ] The English word theory was derived from a technical term in philosophy in Ancient Greek . As an everyday word, theoria , θεωρία , meant ""a looking at, viewing, beholding"", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to contemplative or speculative understandings of natural things , such as those of natural philosophers , as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans. [ 9 ] The word has been in use in English since at least the late 16th century. [ 10 ] Modern uses of the word ""theory"" are derived from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea that a theory is a thoughtful and rational explanation of the general nature of things. Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word θεωρία apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the Greek language . In the book From Religion to Philosophy , Francis Cornford suggests that the Orphics used the word ""theory"" to mean 'passionate sympathetic contemplation'. [ 11 ] Pythagoras changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires in order to enable the intellect to function at the higher plane of theory. Thus it was Pythagoras who gave the word ""theory"" the specific meaning which leads to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory as uninvolved, neutral thinking, and practice. [ 12 ] In Aristotle's terminology, as has already been mentioned above, theory is contrasted with praxis or practice, which remains the case today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things which humans do not move or change, such as nature , so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, praxis involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement which involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of praxis or doing. [ 13 ] Theories are analytical tools for understanding , explaining , and making predictions about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the arts and sciences . A formal theory is syntactic in nature and is only meaningful when given a semantic component by applying it to some content (i.e. facts and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in natural language , but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic . Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of rational thought or logic . Theory is constructed of a set of sentences which consist entirely of true statements about the subject matter under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as ""He is a terrible person"" cannot be judged to be true or false without reference to some interpretation of who ""He"" is and for that matter what a ""terrible person"" is under the theory. [ 14 ] Sometimes two theories have exactly the same explanatory power because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable, and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference. The form of theories is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in model theory . When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are closed under application of certain procedures called rules of inference . A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A theorem is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are abstractions of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include arithmetic (abstracting concepts of number), geometry (concepts of space), and probability (concepts of randomness and likelihood). Gödel's incompleteness theorem shows that no consistent, recursively enumerable theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of natural numbers can be expressed, can include all true statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge. A theory is underdetermined (also called indeterminacy of data to theory ) if, given the available evidence cited to support the theory, there is a rival theory which is inconsistent with it that is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an epistemological issue about the relation of evidence to conclusions. If there is a new theory which is better at explaining and predicting phenomena than an older theory (i.e. it has more explanatory power ), we are justified in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an intertheoretic reduction because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ""sound"", ""light"" and ""heat"" have today been reduced to ""wave compressions and rarefactions"", ""electromagnetic waves"", and ""molecular kinetic energy"", respectively. These terms which are identified with each other are called intertheoretic identities. When an old theory and a new one are parallel in this way, we can conclude that we are describing the same reality, only more completely. In cases where a new theory uses new terms which do not reduce to terms of an older one, but rather replace them entirely because they are actually a misrepresentation it is called an intertheoretic elimination. For instance, the obsolete scientific theory that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of caloric fluid was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that phlogiston is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen. Theories are distinct from theorems . Theorems are derived deductively from objections according to a formal system of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step in testing or applying a theory in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the objections. Theories are abstract and conceptual, and to this end they are always considered true. They are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are ' rigorously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of Classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic lengthscales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light. ""Sometimes a hypothesis never reaches the point of being considered a theory because the answer is not found to derive its assertions analytically or not applied empirically."" [ citation needed ] Theories whose subject matter consists not in empirical data, but rather in ideas are in the realm of philosophical theories as contrasted with scientific theories . At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through empirical observation . Fields of study are sometimes named ""theory"" because their basis is some initial set of objections describing the field's approach to a subject matter. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include set theory and number theory ; however literary theory , critical theory , and music theory are also of the same form. One form of philosophical theory is a metatheory or meta-theory . A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory. In other words it is a theory about a theory. Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems . In science, the term ""theory"" refers to ""a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment ."" [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources. (See characteristics of scientific theories .) The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing disease . The formal scientific definition of ""theory"" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed. [ 17 ] A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not ""guesses"" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than ""just a theory."" It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact. [ 16 ] Note that the term theory would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even scientific models. In the semantic view of theories , which has largely replaced the received view, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] theories are viewed as scientific models . A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a ""model of reality""), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models which fulfill the necessary criteria. (See Theories as models for further discussion.) In physics the term theory is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic postulates (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is classical electromagnetism , which encompasses results derived from gauge symmetry (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called Maxwell's equations . The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed ""laws of electromagnetism"", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered to be adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested. Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be unfeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally with the term ""theoretical."" These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision or rejection of the theory. ^ The word ""theory"" was used in Greek philosophy , for example, that of Plato . It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for θεωρός ""spectator"", θέα thea ""a view"" + ὁρᾶν horan ""to see"", literally ""looking at a show"". See for example dictionary entries at Perseus website . ^ The LSJ cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the Metaphysics and involving the definition of natural science : 11.1064a17 , ""it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)"" and 6.1025b25 , ""Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science"". So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical - or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change. "	Information/Explanation	Information/Explanation
19125	The defendants wrestled with the owner for possession of a handbag. They ran off without the bag, but they had caused her lose possession this was an appropriation, therefore a theft had occurred Actus reus Immediately before or at the Time of Stealing. Theft is a continuing offence. But, courts are flexible. To interpret this literally would have a limiting effect on the scope of the section. Undoubtedly bank robbers who threaten people with force to make good their 'get a way' use force 'afterwards', but are still robbers -- the theft is continuing. Force was used to stop a woman raising the alarm while her jewellery box was being stolen. A substantial part of the force took place when the box was in the thieves' possession. Therefore, violence may come after the act of theft. Stopped leaving an off-licence by shopkeeper, assaulted him to escape. Hale applied, Gomez not relevant. Guilty And in order to do so. Theft from a disabled victim after a fight would not be robbery Actus reus Uses force on any person or Puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being Then and there subjected to force. There must be force (not violence, nor necessarily an assault) More is needed than to take the property from a passive victim as in snatching a handbag from an unsuspecting victim. More is needing than the force used to pick a pocket. But amount of force can be quiet slight, e.g. a nudge causing V to lose balance. The force must be against a person so this could not include a dog. Applying force to the property being taken (the shopping bag in the case of Clouden) is applying force to the person who is resisting. Resisting or unresisting victim The distinction between a victim who resisted having his property taken (for example snatching a handbag) used to be important, but it is not now, it is up to the jury to decide if the 'snatching' amounts to force. Snatching of property, such as a handbag from an unresisting owner would constitute force (Clouden), despite the CLRC expressed belief to the contrary. Blind victim? Need not be aware of force, requirement includes seeking to put V in fear 	Legal	Legal

18990	"University students hit back in St Paul's parking egg wars STUDENTS have hit back at Cheltenham residents who have been 'targeting them' for parking in their road. Tyres have been slashed and eggs have been thrown at cars in Manser Street, which have been left by young people studying at the nearby University of Gloucestershire campus. Gloucestershire Constabulary Kate Wright, who is working towards a PGCE, returned to her Mitsubishi Colt last Tuesday to find it had been vandalised. She claims members of the neighbourhood are creating a culture of intimidation to scare off anybody using their streets to park. And the 26-year-old insisted that she had not broken any laws by using the spot to leave her vehicle. ""I was very angry and couldn't believe someone would do something like this,"" said Kate, who lives in Woodmancote and chose to stay in the county to study at University of Gloucestershire. ""When I parked there last Monday, there was a note left on my car which was impossible to read and I wondered what it said. I came back the next day to find eggs smashed all over the car and my tyres slashed. ""I have lived in Cheltenham all my life and so I know the area well. ""It just seems completely stupid when they have the least amount of cars in that street. ""I thought at the time it was surprising no cars were parked along there but obviously they have scared everyone off. ""When I picked up the car the day before, there were people waiting around and it felt very intimidating. ""Fortunately I was with a friend and we just got out of there as quickly as we could but they have to remember that this is my community too. ""How dare they think they have a right to take the law into their own hands?"" Kate had to spend 108 to replace her tyres. She has now brought a parking permit for the university car park - setting her back a further 45. ""It has cost me a lot of money which I cannot claim back on the insurance,"" she said. ""It doesn't seem like much but, as a student, I'm having to pay my tuition fees as well and it all adds up. ""I am working hard every day, from 9am to 5pm, and this is the last thing I want to deal with."" Residents claimed St Paul's had been the scene of several angry clashes between students and homeowners last week. Detectives said they were aware of the tensions in the neighbourhood and were still hunting for the culprits behind the attacks. They are urging anyone with information to contact them on 101 quoting incident 166 of September 18. 18 Comments ""SInce they introduced resident parking permits in St Lukes, along with meters for non-residents, and allowing permit holders to park in all and any spaces, I've always found a place to park my van. Before the permits were introduced it was a struggle. I prefer to pay the 70 ish per year for a permit and pretty much guarantee a space near my house than the old system... Even in metered spaces, I can park my van and they're more often empty than not during the day and mostly only used by permit holders in the evening... can't imagine Students wanting a yearly permit at around 70 instead of campus one at 45...?"" ""I would not encourage Andrew Landsley or anyone else to pin their hopes on a parking review. This happened in the Suffolks area of Cheltenham, and has made parking and traffic there much more difficult - this took place despite the majority not being in favour of the proposals. Lessons learnt need to include a full consultation, proper neighbourhood participation, and the politicians to listen!"" ""I'd just like to add that in this thread @Matt1006, @eyeopener, @chrisgump2011, @whiteangeluk and @localyoungman have made some of the most articulate and informed arguments I've ever seen on the TiG board! I find it genuinely encouraging for our area that people care so much, are constructive and willing to volunteer their opinions on a public forum. I would also like to offer you a personal guarantee that I will bring your comments directly to the attention of Stephen Marston (vice-chancellor of UoG) when I meet with him tomorrow afternoon to discuss the University's responsibility within our community. I will also be presenting the common sense solutions that have come to me via some of you on this board, personal email or at recent residents meetings. Speaking as a resident, the car parking review cannot come quick enough to our area - along with the St Paul's-wide waste management review. Hopefully we can keep working together to make sure these issues remain at the forefront of trying to improve our community. ""It has always been a problem in St Paul's, when I come home during term time I can never find a space for my car and end up having to park streets away from my house; when these students have left I can park right outside my front door! As it has been said already, there are too many student houses each holding 3 or 4 of them and most of them having a car! We, the real residents of St Paul's who are here for more than a few months of the year need to have our own private/reserved parking spaces by our homes. With regards to this actual incident, Manser Street has always been a notorious area and I would never park my car down there. The university does need to start providing parking for the students when they drive here for their lectures, however the ones that 'live' here, you need to be fair and realise you cannot have more than two cars per house, there simply isn't enough room!"" ""Of course, the person or people responsible for this damage have not yet been identified, so apart from TIG's conjecture, the fact that the car was damaged in Manser Street and the well-publicised enmity between St Paul's residents and students, there is nothing to suggest that this damage was caused by local residents. My own vehicle has been similarly targeted while parked in a public pay-and-display car park! The police don't respond, so I don't bother reporting it any more (my car is now kept in a locked garage most of the time). It's just one of the risks of car ownership. This incident just happened to happen in Manser Street and it just happened to be a student's car. In other circumstances, this kind of damage probably wouldn't have been given such prominent press."" Again, very pleased that the issues we face as residents are making the news - open discussion and an honest appreciation of the challenges we face here will be the best way for us to move forward as a community. No one is under the illusion that there isn't still a lot of work to be done and would like to reassure residents that there are many residents, organisations and officers working extremely hard on behalf of St Paul's. I'd not commented on the remarks made on the previous TiG article as I felt that it would be unfair to school those who are entirely unable to differentiate between my words and a journalist generate headline. To highlight this ignorance, I'll just directly quote serial-offerender @takeway22 for the entirety of their last post: ""Councillor Andrew Lansley has been strangely quiet when TiG posted the last two articles. Afterall, in Mr Lansley's words, ""COOL' St Paul's is fast becoming the best place in Cheltenham"". Really?"" Well done for quoting a headline, certainly not my words and this was underlined in my first post about the story on that particular thread: *** ""Just to clarify some misleading quotes the mar the tone of this piece: 1. I did not claim it's the ""best place in Cheltenham"" 2. I did not claim the ward is ""the place to be"" *** Just to give you a clue, when I say stuff to a paper ""they normally put it in quotation marks."" If they don't, then it is simple journalistic spin - you would do well to note this in order to stop you continually repeating this error. Something tells me that your motivation on this thread would be to make glib, populist remarks rather than actually helping your fellow human beings like some of us have spent their lives doing. If you can't tell the difference between someone highlighting the positive things about an area and crime then it is only you who looks stupid for their remarks. I fully stand by what I said in the article (and my blog) about the positives of our area - here is that link AGAIN so you can see what I actually said: ""The problem is there are too many homes rented out in St Pauls so a 3 bedroom home has been turned into a 5/6 bedroom house, I think in Courtney street houses have been extended to 8/9 bedrooms. Than we wonder why is there no spaces for cars. Most whom rent the rooms have cars. Gone are the days when they have bikes. When St Pauls was first built it was for local workers in the area, even to 30 years ago it was mostly family homes, when the collage became a University that's when people saw their opportunity to buy homes for the purpose of letting them out, not to families as there was more to be made from students as rent out nearly every room. Back in the 1800s there was never the thought that so many could live in the area. Otherwise I am sure they would have made the roads more wider. Yet the council seem to turn a blind eye to the problem. The university could help if they choose to open up car parks allow students to use both gates when they have been drinking at the student club at Francis close. It's not just the parking that upsets people the noise and shouting, is there any need for it ? We have it on their way out approx 11pm than again on their way back at 3 to 4 am I don't condone any criminal damage to anyone or anything, but I do think that students and not all of them, as some are quite respectful of the area, but a few should learn to respect others in neighbourhood before they want others to respect them."" ""@Chrisgump2011 thank you. The university provides a free bus linking campuses in Cheltenham and Gloucester and various other points in the town. Students other than those who live locally, but outside the town, or part time students with jobs simply do not need cars. On the one hand we have the council taking measures to pedestrianise, create shared spaces, rejuvanate town centre car parks and reroute our roads to encourage fewer cars, more cycling and walking only to see this green and healthy trend undone by a university unwilling to tackle the obvious.""

8693	"Pages Tuesday, October 4, 2011 Blog overload - I think I lost the plot there for a moment I think I might've lost the plot there just recently. You see, Digital Parents , an online blogging community here in Australia, are hosting their second blogging conference in March 2012. There's been talk of sponsorship to pay for you to get there, blogging about it, guest speakers, a trade show etc etc. I actually thought hey, I could do this . I found myself writing project plans and check lists on how I was going to achieve all of this. I actually got excited about the idea of going to an interstate conference, something that I did from time to time with my work, before kids. I've seen a few blog posts today about the overuse of social media, spending less time doing but more time spent on the computer and the amount of time you spend blogging compared to commenting. I enjoy reading and commenting on blogs and would prefer to do that. The light bulb went flashing madly today and I said ""NO""! No more. This is just craziness. If I wanted to do all of this, I'd be doing it as a full time job and getting paid for it. I'm a Mother first and foremost, not a blogger. I'm a cook, a wife, a friend, a daughter, a sister, a carer of two dogs and a person who loves life and wants to get healthy. I don't have time to be doing this. I've got two children and a husband who need my time and attention, more than a digital world of maybes and what ifs. I don't have time for media kits and sponsorship. I love cooking, craft, reading, photography, spending time with and looking after my children, husband and two dogs and keeping house. This is what I'll do. We're a one income family and if I do happen to get enough money saved up for a ticket (nearly $200), airfares (approx $500), accommodation (nearly $500) and spending money, then I'll go. If not, then I'm sure I'll find out what happened through Twitter, about 100 different Australian bloggers and guest speakers, video links and photos. Its a lot of money to outlay isn't it? After the last conference,I read a lot of posts saying that you had to do this, this and this and be that, that, that to be blogging correctly and to your full potential. ersonally I like my blogs the way I make them because really it is my own form of self publishing and I want it to be me, not the same as what everyone else is doing IYKWIM? A lot of my favourite blogs either sold out or just lost that appeal for me and it was disappointing. If you do find a way to get there, I am sure you will have fun though... Well done you - sometimes we think being SAHM's mean our days of career and ambition are over. But blogging can be another thinly veiled version of the rat race. We blog because we love it, and I hope it stays that way. I tell myself that as soon as I get sponsors etc etc etc, the pressure increases so much. I need to post all the time, and have great content all the time. I like to take a break when I want. I own the blog, it doesn't own me, and it's such a joy :) Good on you Anne! Love your blog - and your perspective Anne! You have inspired me to do some more cooking. I try to avoid the oven when I cook so I made a lemon slice on the weekend (from my mum's old Nursing Mothers Association cookbook)... it was great! And I replaced the Marie biscuits with Weetbix for a bit less sugar and I think they are just as good :-D I often wonder how people find the money to attend these conferences. I know for myself, there is absolutely no room in my budget for any expense of this size! Glad you're comfortable with your decision not to get caught up with online ""stuff"" and concentrate on ""real life"" :) Well said Anne! I personally won't be going because of the expense....I have a family of six to feed! Also because I'm happy posting my little stories about random and obscure things. Maybe if my blog was bigger? Who knows? It takes such a lot of time posting and then commenting on a few blogs a day...I really don't have time to do any more and I commend you for the amount of commenting you do! I have to remind myself of that all the time. I am not trying to make money right now. Maybe we feel guilt to just do it all, even though doing it all is not possible. It would be fun, but I bet there are more fun ways to spend that money. So well said Anne. I am really trying to balance blogging with my other life loves and keep it in its rightful place...a hobby. Would love to see you in Melbourne some time, be it at a blog conference or some other excuse to come down this way. x Lee What an absolutely brilliant post! Here is the UK it is much the same, and over the last couple of years I've seen the 'mummy blogging world' change completely from how it was when I first started blogging back in 2008. People are obsessed by visitor numbers, SEO, blogging conferences, getting hold of free stuff to 'review', and their position on various blog popularity charts. I can't bear it. The best blogs (and the ones that I prefer to visit regularly and comment on) are ALWAYS the ones who concentrate on actually writing interesting content, rather than all the above, IMHO. Yes! Thank you! I think your post has just pulled me back in to line as well! I'm noticing that the cyber world is taking up more and more of my time lately, when I have a spare moment, I go online. Not that I'm posting much, but I'm certainly writing stuff to post, and reading a lot of other blogs. I'd love to see my blog grow and I do love blogging, but sometimes when it's getting too big for its boots, it's a good idea to take a step back and ask yourself, ""why am I doing this?"" For some it may be a career step, and that's cool. For me, it's a hobby and it needs to be more for ME than anyone.else, otherwise why am I doing it?! As others have said above, it's all about balance! Hope you find yours Anne! "	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
28978	"Which hard-fought victory would he rather obliterate first -- Medicare or women's rights? Will he broaden the ticket's appeal from conservatives to nut job conservatives? With his hangdog look and puppy dog eyes, is he afraid Romney will put him on top of his car? These are the kinds of questions -- and then some -- we will tackle every day.

There's so much to talk about and I'm excited to discuss all of it with you on Current TV. The ancient Mayans referred to the period we're in now as ""the media cycle."" I call it ""the new abnormal"" -- the era of Chick-Fil-A, Jan Brewer and Honey Boo Boo Child. A time when we're less worried about Big Brother watching us than we are about watching Big Brother. A time that I can't wait to talk about with my guests -- and with you. On this website , Facebook , Twitter and some other new platform I'll have to spend all my spare time figuring out. Well, this Command Module is almost finished. It's very similar to the one used by that NASA engineer -- the one with the faux hawk . We spent $50 billion going to Mars and the only alien life they found was in their own control room, wearing a hairstyle that was hip in 1983. The workmen are taking a break. They've left a gigantic box here. It either has talking points for my new show or ten years of Mitt Romney's tax returns. Hmm... It's pretty light. "	Opinion/Argumentation	Opinion/Argumentation
36857	"Focus must shift to prevention strategies Date: November 17 2012 The Herald editorial is right to argue that the royal commission could seek ""reform and healing rather than just punishment by process"" (''Not only truth but reconciliation must be the remit'', November 14). Individuals and organisations that have been complicit in child sexual abuse have not done so in a vacuum. It is through organisational cultures of secrecy, denial and ignorance that child sex offenders gain access to our children. Child abuse is not a problem limited to the past. The royal commission must go beyond the history of complaints: it must examine how the lack of effective, compulsory standards and safeguards has directly led to the sexual abuse of children. We need to shift the paradigm away from a focus on child protection, to one that emphasises child abuse prevention. It is a shift that requires education, training, and community awareness. Children and adults need to be empowered to speak up against child abuse. There is a critical need for national child protection standards: attitudes may change but unless there are mandatory child protection standards, people will not report it and the preconditions for child sexual abuse will remain. Bernadette McMenamin CEO, Child Wise Church should defer to the law I tend to agree with Waleed Aly that the issue of the confessional seal is symbolic and that few cases of child abuse would come to light only through Confession (''It's essential we think outside the confessional box'', November 16). And yet the symbolism is absolutely crucial. In his shrill and spontaneous defence of the confessional seal, Cardinal Pell puts the Catholic Church above the law. He needs urgent and forceful reminding of what century we're living in. Stephen Wilson Five Dock Waleed Aly's article is insightful, but I beg to disagree with his summation. While a secular society's entry into the rules of the confessional may alter the behaviour of the perpetrator of child abuse, by their avoidance of the confessional, that may be a good thing for such a heinous crime. The act of removing or absolving guilt from those that enact such crimes, outside of the law of the land, is simply not appropriate. Better that they are left with the anguish, than relieved of the pain and able to justify a repeat of the process. Ted Keating Tallai (Qld) It appears that the Catholic Church not only has priests and brothers convicted of paedophilia but spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on barristers to defend those same priests time and time again on charges of serious sexual assault against children (''Church pays legal costs of paedophile priests - repeatedly'', November 16). May I suggest that a more productive and positive way to use what is obviously an unlimited cache of funds, would be for the Catholic Church to spend less money on defending those who sexually abuse children and instead invest its millions into supporting the education of its children? Perhaps the federal and state governments could consider withdrawing public funding to Catholic schools as a way of encouraging such positive Christian behaviour? De Brierley Newton Glebe I agree with John Poleson (Letters, November 13). Religious sadists in schools should also be accountable. I remember vividly when I was in year two, aged seven, at a Catholic girls' school being punched and pushed to the ground by a nun and sent outside with my nose bleeding for the rest of the day. This, just for a harmless prank by a friend and me in class. There was never any apology nor did my parents do anything about it; not even speak to the nun. Even though I changed schools, to another Catholic school, beatings still persisted until I entered high school. My mother suffered cruel and sadistic treatment at the hands of nuns in a Catholic orphanage, and I still wonder how she kept her faith and put her children through the Catholic system. She was fanatical about her faith until she died aged 93. Needless to say, the rest of the family discarded the faith after leaving home. It still upsets me to think about it. Denise Oliver Alfords Point Wendy Crew (Letters, November 16) raises a good point: the psychological abuse that religious groups inflict upon children is also worth our consideration. A vital evolutionary trait in children is that they trust and believe the adults around them. Filling their heads with claims about things you can't possibly know to be true is an abuse of this trust. It can take years of anguish to sort fact from fiction and many are never able to do so. Their problem though, becomes everyone's when they encounter others who've been indoctrinated with conflicting, incompatible ''truth'' claims. Larry Tofler Tea Gardens Alfred Hitchcock, devout Catholic and master of the suspense film genre, witnessed, in his words ''the most frightening sight of my life'', while driving through a Swiss town - a priest in conversation with a little boy, his hand on the boy's shoulder. ''Run little boy,'' yelled Hitchcock. ''Run for your life!'' Ian Waters Surry Hills Stand up to the US and Israel and support the Palestinians I am deeply worried about the situation escalating in the Middle East, and extremely concerned about Australia's lack of support for the Palestinian people and Australia's automatic political alliance with Israel and the US. I would like our government to stand up for the Palestinian people, to condemn Israel's illegal wars, and Israel's continual illegal occupation and annexation of Palestinian land, and Israel's illegal economic blockade of Gaza. It is clearly Israel who is the war monger. And it is shameful that Australia does not speak out against Israeli (and therefore, indirectly, US) state terror. If Australia is truly a secular and independent state, it would examine Israel's policies for what they are and condemn them as racist, akin to apartheid and fascism. Being of Jewish descent myself, I had hoped that a people who have suffered as much as the Jews would not become perpetrators of the same wrongs done to them in the past. But it is not the Jews who are perpetrators here: it is Israel. It is very important to make this distinction. I am against Israel's policies against the Palestinian people. I am not against Jewish people. It is an anachronism to have a Jewish state, just like it would be an anachronism if Australia declared itself to be a Christian state. Unfortunately not everyone has arrived in the 21st century. Some people seem to still live in Old Testament times. Israel is deeply in need of a strong international community that will make it stop carrying on like a madman. I wish our government would put pressure on the US to stop military support for Israel. And would condemn Israel's actions, and would put pressure on Israel to start obeying UN resolutions. Jepke Goudsmit Coogee I find it interesting and puzzling that the reporting of the Israeli/Gaza conflict seems to take on importance and make news only when the Israelis retaliate to rocket attacks by Hamas. The fact that Hamas continually fires rockets into southern Israel seems to be largely overlooked by the media, possibly because it is a regular event, possibly because the media have an agenda. It must be recognised that Australia regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, as do most Western nations, and that any similar attack on Australia or other nations would elicit a similar response to that taken by Israel. Turkey's response to incursions by Syria in recent days springs to mind. Michael Hayes Mount Riverview Israel has responded to Gaza's response to its illegal blockade and collective punishment equating to ongoing war crimes against Palestinians. Netanyahu also has an election in two months. Poor Gaza. Stephen Heydt Toowong (Qld) Tit-for-tat rocket fire will not bring lasting peace to the Gaza Strip or Tel Aviv streets but true dialogue could if there was a will. Surely a worthwhile alternative to endless conflict. Eddie Raggett Mosman What hope is there for peace for the Palestinians in Gaza with Hamas in charge? Hamas is ideologically committed to the destruction of Israel. Its charter starts with: ''Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it''. It persists in shooting rockets at civilian targets in Israel provoking a response and uses its own citizens as shields against that response by embedding its launch sites in civilian areas - a double ''crime against humanity''. Malcolm Bersten Lane Cove Dumbing down TAFE costs dearly David Williamson's condemnation of cuts to arts education rightly points to a funding squeeze which will eventually destroy the public training system ('' 'Python squeeze': Williamson condemns cuts to arts education'', November 16). The comparison he draws with funding to improve the nation's sporting prowess, brawn over brain, should shame our nation's leaders. The selling of TAFE colleges is an inevitable outcome of a competitive training market. Our TAFE colleges have been turned into retail outlets selling courses to customers. Our teachers have been transformed into business managers. The teaching workforce is casualised and the teacher training has been downgraded. The customer, who has the capacity to pay or benefits from government allowances, becomes the determiner of national and regional training priorities. In this market, big industry is a major beneficiary of taxpayer dollars as are fly-by-night training providers. Investment in TAFE has declined proportionately to the growth of the private training market. This allegedly ensures a more responsive public training system. In practice, it ensures its slow decline. Narrow skills for the workforce have become the dominant priority. Courses for personal and social development have been sacrificed because apparently they have no economic outcome. But, courses for people wishing to return to study, to upgrade or update their skills are also fast disappearing. Cheap, low-quality alternatives are the substitutes. What price a clever and creative country? Jozefa Sobski Haberfield Look here, Mr Williamson, it's all right for you arty types to say ''can we have more money, please'', but spare a thought for the rest of us barbarians. We want our bread and circuses. Sport is non-complex. You don't have to think too much. You don't have to participate if you don't want. And if you're any good at it then you get paid a motza and for some unknown reason heaps of people love you. Really it's a bit like being a theatre-goer, actor or playwright. In fact an English bloke once wrote about the world being a stage: ''And all the men and women are merely football, cricket or netball players.'' James Athanasou Maroubra Slashing sport funding cannot be used as an excuse for obese children or adults (''Slash sport funding and risk nation's health'', November 16). It costs nothing to keep fit by walking and letting children play outdoors instead of sitting in front of a computer or television after school. Robyn Lewis Raglan It is ludicrous to suggest that children must necessarily participate in organised sport in order to be healthy. The main causes of ill-health in the Western world are over-eating and over-drinking, together with lack of ordinary daily exercise. I am 80 years old. I haven't taken organised exercise of any kind since I contrived, at school, to avoid participation in games. Enjoying both food and alcohol, I weigh what I weighed when I was 19, and have so far suffered no ill effects from leading a life in which exercise has consisted simply of reasonable daily walking. As for the notion that organised sport encourages respect for discipline and rules - has Brad Walter watched any organised sport lately? A good number of professional sportsmen demonstrate rather that breaking the rules is the way to fame and fortune. As for gold medals - is the idolisation of a man or woman simply because he or she demonstrates physical dominance over someone else actually a practice of any value at all? What could possibly be going on? No cause for alarm, dear reader, just another property/mining deal going down in the Emerald City. Derek Douglas McMahons Point On the beat - or doing the beating I can see all the Joe Thug police around the world figuring their best shot at promotion in policing is to migrate to NSW (''Taser police kept on normal duties'', November 16). Terry Simpson Point Clare Following the shooting murders of two policewomen on the beat in London earlier this year, there were calls for officers on the beat to be given guns. The calls were refused - officers on the beat continue to go unarmed, citing ''tradition'' as the leading reason. What does the NSW Police think ''tradition'' is? The Wild West? Alexander Elliott Bilgola Plateau What happened to a short sharp jab or whack with a truncheon? Michael Skinner Blackheath If a police officer was the only thing between me and my family and a drug-crazed, alcohol-fuelled criminal I'd much prefer an old-style cop, adequately armed and committed to protecting me and other law-abiding citizens, thank you. Unlike Pierre Mars (Letters, November 16), I wouldn't give a damn about his or her ATAR. Stuart Salvage Huskisson In days of old ... This latest ICAC inquiry makes the days of the old brown paper bag pale into insignificance. Paint us another one The loyalty, expertise and corporate memory of these people is only worth a piddling $500,000 a year? What brilliant mind came up with that one? Watch this space for other government institutions having to do the same due to Macquarie Street brilliance. I'd love to see the full explanation of just how this amount is to be saved when the norm is that contractors cost a premium over the salaries of the workers they replace. Show us the calculations. Patrick Dodd Wahroonga It's just politics Julia Gillard is not above the law, Leo (Letters, November 16). There are no charges against her - unsubstantiated allegations by politically biased opponents. Stephen Thomas Wahroonga Certain memories best passed over Relax, Campo, the Kiwis are only getting revenge for our underarm bowling in ''that'' pyjamas match (''Sack Deans, says angry Campese'', November 16 ). We just have to ensure they don't plant a coach in our cricket team. Regarding passing, I remember you gave a shocker in your own in-goal. Frank Tweedie Morpeth In a short note Nathan Lee's list of acronyms (Letters, November 16) missed out on one of the most important: NIMTOFF (Not In My Term Of Office). Bruce Hyland Daleys Point Cheers to that As Movember winds down, hard on the heels of Ocsober, Sidetember and Dry July, I wonder if there is a link to the recent sharemarket slide. All that abstinence can't be good for the economy, with barbers, bartenders and bottle-shop attendants twiddling their thumbs for extended periods. The economy needs stimulation. I reckon we should have a month when we keep a record of drinks consumed and in return breweries, distillers and wine producers contribute to a charity of our choice. Next month looks good. Let's call it Bendercember. James McArdle Sanctuary Point Man of many parts Marie Watkins (Letters, November 16) suggests the next actor to play 007 should be Tony Abbott, but I have been told by numerous talent scouts that he is the leading contender for the role of Dr No. Early warning Unseasonal chill With a couple of days of warm weather last week I put away the heater and Doona. Big mistake. I fall for it every year. Down to 20 degrees today and jumper on. Philip Lidbury Marrickville Postscript The Catholics got a drubbing from all angles all week - and for a good reason, according to most readers. The ''louts'' who rubbished the reputation of St John's College with their alcohol-fuelled antics were front page. Frank Adshead called them ''disgusting and shameless'', although Sarah Bell, a former student at St John's College, asked that not all students ''be tarred with the same brush''. Not satisfied with the Premier's order for a ''diluted, narrow'' inquiry - as John Fryer described it - into claims of interference in police investigations of alleged paedophile Catholic priests in the Hunter Valley, many readers demanded a nationwide royal commission. Their prayers were answered. The next day the Prime Minister launched the most comprehensive inquiry into child sexual abuse in Australia's history with a nationwide royal commission. Readers welcomed the move and many called Detective Chief Inspector Peter Fox, who blew the whistle on alleged abuses and cover-ups by the church in the Hunter, a hero. But few were satisfied with Cardinal Pell's insistence on the sanctity of the confessional and his claim there was a smear campaign against the church. Julian Brown said the Catholic leader was in denial. But Pell had his defenders. Martin Fitzgerald said the archbishop had done more to uncover child sexual abuse than any other senior cleric in Australia. Sins of the flesh stayed on the minds of readers thanks to the now former CIA director David Petraeus's bed-hopping, but raising blood pressure was the coroner's findings into the death of a Brazilian student after ''thuggish'' police used a Taser on him. Annabel Little wondered why no one had been charged with manslaughter.

1184	"Experimental algorithm trades stocks based on superstition You could make investments based on market trends or finely tuned financial data, or you could just leave it all up to Shing Tat Chung and his Superstitious Fund Project -- an experimental fund that executes trades based on lunar cycles, numerology, and other superstitions. At the core of the fund is an Automated Trading System affectionately known as Sid the Superstitious Robot. Sid isn't a robot, per se, but a computer program that buys or sells stocks using a superstition-based algorithm (source code available for download here ). The bot won't buy any stocks on the 13th of the month, and avoids the number 13 altogether. It also adjusts its behavior based on the lunar cycle, interpreting the new moon as a sign of auspice, and the full moon as a bad omen. Sid starts selling its shares with more alacrity as the full moon approaches, for fear that it may have drastic effects on investors and the market as a whole. ""an unproven, highly speculative experiment"" Chung, 25, originally launched the project out of his own interest with superstition, which he wrote about extensively on his personal blog. Over time, though, the recent Royal College of Art graduate realized the potential for larger, real-world experimentation, and decided to bring his fund to the FTSE100. ""I wanted to poke fun at our superstitions,"" he told the BBC . ""But I also wanted to highlight our irrational nature in a way that is less critical and more about encouraging dialogue."" The Superstitious Fund began trading on June 1st (on the advice of a soothsayer), and will remain active for one year. Chung plans to benchmark its performance against other stock indices,and, in the event that he sees gains, will pay dividends to his investors. Thus far, though, things have been rather rocky. In the three weeks since Chung's fund went live, its value dropped by 12 percent from its starting point of 5,000 ($7,821). The NASDAQ100 index, by comparison, rose by four percent over the same period. The fund has since rebounded a bit, though Chung has gone out of his way to remind investors of the risks at stake. Each e-mail he sends out includes the following disclaimer: ""Please be aware, that this is an unproven, highly speculative, experiment and a project with the risk of total loss."" "	News	News
10177	Post navigation Sachin's century of centuries World admires Little Master as unique milestone is reached Tendulkar finally reached his 100th hundred against Bangladesh this morning It seemed to take an age. The cricketing world has held its collective breath, patiently waiting as inning after innings went by. Scores in single figures, double figures, in the 70's and 90's. But no centuries. Sachin Tendulkar was stranded on 99. Until now. This morning the 'Little Master' finally made it to the milestone. It seemed that the mark had been weighing him down. Little wonder, with the entire Indian population on his shoulders. Since he got his ninety-ninth century during last years World Cup, Tendulkar has had the world's press on edge whenever he has taken guard. People were sure he would get there during India's tour of England in the summer. He passed 50 twice, including an innings of 91 at the Oval, which when ended was almost mourned as much as it was celebrated by the home fans. From there he went home to India where the West Indies waited. The first Test saw Sachin make scores of seven and 76 while in the second he made 38. The third Test, at his home ground in Mumbai, a place where he had scored only one previous Test century, seemed to be the perfect place to achieve the unthinkable. Having watched the West Indies rack up nearly 600 in the first two days, when he got in, Sachin was determined not to get out. Ending day three on 67, the cricketing world was forced to hold its breath over night. They needn't have as he was out quickly the next morning. A tour to Australia couldn't do the trick, despite some fine knocks.  Specualation mounted as to whether Tendulkar would ever get there. Had he psyched himself out?  Was the pursuit of the goal undermining him, and more importantly, the team?  After all, India's form since the search for the century begun had been wretched. But then, with doubts surfacing, along came the Asia Cup, the little reported but one-day competition that probably would have passed even the most observant cricket fan by were it not for Tendulkar's presence.  Having failed in the first game, Sachin took to the crease against Bangladesh for the second with one thing on his mind.  100 runs later -- the time elephant has left the room at last.  While it may not have been the grand occasion he might have wanted, there was a sense of fate as this was his first century against Bangladesh. So finally, he has done the deed. But what does this achievement mean in terms of the history of cricket and for Tendulkar's future? Well, it is a unique achievement. By becoming the first and perhaps only man to reach such a landmark, Tendulkar has set himself apart. It is a testament to his longevity and brilliance over all forms of the game. No man has adapted so well between Test match and One Day cricket. 51 centuries in Tests and 49 in ODI's is testament to his equal brilliance in both formats. The worry for Indian's everywhere will now be what Sachin does next. This was the target everyone was looking at. What else is there? He has become the record run scorer of all time. He became the first batsmen to score a ODI double century. What is the end game for Tendulkar? Perhaps it is to see India gain revenge over England for the 4-0 whitewash this year. The return series takes place in early 2013, by which time Sachin would be a few months shy of his 40th birthday. Scoring runs and leading his nation to glory at that stage of his career would be quite an achievement. Then it could be time to hang up the floppy white sun hat for good. They say life begins at 40. When will Sachin begin the second part of his? 	News	News
10012	"Even years later, Bobby still sometimes had to resort to less than glamorous plays. Somewhere in your knowledge of hockey, there is a line. This line sits on a particular date, although chances are you couldn't say exactly which date it was; it was too long ago to remember, and back then you weren't counting anyway. On one side of this line are the things you know personally: the games, players, editions of teams and incarnations of the League you yourself have followed through the course of your life. On the other side are all the things you've only heard about in stories and montages, things that were over and done before your time. One side of the line is memory. The other is myth. Memory and myth engender two fundamentally distinct types of response. Players we remember ourselves are familiar creatures, we love them like friends or hate them like rivals. No old legend can ever arouse half the same tender affection we feel towards the men who inspired us as kids, even if those men were, objectively speaking, average practitioners of the game. But similarly we feel entitled to dissect and critique the players of our own time, no matter how great they were. Fans of my generation are fully capable of abjectly venerating Wendel Clark and snarkily deflating Wayne Gretzky, despite the obvious skill deferential and the certain verdict of history. And that's fine. In fact, it's one of the privileges of ""being there"", in the game, at a particular moment- the right to reimagine the grand narratives of hockey through your own idiosyncratic experience. But back on the other side of that line, things are different.  Nobody snarks about Rocket Richard or Howie Morenz anymore.  Nobody really challenges their legacy or reinterprets their achievements or even bothers to accuse them of diving.  The players who came before us we take as they are given, as a set of songs and stories, hockey cards and highlight reels.  Most of the time, we don't even think of them, but when we do, we think of them as archetypes rather than people.  They've been drained of their blood and pumped full of formaldehyde and reverence, not very much more human than their statues. Bobby Orr is right on the cusp of this transition.  He's ossifying before our very eyes. There are still several generations of fans who watched him play personally, but there are also several generations of fans who have no such experience. For half of us, he is a piece of living memory and for the other half he is already a legend. He is, at this exact moment, passing into myth.  To most hockey fans now, his hovering statue outside TD Garden is more him than his own 64-year-old body is. But of course Bobby Orr is one of those players who seems like he might have been a myth right from the beginning. The story is just too right, like a Canadian fairy tale that hockey moms told their sons back in the 40s when no one had so much as heard of an Orr and players named Robert would go by Bob. What sort of NHLer actually comes up poor in a small town, playing on frozen sloughs with newspaper stuffed in the toes of his skates and Sears catalogs strapped to his shins?  Is that even a real thing?  Are we sure that Parry Sound isn't some elaborate, Truman Show-like bubble created by HNIC in order to create good documentary footage?  Because, Occam's razor, that really does sound like a more plausible explanation than ""coincidentally one day hockey Jesus was born in hockey Bethlehem and grew up to save the Bruins from eternal damnation."" Even if you leave aside the eerily perfect creation story, Bobby Orr has a way of accreting weird, quasi-legendary tales.  They say that he never tightened his laces, that he'd be sitting on the bench with his foot out of the boot and the whole skate dangling from his toes until Sinden tapped his shoulder, and then he'd just punch his foot down and jump the boards.  He only used one line of tape on his stick because more would make it feel 'too heavy'.  These stories aren't about accomplishments; they're about superpowers.  No mortal man plays hockey with loose skates and no tape. Even beyond that, though, there's yet another layer to the legend, for in addition to being a prototypical Good Canadian Boy and a prototypical genetic mutant freak, Orr represents a prototypical Way of Hockey.  Some players are famous because of the numbers they racked up, and certainly the digits are a part of the Orr mystique, but Bobby is one of the few, rare players who is probably more famous for his style than for his records.  His highlights all showcase a particular exotic talent: speed without rushing, vision without looking, a kinaesthetic sense that stretched across the entire expanse of the ice and allowed the man to cover the whole crowded distance from one end to the other as if it were no more than 200 feet of frozen river.  To compare a player to Bobby Orr is to invoke the rarest, loveliest, wildest heights of hockey art.  It is to compare him to Superman. Really, everything you need to know about the myth of Bobby Orr is this: he was a hockey player who, even only once, could fly. *** I don't have any of Bobby Orr's famous games. I don't have the Stanley Cup Finals in 1970 or 1972.  I don't have the game where he flew. It's easy to find the highlights, but tough to find the old games in their entirety. I take what I can get, and in the case of Orr, what I can get are a few ordinary regular season matches.  The hockey of October and January, not of April and June. In 1968, Hockey Night in Canada was a much smaller production.  A quick intro of intercut stills to the familiar theme, a couple of minutes of talking by an uncomfortable-looking gentleman with a head like uncooked bread dough, and then we're on to the anthems.  The players stand strictly at attention and perfectly still, no amphetamine fidgets, no bouncing in their skates.  Everyone has hair buzzed close the scalp or shellacked down with a half-pound of grease. No one is wearing a helmet except for Paul Henderson, who is still four years away from the moment that will make him a legend.  Even Phil Esposito looks like he'd call you ""ma'am"" and offer to carry your groceries for you.  Simpler times. Even in black and white, even with the fuzzy resolution and the motion blur, it's easy to pick out Bobby Orr. If you couldn't recognize the hair, you'd notice the skating, and if you didn't notice the skating, you'd see the deference. It's the beginning of his third year in the NHL, he's only twenty and still looks a little slight for a defenseman, but his teammates treat him like an anointed king. When Bobby wants the puck, Bobby gets the puck. When Bobby wants to go deep, he goes deep. The other Bruins circle around, adjusting as needed, giving him the space to follow whatever odd impulses come to him. It's not so much that he's doing anything especially remarkable as that everyone on the ice appears to be waiting, hoping, for him to do something remarkable. There might be a miracle. Any second now. Middle of the first he gets the puck behind his net and starts to skate it up, and I think, maybe this is it. Maybe this is where the awesome shit starts to happen. I'm on the edge of the couch, bouncing a little, excited for some Bobby-fucking-Orr hockey. This is going to be great. He skates across the defensive blue line, goes around a Leafs forward every bit as easily as the stories say, crosses the red line and... dumps it. WHAT? I am still in shock at the very notion of Bobby Orr making a dump in, when, less  than a minute later, he does it again.  Carries it just slightly more than half the distance, just far enough to evade an icing call, and slaps it the rest of the way in. A few minutes later, there's another one. It's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen, because dude can obviously get around people.  In between his own blue line and the red, he does it every time.  And yet, come that half of the neutral zone on the Leafs' side of the ice, even with no pressure and all the time in the world, Bobby Orr is perfectly content to just bang that puck off the back boards and let his forwards scramble for it.  This isn't just a once or twice thing, it's not just a PK thing.  He does it again and again and again.  He does it on the power play.  He does it for no goddamn apparent reason. By the third period, frankly, I am pretty fucking pissed at Bobby Orr. I am shouting at the TV, shouting back in time as if the force of my annoyance could somehow transcend the laws of physics and echo through the 60s: you are Bobby Orr. You are literally, actually, no-joke no-metaphor the 100% real Bobby-fucking-Orr. You are the archetypal model for puck-moving, rushing, scoring defensepersons. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DUMP IT IN. That's WRONG. WHAT?! NO, NOT AGAIN. STOP IT BOBBY STOP IT. And then I give up, and revise everything I thought I knew about Bobby Orr. Or, as am now thinking of him, Bobby Dump-In. Sure, there are excuses. You want me to make excuses for Bobby Orr? I can do that. I can say, look, it was a dump-and-chase game back then. Even sans Bobby, the Bruins are dumping the puck constantly and from every position; obviously there's a coaching influence at work. Maybe it's because the Leafs were a good team- certainly they hold their blue line hard- and Boston is trying to keep things simple. Maybe it's because they were so used to being bad they hadn't figured out how to be good yet. Or maybe it's because Orr was just back from his first off-season knee surgery, and we all know rehabilitation wasn't sophisticated back then as it is now. Maybe he's taking it easy on purpose, or maybe he's still working on getting his stamina back. But whatever the reason, the fact remains: here is Bobby Orr not playing at all like a Bobby-Orr-type player. Stephen Brunt, in his excellent biography Searching for Bobby Orr , tells me that coaches never tried to reign in his natural creativity, yet here he is playing dump-and-chase just like everyone else on his team, presumably at someone's direction. Brunt tells me that, sure, Bobby left his position in the offensive zone, but he'd always manage to get back in time to cover his defensive responsibilities- yet here he is, letting his man go and losing the footrace back to his own net, crashing ineffectually into the back boards just after the Leafs score. Here is Bobby Orr, still a good player, still obviously gifted, playing basic, uncreative, and occasionally dysfunctional standard-issue 1960s Canadian hockey. Here is Bobby Orr, being kind of boring. Myths are formed of highlights, hyperbole, and forgetting. Bobby Orr got 270 goals and 645 assists in his career, but we haven't seen most them. What we've seen is the same two dozen rushes replayed two hundred times, held up to us as characteristic.  The big numbers combine with the flashy replays to make us imagine a force that never quite was, a type of player who existed not for years on end but only for a few select moments in a few select seasons, a few very very special games. What we forget is that in between those rushes were several hundred ordinary games, where Bobby Orr was subject to all the things that all the lesser players of the world are subject to, not just the apocalyptic injuries but the slow recoveries in between, the off games, the coaching demands, the bad decisions. We forget that sometimes he was outplayed, and sometimes he was outraced, and every now and again he lost, poor kitten. *** Last year, when Erik Karlsson started racking up the pile of points that would lead him to become the second-youngest Norris winner in history,  people obviously began making comparisons to the first-youngest: Bobby Orr in 1968. This very season, that began with this dump-in-fest, would end with him deemed the best defenseman in the League.  Eugene Melnyk (indirectly) and a some Ottawa sportswriters (directly) invoked Orr in talking about Karlsson's potential, but more impressive is this: Other than the use of the word ""crap"", which no proper hockey person would ever have said aloud to the media in 1968, that could easily be a quote from an old-time scout talking about Bobby Orr in his early days.  But it's not.  That's Bobby Orr, talking about Erik Karlsson. Provoked by all this hyperbole, the always-fascinating Tyler Dellow decided to do a little experiment.  In a post entitled Erik Karlsson, Bobby Orr, and Stats, I , Dellow went through every single one of Karlsson's assists of the year to date and broke down how they happened.  We'll never know what his ultimate conclusion would have been, since Dellow never posted part II of the analysis, but the closest we have is this statement: ""The key takeaway from this should be that, of his 27 ES assists this year, about ten of them actually involved Karlsson making a play with deliberate intent to create a scoring chance, as opposed to a play like a pass across the blue line, clearing his own zone or throwing it into the mixer in front of the net"". The implication is clear: Karlsson's assists aren't really 'good' assists. They're not playmaking assists. They're not the sort of assists that merit comparison to Bobby Orr.  The presumption, on the part of both Dellow and the Karlsson boosters who made the initial comparisons, is that being a Bobby-Orr-type player means making gorgeous play after gorgeous play, brilliant pass after brilliant pass, rush after rush.  But, based on the look of this one game, anyway, I'd guess plenty of Bobby Orr's Norris-earning assists were accumulated off passes across the blue line, long shots in the general direction of the net, and flat-out dumps, from ordinary, non-mythic plays.  It could be that Karlsson is far closer to playing like the ordinary, non-mythic Bobby Orr than either his supporters or his detractors suspect. Try putting Gretzky or Lemieux or Crosby or Malkin or Ovechkin into the meat-grinder of the late '60?s and early '70?s -- It's unimaginable. Everyone would be (would have been) screaming blue, bloody murder. Back then? It was the only way an entire league of players could deal with, defend against or curtail his speed and talent and instinct. He was simply too good for his time. And, considering what he accomplished, nonetheless? Fuck me. He was ""Compleat"". Without peer. A freak of nature, thrust into a staid culture that found itself agog and disbelieving. Do you know where I can get my hands on a complete archive of all his games? Because I'd rather see for myself than take anyone's word for it. Not that I doubt his excellence- so many experts, as you say, cannot all be wrong- but I'd love to see the texture of his skill, and how many of his games really were full of the kind of play we customarily associate with his name. Unfortunately, no such archive exists -- The CBC wiped tapes regularly, to reuse them -- And they would have been the primary source, bar-none, in providing such material. I should recommend that you view (if you haven't already) the ""NHL Legends of the Game"" episode dedicated to Orr (available on youtube,) as well as NHL Network's ""The Day That Changed The Game -- May 10, 1970?, along with any and all ""found material"" (no matter how seemingly self-indulgent) on youtube. It may provide you with a fairly sound body of anecdotal evidence as to Orr's excellence, passion, competitiveness (above all) -- As well as his ready willingness to sacrifice his body, to no end, in his drive to *win*. Curious, how old are you and how much do you actually know about hockey??? Orr IS human, you know. But his bad games were still far better than most players best games OF THE TIME. Like most children being raised today, you think every stride should be a highlight moment based on what you've heard. You watch A game and you weren't instantly gratified because his every stride wasn't fairy-tale-like in your opinion. I grew up in S.E,Mass watching Bobby Orr play and he was as great as you hear about. But I got to see every game and why he came to dominate his sport and why he was the sole reason hockey was picked up by national TV in the U.S. for the first time when he played. I also grew up playing the sport to understand and appreciate the subtle nuances that separates the great from the good. I have yet to see a player who dominated the game the way he did and that includes the ""Great One"". When asked and without hesitation, Gretzky himself named Orr as the greatest player ever and said he really wished he had the opportunity to be on the same ice with him. Gretzky wasn't half the player Orr was. Orr would skate circles around the opposition and then pound them into submission if they took liberties withh im or his teammates . Gretzky whined about fighting in the game while sending his paid goon McSorley in to do what Orr did for himself. Orr could have easily dominated as a forward, where the Great One would have been Swiss cheese as a defenseman. Want to know how many hockey rinks were built in this area because of Bobby Orr WHILE HE WAS PLAYING? They weren't built years later to honor a myth, we got to see the living legend at the Garden then went on to emulate him on the streets, ponds and damn it if we didn't demand our parents build us rinks and start leagues for us and did they!! The league expanded and hockey had an 800% growth in the U.S. because of Orr while he was playing; greater than the impact Babe Ruth had on baseball!! Know how many kids from New England grew up to become pro's because of Orr during the Orr era? The 1980 U.S. Olympic ""Miracle"" Team was full of players who were directly influenced by Orr. Mike Eruzione said years after winning the gold when the team came back together, Orr made an appearance. Eruzione said he watched grown men behaving like small children getting a visit from Santa Claus when Orr walked in. Orr is the ONLY defenseman to ever win the scoring title; he did it TWICE. The second time towards the end of his career with really bad knees. He is the ONLY player to ever win 4 major awards in the same year,: Art Ross as scoring champ Norris as best defenseman Hart for regular season MVP Conne Smythe as playoff MVP while on his way to capture the Cup which is immortalized in the most recognized hockey photo that also has raised more money for charity than any other sports photo. The Great One never did that in a single year and not a single player has remotely come close since. And the one thing that separates Robert Gordon Orr from every other athlete in the New England area before or since is the type of human being he is. As ruthless of a competitor as he was on the ice, he is an incredible humanitarian with the kindest heart off the ice . We've had our share of larger than life athletes come to our area and not a one comes close to the reputation that Bobby Orr still has among the sports fans of New England to this day. You watch a game and think you got to see Bobby Orr play??? I watched him throughout his entire career and say you don't know crap. Try contacting NESN or WSBK TV in Boston for game archives and then ask NESN to send you their documentary ""Bobby Orr and the Big Bad Bruins"". WSBK TV played Bruins games when Orr came to Boston. NESN broadcasts the Bruins these days. I have had the great fortune of having met (and had a drink or two with) quite a few of Orr's team-mates at the time, over these many years: Esposito, Cashman, McKenzie, Hodge, Stanfield, Cheevers as well as other HHoFamers...I have never had the privilege of meeting Bobby. I can honestly say that my reaction to meeting him (hopefully, some day) would pretty much reflect how you described Eruzione's and the Miracle team's reaction: I would, once more, be 10 years-old and it would be Christmas Day. I'm 55, and I would proverbially ""piss myself"", given such circumstances. Funny cuz I bet Howe said Gretzky was the best ever lol. So gretzkys modest ways allows Howe to be the best? He also said federov was the most skillee player of all time but many wony even rank him in the top 50 of players In the book ""Bobby Orr: My Game,"" Orr says that he used that one little strip of tape on his stick because he assumed there was a rule against having no tape at all. But then, in 73 or 74 I think, he read the actual rule book and learned that there was no such rule, after which he used no tape on his stick at all. I'm pretty sure he also says he thinks the taping the blade tradition is a throw-back to a time when players taped their blades literally to hold the well-used stick together. He talks about the textured fiberglass coating on the then-modern blades being all you need for improved control. Re 200 feet of frozen river: Orr also mentions in the book that when he played on the Sound the nets were closer to 400 feet apart. My memory is that he says there were something like 20 kids on a side, essentially playing keepaway...which makes sense considering how he played as an adult. I think I've actually seen this game and it's not really an interesting one. Another one that is out there is Leafs/Bruins from late in the '70-71 season and Orr is unstoppable. The Leafs go into a full-blown panic every time he touches the puck and how they didn't spend the entire game on the PK is beyond me. Yeah, I've got a few others to go through. But it really was interesting to me to see an 'uninteresting' game, just to be reminded that EVERYONE has such games, even the legends. It's good to remember that even the greatest talents aren't 100% consistent or free of the constraints of their team and era. Ideally, maybe it makes us a little more forgiving of the great talents we see in our own time? But you've seen lots of Gretzky, right? Gretzky, Lemieux, Crosby, they all had/have ordinary games, make mistakes. Did you really need to see an ordinary Orr game to realize that he didn't make a spectacular play every time he was on the ice? No, but there's a difference between knowing such things in the abstract and actually using them as functional knowledge, particularly when- as in the Karlsson case- we use ""Bobby Orr"" as a metonym for a certain largely unachievable ideal play style. If we want to have these kinds of conversations, comparing modern players to Orr (or Gretzky, or Eddie Shore, or whoever really), we can't do it from a standpoint of examining the micro-flaws in the game of the modern guy while characterizing the old legend based entirely on his highlights. The conversation has to involve a nuanced view of both players. I suppose, at this point, what I'm trying to do is open a conversation about the nuances of Bobby Orr's game that I haven't really heard elsewhere. Have you tried checking the NHL Vault? It's accessible with a Game Centre Live account or you can pay $5/month to access it (and maybe you can get NHL.com to hook you up with one given that you're blogging at the Score). They have a lot of old games archived on there, and might have some more Orr games (I don't have an account at the moment due to, well, y'know). I'm assuming that's where you found the game you did watch, but if not, it's worth a try. Hockey is game alot like soccer . A constantly moving struggle for possession with 'moments' of brilliance these moments like goals themselves are the exception. An average player may have one every 10 games a great one one every 5. The best 'Orr 'one every 3 ? What makes an alltime player..one of legend is his/her imagination! To do things others haven't attempted or to do it in a manner not seen. This IS Orr's greatness- defenceman never played like this O&D all over the ice. Also, Hockey still is a team game & Boston was a weak sister His complementary cast was never as good as Montreal. Something that needs to be considered.. And yet in 1969-70, he won the Hart, Art Ross, Norris, Conn Smythe and Stanley Cup. For all the chip-and-chase, he must have been doing something right. I think it's worth mentioning that Bobby Orr probably wasn't really Bobby Orr until that 69-70 season. If the game you've watched is from 1968, that's a season in which he finished outside the top-20 in scoring with 64 points -- still a strong output, but one that he doubled the very next season. Point is, you probably watched a game of ""Bobby Orr the good defenseman,"" not of ""Bobby Orr the generational talent."" The guy from this generation that is going to be deified is probably Nick Lidstrom. Some have already referred to the guy as ""the perfect human,"" so I can only imagine what the hyperbole is going to be like in 20+ years. Wow. This is horrible even for a blog. Bobby dump in? Have you ever seen the movie ""The Best of Bobby Orr"", or anything beyond one game? Hockey is a team sport, made up of individuals, not individuals who make a team. It invloves strategy and smarts. Please before you belittle one of the most respected men in the history of the game of hockey, keep in mind the damage the written word can do, it is impossible to take it back. I think the point here is that movies like ""The Best of Bobby Orr"" only show us highlights, and to people who weren't around watching all the games at the time seeing only such highlights creates an unrealistic picture of his general gameplay. With such a picture in mind it is difficult to make appropriate comparisons between players like Orr and new players like Karlsson, whose highlight reel plays (if they happen) are still to come in the future. I don't think anything said here could be considered ""damaging"" or ""belittling"" to Bobby at all -- it's just the reflection of someone watching the mundanity of his general play for the first time, and using that to give context to comparisons made between his play and contemporary players. I never, once, said he was average. My point is that even the greatest player in the game played ordinary sometimes, whether because of injury, coaching, or running up against hot opposition. That ordinariness WAS a component of his greatness, it was real, it happened too, just as much as the highlights did. When we imagine what Bobby Orr was, and especially when we compare him to modern players (who we get to see every game, warts and all) we should remember that the flashes of brilliance were still something that required tremendous struggle to achieve and didn't always work out the right way. Humanizing him is a way of reflecting honestly on the inconsistent and imperfect nature of hockey talent, not denigrating him. A roast? Did you read the article or just react to the title? The most negative this article gets about Orr is saying that *in this particular game* he wasn't the Superman on the ice one might expect based on the stories. Ellen, you're great on the more distant history, but this one just feels like it has no context, no comparison, just... ""Bobby Orr dumped the puck in a lot in this one game."" If the game was in 1968, for instance, then the revolution which Bobby wrought was only in its first peekingest-out moment. Have you looked at how many points even All-Star defencemen of those years got? 25. 35. 45 max. That's it. Orr came in, and just from ages 18-19-20, as he was just starting he revved the engines to 65 points -- and had already broken the goal-scoring record. And yet, at that age, he was still playing diffidently, shyly, having to fight for room on the ice, for respect -- for himself and his team-mates. The Bruins had been bums, historically, and were just starting to get going, developing a style. Look -- you think the Leafs are bad? the bruins had missed the play-offs 8 STRAIGHT YEARS in the 1960?s before Orr arrived. They were just starting to get a sniff of how good they might be. Esposito had just come over to start 1967-68, for instance, along with Hodge and Stanfield. Cashman was just breaking in in 1968-69, Sanderson was a rookie in 1967-68, and so the Big Bad Bruins -- and that offensive juggernaut -- was just beginning. But Orr, he was already, by 1968, not just unusual on the ice, but off it -- he went under the surgeons's knife. Twice. Plus he got a wicked bad concussion (from Quinn) where he was stretchered off, plus a broken collarbone and separated shoulder. And those are just the injuries Wiki lists. So if he dumps the puck in, the absolute gold standard for defencemen of that time, it could be because he was still new... or maybe he was hobbled... or maybe the Bruins felt they could pound the Leaf defencemen of that era... or or or.... Or maybe Orr was a bore. But just in case you think that, tune in in 1969-70. I know you have some respect for stats, so try this. The NHL went from a time when guys like Ted Harris could make the 2nd All-Star team with 25 points ('68-69) to Orr scoring 33 goals and getting 120 points. With a plus of 54. It starts to get extremely tough to compare him to other defencemen. And then, there was 1970-71. 37 goals, 139 points and a +134. Think about that. We all know plus/minus it isn't a perfect stat, but you want to know how he was on an average night, so turn that little rock over in your hand for a bit. He scored 139 points, and had a plus of 154. Now, try to think about how many average games he had in there, of the 78 he played. Can't be many, can there? Because Bobby Orr was on the ice not just for 154 goals, but for 154 MORE than the other team scored at even strength. Do the math on that. 2 per game. 2 goals more were score when he was on the ice, per game, each game, all year long. And that was just at even strength. Now add in the Boston powerplay. On which, Esposito had 25 goals, and Bucyk 22 and Hodge 4. That's your #1 PP unit, right there, and Bobby Orr was on it. So... he was probably on for another 51 goals or so there. Was he likely on the ice for some goals against, when the other team was on the PP? Sure. Except he also had 3 Short-handed goals in 70-71. In fact, Boston's main PK guys scored more than 20 short-handed goals that year. Orr likely set up a dozen of them. And by then... he was already transforming the game. Guys like Brad Park and Guy Lapointe were being headhunted and then unleashed, to eb followed by the Denis Ootvin's and Larry's Robinson's and Paul Coffey's and Salming's and Turnbull's. You'd never have seen them otherwise. Well, maybe you would. But you never DID see them before Orr. After him, they were great, sure. But not really in his league. Great blog, the kind of thing I've thought about. I did see Orr play, but I compare it to the mythos surrounding Babe Ruth. If you took a time machine and picked a random Yankee game from the 20?s or 30?s, there's a chance you'd see a game where the Babe whiffs three times and fouls out to the catcher, and mishandles a ball in the outfield because he's hung over and bloated from eating a dozen hot dogs before the game...

16828	"Author Topic: Brendan Rodgers playing style - who is likely to be in or out of favour?  (Read 6581 times) Whenever you see Brendan Rodgers interviewed he talks about players needing a high level of ""technical"" ability in order to play in his tip tap style. He also speaks about a high level of game intelligence, allied to good fitness in order to be able to press the ball in groups, ""make the transition"" and all that mallarkey. Which of our players current or on loan are likely to fit or otherwise? An obvious casualty for me is Dirk Kuyt. God love him for his effort, but if you want to ping it about and you haven't got a crash helmet for everyone in the first three rows of the crowd, Dirks not your man. My guess is he'll be on his way very shortly. Charlie Adam? I like him but he seemingly doesn't fit the mould either with his long raking passes, his concession of possession too easily and his Friar Tuck physique. My guess is if his wages aren't too onorous, he'll be away as well. Carra? Perhaps time for the final coaching badge and a spot in amongst the back room team for our ""no nonsense"" defender? Any players which might be given another chance to shine? Well the obvious is Joe Cole, and such a topic starter wouldn't be complete without giving Albert Waterman a mention now would it? Could it just be that our extravagant outlay on both is belatedly about to bear fruit? No I don't think so either but I thought I'd throw it in. Adam, Spearing and Shelvey off the top of my head solely based on his expected tactics. It depends if he's going to use the same philosophy in every title/cup team. He may choose a different style of player depending on the opposition. I'm hoping he's the kind of manager who can see something in a man and mould him into a player who fits into and can do a good job within his tactical model. Carroll can adapt in my opinion, have a look at Swansea's play and you'll see that they aren't afraid of whipping it in to Graham. Do think we'll go after a different type of striker to give another option though. Shelvey's young enough to adapt to a different system. Henderson will absolutely thrive under Rodgers too. Keeping Maxi might not be a bad idea now, he's very slick with his movement and short passing. I see Shelvey and Henderson flourishing, as well as of course Suarez. Thinking about possible transfers in - I think Ibrahim Affelay could do well; he is a young Joe Cole in my eyes, except with a little more flair. All depends on Joe Cole's role: does he come back or not? Carroll can adapt in my opinion, have a look at Swansea's play and you'll see that they aren't afraid of whipping it in to Graham. Do think we'll go after a different type of striker to give another option though. Shelvey's young enough to adapt to a different system. Henderson will absolutely thrive under Rodgers too. Keeping Maxi might not be a bad idea now, he's very slick with his movement and short passing. Agree with the rest but not sure about Shelvey, his passing is suspect, he rushes way too much and his spatial awareness is so low at times he looks like he needs a white stick. It'll be a good test if Rodgers can get him to fit though, for player and manager. Think Johnson will really flourish in this system, along with the others that have been mentioned above. Joe Cole was one of the players I immediately thought of, but I can't really see him getting the chance especially on his wages. Spearing, Carra, Dirk all are going to struggle to fit in IMO. Can see Dirk and Spearing being moved on, as well as Adam. Downing - Clearly his confidence is shot for sh*t, so may not be a bad idea to bring Scott Sinclair in. 4-3-3 is his prefered formation, So essentially we will need a DM (LUCAS) and 2 Attacking Midfielders (AQUILANI AND GERRARD) IN: Aquilani- Creative, a great passer of the ball, and really deserves a chance Cole - Can see Joe Cole getting another chance now.. Sterling- Pacy, Quick and can Kill full backs with pace. Agger - The kind of CB he likes I think Kuyt and Maxi may go because of wages. If we wanted to play possession football and score goals I would keep them though. Kuyt and Maxi are both intelligent movers which is fundamental in pass and move football. Got to admit that Adam, Dirk, Carragher and Spearing are the ones that I suspect might struggle. Hope I'm wrong about Spearing but to me he looks to have limited potential for improvement but I think a lot of our younger players will have the potential for real development. I can see the argument that Henderson might flourish but I think Agger, Lucas and Suarez were made for Brendan and to be honest I'm expecting big things from Shelvey and continued improvement from Carroll. Be interesting to see the shape of the team but I'll be pleased to see a lot less reliance on 442. To be fair, they played with a big guy in Danny Graham at Swansea. Carroll is good with his feet and I'd imagine that Rodgers will be willing to give him a chance, I'm interested to see how he adapts tactically though and if he's willing to constantly close the opposition defence down. An obvious casualty for me is Dirk Kuyt. God love him for his effort, but if you want to ping it about and you haven't got a crash helmet for everyone in the first three rows of the crowd, Dirks not your man. My guess is he'll be on his way very shortly. Alberto and Joe would be a good inclusion and would love to see Raheem get some more time under Rodge! Ha With Rodgers likely (Hopefully) to use his adaption of a 1-4-3-3 you could see the following all really flourishing Reina.. Will love a higher line that he can be behind and start a lot of moves and be a ""sweeper keeper"" Agger.. Ball playing centre back will adore it. Skrtel.. Will give it simple. Johnson.. Getting forward, comfortable with the ball.. Lucas.. The man in front of the back 4, good touch, not scared under pressure, will tick the play along. Henderson.. Can pass a lovely ball, all energy. Gerrard.. Can do anything.. Will love a free type role under Rodgers. Suarez... As Gerrard.. Carroll.. I think he will flourish, he has shown he has good feet towards the end of the season, is a far better player than Danny Graham, if Rodgers can get him the service he will be a big player next year. Coates.. Will improve and get more time I think.. Then the jury is out for me on.. Not that I think these will immediately move on but will have their work cut out to develop into his style. Enrique.. Is a very good defender, but on the ball can dwell on it at times, goes down blind tunnels.. Will have to improve that side of his game. Adam.. Who knows if he will get a tune out of him. Downing.. Same, does he fit the type of winger Rodgers likes? Quick, technically sound? Will get a chance next season but has to improve and quick. Shelvey.. Potential is there, thus could be a key time under Rodgers.. Will either cone good and quick or be shipped on next summer. In trouble I think are.. Kuyt.. Not quick enough to play wide under Ted.. Will want assurances of first team chances or will want out which I don't see him getting. Maxi.. Technically great.. But quick enough? Spearing.. Think his time could be up. Carra.. Anyone who reads my posts knows the respect I have for the man but on paper he doesn't seem to suit Ted's way of playing. Will probably be around next season.. Depends if he sees a future as a coach for him. Then there is the futures of Cole and Aquilani.. On paper they would be Rodgers types of players.. Will they get a chance? How will some of the promising youngsters develop.. Suso, Sterling, Adjordan and Texieria all seemingly would fit in.. The way I see it right now with what we have Rodgers may look at this.. Reina Johnson Agger Skrtel Enrique Lucas Henderson Gerrard New*                        Suarez Carroll Subs: Doni Kelly Coates New man Downing New man New man I think he may look to bring in a couple of wide men, a back up for Carroll and Lucas and possibly a replacement for Carra. If he can get us playing how Swansea did and adds a real classy wide man we will be an improvent without really shaking things up to much. Carroll will be fine. Danny Graham is hardly Messi on the floor & has been a regular for most of the season for Rodgers. In fact Carroll has bettter technique than Graham for me. Think he can adapt to whatever system Rodgers plays, I still don't buy in to this perception that anyone over 6 feet can't integrate in to a pass and move system. Another thing with Mr Rodgers, he's come from a team who's transfer record was 3.5 million quid. I wonder how many times he's seen a player who he's thought ""F**k me he'd be perfect for our system"", only to find out he'd cost 5.5 mill or something and therefore be out of their budget hitting zone. Equally, maybes there's players who are 10 mill plus who'd fit his way like a glove and now he'll potentially be able to ask about them at least. They aren't forced to be big name superstars either, there isn't much big in any way shape or form about Joe Allon and Leon Brittain. I too think Kuyt will leave, he's been a great servant but I'm sure it's now time for him to move on. I lean towards agreeing with the guys saying that Carroll may struggle, but I'm sure he will get a chance next season but if he doesn't bring a good return of goals again his position will be hugely under threat. I'd like to think Rodgers will give Sterling and Texeira game time next season, especially if players like Downing and Adam again fail to perform early on in the season. I think it's a good thing that these players that haven't been a success i.e Downing are not Rodgers' signings so I presume he won have any obligation to persevere with them if they don't perform. Agger will fit into this system perfectly, I fully believe he is one of the best all round defenders in the world. Henderson will flourish as will Joe Cole if he gets the chance. Read an interview with him a week or so ago, seemed really humble and determined to prove himself. Sadly, he's definitely need to take a pay cut. I'm cautiously optimistic about this appointment...

16078	"Not-Quite-Review of A Long Time Coming This is the book that Newsweek published after the campaign, based on a series of articles in the magazine. As in the past few presidential campaigns, its reporters got some sort of exclusive access to the candidates' campaigns, but, in exchange, couldn't publish anything until after the election. The book, like its 2004 equivalent, does a fine job laying out the campaign's essential events. As with most campaign reporting, it's focused on strategy and the candidates' personalities. You won't find comparisons of Obama's and McCain's health care plans. Like most people who pay attention to politics, I know the general campaign narrative. So I read looking for the juicy tidbits that I missed or hadn't heard. The book had some, although I was greedily hoping for more. Here are the ones that stood out to me: Barack Obama's performance in the early debates was so bad that, during one debate, John Edwards ""came up to him during a break and scolded him, 'Barack, you've got to focus .'"" (p.8) As Obama mused on his early shortcomings as a candidate, he narrated this thought process to his campaign team, which Newsweek captured on tape: ""So when Brian Williams is asking me what's a personal thing you've done [that's green], I say, you know, 'Well, I planted a bunch of trees.' And he says, 'I'm talking about personal .' What I'm thinking in my head is, 'Well, the truth is, Brian, we can't solve global warming because I fucking changed light bulbs in my house. It's because of something collective.'"" (p.10) The book states that McCain was ""never comfortable playing the front runner"" and ""was ill suited to be the establishment's man."" McCain is quoted as saying, ""What the fuck would I want to lead this party for?"" (p.34) Both the Obama and McCain campaigns were targets of ""sophisticated foreign cyberespionage,"" which was investigated by the FBI and Secret Service. Neither agency would comment for the book. The best the book can say about the culprits is this: ""There was no suggestion that terrorists were involved; technical experts hired by the Obama campaign speculated that the hackers were Russian or Chinese."" (pp.112-13) ""Inevitably there was some tension between Democratic regulars and the Obama insurgents on the road to Denver. Delegates and congressmen, normally showed with free tickets, were allotted relatively few in order to make room for grass-roots organizers."" (p.114) ""The John Kerry campaign had set up elaborate liaison offices dedicated to ethnic groups, organized labor, groups for the disabled, for women, for gays and lesbians. Somewhat grudgingly, the Obama campaign agreed to have a single staffer devoted to each of these constituencies, but later decided the whole thing was a waste of manpower and dispersed the interest-group liaisons to go work in the field on get-out-the-vote operations."" (p.115) ""It did not go unnoticed in Obamaland that Hillary, toward the end of the convention, reportedly assembled her closest advisers in a hotel room to discuss her prospects for 2012."" (p.118) ""Obama's plane was taking off from Denver airport around 9 am when Axelrod got confirmation that McCain had indeed picked Palin as his running mate. He went to the front cabin to tell Obama and his new running mate, Joe Biden. Biden asked, 'Who's Palin?'"" (p.120) ""McCain loved the whole Palin family. They seemed to offer some relief, if not a touch of anarchy, to the Straight Talk Express, which had become a bit joyless. Piper, the governor's 7-year-old, thought nothing of crawling across Joe Lieberman's lap to get to her mother. Lindsey Graham mischievously enjoyed getting the children hopped up on Mountain Dew, a beverage to which he was mildly addicted."" (p.126) After Obama got back from the White House meeting about the financial rescue plan, he told his aides ""that Henry Paulson had gotten down on one knee to beg House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to blow up the deal. 'Henry, I didn't know you were Catholic,' she said. She told him to go beg the House Republicans."" (p.135) ""At the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 2, McCain was delighted to see that Sarah Palin had irritated Biden. Watching the TV with some aides, McCain exclaimed, 'He looks like an angry old senator!' The staffers were awkwardly silent, unsure if McCain appreciated the irony of his statement..."" (p.147) Why Palin brought up Ayers: ""Actually, Palin was feeling hurt and angry over the tabloid treatment of her 17-year-old daughter Bristol, and decided -- on her own -- that Ayers should be fair game. McCain's advisers were working on a strategy that would launch an Ayers attack the following week, but McCain had not signed off on it, and Salter was resisting."" (p.156) Newsweek reports on this vote-tracking effort by the Obama campaign, but don't report whether it got off the ground: ""The geeks at New Media, working with the field department, had created a program that would allow a 'flusher' -- the term for a volunteer who goes out to round up nonvoters on Election Day -- to know exactly who had, and had not, voted in real time. The New Media magicians dubbed it Project Houdini, because of the way names disappear off the list instantly once people are identified as they wait in line at their local polling station. 'I have no idea how [Project Houdini] will work,' Steve Schle, the campaigns' Florida state director, told Newsweek a week before Election Day. 'But if it does work, it will redefine get-out-the-vote...It's an amazing, fascinating tool, and if it works, it will be the model that everyone uses going forward."" (p. 167) ""The day of the third debate, Palin refused to go onstage with New Hampshire GOP Sen. John Sununu and Jeb Bradley, a former New Hampshire congressman running for a House seat, because their views on abortion didn't fully align and because Bradley had earlier opposed drilling in Alaska. (He changed his position during the race.) The McCain campaign ordered her onstage at the next campaign stop, but she refused to acknowledge the two Republican candidates standing behind her."" (p. 180) With my political science hat on, I also looked for examples where Newsweek described campaigns or particular campaign events as important, but where as yet we have no real evidence that they actually affected voter behavior or election outcomes in the manner described or implied: On the ""Red Phone 3 am"" ad: ""But it was Penn who finally came up with an ad that worked, on the eve of the Ohio and Texas primaries in early March..."" (p.65) ""Running negative campaigns is as old as the republic (Jefferson slimed Adams), but in modern national campaigns, Republicans have been better at the game than Democrats."" (p.86) On McCain's ad with images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. ""Most pundits huffed at the ad as trivial and a cheap shot. But it dominated the news cycle for several days, something McCain had failed to do for months. Obama didn't get much bounce from his [overseas] trip, despite the heavy, overwhelmingly admiring press coverage. The ad had helped stall Obama's momentum and, with some voters, raise doubts about his depth of experience."" (p.95) ""Palin, the polls showed, had succeeded in rallying the Republican base. But she, or the simmering anger around her, helped make Obama supporters out of countless independents."" (p.153) I have not read Chuck Todd's new book .

5158	"Similarities between wage labor and slavery were noted at least as early as Cicero . [ 13 ] Before the American Civil War , Southern defenders of African American slavery invoked the concept to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] With the advent of the industrial revolution , thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of property not intended for active personal use. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The Right to be Lazy is an essay by Cuban-born French revolutionary Marxist Paul Lafargue , written from his London exile in 1880. The essay polemicizes heavily against then-contemporary liberal , conservative , Christian and even socialist ideas of work. Lafargue criticizes these ideas from a Marxist perspective as dogmatic and ultimately false by portraying the degeneration and enslavement of human existence when being subsumed under the primacy of the "" right to work "", and argues that laziness, combined with human creativity, is an important source of human progress. He manifests that ""When, in our civilized Europe, we would find a trace of the native beauty of man, we must go seek it in the nations where economic prejudices have not yet uprooted the hatred of work...The Greeks in their era of greatness had only contempt for work: their slaves alone were permitted to labor: the free man knew only exercises for the body and mind...The philosophers of antiquity taught contempt for work, that degradation of the free man, the poets sang of idleness, that gift from the Gods."" [ 22 ] And so he says ""Proletarians, brutalized by the dogma of work, listen to the voice of these philosophers, which has been concealed from you with jealous care: A citizen who gives his labor for money degrades himself to the rank of slaves."" (The last sentence a quote from Cicero . [ 13 ] ) Raoul Vaneigem , important theorist of the post- surrealist Situationist International which was influential in the May 68 events in France, wrote The Book of Pleasures . In it he says that ""You reverse the perspective of power by returning to pleasure the energies stolen by work and constraint...As sure as work kills pleasure, pleasure kills work. If you are not resigned to dying of disgust, then you will be happy enough to rid your life of the odious need to work, to give orders (and obey them), to lose and to win, to keep up appearances, and to judge and be judged."" [ 23 ] Autonomist philosopher Bifo defines refusal of work as not ""so much the obvious fact that workers do not like to be exploited, but something more. It means that the capitalist restructuring, the technological change, and the general transformation of social institutions are produced by the daily action of withdrawal from exploitation, of rejection of the obligation to produce surplus value, and to increase the value of capital, reducing the value of life."" [ 1 ] More simply he states ""Refusal of work means...I don’t want to go to work because I prefer to sleep. But this laziness is the source of intelligence, of technology, of progress. Autonomy is the self-regulation of the social body in its independence and in its interaction with the disciplinary norm."" [ 1 ] As a social development Bifo remembers ""that one of the strong ideas of the movement of autonomy proletarians during the 70s was the idea ""precariousness is good"". Job precariousness is a form of autonomy from steady regular work, lasting an entire life. In the 1970s many people used to work for a few months, then to go away for a journey, then back to work for a while. This was possible in times of almost full employment and in times of egalitarian culture. This situation allowed people to work in their own interest and not in the interest of capitalists, but quite obviously this could not last forever, and the neoliberal offensive of the 1980s was aimed to reverse the rapport de force."" [ 1 ] As a response to these developments his view is that ""the dissemination of self-organized knowledge can create a social framework containing infinite autonomous and self-reliant worlds."" [ 1 ] From this possibility of self-determination even the notion of Workers' self-management is seen as problematic since ""Far from the emergence of proletarian power, ...this self-management as a moment of the self-harnessing of the workers to capitalist production in the period of real subsumption... Mistaking the individual capitalist (who, in real subsumption disappears into the collective body of share ownership on one side, and hired management on the other) rather than the enterprise as the problem, ... the workers themselves became a collective capitalist, taking on responsibility for the exploitation of their own labor. Thus, far from breaking with 'work',...the workers maintained the practice of clocking-in, continued to organize themselves and the community around the needs of the factory, paid themselves from profits arising from the sale of watches, maintained determined relations between individual work done and wage, and continued to wear their work shirts throughout the process."" [ 24 ] In the Manifesto Against Labour , [ 25 ] Robert Kurz , formerly of Krisis-Gruppe argued against the traditional Marxist notion of class struggle as the motor of history. According to Kurz, there is no class-subject. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is not a struggle between a revolutionary class and its oppressor, but rather a struggle between two opposed interests that are integral to capitalism and form a single ""labor camp"". Contrary to traditional Marxism , then, Kurz asserts that the struggle against capitalism is not the struggle for the liberation of labor, but rather a struggle for liberation from labor. [ citation needed ] The Abolition of Work , Bob Black 's most widely read essay, draws upon the ideas of Charles Fourier , William Morris , Herbert Marcuse , Paul Goodman , and Marshall Sahlins . In it he argues for the abolition of the producer- and consumer-based society, where, Black contends, all of life is devoted to the production and consumption of commodities . Attacking Marxist state socialism as much as market capitalism , Black argues that the only way for humans to be free is to reclaim their time from jobs and employment, instead turning necessary subsistence tasks into free play done voluntarily - an approach referred to as ""ludic"". The essay argues that ""no-one should ever work"", because work - defined as compulsory productive activity enforced by economic or political means - is the source of most of the misery in the world. Black denounces work for its compulsion, and for the forms it takes - as subordination to a boss, as a ""job"" which turns a potentially enjoyable task into a meaningless chore, for the degradation imposed by systems of work-discipline, and for the large number of work-related deaths and injuries - which Black typifies as "" homicide "". He views the subordination enacted in workplaces as ""a mockery of freedom"", and denounces as hypocrites the various theorists who support freedom while supporting work. Subordination in work, Black alleges, makes people stupid and creates fear of freedom. Because of work, people become accustomed to rigidity and regularity, and do not have the time for friendship or meaningful activity. Most workers, he states, are dissatisfied with work (as evidenced by petty deviance on the job), so that what he says should be uncontroversial; however, it is controversial only because people are too close to the work-system to see its flaws. Play, in contrast, is not necessarily rule-governed, and is performed voluntarily, in complete freedom, as a gift economy . He points out that hunter-gatherer societies are typified by play, a view he backs up with the work of Marshall Sahlins ; he recounts the rise of hierarchal societies, through which work is cumulatively imposed, so that the compulsive work of today would seem incomprehensibly oppressive even to ancients and medieval peasants. He responds to the view that ""work,"" if not simply effort or energy, is necessary to get important but unpleasant tasks done, by claiming that first of all, most important tasks can be rendered ludic, or ""salvaged"" by being turned into game-like and craft-like activities, and secondly that the vast majority of work does not need doing at all. The latter tasks are unnecessary because they only serve functions of commerce and social control that exist only to maintain the work-system as a whole. As for what is left, he advocates Charles Fourier's approach of arranging activities so that people will want to do them. He is also skeptical but open-minded about the possibility of eliminating work through labor-saving technologies. He feels the left cannot go far enough in its critiques because of its attachment to building its power on the category of workers , which requires a valorization of work. Friedrich Nietzsche was a notable philosopher who presented a critique of work and an anti-work ethic. In 1881, he wrote: The eulogists of work. Behind the glorification of 'work' and the tireless talk of the 'blessings of work' I find the same thought as behind the praise of impersonal activity for the public benefit: the fear of everything individual. At bottom, one now feels when confronted with work - and what is invariably meant is relentless industry from early till late - that such work is the best police, that it keeps everybody in harness and powerfully obstructs the development of reason, of covetousness, of the desire for independence. For it uses up a tremendous amount of nervous energy and takes it away from reflection, brooding, dreaming, worry, love, and hatred; it always sets a small goal before one's eyes and permits easy and regular satisfactions. In that way a society in which the members continually work hard will have more security: and security is now adored as the supreme goddess..."" The followers of this ethic typically argue that capitalist and communist societies tend to encourage a ""labor"" mentality towards life either directly or indirectly through the cost of living , labor markets , the work week , applying normative values to economics , and social conventions. The critics then ask why with increasing mechanization the number of hours in the average work week have not fallen significantly; for example, Bob Black asks, ""Why hasn't the average work week gone down by more than a few minutes in the past fifty years?"" The devotees of the anti-work movement therefore attempt to find answers and practical solutions towards reducing the volume of work for a typical person and encouraging the activities they see as conducive to happiness. [ citation needed ] Work–life balance is a broad concept including proper prioritizing between ""work"" ( career and ambition) on one hand and ""life"" ( health , pleasure , leisure , family and spiritual development ) on the other. Related, though broader, terms include ""lifestyle balance"" and ""life balance"". The expression was first used in the late 1970s to describe the balance between an individual's work and personal life. [ 29 ] In the United States , this phrase was first used in 1986. [ citation needed ] The term slacker is commonly used to refer to a person who avoids work (especially British English), or (primarily in North American English) an educated person who is viewed as an underachiever . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] While use of the term slacker dates back to about 1790 or 1898 depending on the source, it gained some recognition during the British Gezira Scheme , when Sudanese labourers protested their relative powerlessness by working lethargically, a form of protest known as 'slacking'. [ 32 ] The term achieved a boost in popularity after its use in the films Back to the Future by Robert Zemeckis , and Richard Linklater 's Slacker . [ 30 ] [ 33 ] In the United Kingdom, the classification comprises people aged between 16 and 24 (some 16 year olds are still of compulsory school age). In Japan, the classification comprises people aged between 15 and 34 who are unemployed , unmarried, not enrolled in school or engaged in housework , and not seeking work or the technical training needed for work. The ""NEET group"" is not a uniform set of individuals but consists of those who will be NEET for a short time while essentially testing out a variety of opportunities and those who have major and often multiple issues and are at long term risk of remaining disengaged. Freeter ( フリーター , furītā ? ) (other spellings below) is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as underemployed or freelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or university but instead usually live as so-called parasite singles with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. The word freeter or freeta was first used around 1987 or 1988 and is thought to be an amalgamation of the English word free (or perhaps freelance ) and the German word Arbeiter (""worker""). [ 34 ] (The German word Arbeit is commonly used as the Japanese loanword arubaito for ""part-time job"".) It is said that the use was coined by the Japanese part-time job magazine From A (Japanese: フロムエー Furomuē ). Other possible spellings are furītā , furiita , freeta , furiitaa , or furitaa in order of frequency. [ citation needed ] Parasite single (パラサイトシングル, parasaito shinguru ) is a Japanese term for a single person who lives with their parents until their late twenties or early thirties in order to enjoy a carefree and comfortable life. In English, the expression ""sponge"" or ""basement dweller"" may sometimes be used. The expression is mainly used in reference to Japanese society, but similar phenomena can also be found in other countries worldwide. In Italy , 30-something singles still relying on their mothers are joked about, being called Bamboccioni (literally: grown-up babies) and in Germany they are known as Nesthocker (German for an altricial bird), who are still living at Hotel Mama . Such behaviour is considered normal in Greece , both because of the traditional strong family ties and because of the low wages . [ 35 ] The low income even for highly qualified university graduates does not allow young Greeks to start their own home and raise children. It is also highly encouraged in Singapore as living with parents is considered a cultural expectation, while living on one's own (sometimes even if one is married with children) is perceived as an act of insolence. [ citation needed ] Vagrancy was [ when? ] a crime in some European countries , but most of these laws have been abandoned. Laws against vagrancy in the United States have partly been invalidated as violative of the due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. [ 36 ] However, the FBI report on crime in the United States for 2005 lists 24,359 vagrancy violations. [ 37 ] In legal terminology, a person with a source of income is not a vagrant, even if he/she is homeless . [ citation needed ] Cynicism ( Greek : κυνισμός ), in its original form, refers to the beliefs of an ancient school of Greek philosophers known as the Cynics ( Greek : Κυνικοί , Latin : Cynici ). Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature . This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth , power , health , and fame , and by living a simple life free from all possessions. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society . The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes , who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE. He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope , who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens . Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes , and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire . It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christianity . The name Cynic derives from the Greek word κυνικός, kynikos , ""dog-like"" and that from κύων, kyôn , "" dog "" ( genitive : kynos ). [ 38 ] It seems certain that the word dog was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. Diogenes , in particular, was referred to as the Dog . [ 39 ] In Hinduism , sadhu is a common term for a mystic, an ascetic , practitioner of yoga ( yogi ) and/or wandering monks. The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving the fourth and final Hindu goal of life, moksha (liberation), through meditation and contemplation of Brahman . Sadhus often wear ochre -colored clothing, symbolizing renunciation. This article duplicates , in whole or part, the scope of other article(s) or section(s) .

(July 2013) Two hobos walking along railroad tracks, after being put off a train. One is carrying a bindle . While some tramps may do odd jobs from time to time, unlike other temporarily homeless people they do not seek out regular work and support themselves by other means such as begging or scavenging . This is in contrast to: bum , a stationary homeless person who does not work, and who begs or steals for a living in one place. obo , a homeless person who travels from place to place looking for work, often by "" freighthopping ,"" illegally catching rides on freight trains Both terms, ""tramp"" and ""hobo"" (and the distinction between them), were in common use between the 1880s and the 1940s. Their populations and the usage of the terms increased during the Great Depression . Tramp is derived from the Middle English as a verb meaning to ""walk with heavy footsteps"", and to go hiking. [ 43 ] Bart Kennedy , a self-described tramp of 1900 US, once said ""I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going."" [ 44 ] Gutter punks are generally characterized as being voluntarily unemployed. [ 45 ] As such, ""gutter punk"" is a term that is generally only applied to able-bodied individuals with no signs of physical or mental disabilities. The term has also been used as in the field of social science to describe a specific demographic group . Gutter punks often do seek work; however, they often search for or are limited to short-term employment. Other innovative methods of procuring income, such as panhandling, are generally considered ""last resorts"" but are often used due to the average gutter punk's difficulties in finding stable employment. Those associated with the gutter punk way of life generally do not ascribe to the crust punk ideology, however, due to its name crust punk is often confused with gutter punk. Gutter punks tend not to involve themselves with peace , autonomy , veganism or other activist ideals promoted in the crust punk or peace punk scenes.

1836	"Negotiations about how much money members of the EU should contribute to the budget over the next five years restart today, and MM took to the streets to find out if Manchester agrees with increasing UK funding. The EU Commission has called for an increase of 4.8% on its 2007-2013 budget but some members, including the UK, think it should be cut to match domestic austerity measures. The UK and several other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, have called for a real terms freeze in the EU budget and David Cameron has threatened to use his veto if the other countries call for a rise in spending. If no agreement is reached by the end of 2012 the budget will be rolled over with an increase of 2% along inflation lines. Several EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have indicated that an agreement may be unlikely today and it is clear that there is a massive divide of opinion on this issue throughout Europe. MM went out into Manchester to ask people if the UK gives too much money to the EU? Tags Allocating further funds to the EU's financial budget is like throwing away the wealth of the people again and just like what happened with the banks by propping them up, thus indebting the people of the EU to the tune of trillions of dollars for many decades to come and with that, hard times and declining standards of living. Now we the people are asked again to prop up the EU project and where the political elite are indebting the people to more decades of misery. The problem is that those that run the EU and the Commission cannot lose out, just like the bankers as they get bailed out no matter what. Indeed these people live in a parallel universe remote from reality and where they never want for anything. This even in the knowledge that 17 out of the 27 member states are in recession and where economic conditions remain dismal to say the very least. Unfortunately even Merkel knows that things will not get any better in the long-term and where in 2009 she was a lone voice in stating ""Let's not expect a miracle, because not even the boldest political decision will turn the European economy back on the path of growth"". At the time no-other EU leader agreed with her but where now how right she really was. The EU is a complete folly where it will continue to indebt our people in perpetuity and basically in many ways eventually enslave all our future generations to come to others. In this respect it will be the mother of all economic catastrophes. Time to say no more, cut our losses and start to think as intelligent people and get out of this bottomless pit of no return. For if intelligence were used, the EU concept would be seen as dead if we equate it to people benefits and new wealth creation. Unfortunately our political classes will continue the gravy train by playing the fiddle throughout whilst Europe burns. Indeed the EU is just like all empires as they decline and where those inside cannot see what is happening. In this respect the EU has all the hallmarks of a declining empire and the sooner we see this truism the better it will be for all concerned.

4204	"Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum -selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre "" screamo "". In recent years the term ""emo"" has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds. In addition to music, ""emo"" is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo began off as a style of post-hardcore [ 6 ] and emerged from the hardcore punk scene of early-1980s Washington, D.C. , both as a reaction to the increased violence within the scene and as an extension of the personal politics espoused by Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat , who had turned the focus of the music from the community back towards the individual. [ 5 ] [ 7 ] Minor Threat fan Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics. [ 8 ] Many of the band's themes would become familiar tropes in later generations of emo music, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation. [ 9 ] Their performances became public emotional purges where audience members would sometimes weep. [ 10 ] MacKaye became a huge Rites of Spring fan, recording their only album and serving as their roadie, and soon formed a new band of his own called Embrace which explored similar themes of self-searching and emotional release. [ 11 ] Guy Picciotto from Rites of Spring Similar bands soon followed in connection with the ""Revolution Summer"" of 1985, a deliberate attempt by members of the Washington, D.C. scene to break from the rigid constraints of hardcore in favor of a renewed spirit of creativity. [ 7 ] Bands such as Gray Matter , Beefeater , Fire Party , Dag Nasty , Soulside , and Kingface were connected to this movement. [ 7 ] [ 11 ] The exact origins of the term ""emo"" are uncertain, but date back to at least 1985. According to Andy Greenwald , author of Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo , ""The origins of the term 'emo' are shrouded in mystery ... but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore."" [ 11 ] Michael Azerrad , author of Our Band Could Be Your Life , also traces the word's origins to this time: ""The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested, although the term and the approach thrived for at least another fifteen years, spawning countless bands."" [ 12 ] MacKaye also traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in Thrasher magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as ""emo-core"", which he called ""the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my entire life."" [ 13 ] Other accounts attribute the term to an audience member at an Embrace show, who yelled that the band was ""emocore"" as an insult. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Others contend that MacKaye coined the term when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring. [ 15 ] The ""emocore"" label quickly spread around the Washington, D.C. punk scene and became attached to many of the bands associated with Ian MacKaye 's Dischord Records label. [ 14 ] Although many of these bands simultaneously rejected the term, it stuck nonetheless. Scene veteran Jenny Toomey has recalled that ""The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. [Rites of Spring] existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music ' grunge ,' where you were using the term even though you hated it."" [ 18 ] The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years. By 1986 most of the major bands of the movement—including Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter, and Beefeater—had broken up. [ 19 ] Even so, the ideas and aesthetics originating from the scene spread quickly across the country via a network of homemade zines , vinyl records, and hearsay. [ 20 ] According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for all subsequent incarnations of emo: “ What had happened in D.C. in the mid-eighties—the shift from anger to action, from extroverted rage to internal turmoil, from an individualized mass to a mass of individuals—was in many ways a test case for the transformation of the national punk scene over the next two decades. The imagery, the power of the music, the way people responded to it, and the way the bands burned out instead of fading away—all have their origins in those first few performances by Rites of Spring. The roots of emo were laid, however unintentionally, by fifty or so people in the nation's capital. And in some ways, it was never as good and surely never as pure again. Certainly, the Washington scene was the only time ""emocore"" had any consensus definition as a genre . [ 21 ] ” MacKaye and Picciotto, along with Rites of Spring drummer Brendan Canty , went on to form the highly influential band named Fugazi who, despite sometimes being connected with the term ""emo"", are not commonly recognized as an emo band. [ 22 ] Reinvention: Early 1990s As the ideals of the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, many bands in numerous local scenes began to emulate the sound as a way to marry the intensity of hardcore with the complex emotions associated with growing older. [ 23 ] The style combined the fatalism, theatricality, and outsiderness of The Smiths with the uncompromising and dramatic worldview of hardcore. [ 23 ] Although the bands were numerous and the locales varied, the aesthetics of emocore in the late 1980s remained more or less the same: ""over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music."" [ 23 ] However, in the early 1990s, several new bands reinvented the emo style and carried its core characteristic, the intimacy between bands and fans, into the new decade. [ 24 ] Chief among these were Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate , both of whom fostered cult followings, recontextualized the word ""emo"", and brought it a step closer to the mainstream. [ 24 ] According to Andy Greenwald: “ Sunny Day Real Estate was emo's head and Jawbreaker its busted gut—the two overlapped in the heart, then broke up before they made it big. Each had a lasting impact on the world of independent music. The bands shared little else but fans, and yet somehow the combination of the two lays down a fairly effective blueprint for everything that was labeled emo for the next decade . [ 24 ] ” In the wake of the 1991 success of Nirvana 's Nevermind , underground music and subcultures in the United States became big business. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts were able to access the national stage. [ 24 ] Teenagers across the country declared themselves fans of independent music, and being punk became mainstream. [ 24 ] In this new musical climate, the aesthetics of emo expanded into the mainstream and altered the way the music was perceived: ""Punk rock no-nos like the cult of personality and artistic abstraction suddenly become de rigueur "", says Greenwald. ""If one definition of emo has always been music that felt like a secret, Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate were cast in the rolls of the biggest gossips of all, reigning as the largest influences on every emo band that came after them."" [ 25 ] Jawbreaker has been referred to as ""the Rosetta Stone of contemporary emo"". [ 25 ] Emerging from the San Francisco punk rock scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, their songwriting combined the heft of hardcore punk with pop punk sensibilities and the tortured artistry of mid-1980s emocore. [ 25 ] Singer/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach focused his lyrics on topics that were personal, immediate, and lived, often lifting them directly from his journal. [ 27 ] Though they were often obscure and cloaked in metaphors , their specificity to Schwarzenbach's own concerns gave the words a bitterness and frustration that made them universal and magnetic to audiences. [ 28 ] Schwarzenbach became emo's first idol as listeners related to the singer more than the songs themselves. [ 28 ] Jawbreaker's 1994 album 24 Hour Revenge Therapy became their most-loved amongst fans and is a touchstone of mid-1990s emo. [ 29 ] The band signed to major label Geffen Records and toured with Nirvana and Green Day , but their 1995 album Dear You sold poorly and they broke up soon after, with Schwarzenbach later forming Jets to Brazil . [ 30 ] Their influence lived on, however, through later successful emo and pop punk bands openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound.

Sunny Day Real Estate 's sound challenged other bands to reach further with their own music. ""Seven"" helped bring emo towards the mainstream when it received airplay on MTV . [ 32 ] This song shows their style of emo going under the indie rock style, which was involved in the 1990s reinvention of emo. Sunny Day Real Estate formed in Seattle during the height of the early-1990s grunge boom. [ 33 ] In contrast to Jawbreaker, its members were accomplished musicians with high-quality gear, lofty musical ambitions, intricate songwriting, and a sweeping, epic sound. [ 33 ] Frontman Jeremy Enigk sang desperately, in a falsetto register, about losing himself and subsuming himself in something greater, often using haphazard lyrics and made-up words. [ 34 ] The band's debut album Diary (1994) was over-the-top and romantic, and the music video for ""Seven"" received airplay on MTV . [ 35 ] The band's ambitious sound challenged other bands to reach further with their own music in sentiment, instrumentation, and metaphor, and represented a generational shift between grunge and emo. [ 32 ] Other emo-leaning punk bands soon followed suit, and the word ""emo"" began to shift from being vague and undefined to referring to a specific type of emotionally overbearing music that was romantic but distanced from the political nature of punk rock. [ 36 ] Sunny Day Real Estate fell apart after Diary , as Enigk became a born-again Christian and launched a solo career while the other members drifted into new projects such as the Foo Fighters . They released three more albums through a series of breakups and occasional reunions, but are remembered primarily for the promise of their debut and the shift it engendered in the tastes of underground rock fans. [ 37 ] Underground popularity: Mid-1990s In the mid-1990s the American punk and indie rock movements, which had been largely underground since the early 1980s, became part of mainstream culture. After Nirvana 's success, major record labels capitalized on the popularity of alternative rock and other underground music by signing numerous independent bands and spending large amounts of capital promoting them. [ 41 ] In 1994, the same year that Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy and Sunny Day Real Estate's Diary were released, punk rock acts Green Day and The Offspring had multiplatinum successes with their respective albums Dookie and Smash . In the wake of the underground going mainstream, over the next several years emo as a genre retreated, reformed, and morphed into a national subculture, then eventually something more. [ 41 ] Drawing inspiration from bands like Jawbreaker , Drive Like Jehu , and Fugazi , the new sound of emo was a mixture of hardcore 's passion and indie rock 's intelligence, bearing the anthemic power of punk rock and its do-it-yourself work ethic but with smoother songs, sloppier melodies, and yearning vocals. [ 42 ] The Promise Ring were one of the premier bands of the new emo style. Their music took a slower, smoother, pop punk approach to hardcore riffs, blending them with singer Davey von Bohlen 's goofy, picturesque lyrics delivered with a froggy croon and pronounced lisp , and they played shows in basements and VFW halls [ 50 ] Jade Tree released their debut 30° Everywhere in 1996 and it sold tens of thousands of copies, a blockbuster by independent standards. [ 51 ] Greenwald describes the effect of the album as ""like being hit in the head with cotton candy."" [ 52 ] Other bands such as Karate , The Van Pelt , Joan of Arc , and The Shyness Clinic incorporated elements of post-rock and noise rock into the emo sound. [ 53 ] The common lyrical thread between these bands was ""applying big questions to small scenarios."" [ 53 ] A cornerstone of mid-1990s emo was Weezer 's 1996 album Pinkerton . [ 55 ] Following the success of their multiplatinum debut , Pinkerton turned from their power pop sound to a much darker, more abrasive character. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Frontman Rivers Cuomo 's songs were obsessed with messy, manipulative sex and his own insecurities of dealing with celebrity. [ 57 ] A critical and commercial failure, [ 57 ] [ 58 ] it was ranked by Rolling Stone as the second-worst album of the year. [ 59 ] Cuomo retreated from the public eye, [ 57 ] later referring to the album as ""hideous"" and ""a hugely painful mistake"". [ 60 ] However, Pinkerton found enduring appeal with teenagers just discovering alternative rock , who were drawn to its confessional lyrics and themes of rejection and came to believe that it was directed at them. [ 54 ] Sales grew steadily as word of the album passed between fans, over online messageboards, and via Napster . [ 54 ] ""Although no one was paying attention"", says Greenwald, ""perhaps because no one was paying attention— Pinkerton became the most important emo album of the decade."" [ 54 ] When Weezer returned in 2000, however, they did so with a decidedly pop sound. Cuomo refused to play songs from Pinkerton , dismissing it as ""ugly"" and ""embarrassing"". [ 61 ] Nevertheless, the album held its appeal and eventually achieved both high sales and critical praise, and is noted for introducing emo to larger and more mainstream audiences. [ 62 ] The emo aesthetic of the mid-1990s was embodied in Mineral, whose albums The Power of Failing (1997) and EndSerenading (1998) encapsulated the emo tropes of somber music accompanied by a shy narrator singing seriously about mundane problems. [ 63 ] Greenwald calls their song ""If I Could"" ""the ultimate expression of mid-nineties emo. The song's short synopsis—she is beautiful, I am weak, dumb, and shy; I am alone but am surprisingly poetic when left alone—sums up everything that emo's adherents admired and its detractors detested."" [ 63 ] Another significant band of the era was Braid, whose 1998 album Frame and Canvas and B-side song ""Forever Got Shorter"" blurred the lines between band and listener, as the group was a mirror-image of its own audience in passion and sentiment and sang in the voice of their fans. [ 64 ] Though the emo style of the mid-1990s had thousands of young fans, it never broke into the national consciousness. [ 66 ] A few bands were offered contracts with major record labels, but most broke up before they could capitalize on the opportunity. [ 67 ] Jimmy Eat World signed to Capitol Records in 1995 and built a following among the emo community with their album Static Prevails , but did not break into the mainstream despite their major-label association as their music was mostly lost amongst the popular ska movement of the period. [ 68 ] The Promise Ring were the most commercially successful emo band of the time, with sales of their 1997 album Nothing Feels Good topping out in the mid-five figures. [ 66 ] Greenwald calls the album ""the pinnacle of its generation of emo: a convergence of pop and punk, of resignation and celebration, of the lure of girlfriends and the pull of friends, bandmates, and the road."" [ 69 ] He refers to mid-1990s emo as ""the last subculture made of vinyl and paper instead of plastic and megabytes."" [ 70 ] Independent success: Late 1990s and early 2000s Beginning in the late 1990s emo had a surge of popularity in the realm of independent music, as a number of notable acts and record labels experienced successes that would lay the foundation for the style's later mainstream breakthrough. As emo gained a larger fanbase the music business began see its marketing potential, and as big business entered the picture many of the acts previously associated with the term intentionally distanced themselves from it: “ As the '90s wore to a close, the music that was being labeled emo was making a connection with a larger and larger group of people. the aspects of it that were the most contagious—the sensitivity, hooks, and average-guy appeal—were also the easiest to latch onto, replicate, and mass market. As with any phenomenon—exactly like what happened with Sunny Day [Real Estate]—when business enters into a high-stakes, highly personal sphere, things tend to go awry very quickly ... As fans threatened to storm the emo bandwagon, the groups couldn't jump off of it fast enough. The popularity and bankability of the word—if not the music—transformed an affiliation with the mid-nineties version of emo into an albatross . [ 71 ] Jimmy Eat World's 1999 album Clarity was one of the most significant emo albums of the late 1990s and became a touchstone for later emo bands. [ 75 ] Writing in 2003, Andy Greenwald called it ""one of the most fiercely beloved rock 'n' roll records of the last decade. It is name-checked by every single contemporary emo band as their favorite album, as a mind-bending milemarker that proved that punk rock could be tuneful, emotional, wide-ranging, and ambitious."" [ 75 ] However, despite warm critical reception and promotion of the single "" Lucky Denver Mint "" in the Drew Barrymore comedy film Never Been Kissed , Clarity was commercially unsuccessful in a musical climate dominated by teen pop, and the band left major label Capitol Records the following year. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Nevertheless, the album gained steady popularity via word-of-mouth and was treasured by fans, eventually selling over 70,000 copies. [ 76 ] Jimmy Eat World self-financed the recording of their next album Bleed American (2001) before signing to Dreamworks Records . The album sold 30,000 copies in its first week and went gold shortly after. In 2002 it went platinum as emo broke into the mainstream. [ 77 ] In a world where cars are advertised as punk, Green Day members are platinum rock stars, and getting pierced and tatted up is as natural as a sweet-sixteen party, everyone is free to come up with their own definition of punk—and everyone is ready to embrace it. Emo had always connected with young people—it had just never aggressively marketed itself to them . [ 83 ] In the summer of 2001 Vagrant organized a national tour featuring every band on the label, sponsored by corporations such as Microsoft and Coca-Cola . This populist approach and the use of the internet as a marketing tool helped Vagrant become one of the country's most successful independent labels and also helped to popularize the term ""emo"". [ 90 ] According Greenwald, ""More than any other event, it was Vagrant America that defined emo to masses—mainly because it had the gumption to hit the road and bring it to them ."" [ 87 ] The media business, so desperate for its self-obsessed, post-9/11 predictions of a return to austerity and the death of irony to come true, had found its next big thing. But it was barely a ""thing,"" because no one had heard of it, and those who had couldn't define it. Despite the fact that the hedonistic, materialistic hip-hop of Nelly was still dominating the charts, magazine readers in the summer of '02 were informed that the nation was deep in an introverted healing process, and the way it was healing was by wearing thick black glasses and vintage striped shirts. Emo, we were told, would heal us all through fashion . [ 103 ] ” In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the style became a marketable product. [ 104 ] Dreamworks Records senior A&R representative Luke Wood remarked that ""The industry really does look at emo as the new raprock, or the new grunge. I don't think that anyone is listening to the music that's being made—they're thinking of how they're going to take advantage of the sound's popularity at retail."" [ 105 ] The depoliticized nature of emo, coupled with its catchy music and accessible themes, gave it a broad appeal to young mainstream audiences. Emo staple band Taking Back Sunday would continue to find major success in the years that followed, with their 2004 album Where You Want To Be charting at #3 in the Billboard 200 , with the second single of the album "" This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know) "" being featured in the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack, and their 2006 album Louder Now , with Louder Now being the band's breakout into the mainstream and charting at #2 in the Billboard 200 , notably because of the popularity of its lead single "" MakeDamnSure "", both albums would be certified gold by the RIAA with Where You Want To Be having sold 667,000 copies as of September 2005, and Louder Now having sold over 900,000 copies as of June 9, 2008. At the same time, a darker, more aggressive offshoot of emo gained popularity. New Jersey–based Thursday signed a multi-million-dollar, multialbum contract with Island Def Jam on the strength of their 2001 album Full Collapse , which reached No. 178 on the Billboard 200. [ 106 ] Their music differed from the prominent emo bands of the time in that it was more politicized and lacked dominant pop hooks and anthems, drawing influence from more maudlin bands such as The Smiths , Joy Division , and The Cure . However, the band's accessibility, openness, basement-show roots, and touring alongside bands like Saves the Day made them part of the emo movement. [ 107 ] As the genre coalesced, the record label Fueled by Ramen became a center of the movement, releasing platinum selling albums from bands like Fall Out Boy , Panic! at the Disco , and Paramore . [ 138 ] Two main regional scenes developed; in Florida the scene was created by the label Fueled by Ramen and the band Dashboard Confessional , and in the Midwest emo-pop was promoted by Pete Wentz, whose band Fall Out Boy rose to the front of the style in the mid-2000s. [ 138 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] In 2008, the band Cash Cash released Take It to the Floor , which Allmusic stated could be ""the definitive statement of airheaded, glittery, and content-free emo-pop"". [ 158 ] Allmusic further stated that with this release ""the transformation of emo from the expression of intensely felt, ripped-from-the-throat feelings played by bands directly influenced by post-punk and hardcore to mall-friendly Day-Glo pop played by kids who look about as authentic as the ""punks"" on an old episode of Quincy did back in the '70s was made pretty much complete"". [ 158 ] Screamo The term ""screamo"" was initially applied to a more aggressive offshoot of emo that developed in San Diego in 1991, which used short songs that grafted ""spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics."" [ 159 ] Screamo is a particularly dissonant style of emo influenced by hardcore punk [ 108 ] and uses typical rock instrumentation, but is noted for its brief compositions, chaotic execution, and screaming vocals . Some bands that formed in the United States during the late 1990s and remained active throughout the 2000s, such as Thursday , Thrice , and Poison the Well made screamo much more popular. Many of these bands took influence from the likes of post-hardcore bands like Refused and At the Drive-In . [ 108 ] By the mid-2000s, the over-saturation of the screamo scene caused many bands to purposefully expand past the genre's trademarks and incorporate more experimental elements. [ 108 ] Even bands that weren't necessarily screamo would often use the style's characteristic guttural vocal style. [ 108 ] Derek Miller, guitarist for the post-hardcore band Poison the Well , claimed that the term screamo ""describes a thousand different genres."" [ 165 ] According to Jeff Mitchell of Iowa State Daily , ""there is no set definition of what screamo sounds like but screaming over once deafeningly loud rocking noise and suddenly quiet, melodic guitar lines is a theme commonly affiliated with the genre."" [ 166 ] Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre , alleged that the term ""has been kind of tainted in a way, especially in the States."" [ 111 ] Fashion Emo fashion took a noticeable turn in the 2000s; from being clean-cut to more punk looking. Today emo is commonly tied to both music and fashion as well as the emo subculture. [ 176 ] Usually among teens, the term ""emo"" is stereotyped with wearing jeans , sometimes in bright colors and may often be close-fitting, and t-shirts (usually short-sleeved) which often bear the names of emo bands. Studded belts and black wristbands can be associated in emo fashion. Some males can also be often wearing thick, black horn-rimmed glasses. [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] The emo fashion is also recognized for its hairstyles. Popular looks include thin, flat and smooth hair with lots of hair on the sides and back of the head with long side-swept bangs , sometimes covering one or both eyes. Also, another thing that was popular is hair that is straightened or dyed black. Bright colors, such as blue, pink, red, or bleached blond, are also typical as highlights in emo hairstyles. Short, choppy layers of hair are also common. [ 180 ] This fashion has at times been characterized as a fad . [ 181 ] However, in the early 2000s, emo fashion was associated with a clean cut look instead, but changed as it spread to teens. [ 177 ] Emo fashion also has been often confused with goth fashion [ 182 ] and scene fashion. [ 183 ] Suicide and self harm Emo music has been blamed for the suicide by hanging of teenager Hannah Bond by both the coroner at the inquest into her death and her mother, Heather Bond, after it was claimed that emo music glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with My Chemical Romance was said to be linked to her suicide. The inquest heard that she was part of an Internet ""emo cult"" [ 189 ] and her Bebo page contained an image of an ""emo girl"" with bloody wrists. [ 190 ] It also heard that she had discussed the ""glamour"" of hanging online [ 189 ] and had explained to her parents that her self-harming was an ""emo initiation ceremony"". [ 190 ] Heather Bond criticised emo fashion, saying: ""There are 'emo' websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves."" After the verdict was reported in NME , fans of emo music contacted the magazine to defend against accusations that it promotes self-harm and suicide. [ 191 ] Gender bias Emo has been criticized for its androcentrism . [ 192 ] Andy Greenwald notes that there are very few women in emo bands, and that even those few do not typically have an active voice in the songs' subject matter: ""Though emo—and to a certain degree, punk—has always been a typically male province, the monotony of the labels' gender perspective can be overwhelming."" [ 193 ] The triumph of the ""lonely boy's aesthetic"" in emo, coupled with the style's popularity, has led to a litany of one-sided songs in which males vent their fury at the women who have wronged them: [ 193 ] Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments in a veneer of pop music. [ 194 ] ""Fuck Emo"" graffiti on a wall in Mexico. However, despite emo's frequent portrayal of women as powerless victims, fans of the style are from both genders, and some acts have even greater popularity with women than with men. [ 195 ] One explanation for this is that the unifying appeal of emo, its expression of emotional devastation, can be appreciated equally by both sexes regardless of the songs' specific subjects. [ 196 ] Backlash The genre emo inspired a backlash movement in response to its rapid growth. Several bands considered to be ""emo"" rejected the label for the social stigma and controversy surrounding it. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman stated that there was a ""real backlash"" among bands on the tour towards emo groups, but he dismissed the hostility as ""juvenile"" in nature. [ 201 ] The movement grew with intensity over time. Time reported in 2008 that ""anti-emo"" groups attacked teenagers in Mexico City, Querétaro , and Tijuana . [ 202 ] [ 203 ] In Russia, a law was presented at the Duma to regulate emo websites and forbid emo style at schools and government buildings, for fears of emo being a ""dangerous teen trend"" promoting anti-social behaviour, depression, social withdrawal and even suicide. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] In May 2010 in Saudi Arabia , the religious police in the city of Dammam arrested 10 emo girls for allegedly offensive un-Islamic behaviour and dress. [ 206 ] In March 2012 reports by human rights activists suggested that, in a single month, Shia militias in Iraq had shot or beaten to death up to 58 young Iraqi emos. [ 207 ] ^ Greenwald, pp. 17–18. ""Fugazi is one of the best and most influential groups of the last thirty years—and yet, despite some opinion to the contrary, they are not an emo band.

27580	"The trust's 12th annual gala held at the Liberty Grand on May 30 ""let you embrace your inner rock star, while helping to raise much-needed funds to provide information, treatment and support for brain tumour patients and their families,"" said Nancy Pencer, president of the Gerry & Nancy Pencer Brain Trust. Holly Pencer-Bellman, the Pencers' daughter and executive director of the Brain Trust, said that ""Feb. 3, 2012, marked the 14th year since my dad, Gerry Pencer, passed away from glioblastoma multiforme -- the most aggressive type of brain cancer. Gerry was diagnosed in May 1997 with a brain tumour. At that time there were neither support groups nor clinical trials available. There was no consolidation of care. ""His vision was to create a one-stop shop for brain tumour patients and their families: a treatment centre at Princess Margaret that would consolidate all of the treatments, have the best doctors and supportive care programs under one roof."" The Pencer Centre has an international reputation as a brain tumour treatment and research centre, not only for its state-of-the art medical treatments and enhanced patient-centred care, but also as a significant contributor to leading-edge research. At the gala attended by 800 guests, Harley-Davidson motorcycles added to the rock atmosphere in the Viper Room. Guests who were decked out in rocker attire had the opportunity to purchase ""rock box"" prizes. For $100, you got a box and inside every box was a prize with a minimum value of $100, ranging from gift certificates to jewelry. There was also a $10,000 cash prize raffle. The early part of the evening featured Supper Under the Stars for some 200 sponsors who contributed at least $14,000, a performance by Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Marc Cohn -- who's known for his signature song Walking in Memphis -- and a live auction. Former Pencer Centre patients Lynne Terry and Yves Boucher both thanked the sponsors at the Supper Under the Stars, calling the Pencer Centre an exceptional place that allowed them to be normal and keep on living their lives. ""Cancer is a word, not a sentence. The Pencer Centre makes that sentiment real. We're both living proof."" Richard Saunders, president of Redstone Pictures, who provided video production services for the gala, said the ""crowd the Pencer Brain Trust brings out, the amount of money they are able to raise and the way its pulled together has everyone buzzing in the city. It's really something."" Guest Sara Waxman, publisher of Dine magazine, said ""all charity events and health fundraising events are important... treatments for diseases of the brain is something that touches us all.""

19104	"Australia must find a Budget surplus before 2014 or it will lose its AAA rating, according Kyran Curry, S&P sovereign analyst via the AFR : ""If there's a sustained delay in returning the balance to surplus, as the economy gathers momentum and as people start spending again, as the import demand picks up and current account blows out, we might not see the government's fiscal position as being strong enough to offset weaknesses on the external side and that's what worries us...Australia's already, as we see it, got some credit metrics that are right off the scale when it comes to assessing Australia's external position...It's got high levels of external liabilities, it's got very weak external liquidity and that basically means the banks are very highly indebted compared to their peers...For us, we look to Spain, which was Australia's closest peer four or five years ago in terms of having a very strong fiscal position, very similar to what Australia has at the moment, its external position was weaker, like Australia's, and it got routed very quickly...The government needed to provide support to the banks, it had to shore up growth in the economy and its debt levels more than doubled...We can see that happening in Australia's case."" I've feared this outcome since the GFC. Here's what I wrote back in June: In short, if the sovereign gets downgraded, so do the banks and their cost of funds rises, either raising the price of credit and/or restricting its distribution. The RBA will aim to offset this with rate cuts but how low can they go? In a global recession scenario, the RBA is probably also constrained by the need to keep some yield spread between our rates and those oversees so that capital doesn't flee our shores. Potentially then, the resulting hit to asset prices raises unemployment further than otherwise and the automatic stabilisers become more onerous for the Budget requiring more cuts or borrowing or both. Another downgrade might follow, so on and so forth. I would alter that now a little. Given the mining boom peak is in sight, there is no longer any need for a global recession scenario for this to play out. The RBA has already been forced into cutting interest rates to emergency levels. The great likelihood is that they will go lower still. In short, all that needs to happen is that China continue a steady adjustment towards consumption-led growth and bulk commodity prices remain in current ranges and the rating will come under pressure, risking the feedback loop. The kicker of course is that it may happen anyway because fiscal tightening is already required to support the rating when the economy is not strong enough. That is, we are already in the feedback loop. In this context it makes sense that we revisit the tax base, which is what the independents want to do. Also from the AFR , Rob Oakeshott: ""If we can't make taxes like the GST more efficient to deal with pressing spending, then Australia is in a bad place...We need to look at broadening the base and in that get rid of some of the inefficient state taxes in a country where four taxes do 90 per cent of the work. We need to be brave -- because without some solution, there is no money to do what the government needs to, particularly with an ageing population and programs like Gonski and the NDIS [national disability insurance scheme],"" Mr Windsor said middle-class welfare programs such as the $5000 baby bonus meant that policies such as the Gonski education overhaul, which would improve skills in the workforce, were being deprived of billions of dollars. ""People want spending on health and education, not on hamburgers and milkshakes,"" Mr Windsor said. ""The middle-class welfare started 10 years ago when we had the money to do it, that's not the case any more, but it's difficult once you've given someone something to?take it away from them."" Certainly anything that boosts productivity will help avoid the feedback loop but let's not kid ourselves, raising the GST as the private sector disleverages, let alone deleverages, is going to hit consumption growth and government revenues. The middle class welfare we are discussing cuts across all groups, as the SMH makes clear today: THE richest fifth of households receive nearly half of all the wages paid in Australia but also get about 12 per cent of all government handouts, new research by the Bureau of Statistics shows...the poorest 20 per cent of households receive just 2.5 per cent of the nation's wages and salaries in 2009-10 while the richest 20 per cent gets about 47 per cent. When income, government cash payments and social transfers in kind (such as public education and healthcare) are taken into account the poorest fifth's share of ""adjusted disposable income"" was 11 per cent and the richest fifth 36 per cent. But maybe the most revealing finding was the amount of government assistance being transferred to high-income households. The preliminary results showed the richest quintile of households received about 12 per cent of social assistance benefits while the next highest quintile got 11 per cent. Many high-income households qualify for the childcare rebate, which is not means tested, and the private health insurance rebate. As I've said for three years, we're in a feedback loop that is slowly gathering pace. Keep borrowing offshore and lose the AAA rating as the current account deficit blows out. Stop borrowing offshore and as growth slumps and governments can't reach surplus to protect legacy private sector debts, taxes must rise, hitting growth...and government revenues. Our one real hope to sail clear is to boost exports and grow via external demand. But while we stuff around letting the high dollar hollow us out, the maelstrom draws us ever nearer. Also, however you look at it, people who earn more and spend more pay more with broad based taxes. Even a flat income tax rate, the more you earn the more you pay. This is basic mathematics. Saying that, there is no reason anyone in the highest quintile of income should be receiving government benefits (actual handouts, because tax cuts are not 'benefits'). Welfare of any kind should be available only to those that need it to survive, ie buy food and put a roof over their heads, not buy cigarettes and booze. I just want a complete list. Without it, how can I know what people are talking about? The term ""middle-class welfare"" is more of a concept. I would gather that most people's view of welfare is to offer means of income support for those that can not acquire enough income of their own, to even satisfy what would be considered the minimum quality of life. Thus those than can not work due to disability, or age invaliding them, or those unable to obtain a job. However, a sense of entitlement has begun to pervade the landscape in Australia, where various taxpayers feel that is they put-in to the welfare kitty, they 'deserve' to get something out. So what we have is vast payments, such as family tax act A, which is the second largest category of transfer payments. bearing in mind, this is how the major components of income support payments bear out... I agree with dumping all of these other than the childcare rebates as these basically pay for themselves. More women working means more income tax, more stuff bought due to higher income means more GST, etc etc... Then again, if I could import a maid and pay them $400 a month to take care of my son and keep my house (as is done in South Asia), I'd be more than happy to give up this rebate. Don't see it happening though. LOL ... 'tis all about perspective, and the specific object of attention at the time, dontcha know? Which is why I prefer to largely set aside these more peripheral topics, and focus on identifying the root problem, why and how it exists, and what can/should be done about it... Why? All of Ireland, Spain and Australia had conservative, well managed public balance sheets until the private sector debt ended up on it, in the first two cases. All of those countries had a reliance on one or two asset classes, that eventually funnelled into one, large, debt-blown one, that exploded in the face of politicians. Why would Australia's governing class react any differently? Ireland still has huge export oriented sector worth around 65% of GDP (mostly pharmaceutical/chemical and IT). Even now they export pharma stuff worth $70b. That is 3 times more per capita than all our dirt. In fact, Irish pharmaceutical export per capita alone is almost twice our total export. I think that the RBA will only have limited success with it's plan to stimulate housing. perhaps we will have a small oversupply in the future, but nothing near the size of Ireland or Spain. Demand can be elastic, but it can't stay contracted forever. The currency will correct and it will probably take everyone by surprise. Yes that will create higher inflation, but it won't be the first time that the RBA overlooked short term high inflation, although this time it will be above past incidents. The ratings agencies have been ignored by the bond investors, why would we be significantly different, and in any case we have little public debt. Our house prices have not reached the dizzy heights that they did in Spain and Ireland. Although construction rate was below average, population growth was above the average, over the last 5 year census period we built 100k homes more than needed. That's on top of large existing oversupply. We have a private debt that leads the world, an employment basis reliant on one industry (which is going into relative decline going forward) a non competitive economic base, and a banking system with a narrow funding base which the government has implicitly backed. 'Our house prices have not reached the dizzy heights that they did in Spain and Ireland.' Oh yeah? Plenty of people have made and are still making the case that they have actually gone higher. Australia's insane real estate prices are at the very core of the economic deformity Australia has become. Raveswei above -- you make a good point about Ireland and one I have attempted to make here before. Ireland specifically targeted development of its export sector generally by a generous tax regime which attracted a range of multinationals to its shores. PF, you said: ""What Ireland and Spain taught us was that when you overbuild the market crashes like a stone in double quick time. Those links that you posted [http://www.independent.ie/business/iris\\... ; http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychar\\... show the following: - there was a massive overbuild in Ireland - there was simultaneously a massive run up in prices in Ireland (even worse than in Australia on just about any metric) I fail to see how the links don't directly contradict your statement. Yes, the crash came in Ireland, but it took YEARS to happen, well after the bubble had been identified by dispassionate observers. And what about our own cache of empty houses? Until prices crash these aren't seen as overhang, but the situation quickly changes when property becomes a toxic asset class at the same time as population growth slows because immigration slows or stops. On a separate note, the minebot and I are ad idem on Ireland. It's held out as a basket case but there are MANY things that we could learn from Ireland about creating value-added export industries from scratch. This will pull them through, stronger than ever and much, much wiser for what's happened in the past 5 years. People tend to look at GDP figures only, without understanding how economy is actually performing. Ireland is export oriented economy with large trade surplus of $85b ($19k per capita). We are on the other hand import oriented country ($1.9k trade surplus per capita) with higher external debt. They plan to use surplus to pay off the debt. How we are planing to pay off our debt? Ireland and Spain fell in double quick time aided by a banking crisis in both countries. Refer to the link to ""The Economist"" interactive. Now that their bubbles have corrected -- they are still HIGHER than us. The Melbourne water use study that you linked to is interesting, but hardly conclusive in absolute terms. I'm aware that in some areas we do have an oversupply, but after we have all waited 4 years for a nationwide correction caused by this phantom oversupply, I suggest that we would have to be completely mad to not re-evaluate in the absence of any significant correction. I appreciate that you draw a different conclusion, but that is mine until I see evidence to the contrary. (BTW, I did include the link to the overbuild article but for some reason there was no hyperlink.) The way the Economist chart works is quite confusing because it's all based to the start date. If you start the comparison from 1975 you will get all sorts of wacky results because Ireland was basically a 3rd world theocracy back then. If you look at where the most recent bubble started (I make it to be around 1996), you'll see that real Irish prices have come down to now be 50% higher than at the start of the bubble. In Oz that figure is 100%. Prices against average income, we have seen a similar rise to post-bubble Ireland over the same period: 40%. Prices against rents, we're at about a 70% increase and Ireland a mere 40%. So as I read that data we certainly have a long way to fall on most measures if we're to catch up to where Ireland is now. McPaddy that graph by the economist doesn't track prices, it tracks the price/income ratio. Some of the correction may be related to income falls. Judging by your sign on name you may have more information on that that I do. Read what Terry McFadgen wrote further down this thread, and note that it was agreed with. I really don't mind if you believe in a housing surplus in Melbourne. It may be so in the new outer ring suburbs, in fact I expected it to be so, but that isn't what the market is telling me, and I believe the market given the length of time and the lack of exhuberation in that market. PF, I'll put my hand up and admit (in case it isn't obvious) that I have no special knowledge about the Melbourne situation. My broader point remains that what can appear to be a tight supply situation (with people fighting each other to get on the ladder) can quickly transform into a glut of supply when RE starts to be viewed as a toxic ticket to debt bondage and capital annihilation, as it has been viewed in Ireland these past 5 years. The demand is simply sucked out of the market much quicker than supply can follow it down. A small point but if you go back to that Economist graph you'll note that there are many metrics you can compare, some of which are the ones I quoted. It's the drop down menu in the top left hand corner. Date range can also be adjusted to provide a data set that is in my view much more instructive than that starting from 1975. Just my 2c on that Mav ... ""winning"" an election is not carte blanche to do whatever you want, back whatever parties/policies you want, if such action flies contrary to the general tenor of your electorate's wishes. Of course, knowing precisely what that tenor is can be unclear and/or subjective ... hence why I advocate restructuring our political system towards Direct Democracy principles such as those practiced in Switzerland and elsewhere, whereby the electorate is empowered to hold their ""winning"" representative directly accountable for his/her actions during their term of office, including the potential blockage / reversal of any legislation they may pass or seek to pass that is contrary to the electorate's wishes. Oakshott does represent his constituents, he has a go for small business and he is not corrupt, so on that front he miles ahead of the labor party. He is a decent fellow like most Nationals but without the social conservatism. Anyway I dont think its a given he will be tossed out by the coalition as they are fighting between themselves at the moment on how they tackle Lynne As opinion8red states, winning an election is not a license to do with as you please. He won the election, I understand that you lean left and support Labor but I honestly cannot see you having the same attitude has Wilkie supported the Coalition and put them in power instead. Oakshot presides over a conservative electorate that given a one or the other choice would have put the Coalition into power and it wouldn't have even been close. He was elected to represent his electorate, he hasn't done that and in a just world will be booted out next election as he deserves. Who's ignoring reality? I really do love the post rationalisation here. Who do you think his electorate wanted him to side with? Yes, he's an independent but he is still there to represent the wishes of his electorate. What do you think his electorate wanted? Like I said, had Wilkie sided with the Coalition you, and ALP supporters everywhere, would be up in arms. You can say ""yeah well that didn't happen so me"" all you want, you know it's true. MattR: I have no doubt the majority of Oakeshott's electorate is conservative and I have no doubt the majority would have preferred he sided with Abbott in 2010. However, I just like what the guy says. Is that allowed? In this Parliament the people of Lyne have a representative who speaks his mind and has some real influence over policy. In the next Parliament the people of Lyne will have an anonymous National Party MP who will do neither. ... And, as Mav pointed out, he's a former Nat who was elected as an independent, and by siding with the Gillard government he sure has demonstrated his independence! MattR, wiki says -- In his first term (2007), Oakeshott voted 32 times with the ruling Labor government (including in support of the proposed emission trading scheme) and nine times with the opposition. His ""conservative"" electorate knew all this before electing him for the 2nd term (2010). Lorax, you are certainly allowed to like him. I was merely commenting on the fact that for such a 'great' MP he doesn't have any integrity at all. Nothing says you can't like him though. Mav, polling is very clear as to what his electorate wanted him to do. He sided with the ALP and will almost certainly lose his seat now. You are essentially saying ""he got elected he can do what he wants"". Independent or not, the minute the parliament became hung this became irrelevant. At that time it was his DUTY as his electorates representative to side the with party they wanted him to side with. Simply saying ""oh he's an independent, they knew he could side with the ALP"" is post rational nonsense. And since you like facts so much more than twice as many people voted for the Nationals than the ALP in that electorate. His primary vote has dropped 20 points since the last election. You are entitled to your opinion of course, the people that matter disagree with you. On the question of Oakeshott representing his electorate, I am inclined to say that, once elected, his responsibility is to make up his own mind on issues raised in Parliament. He can't keep going back to the electors and polling them on what they want. It is then up to the electors on the roll at the next election to decide whether he has adequately represented them. I would not write off his chances of winning. Although the Lyne vote in previous elections suggest that his electorate is conservative, there is no reason they could not change -- for example, the demographics of the electorate may be changing. Also a lot of his supporters who might otherwise vote for the National Party would not be all that keen on the market oriented policies of the Liberal part of the coalition. We should expect our politicians (especially at the federal level) to do more than just represent their electorate. Yes, they need to deal with day-to-day concerns raised with their electoral office, but they also need to consider national issues and the national interest. Sometimes we are best served if they lead, rather than follow, public opinion. He went against their wishes in supporting Gillard, but he has done a lot for the electorate since. I vote in lyne and he is generally well liked and with the carbon tax scare fading he is looking good. As everyone forgets, he chose gillard primarily because of the NBN, and got an early rollout for lyne so anyone with a clue who lives in the area knows they have gained from this. A national would have delivered nothing on roads, less than nothing on broadband, no opposition to the Transgrid powerline of gold plating fame, zero backbone. As for his constant attempts to find common ground in the parliament ie his compromise bill on asylum seekers, well that is inspirational and he deserves to be reelected on that alone. The fundamental tenet of Westminster democracy (or any democracy for that matter) is that representatives represent those that voted for them. Yes, they can have varying ideas on varying issues but on something as major as choosing who gets to form government MP's, whether party affiliate or not, have a duty to chose the party their constituents want. Alex I don't buy that for a second. Oakshott got 47% of the primary vote and would easily have been returned had their been a second election. Instead he sided with the ALP and will almost certainly lose his seat along with Windsor next election. He could have had his seat for several election cycles, instead he got one term. It makes no sense at all. I used to think he was a bit of a dick particularly after the 17 min speech etc , but I have changed my mind. I wish he was my MP. He had the choice between Gillard and Abbott and he went for the one that he thought was best for both him and the electorate. He beats the hell out of that sanctimonious twit Wilkie and he has more humility than Windsor. The only independant that I rate above him is Xenophon. I certainly think Australia could do with more Polies like him and he is a reformist. a ReachTel automated phone poll conducted in August, which had the Nationals leading 55 per cent to 15 per cent on the primary vote. That poll was rightly criticised at the time for asking about the carbon tax and pokies reform before getting to voting intention.&lt;/i Lorax, if the voters of Lyne are stupid enough to vote for him again that's their issue. I can't see him choosing the next government regardless. At any rate he's 10 points behind on 2pp and 20 behind on primary. Can't see it happening. Windsor is still way behind too. Love how you attribute improving polls to the passing of the carbon tax scare, nothing to do with lower rates or anything. Not like they have trended with rates or anything silly and obvious like that. +1 Independents are becoming more and more crucial to effective government. Whilst all the parties are more and more inclined to play politics on absolutely every issue it is the independents that might force us to face some tough realities and hold the govt executive to account. Yes GST is not progressive but it's broad based and simple and can be easily further simplified by taking out all the exemptions like food etc. In any event the GST is not as non-progressive as people think because you can save tax by not consuming. Let's face it the hard up for a buck (which demographically also happen to be those on the porky side) are still pumping money into the tax base through the burger chains. Does RO's constituents think the parties would do anything other than just side with the power companies? It would be disgusting if they kicked RO out for another party hack. People will enter this scam willingly -- convinced that property investment is the best way to go, by the mob and by the banks. SMSF will be the heart of the scam -- get them into a SMSF, get them investing that money into property. Just don't play (or at least play carefully with what you are happy to bet). I reckon there's every possibility the b@$t@rd$ will go after SMSF's first . Have already observed a number of articles by/for the usual suspects, suggesting/implying that SMSF needs great ""regulation"" .. why? to ""protect"" the unwitting superannuant from unscrupulous advisers and ""investment"" spruikers, of course ... and/or the removal of various ""incentives"" that allegedly offer an ""unfair"" advantage to SMSF. Oped -- not sure where you are going with that comment. I'm sure the gov and the banks will want a slice of the fees so the regulation will come. But my main call is that the SMSF vehicle will be the tool the banksters (facilitated by the unquenchable greed and amorality of the brokers and spruikers -- and hence allowing the banks to stay one step removed) will use to get access to the last bit of money the middle-class not yet tuned into debt. This has started a bit, with most of the sob-stories being SMSF facilitated 'invest in property backed mezzanine debt products' stories. What's even worse is that when the terms of trade Australia has decline, all of the foreign borrowing is going to be onerous to repay. For big corporations that $250M / year in foreign denominated debt payment balloons out with each drop of the Aussie dollar. That'll lead to either default or substantial price inflation to pass on the cost to consumers. Because reduced profits would be a no no :p I have heard from people working in Salvos that the number of so called property-onwer-people turning up to get ""food coupons"" is steadily increasing... I personally know a ""front office worker"" pulling max 50K has FOUR investment properties along with her husband (apparently husband owns a ""major"" manufacturing company!) and she was giving me TIPS and telling me HOW TO GET AHEAD in life...last week, they were told from their banks to ""reduce debt somehow""!!! she has put 2 properties on market at 30% over-priced compared to same stock on same street!.... another property the tenant ""vanished"". no rent and no tenant... it appears that the husband-wife dont go to toilet at a specific time anymore , because they are shitting all the time! I dont disagree with the tenor of your argument HnH but I suggest that the most likely outcome is for more ""good luck"" via two channels: 1. The kleptocrats in China will move very slowly on household consumption and will stick with high levels of fixed asset investment for a few years yet. Commodity prices/vols will be supported; 2. The USA will surprise on the upside on fiscal resolution and we will see a sharp rerating of USD/AUD. All will be well-in a sense. I also find the Spanish/Australian comparisons far fetched.Half of Spain was and still is covered with unoccupied multi level appts and villas(somewhat like parts of China) with zero supporting rental cashflow and no buyers..Australia has no surplus and property is occupied by families who can and will service the debt loads-albeit with a bit of pain as things contract. &gt; also find the Spanish/Australian comparisons far fetched.Half of Spain was and still is covered with unoccupied multi level appts and villas(somewhat like parts of China) with zero supporting rental cashflow and no buyers..Australia has no surplus and property is occupied by families who can and will service the debt loads-albeit with a bit of pain as things contract. Have you been to Adelaide?... try suburbs like West Lakes, Mawson Lakes etc.. you may not find much ""advertised"" online.. on ground.. the occupancy is sparing.. I have to say I do agree with you re Spain. Trouble there I expect is that a huge amount of the building was for holiday homes, the demand for which can vanish in a flash. Ireland I see as a bit different. There, the overbuild was catering for / aiming at: - people desperate to rush into a galloping property market and get a foothold -- now defunct - the immigrants that were streaming in during the boom -- this flow has reversed I get so frustrated at the term middle class welfare, when actually it's the governments method of offsetting massive costs to taxpayers for services they have failed to provide. Try and get your kid into a government preschool in Sydney. They have 20 places for 200 kids, so private day care is the only option, at triple the cost of public preschool. My argument is that there is nothing in place for kids 3+, so child care rebate is hardly welfare. Additionally, if you aren't willing to take your chances or can't access the public system to have a baby, the baby bonus is just paying for your obstetrician, which Medicare won't do. If every single pregnant woman accessed the public health system, it would collapse in a week, again, meaning the government has to funnel people to private health care. Of course, all the Boomers who rant about middle class welfare got all of those things for free, which is my preference! If we didn't apathetically continue to go along with a debt-at-usury monetary system, we would not have found ourselves in a situation where both spouses/partners are effectively forced to work in order to support the household budget; as such, the need for childcare external to the family unit would be hugely less. Standing by for the misplaced accusations of misogyny and/or wanting to return society to the 50?s in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... I fear you miss my point. If not for a debt-at-usury monetary system, whereby ever-increasing debt saturation of society is a fundamental necessity in order to keep the Ponzi going (for the primary benefit of the credit&lt;/strike debt -pushers at the top), then it would still be possible for a household to live on one income. The question of a male or female's genuinely free (not forced) choice to seek employment or not, is IMHO a separate debate. Opinion8red -- Would not alot of the fact that both partners now have to work to support the household potentially be derived from the relaxation of bank credit policy (20-30-40) years ago? Relating in particular to the fact that the banks previously would not use the female applicants income for assesment purposes thus relying soley on the male apps income keeping prices relatively stable? Once these perameters were removed and female applicants income is added in for servicing this was always going to have an effect on prices as now married couples can pay double for a property than they could previously. Add in the fact you now only require 5% deposit and bingo the Mum now needs to go back to work just in order to keep the roof over the familys head as the loan was established prior to having children, both incomes were used so there is no choice but for Mum to go back to work regardless of wether she would like to stay home or not. All blame ... repeat ALL ... for these and pretty much all societal ills, where ever ""money"" has any bearing or influence whatsoever, can IMO be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Merchants of Debt. I'm as anti the free-market fairy as the next raniformis but really this substantially about a corrupt party system that mis-allocates funding away from core 'house-keeping' responsibilities and has facilitated unfettered population growth massively out of alignment with infrastructure growth to keep their corporate owners in the black. The problem has more to do with unthinking ideologues lining up to suck up the vast quantities of b.s. that the parties tell them. The fact is the parties don't give two sh8ts whether the kids have a school to go to, they care about the pursuit of power and the rewards it brings them and the corporate support they need to keep it. Exactly. The damage wrought chasing the free market fairy is extensive and very difficult to fix. To be fair, we haven't moved to a liberal market. We have convinced that liberty in the market place is good, and it has convinced some... as by their never-ending spiel on 'gum'int waste!'... but all we have done is move economics structures to favour a quasi-gerontocracy. Favouring assets over labour, just favours chronology. If there was liberty in the market place, the most productive people are males aged between 29-49... they should be living it up. Instead they are the cart horse that pays for baby boomer and female largese. ""We have convinced that liberty in the market place is good, and it has convinced some... as by their never-ending spiel on 'gum'int waste!'... "" Liberty IS good when it is tempered with sensible regulation. It's actually called commonsense. That all began to fail when Clinton repealed Glass -- Steagal. The Marxist failed totalitarian rot you endorse won't get up. There are things that CAN be actually done and there are things that just WILL NOT get done. Within those boundaries lies the feasable. I espouse the wanton collapse of various business so they can be bought up on the cheap by newer venturists. I am for the elimination of the dole, the elimination of the baby bonus, for the increasing the age for the eligibility of the aged pension, the increased of the preservation age for accessing superannuation for the elimination of the federal department of health. The only socialised aspects of society I espouse are education, ceertain health and I would implement a job guarantee. You come to some airy fairy notion I'm a totalitarin because... in the politist way.. you are thick. You do not understand anything you parrot, you do not comprehend what I argue against. i argue we are already a socialst state, one that benefits business. We are a crony-corporatist state, and it has been aided by the implementation of select 'libertarian' policies, without the implementation of the necessary checks and balances. These select policies are gleefully implemented because of useful idiots like yourself. +1 GSM, too many people claim they favour free-markets and oppose crony capitalism yet will support the most horrendously interventialist policies. Personally, as a poker player, my pet hate is the enforcement of the Casino monopoly and the justification that it's to 'protect' people from too much gambing. It's pure nonsense, it's about lining the governments pockets with money made by essentially one person. The result? Innocent punters like myself get utterly ripped off by the house (in the house odds/rake sense, rather than the sense that all casino's rip you off). This is crony capitalism at it's worst and it's all state sponsored, all crony capitalism is! Aquarian -- Where cant an Australian Citizen access the free health care system to have a child? The only people I know who pay to go private is purely by choice only OR people who are not Perm Res / Citizens so are not covered under medicare. If people want to spend 5k to go private then so be it but they could access the public system to do it. I think the point is that if they all did so, the public system would be overwhelmed. It's all tied up with the division of funding and responsibility for health between the States and the Commonwealth. One of the scary comparisms re spain is that they have the bulk of Europes fishing fleet, and naval building capabilities, mind you they did have as many unsold houses as the Yanks with 1/6th of the Population. My understanding was poor old portugal had to give up its fishing fleet in deference to Spain. i think comparing Australia to spain is a bit silly. Australia is unique in a scary way. What a pathetic system that we force people to draw down housing loans to put in superannuation just to pay the banking sector a spread. And we take huge credit and system risk for our trouble. With negative gearing and superannuation we are simply a mighty derivative that needs unwinding! Interesting post HnH. Time will tell. Out of interest there are many in the thread above bemoaning the 'hollowing out' of the Australian economy. It is possible to demonstrate this statistically and is it possible to ascertain that any said 'hollowing out' is entirely due to the AUD -- not other factors like globalised manufacture. In case you hadn't noticed, the terms-of-trade have peaked, the AUD has decoupled from commodity prices -- particularly coal -- and the strong dollar is hurting the mining sector as much as anyone else now. All those mining projects that have been delayed, postponed or cancelled would become viable overnight if the AUD were to fall to its long-term average. So please, go back to your masters, and ask again: Should I still be cheering the dollar higher? Perhaps the memo was mislaid? Oh please, that's a bit rich coming from someone who is paid by the mining industry to comment here. I think we all understand the causes of changes in our export sector, its a matter of how much emphasis you put on each cause. No-one has denied that globalisation has been a factor, but you flat out deny that the exchange rate has been a factor. IMO they are roughly equal, but there's very little we can do to slow globalisation, we can however lower our exchange rate. BTW, I don't expect a speedy recovery either. I expect (hope?) a weaker currency will save what remains of the trade-exposed sector, and restore some balance to our economy. No speedy recovery. Far from it. We either usher in wide ranging economic restructuring in response or we get shredded over time. The new normal is arriving whether we like it or not.The only variable be the response Australia takes to it. With the emergence of truly globalized markets we have an unusual situation where geographically localized manufacturing support is vital to the success of the upper levels of the manufactures pyramid. Let me explain: Yesterday I mentioned a product that I had recently had manufactured in China, whereby the total time to make and import the product, was considerably less than the time to make the same product in Australia. The main reason for the difference was: -- In China, the component demands for our end product did not stress the local component supply chain. Meaning there were no BOM (bill of material) items with critical ""long lead times"". This situation correctly reflects the relative modest size of my project, compared with the enormous size / depth of the local Chinese component industry. By contrast in Australia: Since most of the components we used were fairly unique, we needed to either directly import these ourselves OR use an existing agent, either way we had to pay for all components in advance. This situation creates supply chain inflexibility, which although not a direct cost it does directly affect our projected turns of capital and also changes our ability to dynamically adjust product volume to meet real market demand. For a small company with growth aspirations these are very important differences. Notice that labor costs, were not the most important consideration, however the $AUD was an important consideration which was managed by pricing even our local Aussie product in $USD. As usual, not a squeak about the grotesque size of (Unionised) Govt and it's parasitic effect on strangling the economy. All this is to be expected really. If this Govt continues down its road of waste , mindless spending and protectiong Unions (just to stay in power by buying the donkey votes) then yes, we will end up like Spain. What matters is what will we do NOW, from here on. The past is done and dusted. Private debt is there- it's on the books. It wont be going anywhere but what is Govts response ? Spend more, accrueing debt and pumping up RE , again. Mindless but entirely expected. The way forward from here IMO confronts us with clear choices. - Roll the dice with status quo, ending up like something akin to Spain.It's only a matter of when not if. - Bite the bullet and slash Govt size and it's spending so that we get a REAL surplus that includes substantial Debt repayment. Combine this with massive tax and regulatory restructuring that incentivises SME's ,Ag , Health/ research and R&D sections of the economy.Our best economic options are centred around a)providing what Asia needs and b)promoting SME's with incentives c) LOWER taxes accross the board that puts more spending power into households. Claims on public moneys need to be slashed. And to do DO something means actually plan and execute to full budgetted delivery on schedule- not seeming to do and announcing to do or putting out a white paper to do. DO. The only soft option is to do nothing and sit here like a frog in a pot. None of that is in the immediate, short term best interests of the Merchants of Debt. So it won't happen. Folks here and everywhere continue spending their time debating the many and varied aspects of the noise, while persistently failing to consider that the only way to change the tune is to take control over who plays what over the loudspeakers. Even within our meagre range of options there is choice. And likely I have not included enough choices. We may not be able to do much about the menu, but let's at least consider and ACT ON what is best for the country's future. My sense is we are approaching a major inflection point in our history. We may not be able to save the whole pack of cards but we should certainly be making and acting on choices that deliver viability for the future. One thing we should certainly be doing to prepare, is to start reducing our reliance on the savings habits of foreigners. As with manufacturing there is a short term argument that we should use the cheap imported 'saving habits'. Those easy to please foreign investors desperate for yield having being denied one in their own currency. But the problems with dependence on foreign investment/capital/savings habits are even more serious simply because they a major reason for the dependence on foreign manufacturing. If we really want a currency that reflects our competence and 'worth' the first thing we should self-limit our capacity to run up debt on the credit cards of foreigners. That means: * limiting sales of govt securities to foreigners, * limiting asset sales to 49% equity sharing arrangement (as do most of our local competitors), * strict limits on the sources of funds banks can use for lending for housing. * higher interest rates -- as locals will take some persuasion that saving has merit. Naturally work on the tax regime to discourage unproductive speculation on capital gains rather than generated incomes would be also helpful. People can rarely be told, most need to be shown. Until a bunch of people lose a whole lot of money on housing the ""housing prices never drop"" mentality will remain and those that profit from debt slavery will keep doing what they can to promote it. Maybe I'm stupid but it seems to me that Australia needs to firstly create export focused businesses that are such a slam dunk that the investing public is lining up to get their slice of these businesses. This increases the size of the pie and thereby provides an alternate focus for the passive investors capital. Minus this alternate investment focus, it seems to me that Aussies must ultimately conclude that their savings are safest in housing. Australia needs to create a Facebook, Google....whatever. Something that is clearly more valuable than just another house. Now the kicker is they must hang-on-to the business once it is created, unfortunately hanging on to the business is almost impossible because of the absence of a deep technical skills pool. My conclusion is that education is the place to start, IMHO this means focused technical education reaching well beyond even today's needs. Maybe there should be some simple direct reward for learning certain technical skills, (something like student loan forgiveness for all engineering grads). If you look at the success within the Indian Technical college schemes and their Chinese equivalents you'll have some ideas on how to structure such a system. Foreigners can't create AUD, so if it wasn't for the continual negative terms of trade, foreigners wouldn't have the AUD to lend us in the first place. Yet presumably our banks would still be able to create loans and our government would still be able to spend AUD. Are foreigners AUD savings just a margnially cheaper source (or maybe a capitive source) of bank funding / bond sales than domestic AUD savings? If they stopped buying Australian bonds or lending to our banks (and instead just left their AUD idle) would that actually be a problem?

Then there do a recount, just like they did when BNP got in at Burnley by two votes in 2007. Once the recount gets done it will go to some other party/candidate who agrees with there way of thinking. Basically it doesn't matter where the votes go, if you don't agree with there way of thinking you want stand a chance. Just look and read of the resent, Kev carroll police Crime commissioner scandal. They pretty much excluded him from all major advertising/promotial events where most candidates but him was there and his party. They also took down his advertising! Democracy?
