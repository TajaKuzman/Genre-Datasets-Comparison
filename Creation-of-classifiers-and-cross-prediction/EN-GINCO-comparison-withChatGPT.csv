1,"Why graft thrives in postconflict zones <p> A report issued Wednesday said Iraq could become 'the biggest corruption scandal in history.' <p> March 17, 2005 <p> By Mark Rice-Oxley Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor <p> Five Polish peacekeepers are arrested for allegedly taking $90,000 worth of bribes in Iraq. Several Sri Lankan officials are suspended for mishandling tsunami aid. US audits show large financial discrepancies in Iraq. Reports of aid abuse taunt Indonesia. <p> Two of the world's biggest-ever reconstruction projects - Iraq and post-tsunami Asia - are facing major tests of credibility, as billions of dollars of aid and reconstruction money pour in. <p> And according to a major report released Wednesday by Transparency International (TI), an international organization that focuses on issues of corruption, the omens are not good. <p> From Iraq and Afghanistan to Cambodia and Bosnia, from the wrecked coasts of Asia to the kleptocratic carve-up in some African countries, crisis zones are proving to be fertile soil for corruption, the report argues. <p> ""Many postconflict countries figure among the most corrupt in the world,"" says Philippe le Billon of the University of British Columbia, Canada, in the TI report. ""Corruption often predates hostilities and in many cases it features among the factors that triggered political unrest or facilitated conflict escalation."" <p> The report cites weak government, haphazard law and order, armed factions that need appeasing, and a scramble for rich resources as factors that render a country prone to corruption. <p> Nations that face security threats are even more vulnerable, since they require protection money and may not be able to keep monitors safe. <p> Bosnia is a good example. During the breakdown of communism in the late 1980s, factions scrambled for assets by plundering state companies, a situation exacerbated by the 1992-1995 war. <p> Wartime sanctioned nefarious activity. Criminal gangs became cherished paramilitary groups; black markets flourished; underworld players became rich and powerful. After peace was declared in 1995, the world community was wary of upsetting the status quo. It's still unclear how much of the $5 billion spent on aid after the war ended up in the pockets of shady characters. <p> ""These elements were either part of the ruling political parties, or criminal elements that were financing the ruling political parties,"" says James Lyon, an analyst in Belgrade with the International Crisis Group. <p> In Iraq, allegations range from petty bribery to large-scale embezzlement, expropriation, profiteering and nepotism. The TI report says it could become ""the biggest corruption scandal in history."" <p> ""I can see all sorts of levels of corruption in Iraq,"" says report contributor Reinoud Leenders, ""starting from petty officials asking for bribes to process a passport, way up to contractors delivering shoddy work and the kind of high-level corruption involving ministers and high officials handing out contracts to their friends and clients."" <p> The recent elections may help, he adds, but already he notes a tendency for political bargaining indicative of ""dividing up the cake of state resources."" <p> But it is not just about Iraqis dividing up the cake. US audits of its own spending have found repeated shortcomings, including a lack of competitive bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars, payment of contracts without adequate certification that work had been done, and in some cases, outright theft. <p> A report on the disbursement of Iraqi oil revenues to ministries by the Coalition Provisional Authority, which governed Iraq until last July found a $340 million contract awarded by the electricity ministry without a public tender. <p> A January report by special inspector Stuart Bowen found that $8.8 billion dollars had been disbursed from Iraqi oil revenue by US administrators to Iraqi ministries without proper accounting. <p> And earlier this week, it emerged that the Pentagon's auditing agency found that Halliburton, the Houston oil services giant formerly run by Vice President Dick Cheney, overcharged by more than $108 million on a contract. <p> A Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown and Root, faces a number of investigations for overcharging, including one case where it charged the Army more than $27 million dollars to transport $82,000 worth of fuel from Kuwait to Iraq, according to excerpts of the report released this week by Rep. Henry Waxman (D) of California. <p> In a written statement. Halliburton defended the cost, explaining that delivering the fuel was ""fraught with danger."" <p> Analysts also point to an entrenched culture of graft in the Iraqi government. <p> It doesn't help that much of Iraq needs physical rebuilding, which involves the sector more vulnerable to corruption than any other: construction. <p> ""Public works and construction are singled out by one survey after another as the sector most prone to corruption - in both the developing and the developed world,"" says TI chairman Peter Eigen. <p> Construction is considered prone to sleaze for several reasons: the fierce competition for ""make or break"" contracts; permits and approvals that are open to requests for backhanders; opportunities for delays and overruns; and the physical cover-up opportunity presented by plaster and concrete. <p> With whole swaths of Southeast Asia requiring rebuilding after the tsunami, experts worry that construction corruption could take a deadly toll. <p> ""The cost will be lives lost,"" said Eigen, noting that cheap materials and corner-cutting can prove lethal in earthquake-prone parts of the world. <p> So how to battle corruption? Good governance is clearly the No. 1 priority, but TI identifies several other initiatives that can help improve probity. <p> These include vetting contractors and blacklisting those with shady records, ensuring competitive bidding for deals and assuring independent auditing and multilayered monitoring involving local communities, rotating staff in sensitive positions, and encouraging donors to disburse funds in a timely fashion to reduce pressure on local officials and prevent accounting trickery. <p> ""We are simply making the case that a series of norms should be applied which make it much more feasible to avoid the kind factors driving corruption,"" says Lawrence Cockcroft, chairman of TI UK. <p> • Dan Murphy in Baghdad, Beth Kampschror in Sarajevo, and Peter Ford in Paris contributed to this report.",News,News,"The author's purpose is to report on the corruption that takes place in post-conflict zones, particularly in Iraq and post-tsunami Asia, and how this corruption can hamper the reconstruction efforts in these regions.

5,"The following table summarises the relevance of Objective 3.1 in achieving the purpose of the Resource Management Act: <p> Purpose of RMA <p> Achievement <p> Sustain the potential of natural and physical resources to meet needs of future generations <p> Objective 3.1 provides for the sustainable management of natural and physical resources by recognising the importance of the inter-relationships and shared values between resources. This objective aims to ensure that the effects of land activities do not adversely impact on water bodies and the marine area and vice versa. To achieve this will also require a co-ordinated approach across local authority jurisdictional boundaries. Decision making for management of resources must take an integrated approach that will protect the potential of the region's resources for future generations. <p> Safeguard the life-supporting capacity of air, water, soil and ecosystems <p> Objective 3.1 recognises that co-ordinated management of resources must take place to ensure that the life-supporting capacity of water bodies, the marine area and the surrounding land is safeguarded. In particular, the objective seeks to ensure that water bodies and the marine environment are not just seen to be a 'receiving environment' for discharged pollutants from land-based activities. The objective has the potential to contribute to safeguarding the life-supporting capacity of air, water, soil and ecosystems. <p> Avoid, remedy or mitigate adverse effects of activities on the environment <p> Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that activities that are likely to have adverse effects on natural resources are managed in an integrated way, rather than looking at resources in isolation. An integrated and strategic approach to decisions relating to activities provides an understanding of the wider effects of an activity, including cumulative adverse effects, and enables strategies to avoid, remedy or mitigate adverse effects. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their social wellbeing <p> Natural resources such as water bodies, riparian areas and the coast are a significant part of most New Zealanders' social and recreational experiences. Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that people can continue (into future generations) to enjoy a range of experiences involving natural and physical resources. In this respect it is critical that an integrated approach is taken to managing the use of these resources. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their economic wellbeing <p> Water bodies and the marine area are a significant economic resource for industries (such as agriculture, fishing, marine farming) as well as for communities (such as tourism support services). Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that people can continue (into future generations) to gain economic advantages from water bodies and coastal resources. In this respect it is critical that an integrated and strategic approach is taken to managing the use of these resources. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their cultural wellbeing <p> Water bodies and the marine area make a significant contribution to people's and communities' cultural wellbeing. In particular, for tangata whenua, the protection of coastal environment, rivers and water bodies is part of their role as kaitiaki which is an integral part of Maori culture. Water resources are viewed as a holistic unit and this objective seeks to reinforce this approach by recognising that these resources need to be managed in an integrated manner. Objective 3.1 also recognises the historical links many people have with these environments by ensuring that decisions regarding activities in these areas are based on a balanced approach that recognises the inter-related nature of resources. <p> By recognising the integrated nature of these environments, Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that natural resources such as rivers and the marine area are not degraded by land-based activities.

7,"Contents <p> Introduction <p> Doxygen allows users to quickly create documentation for our code by extracting the relavent information from the code and comments. It is able to document all the code structures including classes, namespaces, files, members, defines, etc. Most of these are quite simple to document, you only need to place a special documentation block before the declaration. The special documentation blocks take the form of a javadoc style comment. A javadoc comment is a C style comment with 2 *'s at the start, like this: <p> The intermediate asterisks are optional, but please use them to clearly delineate the documentation comments. <p> The documentation within these blocks is made up of at least a brief description of the documented structure, that can be followed by a more detailed description and other documentation. The brief description is the first sentence of the comment. It ends with a period followed by white space or a new line. For example: <p> If you need to have a period in the brief description, follow it with a backslash followed by a space. <p> Blank lines within these comments are interpreted as paragraph breaks to help you make the documentation more readble. <p> Special commands <p> Placing these comments before the declaration works in most cases. For files however, you need to specify that you are documenting the file. To do this you use the @file special command. To document the file that you are currently in you just need to use the command followed by your comments. To comment a separate file (we shouldn't have to do this) you can supply the name directly after the file command. There are some other special commands we will be using quite often. To document functions we will use @param and @return or @retval to document the parameters and the return value. @param takes the name of the paramter and its description. @return just describes the return value, while @retval adds a name to it. To specify pre and post conditions you can use @pre and @post. <p> Some other useful commands are @todo and @sa. @todo allows you to place reminders of things to fix/implement and associate them with a specific class or member/function. @sa lets you place references to another piece of documentation (class, member, etc.). This can be useful to provide links to code that would be helpful in understanding the code being documented. <p> Example of Simple Documentation <p> Here is a simple header file with doxygen comments added. <p> Grouping <p> Doxygen also allows for groups of classes and member (or other groups) to be declared. We can use these to create a listing of all statistics/global variables. Or just to comment about the memory hierarchy as a whole. You define a group using @defgroup and then add to it using @ingroup or @addgroup. For example: <p> This places stat1-3 in the statistics group and stat4 in the subgroup.

10,"Detailed Description <p> The QScriptEngineDebugger class provides a debugger that can be embedded into Qt applications that use Qt Script. The debugger enables the application user to inspect the state of the script environment and control script execution. <p> To attach the debugger to a script engine, call the attachTo() function. <p> Once the debugger has been attached to a script engine, you can proceed to evaluate scripts as usual, e.g. by calling QScriptEngine::evaluate(). The debugger will be triggered when an uncaught exception occurs, or when a debugger statement is encountered in a script. It is also possible to interrupt script evaluation at an arbitrary time by triggering the InterruptAction. For instance, to start the debugger when script evaluation starts, you trigger the action before you begin to evaluate() the script. <p> By default, the standard debugger window is shown when evaluation is suspended. This can be changed by calling the setAutoShowStandardWindow() function. <p> The debugger defines a set of actions that are available, such as stopping execution or printing the contents of a variable. It also provides a set of widgets (components) that display the information available from the debugger and that trigger the actions on request. The actions available are identified by the DebuggerAction enum, and the widgets are identified by the DebuggerWidget enum. <p> Access to the individual debugger widgets is provided by the widget() function. This makes it possible to arrange the widgets in a custom manner. Similarly, the action() function provides access to the various debugger actions. <p> The createStandardToolBar() function creates a standard toolbar, and the createStandardMenu() function creates a standard menu; these functions can be useful if you are creating a custom debugger configuration. <p> The evaluationSuspended() signal is emitted when the debugger has suspended script evaluation and entered interactive mode, i.e., the mode in which it accepts input from the user. The evaluationResumed() signal is emitted when script evaluation is resumed, i.e, when execution control is given back to the script engine. The state() function returns the debugger's current state. <p> When calling QScriptEngine::evaluate() it is useful to pass a descriptive script name (file name) as second argument, as this is the name that will be displayed by the debugger in the ScriptsWidget; if a name is not passed, the script will be labelled ""anonymous"". <p> When evaluation is suspended, the debugger will also suspend the event loop of the script. In the following snippet, the call to QScriptEngine::evaluate() causes the debugger to be triggered, and the function call does not return until the user has finished interacting with the debugger. <p> When the Qt Script debugger is running, the C++ application itself is not ""frozen"". This means that it is possible that more scripts are evaluated, even though the debugger has suspended evaluation of the current script evaluation. For example, a C++ timer might trigger that causes a script function to be called, or the user might click on a button in the main application user interface whose clicked() signal is connected to a script function. This kind of nested evaluation is permitted. The debugger will enter interactive mode for the new script if an exception is thrown or a breakpoint is reached. Note that it will not stop when encountering debugger statements. <p> Nested evaluation requires some thought when deciding how the debugger is presented to the user; for example, whether a modal dialog is suitable, or whether some parts of the main application user interface should be disabled while the debugger is running. <p> Debugging inside of a paintEvent() is currently not supported. If you need to debug painting-related script code, that code should be evaluated outside of the C++ paintEvent(), e.g. by rendering to an image, like the Context2D and Tetrix QtScript examples do. This will make the code safe for debugging. <p> The debugger adds some special properties to the script engine: __FILE__ holds the name of the script in which the current evaluation occurs, and __LINE__ holds the current line number. These are useful when doing print()-style debugging (the messages appear in the debugger's debug output widget). <p> The Qt Script Debugger Manual describes how to use the debugger. The Context2D example shows how to integrate the debugger in applications. <p> Member Type Documentation <p> enum QScriptEngineDebugger::DebuggerAction <p> This enum specifies the action that the action() function should retrieve. The actions retrieved can be connected to any slot and connected to any widget. Please see the Qt Script Debugger Manual's Console Command Reference for a detailed description of these actions. <p> Description <p> enum QScriptEngineDebugger::DebuggerWidget <p> This enum decides the widget that the widget() function should retrieve. We treat these widgets in more detail in the Qt Script Debugger Manual. <p> Returns a pointer to the specified action. The actions available are given by the DebuggerAction enum. <p> With this function, you can add the actions to your own widgets, toolbars, and menus. It is also convenient if you, for example, wish to spice things up with your own groovy icons. The code example below shows how to add actions to a QToolBar. <p> The debugger will install a custom agent (using QScriptEngine::setAgent()) to monitor the engine. While the debugger is attached, you should not change the agent; however, if you do have to perform additional monitoring, you must set a proxy agent that forwards all events to the debugger's agent. <p> void QScriptEngineDebugger::evaluationResumed () [signal] <p> void QScriptEngineDebugger::evaluationSuspended () [signal] <p> This signal is emitted when the debugger has suspended script evaluation for whatever reason (e.g. due to an uncaught script exception, or due to a breakpoint being triggered). <p> Sets whether the standard debugger window is automatically shown when evaluation is suspended. If autoShow is true, the window will be automatically shown, otherwise it will not. <p> Returns a pointer to the instance of the specified standard widget. The widgets available are defined by the DebuggerWidget enum. <p> A main window containing all widgets is returned by standardWindow(). If you do not want to use this window, you can fetch the individual widgets with this function. For instance, the code example below shows how to set up a layout containing a code window and a stack widget. <p> Note that you need to set setAutoShowStandardWindow() to false; if not, the standard window will be shown regardless.",Instruction,Instruction,"The text provides instructions on how to use the QScriptEngineDebugger class, which is a debugger that can be embedded into Qt applications that use Qt Script.

I had a couple priests, popemobile, and the Ring of Volans. Getting WS10 I10 spears via the Golden Griffon on the Pope Mobile on a 5+ was nice. I got that off twice! For those who doubted the power of horde spears, I can assure you... they are brutal. My spears were not horde, to gain some extra ranks. My opponents were. We both had hatred (he being DE, and my having a priest). He stilled out killed my spears by quite a bit. Meanwhile my spears, when charged by frenzies corsairs, outkilled them significantly. The random charges really changed things. Still not totally sure how to feel about that. It really does get rid of that 'game' of trying to deny the charge and all. Though I just wish the ranges were less extreme. The changes in ranks negating really sold me on detachments. I almost never took them in all of 7th edition. Less than 5% of the time I played Empire, as I felt they really didn't do a whole lot... or earn their points. Now with firing in two ranks, small handgunner detachments are worth their points. Also 15 strong Sword detachments work very well, as they can negate the ranks and might have the distance to do it without being to far forward. Dark Riders just got a lot nastier, they really did. As did Shades. Comments from opponent: <p> So I played my first game of 8th last night and liked how the changes went. I played a 2250 game against Robert Elmer's Empire. My rough List: Dreadlord General BSB Lvl 2 Sorc Fighty Lvl 2 Sorc 39 Spears, FC, Armor piercing Banner (10 wide) 19 Corsairs, FC, Frenzy Banner 10 Crossbows, Musician, Shields 2 units of 5 Dark Riders w/ Musician 17 Black Guard, FC, +1 LD Banner 6 Shades w xhw Hydra Rob's List: Captain General Arch-lector on Pope-mobile 2 Priests BSB 38 Spears, FC,Armor piercing banner, Detachment of 6 Hand-gunners, Detachment of 15 swordsmen 38 Spears, FC, Detachment of 6 Hand-gunners, Detachment of 15 swordsmen 2 units of 10 Hand-gunners Cannon Mortar 18 Flagellants Tactically, the only mistake made by rob was not running his spears 10 wide as he tried to go for the extra ranks to gain stubborn. Some of the things I saw that were cool were: On my third turn I charged his pope-mobile with my crossbows and sorceress. After casting a spell from the lore of shadow, I was able to switch her with my general, which locked them into a challenge and ended up killing his Arch-lector. My frenzied corsairs with my combat mage charged his unit of spears and got whiped and chased away. not taking the wounds from the front really makes a difference. Later on Robs spears charged my Spears. Rob then made his spears WS and In 10. he killed 6 of the 38 models I had, and I returned the strikes. Even with needing 5's to hit, I still did enough damage that he needed snakes to hold. I broke him and gave chase. I then charged into his other unit of spears while running down his first unit. because of the hoard rule, I still had 28 models attacking, and again breaking his unit by a lot. So, in all, loving the new rules with hoards and spears, and Dark Elf Spearmen Rock. Also, I really like the lore of shadows. <p> FORGET AoS.

21,"SAP NetWeaver on VMware Cloud on AWS Overcommit Sizing Example <p> Note: SAP certification for VMware Cloud on AWS is currently in-progress. Follow us on twitter to know when the certification is complete: https://twitter.com/vmwarecloudaws <p> In this article we show an example sizing of an SAP landscape on VMware Cloud on AWS. The SAP landscape refers to the multiple SAP systems from production to non-production required in the implementation of SAP business functionality. A VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool is available online that allows us to estimate the compute and storage resources required for a SDDC deployment on VMware Cloud on AWS. Before we can use this online tool, we need to establish the SAP sizing requirements. Here are two SAP scenarios: <p> Greenfield installation – treat the cloud SDDC as an on-premise vSphere implementation. We can following standard SAP sizing methodology e.g. SAP Quick Sizer. <p> SAP installations already running on vSphere on-premise – VMware tools are available for measuring existing resource usage. This is part of a migration assessment and is covered in the PREPARING FOR VMWARE CLOUD ON AWS Planning Guide . <p> The example here is based on a sizing of an existing on-premise installation. The scope is for a non-production SAP NetWeaver landscape where we are sizing for SAP systems deployed on non-HANA databases (e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, SAP Sybase, IBM DB2, etc.) and we are considering CPU and memory overcommitment. <p> Overcommit is defined as: <p> The number of vCPUs scheduled on an ESXi host is greater than the number of physical cores. <p> The sum of configured memory of all virtual machines on an ESXi host is greater than the physical memory of the host. <p> We have chosen non-production as resource overcommit is more viable in this environment. The workloads across the different non-production systems are expected to peak at different times. Also, non-production environments are likely to have systems running idle for some periods of time. <p> We will first describe the sizing of the SAP landscape and the resource requirements for different virtual machines (VMs). We then use this data as input to the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool to determine the SDDC resources required for VMware Cloud on AWS. <p> Because this is a sample scenario, variations and alternatives with higher or lower degrees of overcommit are possible. <p> SAP Sizing Results / Output <p> The example here is based on a non-production SAP NetWeaver landscape and is derived from an actual sizing with some changes (e.g. not all SAP systems are shown). The methodology of a virtual SAP sizing to determine the VM vCPUs and vRAM is not covered here – for an example see this whitepaper. <p> The non-production environment can include many different systems with various functions such as: development of new SAP functionality; support for production code fixes; future upgrade testing; training. The following table describes the different systems in this example. <p> To quantitatively size for overcommit, an initial priority (high, medium, or low) is assigned to each non-production system. The priority determines the probability/prediction of how much of the configured vCPU and vRAM the VM is likely to use. The priority and sizing impact are defined in the Appendix below. <p> Final SAP Landscape Sizing <p> The spreadsheet below shows the final sizing with adjustments made for overcommit based on the priorities of the different SAP systems. This spreadsheet is an example of a working sheet used in a pre-sales sizing engagement and variations are expected. <p> SAP Sizing Spreadsheet – Example <p> The columns in the spreadsheet above are described as follows: <p> ""SAP Product / Module"" – in this example we are sizing for three SAP products each of which has its own database, application servers and Central Services (handles special SAP services) : ERP = SAP Enterprise Resource Planning software; BW = Business Warehouse; Portal = SAP's Portal solution. There are multiple installations of each SAP product across the different non-production environments. <p> ""DB vCPU"","" App vCPU"", ""CS vCPU"" – these are the estimated vCPU requirements for each architectural component. This value is an output of the SAP sizing project (the method by which this was derived is not part of scope for this article). These components can be: all installed in the same VM ; or distributed across separate VMs. <p> ""VM Memory"" – this is the estimated memory requirement for all the architecture components of each SAP product. This value is an output of the SAP sizing exercise. <p> ""Example Priority"" – priority assigned to the SAP system based on its business impact. <p> ""Resource Adjust Factor"" – probability of resources being used. This is based on the priority setting (see Appendix) <p> ""ESXi Host cores"" = ESXi host cores required to support the vCPU sizing = ""Total vCPU"" x ""Resource Adjustment Factor"". <p> ""ESXi Host Memory"" = ESXi host memory required to support the memory sizing = ""VM Memory"" x ""Resource Adjustment Factor"". <p> The totals at the bottom of the spreadsheet above allows us to estimate that we can support 122 vCPUs of VMs and 1220GB of total configured memory on a set of ESXi hosts that total 100 cores and 1000GB of physical memory. The total number of VMs = 24. <p> In this overcommit scenario, if all virtual machines try to consume 100% of their configured CPU and memory simultaneously, a performance issue may occur. VMware Cloud on AWS can address this with Elastic DRS (eDRS) – this is a feature that uses the resource management features of vSphere to analyze the load running in your SDDC to scale your clusters up or down. Using this feature, you can enable VMware Cloud on AWS to manage your cluster sizes without manual intervention. <p> The priority settings and adjustment factors shown here are examples only. They must be re-evaluated for specific implementations. For example, if you expect high levels of simultaneous Development, Testing, and Training activity by a large team of external consultants and/or system integrators, who cannot afford idle time due to performance bottlenecks, you can justify assigning a high priority to several non-production systems thus reducing the degree of overcommit. <p> We will now use the output of the above sizing spreadsheet to input data into the online VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool. <p> The online tool is available here – click on ""Start as a Guest"" to start the sizing. We will input the data from the above SAP sizing spreadsheet. For SAP we will use the i3 instance type which is based on ESXi hosts with 36 cores and 512 GB RAM. The input data values are shown in screenshots below. <p> The tool provides the following output/ recommendation. <p> The sizing results show that with HA requirements factored into the final solution the total number of required ESXi hosts is 4. This results in a cluster with total 4 x 36 = 144 cores and 4 x 512 = 2048 GB of RAM i.e. the number of cores and memory in the SDDC cluster is more than the SAP sizing requirements. This is expected and is the same case when sizing and designing high availability SAP cluster environments on-premise. Acceptable overcommit in this example will occur in the case of a host failure which is only temporary until a new host is provisioned. The time to provision a new host after a failure is quick in VMware Cloud on AWS due to the auto remediation feature. To increase overcommit more VMs can be added to the 4-host cluster but this could lead to unacceptable resource constraints (albeit only temporarily) in the case of a host failure. Adding more sandbox VMs that have a low SLA and do not need to be immediately recovered after a host failure will help to increase overcommit ratios without impacting SLAs during a host failure. Generally mixing high priority SAP VMs with low priority VMs in the same cluster enables overcommit. Applying the same overcommit method to production landscapes can be challenging as typically all production VMs are considered high priority. Mixing production with low priority non-production systems can yield overcommit scenarios without impacting SLAs. Production / high priority VMs are protected with memory reservation settings. <p> Key Points <p> We showed an example greenfield sizing for an SAP landscape based on overcommit of CPU and memory. The SAP sizing model included a method to quantitatively size for CPU and memory overcommit for non-production. We chose non-production as this is where we typically see overcommit for SAP environments. <p> Mixing high priority SAP VMs with low priority VMs in the same ESXi cluster facilitates overcommit. <p> We used the output of the SAP sizing as input to the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool which generated a recommendation for deployment on VMware Cloud on AWS. <p> Generally sizing of SAP environments is conservative with minimal to no overcommit. As workloads of different SAP VMs peak at different times the resulting utilization of ESXi clusters can be low. Elastic DRS (eDRS) available in VMware Cloud on AWS can scale clusters up or down to meet the resource needs. <p> Auto-remediation in VMware Cloud on AWS enables faster recovery of a SDDC cluster after a host failure. <p> In conclusion the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool can help you quickly determine the host and storage requirements for a SDDC deployment and facilitate the transition to cloud for your SAP environments. <p> Thanks to my colleagues for their inputs and feedback: Dan Florea; Bill Roth; Gary Hamilton. <p> Appendix <p> The following table shows the priorities assigned to the different non-production systems and the sizing impact. <p> The Priority in the second column corresponds to an assessment of 1) the importance of each environment from a business standpoint and 2) the likelihood of resources being used by users. <p> The ESXi host Resource Adjustment Factor in the fourth column is linked to the priority and corresponds to an estimate of the fraction of resources that will be consumed. For example, a value of 0.75 corresponds to a prediction or probability that 75% of configured CPU and memory resources will be used. <p> The ESXi Host Sizing numbers in the last column are the number of physical ESXi host cores and memory required to support the environment. These resources equal the total virtual resources of vCPU and memory adjusted by the Resource Adjustment Factor (defined by the priority setting). <p> Note: The resource adjustment factor values in the table are suggestions.",Information/Explanation,Instruction,"The text is intended to instruct the reader on how to size an SAP landscape on VMware Cloud on AWS, providing specific examples and tools to assist in the process.

27,"""The Roots of Racism"" <p> by Sargent Shriver Peace Institute | Mon Apr 29 06:00:00 EDT 2019 | Quote of the Week | Justice | Human Rights | Civil Rights <p> Our Quote of the Week tackles an important topic that continues to influence the systems in which we operate and to adversely affect the lives of people of color: racism. The quote is from Sargent Shriver's keynote address at the first gathering of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice; Sargent Shriver was serving as the Conference's chair at the time. In his capacity as President of both the Chicago Public School Board and the board of the Catholic Interracial Council, Sargent Shriver fought alongside African American community leaders throughout the 1950s to successfully desegregate schools, housing developments, hospitals, and other institutions in Chicago. <p> It's important to note that Sargent Shriver's Catholic faith informed his views on racism in particular and on inequality in general. Quoting St. Paul in his speech, he reminds the audience that human beings are ""are spiritual beings united in a real and effective way into one body – a living, acting body, busy in the work of saving the world from the effects of sin, death, corruption, fear, pride and prejudice."" When we recognize each other's humanity and when we act with love, argued Sargent Shriver, we live in community with each other and avoid the conflict and violence that comes from what today we would refer to as ""othering,"" deeming those who are different than we are as threatening or inferior. <p> Sargent Shriver's desire to combat racism and inequality stayed with him throughout his life. It is visible in the values he asserted when he led the Peace Corps, the War on Poverty, and even Special Olympics later in his life. You can read more about Sargent Shriver's civil rights work here. <p> Many things have changed since Sargent Shriver spoke these words in 1958, but it would be irresponsible to ignore or to downplay the impact of racism and racial violence on us today. An honest look around will show that divisions based on race affect so much of our daily lives. From lack of equal treatment in the criminal justice system, to unethical banking practices that still show the remnants of redlining, to workplace discrimination, unjust and inhumane immigration policies, and violence triggered by white supremacy, we still operate within a system based on white privilege that makes it impossible for all of us to be treated as equals and to live in peace. We need to keep talking about race and to stand against racism whenever we have the opportunity. <p> Like this quote?

29,"Browse Promos + Events <p> Restaurant Details <p> Having left an impression on the city's culinary landscape with such well-received hotspots as Bravissimo, Babbo and Aroma, Armando Martorelli has now set his sights on Winter Park, taking over the former Lotus Café space situated across the street from the venerable Café de France on Park Avenue. Living up to the standards set by the French boîte is no easy task, but he brings an accomplished pedigree to the tony thoroughfare, and while the 'Toscanaâ?� in 'Trattoria Toscanaâ?� is taken somewhat liberally here, there's enough brio to draw a mixed crowd into the quaint little eatery. <p> Apart from the interrogation-room lighting fixtures, the dining room is tastefully appointed, with bold blue-and-red modern art gracing the beige walls ' not exactly playing up the simple, rustic, old-world charm Tuscany is known for, but then again, neither does the food. Items I expected to see ' steak Florentine and hearty bean soup, for example ' were nowhere to be found, while all the pastas with cream sauces on the menu weren't exactly indicative of Tuscan cuisine. The fresh-baked bread, a Tuscan fundamental, was wonderfully light and airy with a crispy crust, but serving it with cold squares of butter rather than extra virgin olive oil was a little surprising. We thoroughly enjoyed the salmon carpaccio ($9.95), every slice undoubtedly fresh, superbly smoky and embellished with creamy goat cheese, red onions and capers, served with roasted red peppers and olives. A heavy sauce weighed down the eggplant alla parmigiana ($8.95), but the substantial starter (along with the bread) could easily satisfy diners on a shoestring budget, particularly the Rollins College students who frequent the place. Same goes for their thin-crust pizzas ($11.50 to $13.95). <p> Pastas dominate the mains. The gnocchi ($12.50), done in the Sorrento style, was bathed in the requisite sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil leaves, even though the potato dumplings were slightly overdone and on the soft side. Still, that was the sole fault of this otherwise rewarding dish. Pollo di Babbo ($13.95), a holdover from the days when Martorelli ran Babbo in College Park, was a thick, rich and completely filling second course. The corpulent breast stuffed with spinach, ricotta and mozzarella was served atop a bed of spaghetti drenched in a creamy sherry wine sauce. The sauce had life, but the breast, surprisingly, was lackluster. <p> A decent wine list emphasizes Italian varietals (a glass of chianti is practically a must), and if you require assistance in your selection, the knowledgeable waiters are sure to help. Service, it should be noted, was impeccable, polished and professional, though placing all our leftovers in tinfoil was bizarre. Sure, it's more enviro-friendly than Styrofoam, but I didn't appreciate finishing mushy leftover tiramisu ($6.95) the following day. No matter, it was still good. Same goes for the homemade cannoli ($6.95) with its generous filling, restrained cinnamon essence and perfectly done shell. <p> Trattoria Toscana isn't perfect, and it may not even be totally Tuscan, but the restaurant shows a lot of promise.

Whenever I was fortunate enough to get a blow job, my penis would go limp after about a minute. I never felt enough stimulation to stay hard, let alone to orgasm or even ejaculate.

33,"The front page of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun claimed a world-exclusive interview this morning. The interviewee - President Donald Trump, who is in the U.K. right now. And Trump was not mincing his words in this interview. He said that Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, had wrecked the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. He also praised one of the prime minister's political rivals. And he slammed the mayor of London, who he has had a long-running war of words with. <p> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You have a mayor who's done a terrible job in London. He's done a terrible job. And take a look at the terrorism that's taken place. Look at what's going on in London. I think he's done a terrible job. But I think that all of this immigration has really changed the fabric of Europe. <p> GREENE: NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, who hosts All Things Considered, is covering the president's visit to London and just sat down with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Mary Louise, good morning. <p> MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Good morning from London, David. <p> GREENE: Well, so where exactly are you? <p> KELLY: Well, so I did just interview Mayor Khan here at city hall at his office. We are - I'm speaking to you now from up by the roof of city hall, looking down over the Thames River, boats crawling up and down. The Tower of London is in the background. It is quite a day in London, glorious weather too, which will be working in favor of the protesters which are expected later today. <p> GREENE: And they sound like they're going to be pretty sizable protests greeting President Trump on this trip. <p> KELLY: They are expecting thousands and thousands of protesters starting at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon here. They're going to walk down one of the main streets of London and end up at Trafalgar Square, which is about as close to London gets to having a central square. And there, you know, you never know, but there is tremendous buzz about it. And a lot of groups, a lot of people organizing to get people out to protest everything they do not like about President Trump. So that's all coming up this afternoon here. <p> GREENE: Well, I want to get to exactly what the mayor told you. But just first, can you step back and tell me how people in general are reacting to the president of the United States arriving for, you know, a pretty formal visit, meeting with the prime minister, meeting and having tea with the Queen of England and then doing this interview where he really didn't mince his words at all? <p> KELLY: He certainly did not. It is what everyone here is talking about. I woke up, turned on the BBC Breakfast News. And the anchor of that program opened the show, of course, with this interview and said, it's hard to know where to start, isn't it? And then he said, how could it be any worse from the point of view of Prime Minister May, who is hosting Donald Trump, who had a - what appeared to be a lovely dinner from the outside? We don't know quite what she knew last night as this interview was about to break, if she knew it was coming or what exactly had been said. <p> And now aides on both sides, the British delegation, American delegation here trying to figure out how the heck do we go forward with the day's meetings on this working lunch that's been planned when President Trump has thrown, you know, a wrecking ball, a firebomb - pick your metaphor - into what they were supposed to be negotiating over? <p> GREENE: OK. In addition to that wrecking ball or whatever you're going to call it in terms of the meetings with the prime minister, President Trump also harsh attacks on the mayor of London. So tell us about what those attacks were and then, of course, what he had to tell you in this interview. <p> KELLY: Well, as you heard, President Trump there saying he - President Trump says Mayor Khan has done a terrible job as mayor, he's done a terrible job keeping the city safe. There have, of course, been a number of recent attacks in London in the last year or so. So I asked Mayor Khan about this, and more broadly, just about this whole Sun interview ripping Theresa May and others. And here is what Mayor Khan told me. <p> SADIQ KHAN: Well, he's entitled to have his views. I'm not going to rise to the individual things President Trump says. I'm hoping during the course of his visit, he sees a city and a country very comfortable in ourselves, very comfortable in our diversity, see it as something we should celebrate, not be scared of. <p> KELLY: So you hear - it's Mayor Khan basically adopting the Michelle Obama mantra. When they go low, we go high. He's refusing to slam back quite in as unmincing (ph) words as President Trump came out with, but clearly taking exception to just about everything President Trump said in this interview. <p> GREENE: Reminds me a little bit of Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, too, after he met with President Trump recently. And Trump left those meetings in Canada saying, you know, France, we are a proud country. We're comfortable in ourselves. We don't need to engage in this kind of stuff. Let me just ask you, Mary Louise. There's been all these stories about this blimp, a blimp like a balloon of a baby Donald Trump the protesters have up. Didn't they need to get permission from the mayor to have this? Did the mayor talk about that? <p> KELLY: They did. The blimp is up. The mayor did sign off on it, which is controversial. And I asked the mayor about that, you know, defend why this is a good idea. Here's what he told me on the blimp. <p> KHAN: Can you imagine what your listeners would think if their politicians curtailing free speech, curtailing the right to protest simply because somebody is offended, what's next? One of the things that we should be really proud of, both Americans and Brits, is the rights we have to protest and to express our views. And the key thing is it should be done in a peaceful manner. It should be good-spirited. <p> GREENE: All right. Have you seen the blimp? <p> KELLY: So Mayor Khan there making the case. It is up, and we're on our way there next.

34,"Network where the action is <p> June 18, 2010 <p> I'm not good at networking or socialising. At least I never thought I was. People kept telling me to go to certain parties, but until recently I thought I'd just make a fool of myself, trying desperately to impress ""the important people"". <p> But then I realised that maybe I had the wrong conception of these kind of things. It turned out that I just had to get to talk with people, be myself, tell something about me, and to have a bit of luck. And suddenly I had a great opportunity at hand! <p> But before I realised that, I came to understand something else: It's never wrong to be where the action is. I was in Cannes during the film festival this year. I did not have anaccreditation and I was aware I wouldn't be seeing much (which turned out to be completely wrong, but that's another story), I just came to enjoy the athmosphere and the sun. <p> On day one of my visit I had already seen my first red carpet show and was so thrilled about it and happy with my visit that I thought the day was over. So I went to a bar to celebrate all by myself. But that day wasn't over by far and I wasn't all by myself for long. Within minutes I got talking with two Americans at the next table. At first I was a bit disappointed that they weren't film people, but they were nice and I stayed for longer than I had anticipated. And after a while I found out they were pilots of a private jet belonging to a Hollywood producer. <p> Actually, I didn't care much about this fact as I didn't look at this as a business contact. But later I told one of them about the film script I'm working on. He was suddenly all interested and asked a whole lot of questions about it and then said, well, give it to me and I'll give it my boss. For some reason I didn't take this too seriously either and just kept on talking about something, wondering why the hell he wasn't listening, but talking on the phone, until I heard the words: ""I'm sitting here with this young, interesting, european film-maker. Could she send you her new film script?"" And then he handed over the phone to me! <p> And there I was, talking to a Hollywood producer at 2 am about my screenplay. And he did invite me to send the script over! <p> The next day it took me a while to realize what really had happened that night, but the fact is, I got my first connection to Hollywood and whatever the outcome will be, at least I know now what being in the right place at the right time and talking to people can be worth. <p> Carmen Moreno is a young filmmaker from Sevilla, Spain.

37,"S&P 500 vs. Total Stock Market <p> This article compares the S&P 500 with the Total Stock Market. The two indices are very similar but contain important differences. Is there an advantage to owning a Total Stock Market fund instead of the S&P 500? Or is it the other way around? After reading this article you will have a solid understanding of these similar yet different indices. <p> Who Cares? <p> Before launching into a detailed discussion lets pause for a moment and ask ourselves an important question: Who cares? The unfortunate answer to this question is ""Not many."" The next question we ask is: Who should care? The answer to this question is ""Still not many, but a few more than last time."" The astute reader has probably deduced that there a few people who should care about the differences between the S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market but do not. Read on to find out if you are one of those people. <p> Introduction <p> The S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market are both market-capitalization weighted indices. The S&P 500 represents the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States, accounting for a few other factors such as liquidity and industry grouping. The Wilshire 5000 and MSCI US Broad Market Index are indices that contain all active publicly traded U.S. stocks which at current count numbers more than 6,7001. There is little difference between Total Stock Market indices and this article will not distinguish between them. <p> The S&P 500 and Total Stock Market indices can be purchased through a variety of mutual funds or ETFs. I recommend purchasing the Vanguard funds VFINX for the S&P 500 and VTSMX for the Total Stock Market. <p> Similarities <p> Diagram 1: Comparison of S&P 500 vs. Total Stock Market <p> Diagram 1 shows a comparison of the S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market. The comparison spans roughly 10 years from June 20, 1996 to January 22, 2006. Over this time period $10,000 invested in the Total Stock Market would have grown into $22,119.01 at a respectable rate of 8.67% per year. $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 would grow into $21,180.82 at a rate of 8.14% per year. The Total Stock Market returned nearly $1,000 more than the S&P 500 (or 0.53% more per year). <p> Does this chart alone mean the Total Stock Market is the superior index? Certainly not. How would the results differ if our time period ended in June 2000 instead of January 2006? According to Diagram 1 the S&P 500 performed better than the Total Stock Market until June 2000 at which point the trend reversed. Therefore if our time period ended in June 2000 the S&P 500 would have performed better than the Total Stock Market. This shows that it is dangerous to measure performance using a small amount of data. Ten years is not enough. <p> If you have difficulty understanding which index is performing better, think about the chart as if it were a horse race. The distance between the lines can also represent the distance between two horses. Until June 2000 the S&P 500 horse pulled ahead of the Total Stock Market horse meaning it was running fastest, or performing the best. After June 2000 the Total Stock Market horse closed the gap between the S&P 500 horse, meaning it was running faster than the S&P 500 horse even though it was still losing the race until April 2005. <p> The only valid conclusion we can draw from Diagram 1 is that the S&P 500 performance closely matched the Total Stock Market performance from June 20, 1996 to January 22, 2006. In reality, the S&P 500 will always perform similarly to the Total Stock Market. This is true because the two indices are nearly identical: 80% of the Total Stock Market ingredients are the S&P 500. To illustrate, observe the top five holdings of each index in Diagram 2: <p> We see that both indices have the same top 5 holdings in roughly the same amounts. For example, consider $1,000,000 invested in both indices. This would purchase $36,100 of ExxonMobil in the S&P 500. In the Total Stock Market it would purchase $28,700 of ExxonMobil which is about 80% of $36,100. <p> If both indices hold roughly the same stocks then we would expect them to perform roughly the same. Thankfully this is true and the logical order of the universe is not breaking down2. If 80% of the Total Stock Market is the S&P 500, what's in the other 20%? <p> Differences <p> The Total Stock Market is comprised of many more companies than the S&P 500. It is more than ten times larger, in fact. How is it possible that their performance is so similar? The answer is that both indices are market-capitalization weighted. This means that each stock in the index is weighted proportionally to its market cap. Lets run through an example: <p> The current market cap of the entire US stock market is 13.8 trillion dollars. The current market cap of General Electric (GE) is 348.3 billion dollars. 348.3 billion divided by 13.8 trillion is 0.0252, which can also be written as 2.52%. This means that GE represents 2.52% of the total US stock market. Looking at Diagram 2 we notice that GE composes 2.52% of the Total Stock Market index as well. This is not a coincidence. Lets take a look at a different company, Somanetics (SMTS). Somanetics weighs in at a market cap of 274.9 million dollars which is less than one thousandth the size of GE. This represents 0.0019% of the total US stock market. Therefore we would expect Somanetics to compose 0.0019% of a Total Stock Market mutual fund such as VTSMX3. <p> Now we should understand how the Total Stock Market can contain so many stocks and still perform similarly to the S&P 500: The additional stocks in the Total Stock Market have a small impact on performance because they make up a small portion of the index. In our example the price movements of GE are over one thousand times more important than the movement of Somanetics. As of January 24, 2006 the Total Stock Market is composed as follows: <p> Since small and medium cap stocks represent a smaller percentage of the Total Stock Market, one might think they are not important. This is far from true. Owning small and medium cap stocks diversify the Total Stock Market holdings and may increase performance in the long run. Lets take a look at another diagram: <p> Diagram 4: Total Stock Market components: NAESX (small) VIMSX (medium) VFINX (large) <p> Diagram 4 shows the performance of small, medium and large cap stocks from May 28, 1998 to January 23, 2006. Small cap is red, medium cap is blue and large cap is green. We see that large cap stocks win the race until about June 2000 when they begin to lose value rather quickly. At this point in history many people became quite unhappy as their net worth began to approach zero. People whose portfolios consisted mainly of large cap stocks were the most unhappy of the bunch, although not quite as unhappy as those who owned technology stocks. If you remember the beginning of this article (I know, it's long. I'm sorry.) then you remember that the Total Stock Market began to perform better than the S&P 500 at about this same time. What was previously a mystery is now solved. The Total Stock Market performed better than the S&P 500 because it contains medium and small cap stocks which have recently outperformed the large cap stocks in the S&P 500. Since the Total Stock Market index is diversified in small and medium cap stocks it was less affected the poor performance of the S&P 500. The other side of this coin is that it will also be less affected by strong performance of the S&P 500. No free lunch here.",Information/Explanation,Information/Explanation,"The author's purpose is to inform the reader about the differences and similarities between the S&P 500 and Total Stock Market indices, and provide an understanding of these similar yet different indices.

38,"Oregon Communities and Developers Face Significantly Heightened Standards Following ESA Consultation on National Flood Insurance Program <p> On April 14, 2016, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) released its Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7(a)(2) Biological Opinion regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in Oregon (Oregon BiOp). <p> Similar to the 2008 Biological Opinion issued by NMFS regarding the NFIP in the Puget Sound region (the Puget Sound BiOp), the Oregon BiOp concludes that the Oregon NFIP allows and encourages floodplain development that jeopardizes the continued existence of 16 ESA-listed anadromous fish species and Southern Resident killer whales, and results in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat for the fish species. In contrast to the Puget Sound BiOp, where NMFS permitted FEMA to rely heavily on local governments to implement more restrictive floodplain development standards, the Oregon BiOp takes a different approach to the ""reasonable and prudent alternative"" (RPA), and directs FEMA to change significant portions of the NFIP at the national level. Specifically, NMFS directed FEMA to change mapping protocols and the minimum floodplain regulatory criteria that all local jurisdictions must adopt to participate in the NFIP (enabling residents and businesses within their jurisdictions to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP) and to enforce NMFS's proposed new national standards against local governments in Oregon. <p> The magnitude of the Oregon BiOp is startling. If implemented as written, it could force local governments in Oregon, and ultimately other jurisdiction around the country, to apply much more restrictive development standards to larger floodplain areas to maintain eligibility to participate in the NFIP. For both public and private property owners and developers near a river or coast line, these changes could effectively prohibit the majority of development options, significantly reducing the value of previously high priced lands. <p> The Oregon BiOp includes a six element RPA, which directs FEMA to implement a series of immediate and longer term changes to the operation of the NFIP. In the short term, RPA Element 2 directs FEMA to require local jurisdictions in Oregon participating in the NFIP to adopt ""interim measures"" intended to protect floodplain habitat and listed species while FEMA adopts changes nationally to the NFIP. These measures include requiring that all development in the 100-year floodplain in Oregon be mitigated to achieve ""no net loss of natural floodplain functions"" through a combination of compensatory flood storage (at ratios higher than 1:1), and eliminating or mitigating for the use of impervious surfaces (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, etc.) in the floodplain. Further, Element 2 directs FEMA as an interim measure to identify a ""riparian buffer zone"" (RBZ) in Oregon measured 170 feet horizontally from the ordinary high water mark of perennial or intermittent streams, and limit the types of development allowed in the RBZ to: (1) water dependent uses, (2) habitat restoration activities, (3) activities that result in a beneficial gain for the listed species or habitat, and (4) activities that will have no adverse effects on listed species or habitat, i.e., activities that will not degrade or limit natural floodplain functions in any way. The BiOp sets forth a narrow definition for ""water dependent uses"": ""a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless located or carried out in proximity to water."" The Oregon BiOp directs that FEMA must complete implementation of Element 2 by March 15, 2018. <p> Concurrent with implementing the interim measures in Element 2, RPA Elements 3 and 4 direct FEMA to change both its floodplain mapping program and the minimum floodplain development criteria at the national level. If FEMA opts to move forward with implementation of these Elements as currently written, they will represent a dramatic shift in the requirements and operation of the NFIP. Specifically, Element 3 directs FEMA to begin mapping erosion prone areas as ""E Zones"" on FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS) and to designate them ""high hazard areas."" (FEMA has not previously mapped E Zones.) These E Zones would encompass the entire channel migration zone (CMZ) for most rivers except where the CMZ has been disconnected by existing infrastructure or development. Further, Element 3 directs FEMA to begin depicting the ""Area of Future Conditions Flood Hazards"" on its FIRMS, including accounting for climate change and anticipated future development/build out. Element 3 also directs FEMA to expand the boundary of the regulatory ""floodway,"" to accelerate issuance of updated floodplain maps and to use more elaborate floodplain modelling techniques (e.g., multi-dimensional and unsteady state hydraulic models), and to require ESA-compliance for proposed FIRM amendments. <p> Element 4 directs FEMA to incorporate an ""ESA performance standard"" into its minimum floodplain management criteria, and then to develop region specific guidance based on the particular ESA listed species and designated habitat in each region. This element would have the effect of applying ESA-based protection standards to purely local floodplain development permits – permits which are not currently subject to ESA consultation requirements. Element 4 further directs FEMA to change its regulations to prohibit new development or substantial improvements in ""high hazard areas,"" defined as the expanded regulatory floodway and E Zones (per Element 3), except for (a) open space uses, (b) habitat restoration activities, (c) low intensity recreational uses, (d) water dependent uses (as defined above), and (e) bioengineered bank protection, all subject to appropriate mitigation. The Oregon BiOp calls for FEMA to implement Elements 3 and 4 no later than January 1, 2021, with earlier interim deadlines. <p> If implemented as written, the Oregon RPA will significantly expand the mapped floodplain and tighten regulations applicable to floodplain development within Oregon, and ultimately across the country, through changes to FEMA's floodplain mapping and minimum floodplain regulation criteria. FEMA has signaled significant concern with the Oregon BiOp's RPA to NMFS, the State of Oregon and local communities, and has suggested to local jurisdictions that they await further direction from FEMA before jumping ahead and trying to implement the RPA as written. <p> Overall, the Oregon BiOp appears to be the next step in an ongoing ""show down"" between FEMA and NMFS that is likely to result in significant changes to the way floodplains around the country are mapped and regulated. For more information regarding the Oregon BiOp and its RPA, please contact Molly Lawrence.",News,News,"The text is an objective reporting of a new biological opinion from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) that could affect the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in Oregon.

44,"Severus the Magnificent! <p> Severus' story begins in February of this year on a walking trail in Everson, PA. Two girls, Callie and Gena called our answering service and asked if FosterCat could help with a stray cat that had been obviously abandoned and that they had found when walking on this trail. <p> Apparently Severus had approached both girls meowing and continued to follow them on the trail until they stopped and petted him. They noticed that he had a wound on his leg and was limping and knew they could not just leave him in this wooded area. They immediately picked him up and took him to a vet to get medical attention for his leg. Thankfully, the vet said that there was no bone or muscle damage and after cleaning the wound, Severus was put on antibiotics. After a few weeks, Severus was neutered, given his vaccinations and tested for feline leukemia/FIV. The results were positive for FIV. We thought we would have a hard time placing Severus because of that diagnosis, even though we knew he could live a long and productive life. Severus was dealt yet another blow when the vet noticed that his eye was very cloudy. After a close examination, it was determined that Severus had an iris melanoma. FosterCat immediately took Severus to an eye specialist where they confirmed the diagnosis and recommended that his eye be removed. Poor Severus had gone through so much during his rescue and transition and now needed to have major surgery! Jordana, one of our foster parents, stepped up and offered to foster Severus during his long convalescence from eye surgery. Recently, her senior cat who had been in renal failure, sadly passed away and she felt that she needed to help another cat in distress. Severus was lucky to be that cat! After the surgery, Jordana made sure that Severus had everything he needed so that he would have a speedy and comfortable recovery. <p> Well, as they say, the rest is history. Severus had his surgery and it was a success. More importantly, Jordana and Severus bonded! She decided she could not give up this little guy and decided to adopt him. Needless to say, all of us at FosterCat were absolutely thrilled! As you can see by the pictures, he is doing well and is living and loving each new day! <p> There are so many more cats out there who need happy endings like Severus. We have two cats, Gulliver and James Bond (007-licensed to thrill), that have similar stories and just need someone like you to open their hearts and home. Both are wonderful, loving cats that need a second chance at the ""good life."" Please go to FosterCat's website, www.fostercat.org and take a look at these wonderful cats! They are waiting for a special home like yours! <p> Severus is very lucky! His story is only one of many, many cats outside who are in trouble and need our help. Because of your generous support, FosterCat has been able to lend a helping hand to many of these cats in need, just like Severus. We will never give up on these cats. While we may not be able to help all of them, FosterCat will continue to save them, ""one cat at a time."" <p> We would like to keep you informed by sending you updates and information about important events, like our upcoming Bingo Fundraiser.

You can specify FosterCat, Inc as your charity! <p> Eight is Never Enough <p> Late in February of this year, Kim Z., our foster parent, noticed on Facebook that a woman (Kimmie) posted that she was feeding multiple cats at her house in Verona and was asking for help. One group was able to get a few of the cats to the vet for TNR, but ""Kimmie"" kept noticing more and more cats were showing up at her house to be fed. Kimmie was extremely worried as she noticed that many of the cats were calicos and the thought of more multiple litters of kittens being born outside scared and overwhelmed her into seeking help. Kim was able to call and lend her traps to get the ball rolling. When visiting Kimmie to check out the situation, Kim noticed that one particular male cat (Sylvester) was older, not exactly friendly and not neutered. Kim immediately surmised that he was the father of most of these cats and that he should be neutered immediately. Kim was able to get Sylvester into a carrier, and off to the vet he went. Once he was vetted and released, Kimmie noticed that he was much calmer and pretty much hung out around the house. <p> Traps were immediately set for the remaining cats and after much diligence and perseverance during the coming weeks, one cat after another was trapped and spayed/neutered. It was then Kim noticed that most of the calicos and many of the males were friendly and could be adopted out. Needless to say, all of us at FosterCat were thrilled to know that we could place these cats into permanent, loving homes. We started with Andy and Bonnie. They were just the sweetest cats and we were able to place them into a loving home with Holly T. and her husband, who are indeed two very special people. Holly writes..""The kittens are doing great. It didn't take them long before they were sitting with us. They played with their toys for hours last night and we got them a cat tree for Valentine's Day which they love. Thank you so much for giving them to us. They will be loved so much."" <p> The next two who were adopted out were Vinnie and Guiseppe (now Lil Ace and Bandit)! These two also got a wonderful home with Dan S. Dan writes ""The cats are doing fantastic! I am extremely glad that I adopted both cats. The entertainment those two provide on a daily basis is incredible! Thank you for giving me this opportunity."" <p> Ginnie and Mira have also been adopted, along with Maya. We are awaiting updates and pictures. Delta is still in foster but we are hoping to get her a wonderful home as well. I call them the 'Verona Eight!' <p> You are probably wondering at this point why I decided to do a story on these eight cats. I wanted to emphasize how important it is to ìreach out and ask for helpî when feeding stray or feral cats. Two cats can quickly turn into 22 cats, so I can't stress the importance of reaching out to a rescue organization (Homeless Cat Management Team, Animal Friends, Homeless Cats of Butler, Fix UR Cat, Merlinís Safe Haven, etc. to name just a few) so that they can give you information on TNR (trap, neuter and return) or for upcoming clinic information. Please remember that feeding the cats is only the first step! Itís important to follow through and do the right thing for the cats. Spay/neuter is the only answer. There are free and low cost clinics out there so why not take advantage of them. If you don't know how to trap, numerous organizations will show you, but you have to reach out and ASK! <p> For these eight cats, it meant the difference between just existing outside; exposed to the elements in the bitter cold of winter with no food, clean water or shelter. The cats end up having flea infestations, worms, ticks, and upper respiratory infections, not to mention predators. These poor females have litter after litter with no end in sight. No tame cat or dog deserves to live a miserable life outside (through no fault of their own) when we can get them indoor homes to live out their lives in comfort. Don't they truly deserve that much? FosterCat is determined to continue its mission of 'Saving lives one cat at a time.' That my friend is what FosterCat is all about. <p> Blessing of the Animals Update <p> Seventy five dogs, cats and a few guinea pigs received a special blessing at Unity Presbyterian Church's second annual Blessing of the Animals event on June 1st.

I do on rare occasions have to explain the difference between a ""Jailer"" (aka ""guard"") and ""Corrections Officer"" but for the most part everyone around me knows what I do and all the training I have gone through for the sake of the job. I think the BEST remedy for the image of CO as goon lies with the officers themselves. If more CO's had more interest in training, education, professionalism and physical conditioning then that stereotype wouldn't be quite as widespread. How many of you work with at least ONE semi-literate, overweight, lazy, rude (or any combination thereof) CO? How many of your coworkers are just there for a paycheck and aren't very committed to the job itself? How we conduct ourselves on the job and off goes a long way towards shaping how people regard our profession. <p> Yeah Cq I know they lowered the standards. I've seen a few of 'em, and frankly I think one CO is a bit on the mental slow side. It's scary. Knuckle Dragger? Naw.. most of my inmates look at me 1) Like I'm crazier than they are, 2) Know I'm prior military, 3) Don't put up with any crap, and finally 4) Know I don't mind a good fight. So it all tends to keep things on an even keel in my part of the ""insane wing"". I push education with the ones that are the medical detainees, and will work with them if they need help with their studies. Hell I don't mind as long as they want it. I've told 'em that I have a B.A., M.A., and M.B.A. mebbe I can figure things out a little. <p> Of all the Public and Law Enforcement services I would have to say that we in Corrections would have the Darkest and most Twisted sense of humour of all. But then again look at the environment that we work in and the people we work and deal with. Is it any surprise. Our Job is completely unique in every way. Sure we even have our own language. I remember being out one night with friends from work and some Humans (what we call civilians). Half the time the Humans couldn't understand what we were saying and the other half puzzled and at times horrified by what we found funny. <p> I'm fairly short so my knuckles are close to the ground, but they don't quite drag! Good thing, draging my knuckles would totally ruin my nails! <p> And to think that I thought that it was only the dry air and old age making my hands cracked and calloused. It wasn't untill tonight, after I got to work and found a few peddles and dirt in my knuckles that I realized what you all where talking about. <p> It looks like every state has openings in corrections but few answer the call. We've had posts in the past where we talked about seeing corrections staff who don't take care of their uniforms or even attempt to look professional. Is it possible that a lot of potential new-hires shy away because they think the job is beneath them and only a Neanderthal will do it? <p> I totally agree that you can't understand working in corrections and can't appreciate the humor unless you've worked in corrections. <p> Hey Sniper7310, got to agree with the humor aspect. If someone were to tell me the things these idiots do before I got into this business I'd never believed them. As for the recession, look around. It's nation...scratch that, World Wide as our economey effects the World. DSHS is dropping claims as families have exceeded the time frames and are no longer elligable for benefits. For those who are dealing with Labor & Industries in a fight for disability, only adds to the stress and depression. The result will increase in crime and suicide. In WA, they have lowered the standards so new recruits may get hired on....lol <p> No one will really understand what we do until they have done it themselves. No documentary can begin to show what it is like and what we put up with every day. I will give some credit Hard Time (nice job ODRC) is good but still will never be able to show what its really like. Then they think they know what its like and look at us like we are completly nuts because of our warped sense of humor. If you cant laugh about the warped things you will go crazy. One thing though that I cannot figure out. Ohio is in a huge recession, highest unemployment rate in how long, so the new officers coming in ARE THE BEST WE CAN FIND.....REALLY? <p> Unfortunately unlike the Police whom the public see every day and look upon as Guardians of their safety, we are hidden behind high walls and razor wire. And apart from a few Documentaries on TV. Most of the media portray us as lowly educated Neanderthals in uniform. What they don't see is the work involved. Let me take one example. Criminal Intelligence gathering. My colleagues and I in O.S.G. (Operational Support Group) work very closely with the Police sharing gathered intel. Which has lead to some stunning victories against the criminal gangs both inside and outside the prison system. And until the day comes when the media give us a fair shake we will always be thought of as Knuckle Dragger's. <p> I have a couple of nephews that have been in and out of jail/prison and like most all inmate mothers/grandmothers/girlfriends they believe everything they tell them hook, line and sinker. So them I'M the one that's looked on with suspicion because I'm one of them big, mean prison guards their little darling told them all about. I've tried to set the record straight a couple times in as gentle a manner as possible but you can tell they're always going to believe them more than me. <p> There is a lot of buzz about the economy, especially here in Ohio. When state workers (in general) complain about cutbacks, a common response is ""If the job is so bad, quit!"" It's difficult to respond to that statement in a sentence or two, but one reply might be ""If the job is so good, come join us."" <p> Money is a big consideration to just about any job, regardless of what the job is, and I freely admit that I wouldn't be working Corrections if the state paid minimum wage with benefits like most private employers offer. <p> We work side by side with people that the general public wouldn't want as next door neighbors, and the general public doesn't realize what we deal with day after day. It's more than simply watching and feeding prisoners. My friends and family understand what I do, but even they don't REALLY understand what the job is all about. They do, however, know me on a personal level and they know I'm not in this job because I think I'm going to get rich. <p> Do you have any neighbors, friends or family who still think we are knuckle dragging ""prison guards?"" Do you still respond to their inaccurate perceptions of what you do, or have you given up?",Forum,Forum,"This text seems to belong to the ""Forum"" genre, where people can discuss and exchange opinions on different topics.

They're all startups from the clever folks at Mint Digital. Check out DeskBeers and Boomf at your leisure, but today we're talking bathtime with The Bathory and their custom-made, hand-blended bath soaks. <p> The Bathory invited me to have a go at making my own soak a little while ago. It's a pleasure to browse the lovely site and choose the perfect ingredients for your very own bath-time invention. First you pick a base of salts, either designed to soothe, detox or just bask. <p> Then you can layer on three essential oils: information is given about the properties and effects of each fragrance so you can pick ones that revive, relax or inspire you. Pop your choices in the basket and a few days later a beautifully-designed little bag lands on your doorstep. <p> You can clearly smell the fragrant oils even from outside the packaging! I couldn't wait to give it a go. The jar is pretty enough to display on the shelf all the time and is enough for several happy bathtimes. <p> I went for a detox base with grapefruit, bergamot and rosemary oils, and it smelled absolutely amazing. You need to add quite a lot to get a truly scented bath, but my favourite way to use it is in the shower: mixed with a little olive oil it's a dreamy shower scrub. It made my skin really soft and the scent lasted after I dried off. I'll definitely be replacing my jar when it runs out – the question is do I stick with my current blend or try a new one...? <p> The competition is now closed.

53,"Related Posts <p> Comments (53) <p> I went for a sooooothing bergamot, grapefruit and lemon. I think it would make a good morning shower scrub. Uplifted and inspired. Super ready to take on the day! Yay! <p> Thank you for drawing my attention to this innovative start-up! Baths are so precious and it's lovely that someone is bringing something special to the market for bath-time. <p> Personally I'd go for the following: lavender (I can't sleep without smelling some of this beautiful scent each night), rosemary (this reminds me of the Swiss thermal baths of yesteryear), and ylang-ylang (because who doesn't want a little bit of sexiness in there too?!). <p> Ohh, many decisions to be made but a detox with grapefruit, lavender and ylang ylang. I have some grapefruit and lavender soap that I love and I think ylang ylang would just add a lovely warmth to it. <p> These look incredible, and would be perfect to soothe and revive me in my current mad dash to finish my PhD thesis! I would go for a base of epsom salts (because who doesn't want their bath to help slim them?!) with Bergamot, Ylang Ylang and Frankincense, to give me a boost and make me smell like a vixen afterwards! :-) Thanks for the giveaway! Congratulations to the winner (who I am secretly hoping will be me!). <p> Turn me into a CITRUS! I would pick Detox Salts, Lemon, Grapefruit and Chamomile. Hopefully, I will come out smelling like a Citrus but not resembling the fruit itself. <p> Oooh, what to choose? I think I'd go for a detox with lavender, rosemary, and ylang ylang. Might have to go and run a bath right now, I forget how lovely they are! <p> I've been desperate to try these guys out but hadn't quite worked out how mang baths/soaks a bottle would give you? What do you reckon? Either way I'd love to win since coming back from travelling I've actually turned into The Little Mermaid and love baths more than anything. I'd go for Ylang Ylang, Rosemary and Chamomile. x <p> Wow these look incredible! I would probably pick lavender as I love floral aromas and maybe infuse it with chamomile to add a relaxing edge :) <p> After a couple of years without a bath, I'm really looking forward to long soaks especially after a hot bike ride! My combo would be a citrus-tastic happy one of lemon, grapefruit & bergamot. x <p> For me baths are definitely about relaxing so I'd go for the Soothe base with the lavender (I am basically addicted), rosemary and sandalwood oils. This company sounds really amazing. Thanks for writing about them. <p> Wow! I've been looking for something like this for a while. I just had a look at the checkout process to pick my favourite and what a fantastic experience it was. I was a bit nervous to pick oils that didn't clash but they'd figured everything out for me – so easy and relaxing, I wish more sites would take note and have less painful purchase processes! And with worldwide shipping for $3, what's not to love! The ingredients list displayed clearly is also a massive bonus for those of us who try to avoid using a lot of chemicals. <p> My dream blend would be Soothe (honey, oatmeal and buttermilk) with lavender, frankincense and rosemary. Ahhh, just thinking about it makes me want to go take a bath right now. That's ok, at 9.30am, right?? <p> Great giveaway! I would like to try all of oils and salts.:-) But I am choosing Soothe base with lavender, rosemary and frankincense. Just noticed that girls comment has the same ingredients.:-) Thanks! <p> Hi Katie! I don't read on a regular basis, but I really appreciate the effort you put into each blog post. <p> Custom bath soaks – just what I've been waiting for. I'm kind of addicted to the smell of chamomile, it's so relaxing and ever since the Kneipp company discontinued their Chamomile bath a few years ago I've been desperate to find a similar product – yet without success so far. That's why I'd choose chamomile as my sole ingredient. <p> By the way – in a few weeks I'll be in London again. As far as I remember you are a vegetarian but do you have any recommendations for not too fancy restaurants or pubs where they offer nice sunday roasts? Thanks in advance! <p> Think I'd opt for Soothe with Ylang Ylang, Camomile and Grapefruit. Sounds delightful! Love the look of the website and simplistic design of the bottles. <p> Wow! What a fab idea, and thanks for the giveaway! It's a popular choice, but I love the idea of of a zingy combination of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit in a soothe base <p> Ooooo! I'd pick the detox salts with rosemary for a bit of magic, lemon to add some zing and grapefruit for inspiration. It sounds totally delish! x <p> I originally saw The Bathory after your first tweet about them! I loved the look of them so bought my mum one as a treat, as I felt guilty buying myself one but loved the idea and brand! I got her a soothe blend with lavender, chamomile and bergamot. I'd go for something slightly different I think, like a detox blend with grapefruit, eucalyptus and bergamot. Summery and fresh : ) <p> Oooh, this looks lovely. I'd have a detox bath with Frankincense, Bergamot and Rosemary, to relax, revive and inspire me after a particularly stressful couple of months. <p> Wow, what a great company, love blog posts like this that introduce new ventures! <p> I love a bath every now and then as a treat so I would definitely go for Soothe – with Ylang Ylang, Bergamot & Grapefruit (my favourite scent!)",Forum,Forum,The author of the text is expressing personal opinions and sharing experiences with the bath products offered by a particular company.

54,"Professor of Materials Science <p> MA University of Cambridge PhD University of Cambridge <p> Polymers and Medical Materials <p> Together with Professor Serena Best, I direct the Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials. My research focuses on materials which interact therapeutically with the body. <p> Ice templating 3D environments for the control of tissue growth <p> The availability of tailored three dimensional environments for control of cell behaviour is a key step in the regeneration of healthy tissue in the body and can also enable model tissue creation for drug screening and cancer research. We are using ice templating techniques to create materials that mimic the complex orientational and spatial anisotropy of natural tissue, and that impart defined biochemical and mechanical cues. This is enabling us to develop bespoke cellular environments for clinical contexts including cardiac, dental and orthopaedic repair, cancer research and diagnosis, and blood cell production. <p> Biodegradable polymers and composites <p> Resorbable polymers and composites may be used in temporary load-bearing applications such as sutures and pins, in scaffolds for tissue engineering and in drug-delivery devices. We are exploring the intricate temporal and spatial relationships between the processing and morphology of the material, the diffusion rates of water, drug and degradation products, the degradation rate of the polymer and ultimate properties. An understanding of these factors allows informed device design. Our study of composites ranges from the micro co-continuous to the nano-scale, for orthoapedic and other tissue repair. <p> Biostable implants <p> In many surgical applications, the implant material must not change over time within the challenging environment of the body. Issues we addressing include those spinal and cardiac surgery. <p> Drug delivery and pharmaceutics <p> We have interests relating to drug delivery to the body including drug polymorphism, tablet design and inhalation delivery systems. <p> Collagen scaffold imaged using X-ray Microtomography to reveal its 3D structure.

She's there to talk parenting. <p> ""It's important for us to discuss and share experiences and to share both opportunities and challenges as moms,"" she told HoH shortly after the get-together. <p> Mathews Burwell was a mom of two before she became a member of President Barack Obama's Cabinet. And to hear her tell it, sometimes that needed to take precedence, even amid an Ebola outbreak. <p> It was a Friday evening in 2015 when Obama called a last-minute meeting to discuss the crisis. He planned it for the next day, and although Mathews Burwell was no stranger to working on Saturdays, she already had a commitment on this particular weekend. <p> ""I sent an email and said, 'I'm happy for my team to represent me ... but I can't make that time because it's my daughter's birthday,'"" she recalled. ""And so the president moved the meeting."" <p> Don't hide ""from the fact that you're a mom,"" Mathews Burwell told the ""Moms in the House"" meeting. Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz organized the group at the beginning of the year Congress welcomed a record number of newly elected members who were also mothers. <p> The ""Moms"" meet monthly. While the type of event varies, several have been scheduled around breakfast, according to Wasserman Schultz. Past guest speakers have included Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel and Running Start CEO and founder Susannah Wellford. <p> ""It's really important that we have that bond of sisterhood and a network of women who have lived through this experience and done so successfully,"" Wasserman Schultz told HoH in January. <p> Massachusetts Rep. Katherine M. Clark went on MSNBC last Wednesday to weigh in on the group of House Republicans who stormed a closed-door impeachment hearing. But hours before she made an appearance on national TV, she was at the long table inside the Speaker's Dining Room, with fellow Democrats Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Grace Meng of New York, and Debbie Dingell of Michigan. <p> Although Wasserman Schultz's ""sisterhood of support"" is a bipartisan effort, most mothers of young kids this year are on the Democratic side.

Stacey Plaskett, a mother of five, is no stranger to that ""guilt."" The Democrat from the Virgin Islands felt it from her oldest kids who once questioned her commitment to being a full-time mom while juggling her congressional duties. <p> ""Would you tell me that if I was your dad?"" she'd respond rhetorically. ""Don't give me that s---,"" she quipped to the other women in the room who responded with laughter. <p> Their meeting felt more like a group of girlfriends swapping stories about husbands and kids than a meeting among policy wonks. <p> And while a convenient continental breakfast, featuring an assortment of muffins and bagels, was on display in the prestigious dining room for these moms-on-the-go, the preferred source of energy wasn't necessarily the carbs.

Trying to read more non fiction, especially theology and devotional, so hopefully this trend will continue. <p> Just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire and just started The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest (last of original author, Larsson, in series). <p> This book was much better for me the second time I read it, when I knew to not wait for Karla, and when I realized how much it was going to be about Jerry Westerby. It also serves some other functions I didn't figure out until I'd finished the trilogy.

73,"Bills to protect U.S. elections from foreign meddling are struggling, senators say <p> Erin Kelly USA TODAY <p> Published 6:48 PM EDT Jun 12, 2018 <p> WASHINGTON – Bipartisan bills aimed at protecting U.S. elections from foreign meddling face unexpected opposition, prompting members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to appeal to Trump administration officials for help Tuesday. <p> Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, complained that some American businesses oppose his bill, which would strengthen enforcement of a law requiring lobbyists for foreign governments to register with the Department of Justice. <p> Grassley's bill, the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would require Justice to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Companies don't want to have to register as foreign agents and oppose a provision that would require international businesses with U.S. subsidiaries to register. <p> ""We're running into opposition from some business groups that I don't think have a legitimate reason to oppose it,"" Grassley told Adam Hickey, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's national security division, during a committee hearing Tuesday. ""I wish you'd look at it and consider supporting it."" <p> The Foreign Agents Registration Act – passed by Congress in 1938 to expose Nazi agents before World War II – has received increased attention in the past year. <p> Special counsel Robert Mueller charged two former Trump campaign officials with violating the law as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. <p> Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was charged with – among other things – failing to properly disclose his work for the Kremlin-backed government in Ukraine. Richard Gates, who served as the campaign's deputy chairman, was initially charged with violating the same law, but that charge was dropped when Gates pleaded guilty to two separate crimes. <p> Despite Mueller's actions, the law has rarely been used to prosecute lobbyists, and Grassley and others pushed to step up its enforcement. <p> Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced a separate bill with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who serves on the panel. That bill would require the attorney general to create a section within the Justice Department to enforce laws against suspected operatives or agents of foreign governments. <p> The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill by Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., in January that is identical to Grassley's, but the senator's bill stalled in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Feinstein-Cornyn bill – the Foreign Agents Registration Amendments Act – also awaits action there. <p> Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said her separate, bipartisan bill aimed at protecting state election systems from cyberattacks by the Russians or other foreign governments is blocked by Senate Republicans despite the fact that it is co-sponsored by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. <p> The Secure Elections Act would streamline cybersecurity information sharing between federal intelligence agencies and state election officials and provide security clearances to state officials, so they could get classified information about cyberthreats. <p> The senators are trying to attach the bill to a sweeping defense authorization bill the Senate is likely to pass this week, but Klobuchar said their amendment faces opposition from GOP leaders. <p> ""For reasons I do not understand, our bill ... is being hung up,"" Klobuchar said Tuesday. <p> Russian hackers tried to breach the election systems of 21 states during the 2016 election, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The Russians succeeded in penetrating Illinois' voter registration database. There is no evidence that any votes were changed. <p> Hickey said he could not endorse any specific bills but promised to work with senators on their legislation. He said he expects the Justice Department to issue a public report this summer on interference in the 2016 election and ways to prevent meddling.",News,News,"The text reports on current events related to U.S. elections and foreign meddling.

82,"GCube and Modern Energy Management partner on Indonesian wind farm project <p> Modern Energy Management (MEM), a specialist in delivering project lifecycle certainty to renewable energy developers, financiers and investors, is to carry out marine warranty surveying (MWS) services at Indonesia's first utility-scale wind project, Sidrap Wind Farm, on behalf of GCube Underwriting Ltd (GCube). <p> Under the terms of the agreement, MEM will provide risk management services related to the offloading of wind turbine generator components for the 75MW wind farm. As the pace of wind energy development in the emerging markets increases, there is an urgent need for supporting infrastructure to be properly integrated into the supply chain process. Although relatively lowly ranked by the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, Indonesia is undertaking significant investment in its ports and harbours in order to better facilitate the import of capital equipment. Whilst this process takes place, however, wind energy developers require the confidence of a secure and comprehensive marine warranty service to ensure that large parts and components arrive at the project site undamaged and on time. GCube selected MEM for this work ahead of local survey companies due to the firm's clean energy specialism and expertise in the emerging Asian renewable energy markets. A key factor in the decision was ensuring the necessary depth of experience to comprehensively assess on-site and logistical risks, and prevent these leading to project delays. The Sidrap wind farm, located on a series of ridges in Northern South Sulawesi, will consist of 30 Gamesa turbines and is scheduled for completion in January 2018. The site's remote and challenging landscape poses unique logistical challenges for the construction team, and will require components to be offloaded at a jetty specially-constructed for the project. MEM will oversee the components' offloading, before they are transported to the project site itself. ""As Indonesia begins to develop in clean energy, investors need to have the confidence that their projects may be de-risked throughout the development timeline,"" says Lars Lund, Director, MEM. ""Deploying wind energy in remote regions requires a full understanding of the project risk profile. Our own development experience informed the survey work we carried out at Sidrap, and will allow us to put procedures in place to best mitigate these risks."" Charlie Richardson, Senior Underwriter at GCube, commented: ""GCube's specialised expertise in renewable energy underwriting, coupled with MEM's local knowledge of the Indonesian market, has enabled us to develop a detailed understanding of the risks related to offloading turbine components and transporting them across the country. ""Partnering in this way will ensure comprehensive oversight of what was a technically and logistically challenging element in the Sidrap Wind Farm's construction, helping the project to realise its full potential.""",News,News,"The text reports on the partnership between Modern Energy Management (MEM) and GCube Underwriting Ltd to provide risk management services related to the offloading of wind turbine generator components for Indonesia's first utility-scale wind project, Sidrap Wind Farm.

85,"Soil erosion problems are not only limited to water erosion in Iowa, although it is the dominant one due to high rainfall events and their significant impacts on sediment transport to lakes and streams in the state. However, wind erosion at this time of the year can be very significant and contribute to serious topsoil loss given the high winds experienced in the state during recent weeks. Soil loss by wind erosion may not be physically noticeable on the field, but it can be significant in terms of its effects on air, soil, and water quality over time. <p> This spring most parts of Iowa have had plenty of rainfall, causing many producers to enter fields at less-than-ideal soil conditions. High soil moisture increases soil compaction caused by field traffic and machinery. Over the past decade the size of Iowa farms has increased, leading to larger and heavier equipment. However, equipment size is only one factor among many causes of the soil compaction problem. Rushing to the field when the soil is wet can increase chances for severe soil compaction combined with the weight of equipment and traffic pattern in the field. <p> Spring rains come with unexpected quantities and force, causing significant amounts of soil erosion to unprotected cropland. Spring is the most critical time for soil erosion because of degraded crop residue, tillage in preparation for planting, and lack of crop canopy. Residue cover is not only good for preventing soil erosion, but it will cut down sediment transport to water bodies and contribute to the improvement of water quality. <p> Providing the crop an even start with weeds is still the first step in successful weed management, although the importance of this practice has diminished in many farmers' minds. An even start is provided by planting soon after the final seedbed preparation tillage pass, or in no-till by applying a burndown herbicide soon before or after planting, or use of early preplant treatments prior to the weed establishment. <p> Soil Management <p> The weather is gradually improving and most Iowa producers are getting closer to working in the field. Some have already started fieldwork. <p> However, there is still time to finalize preparation of tillage implements for spring fieldwork. Producers are encouraged to check and evaluate the design of soil-engaging components of their tillage implements, assess the potential for soil erosion, and think about their chances for a successful crop. <p> Carbon and the 'carbon cycle'. Over the past century, CO2 levels have risen significantly. There is considerable debate about the reasons -- whether it's a natural cycle or the result of increased CO2emissions due to human activities-- but there is general agreement that human activity accounts for part of the increase, especially in view of the continuing increase of CO2 levels following the on-set of the industrial age. <p> A conservation planning should be part of every Iowa farm management plan. Now is the best time to conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of conservation plans, based on field observations and the outcomes seen during the 2003 growing season. Residue management, soil erosion control, improved water quality, soil productivity and moisture conservation and its impact on yield can be used to measure success of your plan. <p> Harvest conditions in fields this fall will be determined by the extent of drought damage to each crop, especially soybeans. Decisions about equipment use for harvesting the drought-damaged crops must consider the plant moisture content, crop use, and equipment availability if owned, leased, or custom. <p> In most cases, plant moisture content has already dropped below the 60 to 70 percent recommended moisture level for ensilage. Forage material still may be collected in bales or stacks if plant material is dry enough for appropriate storage.",Information/Explanation,Information/Explanation,"The text provides information and explanation on soil erosion problems, the causes of soil erosion, and its effects on air, soil, and water quality.

86,"Being ordained for the Diocese of Belleville, Illinois, next door to the heart of the Bible Belt, I figured I would be spending lots of time dealing with Protestants, converting and arguing with these Scripture-quoting folk. I wanted to make certain no one could throw a Bible verse my way with the taunt, ""I bet you never heard that one before."" Having read the whole book, I could honestly answer, ""Yes! I have."" <p> Ironically, after 54 years of ministry, I have rarely tried to convert or argue with Protestants. I spend the vast majority of my time teaching, converting and arguing with Catholics! People of my own denomination provide the most problems for me. I certainly never saw that coming. <p> But then again, I have always thought it important to remember that during my ordination in Rome's St. Peter's Basilica, my classmates and I had to weave our way to the Altar of the Chair of St. Peter through scaffolding set up for the Second Vatican Council. That church-quaking council affected more than just my path to that particular altar; it has changed the path of my entire ministry.The biblical authors of this month's liturgies can identify with my change in direction. If their own discipleship had given them a direct path in carrying out God's plan, they probably would never have written the readings on which we are reflecting. For most, the turnabout they experienced prompted the passages we have been given. <p> Jeremiah's pericope on the First Sunday of Advent is one of the exceptions. At this point in his ministry, the prophet still believes Yahweh will rectify the abuses he has encountered in the ""normal"" way: through the Davidic leadership. When the right king sits on the throne, things will change for the better. Paul, on the other hand, has experienced a 180-degree directional change. He writes 1 Thessalonians – the oldest Christian writing we possess – for Gentiles, not for the Jews he originally presumed he would be evangelizing. Instead of first converting all Jews, then starting on Gentiles, he has reversed the process. In his revised plan, once Gentiles are turned into other Christs, jealousy will prompt Jews to follow suit. <p> In a similar turnabout, Luke seems to be the first Christian writer to abandon the general belief that the risen Jesus will return in his lifetime. He is convinced this Parousia will eventually happen, but it is going to take place while he is already enjoying heaven with the Christ, not before. That's why – writing in the mid-80s C.E. – he is so insistent that his readers stay ""vigilant."" That unique event is still going to happen, even if it is not following its original schedule. In situations like this, one can only join the psalmist in praying, ""Teach me your paths."" They are certainly not the paths God's chosen people originally started down. <p> As we know from the Second Sunday of Advent, Paul is confident that in spite of all the change in directions, ""the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ."" It is understandable that Baruch encourages his people to look forward to people returning to Jerusalem after the sixth century B.C.E. Babylonian exile, but it is important to remember what Deutero-Isaiah discovered: Most Israelites refused to accept that a non-Jew – Cyrus – would be the ""new-Moses"" who would actually bring about that return. It is one thing to pray Psalm 126, confident that Yahweh will ""[bring] back the captives of Zion."" But it is a whole other thing to agree with the process that will make that glorious day a reality. Just as Luke can see the Roman Empire as an agent of Yahweh working in the world, so his John the Baptizer can see the crooked paths, deep valleys and high mountains he encounters as the way in which God is working, even before they are straightened and leveled. It is evident that few others were able to look out on their mixed world and actually ""see the salvation of God."" If everyone could pull that off, we would have no Scripture. <p> One of my favorite ""Peanuts"" cartoons has Linus making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when he suddenly stops and looks at his hands. ""These hands,"" he reflects, ""could be the hands of a terrific scientist, or a life-saving doctor, or a great artist."" His sister Lucy looks him and points out, ""Those hands have peanut butter and jelly on them."" <p> In some sense, this is what we find on the Third Sunday of Advent. Our sacred authors could not speak in more idealistic terms of Yahweh, or the risen Jesus working in our lives. Zephaniah, for instance has confidence that the seventh century B.C.E. reforming King Josiah will restore Yahweh to the majestic place he/she deserves, actually causing God to ""sing joyfully ... as one sings at festivals."" Isaiah, the composer of today's psalm agrees. Since Yahweh is on our side, we have nothing to fear. Paul believes the risen Jesus now fulfills that role in our lives. We only must ""make your requests known to God"" through Christ and we will ""have no anxiety at all."" Beautifully and optimistically said. <p> But then, John the Baptizer – our Lucy – comes on the scene. When asked, ""What should we do?"" he leaves the idealistic language behind, simply saying, ""Share your cloaks and your food. Stop cheating and extorting. Don't lie and be satisfied with your wages."" John focuses on the peanut butter. Unless we first change our basic direction in life, there is no sense worrying about what God can achieve through us. The best might still be to come, but we will only be part of it after we clean our hands. <p> Yet as the Fourth Sunday of Advent teaches us, we will also be part of it only after we change to another direction in life: from big to small. Though St. Thérèse of Lisieux is usually credited with developing the popular theology and practice of the ""little way,"" I am afraid her insight was predated by our biblical authors. (Because Scripture was rarely a part of 19th century spirituality, I don't think she copied from them. She, like other saints, seems to have developed the concept on her own.) <p> It is consoling to look at God as the psalmist's majestic person enthroned ""upon the cherubim"" (thankfully not the baroque baby angels inhabiting many of our churches). Here we have the kind of God we presume is in charge of everything and everyone. Yet when that God gets down to the nitty-gritty, he/she works through the most insignificant people around. Micah, for instance, reminds us that the family of David, which will eventually ""save"" the chosen people, had its start in the village of Bethlehem – not the town we would expect to find on a messiah's resume. <p> Even those most involved in the conception and birth of Jesus weren't individuals we would write home about. Elizabeth, the Baptizer's mother, points that out in today's Gospel passage. She wants to know why Mary is visiting her, and not hobnobbing with some high muckety-mucks. The only thing she and her relative have going for them is that they believe God can personally work through their lives, as insignificant as they are. <p> The author of Hebrews joins in their amazement, applying the same standard to Jesus. He is not known for his good looks or superior mind. The one thing all his followers can imitate is his determination to do God's will, no matter where that will take us, or no matter how often it changes direction. I wonder how frequently, before the historical Jesus fell asleep at night, he reflected on how many parts of his ministry had changed that day. I simply presume God's will wouldn't have truly been fulfilled if by nightfall, it was still the same as it was in the morning. <p> We hear the readings of the Christmas Mass during the Night so often they have lost much of their original ""sting."" When Isaiah, for instance, first proclaimed the early eighth century B.C.E. birth (or coronation) of King Hezekiah, he was talking to a people who for a generation had been forced by his father Ahaz to practice a pagan-riddled faith, going so far as even sacrificing their sons to the local fertility gods. The prophet was confident this boy – consumed with the zeal of Yahweh – would bring a total turnabout. <p> In the same way, just as those who had experienced Hezekiah, so those who experienced Jesus would never be the same again. Everything has changed. Though we wax poetic over angelic interventions, remember how our sacred authors employ these otherworldly messengers: Scholars contend they are simply literary devices who interpret events for their readers. We are to take their message, not themselves, literally. In this situation, this humbly born child is gifted to us by God in order to bring peace into our lives. But as the author of the Letter to Titus reminds us, the peace for which we long isn't going to happen automatically. Before this golden age, we are obligated ""to live temperately, justly and devoutly."" Lawlessness does not disappear on its own. No wonder the responsorial psalm on this night talks about singing a ""new song."" If we insist on revolving our celebration around the usual schmaltzy, comforting feelings ""of the season,"" peace will never be ours. Only when we change will our world change. <p> Perhaps that is why it is good that the next feast is that of the Holy Family. Those, who like myself, have problems with Joseph and Mary actually being anxious about ""losing"" God, should read Raymond Brown's Birth of the Messiah. The late scholar presumes Luke, at this point in his Gospel, is employing a source that knows nothing about annunciations to Mary and Joseph. Their anxiety and questioning are for real. Jesus' parents are constantly learning who their son is. They have received no special, angelic information about his personality. Though I presume they had troubling questions about his conception, on many other levels they are just like us. They aren't ""faking it"" for the Bible's sake. <p> That is why our other two readings are important. They apply not only to us but also to them. The three certainly agreed with the author of Colossians, constantly developing concrete ways to show ""compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience."" These virtues didn't appear automatically. Some worked better than others. It certainly took hard work to produce the kind of family harmony the author of Psalm 128 envisions, as it also took a lot of sacrifice, as Sirach mentions, to relate gently to aged, forgetful parents. <p> Good families only ""happen"" when all family members are adaptable. Unless we are willing to constantly change direction in life, we will never be able to figure out the will of God for our families or for the world. <p> It reinforces my belief that Christianity should make the cockroach its ""totem insect."" No living critter has evolved more over the millions of years it has existed. Only its ability to change and adapt keeps it alive.",Opinion/Argumentation,Opinion/Argumentation,"The author argues that the biblical authors of this month's liturgies have experienced significant changes in direction and their lives, which have inspired the passages we have been given.

89,"28 August 2019 <p> A project by Orkney Islands Council which aims to support the sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry whilst protecting and maintaining the seas around Orkney has been shortlisted for a national planning award. <p> The 'Scapa Flow Aquaculture Water Quality Impact Modelling Assessment' has been designed to improve understanding of the water quality impacts arising from existing and proposed fish farms in Scapa Flow. <p> The project has now been shortlisted under the 'Plans' award at this year's Scottish Awards for Quality in Planning. <p> The 'Scapa Flow Aquaculture Water Quality Impact Modelling Assessment' was developed following feedback received through a public consultation on aquaculture in 2017, during which stakeholders raised concerns regarding the cumulative impact of existing and proposed fish farm developments in Scapa Flow. <p> Stakeholder concerns were mainly around nutrient enrichment, water quality impacts, sea bed impacts and impacts on wild sea trout populations. It was suggested during this process that an assessment of capacity for further fish farms should be undertaken. <p> Taking on board the feedback received, the Council commissioned Intertek Energy and Water Consultancy Services to develop an assessment, with their work guided by a steering group led by the Council. <p> Accurately predicting areas of potential higher and lower water quality impacts, the assessment now provides a tool for fish farm developers, the planning authority, SEPA and wider stakeholders to better understand the impacts of fish farm developments and where further specific site assessments might be required. <p> It also marks the first use of hydrodynamic modelling by a planning authority for aquaculture spatial strategy. <p> Councillor James Stockan is Leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: ""I congratulate the team on their shortlisting in this award, an awards scheme in which the Council has found success before. <p> ""The study presents an innovative approach to local planning policy that goes beyond current best practice for aquaculture spatial planning in Scotland. This work came about following feedback from stakeholders and was very much a team effort in its development, highlighting the Council's commitment towards partnership working to achieve the best possible outcomes for Orkney."" <p> Orkney Islands Council's 'Team Stromness' scheme – a regeneration effort spanning ten years – took the Judges Award at the 2017 awards.

The sleek modern minimalist design ensures your choice of shower pod will blend seamlessly into your bathroom environment. The smooth high-gloss finish of the surface gel coat is easy to clean, only requiring a wipe over with soapy water or a non-abrasive proprietary cleaner. <p> Installation could not be simpler. The shower pod shell does away with the need for traditional tiling, and with that goes a time consuming job. No tiles means no grouting. No grouting means no maintenance and no possibility of leaks over time. No leaks means you won't suffer from the associated smell of mildew, so your bathroom will always smell clean and fresh. <p> The Envirotec pod is designed so it simply cannot leak. Conventional shower enclosures rely on the integrity of the joint between the shower tray and the tiled wall to prevent the escape of water. The Envirotec pod has a moulded upstand that reaches far up the wall where it joins to the upper panel hence nowhere for water to go except down the drain. <p> You can buy the shower pod shell without the doors <p> Unlike most shower pod manufacturers Envirotec offer their shower pods in component parts. If you simply want to do away with tiled walls and leaky shower trays then choose the shower pod shell only. To this you might wish to fit a curtain and rail, or a door configuration from your favoured manufacturer. We do of course offer several complete packages, but the choice remains yours. <p> To complete the picture, Envirotec shower pods are available in a choice of three colours - porcelain white, black granite and sandstone granite. Shower pods are available with or without legs facilitating low access with an under-floor waste or above floor waste with legs and plinth panel. <p> Please take a while to look through the comprehensive range of options offered within the Envirotec range. It's sure to wake up the creativity within! <p> Shower pods are leak free, maintenance free, strong and durable <p> The concept of the 'shower pod' is fast catching on in the UK albeit a product that is firmly established in other countries around the world - particularly the USA. <p> The simplicity with which installation takes place cuts fitting time considerably. Wall surfaces need not be great as the shower pod shell covers imperfections. There are no 'advanced or specialist' abilities needed to carry out the fitting task which puts installation within the capability of a competent DIYer or trades person with basic plumbing and building skills. <p> A shower pod with options of low entry or a leg riser kit <p> Envirotec shower pods can be installed so the waste trap and pipework goes beneath the floor or above the floor on which they sit. <p> With a below floor configuration a very low step in height of only 50mm can be achieved. <p> If for any reason you wish to run your waste pipework above floor level then a riser leg and plinth panel kit is available as an optional extra. <p> In either case, the feet are adjustable to enable easy levelling of the shower pod tray.",Promotion,Promotion,"The text is promoting Envirotec shower pods, which are one-piece self-contained shower pods that are designed to be leak-free.

96,"Valedictorian's speech <p> Many great events go down in history, the birth of Christ, the building of the pyramids, the Titanic and all that other stuff we learned about in Mr. Moffet's history class. And as much as we would like to compare our class and the commencement of high school to some memorable moment in time, we probably relate most to the Titanic as that, too, didn't go as planned. It seemed to be smooth sailing for most of this trip we call high school, but towards the end most of my classmates can agree we hit quite the iceberg of senioritis. Nonetheless, with a little help from our parents and all of our teachers, we made it here. <p> High school may have been a brief four years, but for some of us the history of our class goes back many more. And with each year spent growing up together came change. For example, in first grade I got my only red ticket because I snuck my flip phone into reading group. Well, that might be a bad example, because I've lost every behavior point in Mr. Wehr's class because of that same reason. Some things have actually changed though. Instead of fighting every day over who got to sit on the big swings at recess, we get into heated debates that usually last weeks, even though they were supposed to be a one-day deal. The intense middle-school PE dodgeball games where the boys would all gang up on us was pretty fair payback for when us girls used to make them pretend to be babies when we played house in kindergarten. The field trips to museums turned into skip days to ride roller coasters. Counting to ten and the ABCs turned into AR reading tests which then somehow turned into stoichiometry and quadratic equations, even though we probably won't be using much of those again. <p> Through all this change, we learned some things along the way. Of course there was the math assignments and essays, but some of the lessons that helped us get here today aren't your typical high school lessons. Like when you hear high heels click-clacking down the hallway, Mrs. Nelson is coming, so you probably should look like you're doing something, even though half the time those high heels turn out to be Mrs. King. When it comes to Mr. Schuh, Desmos* is your best friend. If you want some candy or a cup of coffee, Ms. Caler is your hookup, and recycling bins have more than one purpose. <p> Our class turned out to be quite the fun group. Within our 14 kids, you can find the Harry Potter enthusiasts, the athletes, the shopaholics, the artists, the hunters, the overachievers and just about everyone in between. With our unique mix of strong personalities, we proved to be quite the handful for our teachers, and I'm sure every one of them, from preschool all the way until now, would back me up on that. So, to all of the teachers that taught us everything from how to tie our shoes and zip up our coats to how to build resumes and prepare for the real world, thank you. To our parents who packed our lunches, stayed up late while we finished our homework, made sure to come to every game, and our friends' parents who were there to fill in anytime they were needed, gave us countless rides home and always cheered us on, we could never thank you enough. <p> The stories we have from our time here are some you would never hear anywhere else. I doubt any other kids we meet will have had a song written by their teachers for them at their graduation. They probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble for sneaking off during the walks to the golf course during PE. They probably couldn't tell you what it was like to have to stay the night in the Chicago airport. I doubt they know what it's like to have to drive 45 minutes just for some McDonald's. And I can almost guarantee they didn't grow up within walking distance of almost all of their friends' front porches. <p> I'm sure every one of us complained at some point about growing up in a small town or having to move to one, but looking back it has given us some pretty special experiences. Usually, your high school sports teams don't have the same starting lineups as your peewee teams did. Most of the time, the girls who used to play dress up at sleepovers don't get to spend hours getting ready for the prom together. And the kids who used to ride their bikes to the pool don't get to spend summers at the lake together. Odessa is a little different though. Many of us got to grow up together and we were lucky enough to add a couple of new kids along the way. <p> Sure, things have changed growing up, but I think we all turned out pretty good. Over the next few months, we'll all be going our separate ways. We'll be seeing new things, meeting new people, and just trying to figure out how to navigate being an adult. The next time we walk into a classroom, it won't be filled with the same familiar faces. The next path we take in life won't be alongside our childhood friends. But no matter where we end up going, our roots are all the same. There's no telling where we are headed, but Odessa has left us all with some pretty cool stories to tell, and I wouldn't have wanted to make those memories with any other group of kids.",Opinion/Argumentation,Prose/Lyrical,"The text is a speech by a valedictorian delivered at a high school graduation ceremony.

97,"PC Disposal <p> PC Disposal Guidelines <p> When you wish to dispose of a computer (desktop, laptop, or server), you must first remove all the data (sensitive or otherwise) that is on it. Southern University Property Management will not accept a machine for disposal unless you confirm that this process has taken place. <p> Hard drive ""sanitization"" is important for two reasons. First, you do not want the next user of the system to have access to sensitive information (like research data, student info, financial data or patient information); and second, you do not want people to have unauthorized access to licensed software, such as Microsoft Word. Even Personal Digital Assistants, like Palm devices, should be reset, so that all data and programs are wiped from them. <p> However, merely using the ""delete"" command or dragging items to the trash does not remove the data from the disk. There are many, widely available programs that can restore data deleted in this manner. A plain ""format"" command is somewhat better, but a determined person could still access sensitive data. Some operating systems offer a ""format and zero out all data"" command, which is better, and is sufficient for machines which are just being moved around within the University. <p> The easiest and most secure way to remove the data is to use a ""wiping"" program that not only deletes the data, but also overwrites each sector with garbage data multiple times. Be aware that the process will take some time (potentially hours if the drive is very large, or if the processor is slow). If you do choose to do the cleanup yourself, you will need the following: <p> 1. A software program to wipe the disk and overwrite it with data.

This restriction has now been removed from version 4.02 onwards. The storage medium used must, however, support long filenames for this to work. <p> Certain characters have special meanings and cannot be used within a filename. A general rule of thumb is not to use top-bit-set characters, even though FileCore can support them. <p> Meaning <p> 1 Available on FileCore-based filing systems, and any other that choose to do so. <p> Note: In RISC OS 2, wildcard matching would be specific to either file or folders, but not both. Later versions of RISC OS changed this, so that a wildcard match would act on all file objects. i.e it will try and find a match on both files and directories. <p> Directories, also known as folders on other Operating Systems, are used to group lots of files, and possible other directories together. Objects within the currently selected directory may be accessed without reference to the directory name. The names of objects must be unique within a directory. <p> The root directory of a storage medium is accessed via $ character. As $ is the root directory, there is no parent, and trying to access its parent will simply result in access to the root directory. <p> File in directories other than the root directory can be accessed by either prefixing the desired object with a directory path, or by setting the currently selected directory (CSD) and then accessing the object. <p> The use of the '.' (period) character is used to separate directories in a hierarchal structure. <p> Path <p> Meaning <p> File 'Miami' in directory Holidays within currently selected directory <p> File Attributes <p> File attributes are used to store information relating to the read/write access available. They are stored using 4 bytes (32 bits). The top 24 bits are filing system dependent, where as the lower byte has the following standardised interpretation: <p> If both bits 6 & 7 are set, then the file is super-hidden. The top 24-bits are filing system dependant. e.g. NetFS uses them to store the date. <p> Filing systems that have been created to use the features of FileCore, such as ADFS and RamFS, ignore the settings of bits 4 and 5. This is so that files can be moved freely between ADFS, RamFS and NetFS without losing information on their public read and write access. <p> Bits 2, 6 and 7 should be cleared when creating file attributes for a file, as they may be of use in future versions of RISC OS. <p> File Type <p> Unlike many other Operating Systems, RISC OS does not use file extensions as its native method of identifying the type of file. Instead, a three digit hexadecimal code, that is not part of the file name, is used instead. <p> Applications that can load and/or save a file of a specific type, usually inform the Operating System of this, and can assign a Sprite to the file type. Any files 'seen' by the Filer will then automatically display files of that type with the sprite, and if double-clicked upon, will use the application to load the file. <p> The file type information is stored as part of the Load and Execution Address fields. <p> It is possible to list the file types currently known by the computer at any given time, by using the following command. <p> For a list of commonly used file types by RISC OS, please see the File Types section. <p> Load and Execution Addresses <p> All files have in addition to their name, length, type and attributes, two 32-bit fields that are used to describe the file. These are set when the file is first created, and have two possible meanings. <p> File type and Date Stamps <p> In the case of a simple machine code program, two memory addresses are specified; the load address specifies the memory address where the file should be loaded, and the execution address specifies where the program should commence. The table below shows the format of the memory addresses: <p> Load address <p> Execution address <p> Note: The execution address must fall within the load address and load address + the length of file. <p> In addition, if the top twelve bits of the load address are all set (XXX = &FFF), then the file is assumed to be date-stamped. <p> Date Stamp <p> If the top 12 bits of the load address are all set (see Load and Execution Addresses), then the remaining bits are used to store the date/time stamp of when the file was created or last modified, and the file type. <p> The date/time stamp uses 5 bytes (unsigned) to store the value. The start value begins at 00:00:00 1st January 1900, and each successive value is in centi-seconds. The most significant byte of the date is actually stored in the least significant byte of the load address field. <p> The format of how the data is stored using each of the 32 bit fields are shown below:",Information/Explanation,Information/Explanation,"Explanation texts are intended to provide detailed information about a particular topic or subject to an audience.

113,"The relative abundance of seagrasses in coastal waters is a key indicator of coastal and estuarine ecosystem health. Like other plants, seagrasses produce food using photosynthesis, but they require significantly more sunlight than terrestrial vegetation. The amount of light that is available to them for photosynthesis is dependent on water clarity, as is their potential range; where there is good water clarity, they can grow in deeper water. The suspended sediments, organics, and microorganisms present in seawater affect its transparency, and therefore the amount of sunlight that can reach the leaves of seagrasses. As light passes through water, its intensity decreases, and this reduction over a given distance is known as light attenuation. The main contributors to light attenuation in the water column are turbidity, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter. Light attenuation can also occur at the surface of the leaf due to the growth of algae/epiphytes. <p> Light availability: Not all wavelengths of light are equally usable for photosynthesis by seagrasses and other submerged aquatic vegetation. Generally, wavelengths in the range of 400-700 nanometers (nm) can be used. Special optical sensors have been developed to measure this photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in surface water.

119,"In the past day or two an interesting piece of news has been making the rounds. Earlier this year the police department of the city of Seattle, Washington set up its own wireless mesh network for what many people are saying is for the purpose of keeping people under surveillance. The hardware was purchased from Aruba Networks; it is unknown whether or not the company set up the gear, or if another outfit was contracted for installation and maintenance. Each of the nodes is apparently broadcasting frames containing ESSIDs that reflect its location (such as 4th Avenue and Union Street), which is probably why some people noticed in the first place. The nodes are undoubtedly handling more traffic but without packet captures there's no way of knowing (hint hint, cough cough). The Seattle PD isn't saying much so all we have to go on is a handful of facts, knowledge of how wireless networks work, and I'm sorry to say a lot of ill-informed rumors. Let's try to sort things out as best we can. The first logical question to ask is, why use wi-fi? The best hypothesis I can come up with is that police may not be able to gain access to cellular records in what they consider a timely fashion. It is well known and understood that cellular providers track the IMEI of every cellphone that pings every tower on the cellular network at what time, and that information can be handed over to law enforcement (and other) agencies without warning. Cell companies maintain detailed inventories of their gear, maps of where every cellular tower is, and what cellular nodes are positioned where on them. Log a certain IMEI on a certain transceiver on a certain tower and you know roughly where that device is. Log the same IMEI on several transceivers on several towers and you can figure out where the device is in a lot more detail. Analyze the pattern that IMEI makes and you can plot the device's trajectory on a map. However, that often means hitting up several cellular providers at the same time and hoping that they all respond fast enough for police to find someone. That probably isn't the case. Wi-fi gear is much less expensive than cellular equipment (even if it was technically paid for by DHS and not the city of Seattle per se) and requires less bureaucratic overhead (such as FCC licensing) to deploy. In case you're curious, here are a few ways you can find out the IMEI on your mobile device. It seems plausible to state that this network could be used, in part at least to track people based upon the locations of their mobile devices. Smartphones, tablets, and MP3 players which are wireless enabled will, if they are not powered down or if wireless is not disabled, periodically probe for the presence of wireless networks they've been a part of in the past by sending association frames in the hope that the access point is still out there and will respond. Those association frames contain, among other things, the MAC address of the wireless chipset in the device, the ESSID of the access point, the supported data rates of the chipset, and any additional capabilities of the device (which may be sufficiently unique to help fingerprint a device, and later the device's owner). While this leaks some potentially identifiable data (like the name of your network at home), it could also just as easily broadcast the network name of any of the bazillion Starbucks franchises undoubtedly squatting on corners in Seattle like mushrooms after a summer rain ('attwifi', if you care). It is possible that apps installed on or semipermanently baked into the firmware of your device may broadcast additional identifying data, but without a packet capture there really isn't any way of knowing. As an aside, MAC addresses are not globally unique. You can bet your goldfish that at least ten other people on the planet have wireless devices that have the same MAC address. However, there are 2^48 possible MAC addresses, which is a big but finite number, and it is statistically unlikely that two mobile users will have the same MAC in Seattle. That seems sufficient to follow the movements of a single mobile device. Taking into account the set of ESSIDs the mobile device may try to associate with provides additional information with which to uniquely identify the owner of a device. Additionally, the wireless MACs of mobile devices are notoriously difficult to change, even if the device has been rooted. The wireless chips may not support soft MAC changes (but pretend that they do). The chips may power cycle themselves to get back to a known-good state and ask to be reconfigured without the user knowing after they've been frobbed, too. If the sensors also sniff other forms of traffic emitted by mobile devices that traffic can be characterized and used to identify the device (and then its owner) more precisely. The countermeasures for this are remarkably simple: Turn wi-fi off on your mobile device before you leave. Not only will you save the battery, but you won't be trackable via wi-fi emissions. The more paranoid are advised to pull the batteries on their mobiles entirely, if feasible. It would not surprise me one bit to discover that this network had several other uses. Radio communications in cities, especially densely packed ones are unreliable. Line of sight is key for radio, and if you don't have it (and you usually don't in big cities) there's a good chance that your signal might not get through at all. Sometimes buildings are so large that they prevent any signal at all from propagating very far. Sometimes buildings refract RF in such a way that the signal goes in the wrong direction or scatters so much that you can't make anything out. Repeaters aren't found everywhere, just in a few strategic locations, and being able to hit one with a radio isn't a sure bet. Mesh networks are, in fact, a good way of setting up reliable comms in such areas because they can work around many of those environmental obstacles. Additionally digital radios are becoming more and more popular with law enforcement agencies, and digital modes readily lend themselves to working in mesh topologies. So, I would be unsurprised to find that these units in Seattle were set up with mesh repeaters to make police radio communications more reliable. Were I solving such a problem, that's what I would do. I will concede the possibility that the wi-fi ESSIDs broadcast from the nodes could be for the purpose of remote maintenance. So much kit these days plugs into the Net so it can be managed remotely, and industrial grade wireless access devices are no exception (I've worked with too many of them over the years). Naming the device after its location is good practice in that it's self documenting; to put it another way, you don't need a Captain Midnight Secret Decoder Ring to figure out that the AP air5Pohk is at Sixth Avenue and Union, it would logically call itself 6th&Union. On the other hand, for a municipal project this is really, really bad practice. If you announce what something is and where it is, chances are somebody's going to get curious and go poking around. Like the people who wrote these news articles and then you have to contend not only with the press but with people who take it upon themselves to cause trouble for you. This possibility doesn't seem to jive with official statements to the effect of, ""Yes, this is a mesh network,"" not without more data from the field. The mailing lists of a couple of projects that I monitor (as well the ones I'm part of) have also had some discussions about these news articles. Mainly, they're concerned that the reputation of community wireless networks will be adversely impacted. The big concern is that, due to the fact that a municipal mesh project in Seattle is in a position to put an entire city under surveillance, our own projects might be thought of in the same way. Some might think that we're setting up our own surveillance network, when in fact we're not. This could hurt the adoption of community wireless networks across the country (moreso than state and local laws already have). It's also too much to tell people to look at our code and see for themselves. Let's face it, there are a lot more non-coders than there are coders, and that's just going to make people more mistrustful. The best, and really the only thing we can do is be personally active in our communities. We can't just set up a bunch of equipment and hope people are going to use it, we have to tell people about it. We have to tell people what it is, what it's for, and more importantly who it's for. They're going to come to us with their fears, especially due to news articles like that. And we're going to have to lay those fears to rest however we can.
