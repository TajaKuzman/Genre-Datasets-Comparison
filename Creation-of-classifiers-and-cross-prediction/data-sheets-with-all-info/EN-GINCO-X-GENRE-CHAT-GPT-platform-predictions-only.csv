1,"Why graft thrives in postconflict zones <p> A report issued Wednesday said Iraq could become 'the biggest corruption scandal in history.' <p> March 17, 2005 <p> By Mark Rice-Oxley Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor <p> Five Polish peacekeepers are arrested for allegedly taking $90,000 worth of bribes in Iraq. Several Sri Lankan officials are suspended for mishandling tsunami aid. US audits show large financial discrepancies in Iraq. Reports of aid abuse taunt Indonesia. <p> Two of the world's biggest-ever reconstruction projects - Iraq and post-tsunami Asia - are facing major tests of credibility, as billions of dollars of aid and reconstruction money pour in. <p> And according to a major report released Wednesday by Transparency International (TI), an international organization that focuses on issues of corruption, the omens are not good. <p> From Iraq and Afghanistan to Cambodia and Bosnia, from the wrecked coasts of Asia to the kleptocratic carve-up in some African countries, crisis zones are proving to be fertile soil for corruption, the report argues. <p> ""Many postconflict countries figure among the most corrupt in the world,"" says Philippe le Billon of the University of British Columbia, Canada, in the TI report. ""Corruption often predates hostilities and in many cases it features among the factors that triggered political unrest or facilitated conflict escalation."" <p> The report cites weak government, haphazard law and order, armed factions that need appeasing, and a scramble for rich resources as factors that render a country prone to corruption. <p> Nations that face security threats are even more vulnerable, since they require protection money and may not be able to keep monitors safe. <p> Bosnia is a good example. During the breakdown of communism in the late 1980s, factions scrambled for assets by plundering state companies, a situation exacerbated by the 1992-1995 war. <p> Wartime sanctioned nefarious activity. Criminal gangs became cherished paramilitary groups; black markets flourished; underworld players became rich and powerful. After peace was declared in 1995, the world community was wary of upsetting the status quo. It's still unclear how much of the $5 billion spent on aid after the war ended up in the pockets of shady characters. <p> ""These elements were either part of the ruling political parties, or criminal elements that were financing the ruling political parties,"" says James Lyon, an analyst in Belgrade with the International Crisis Group. <p> In Iraq, allegations range from petty bribery to large-scale embezzlement, expropriation, profiteering and nepotism. The TI report says it could become ""the biggest corruption scandal in history."" <p> ""I can see all sorts of levels of corruption in Iraq,"" says report contributor Reinoud Leenders, ""starting from petty officials asking for bribes to process a passport, way up to contractors delivering shoddy work and the kind of high-level corruption involving ministers and high officials handing out contracts to their friends and clients."" <p> The recent elections may help, he adds, but already he notes a tendency for political bargaining indicative of ""dividing up the cake of state resources."" <p> But it is not just about Iraqis dividing up the cake. US audits of its own spending have found repeated shortcomings, including a lack of competitive bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars, payment of contracts without adequate certification that work had been done, and in some cases, outright theft. <p> A report on the disbursement of Iraqi oil revenues to ministries by the Coalition Provisional Authority, which governed Iraq until last July found a $340 million contract awarded by the electricity ministry without a public tender. <p> A January report by special inspector Stuart Bowen found that $8.8 billion dollars had been disbursed from Iraqi oil revenue by US administrators to Iraqi ministries without proper accounting. <p> And earlier this week, it emerged that the Pentagon's auditing agency found that Halliburton, the Houston oil services giant formerly run by Vice President Dick Cheney, overcharged by more than $108 million on a contract. <p> A Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown and Root, faces a number of investigations for overcharging, including one case where it charged the Army more than $27 million dollars to transport $82,000 worth of fuel from Kuwait to Iraq, according to excerpts of the report released this week by Rep. Henry Waxman (D) of California. <p> In a written statement. Halliburton defended the cost, explaining that delivering the fuel was ""fraught with danger."" <p> Analysts also point to an entrenched culture of graft in the Iraqi government. <p> It doesn't help that much of Iraq needs physical rebuilding, which involves the sector more vulnerable to corruption than any other: construction. <p> ""Public works and construction are singled out by one survey after another as the sector most prone to corruption - in both the developing and the developed world,"" says TI chairman Peter Eigen. <p> Construction is considered prone to sleaze for several reasons: the fierce competition for ""make or break"" contracts; permits and approvals that are open to requests for backhanders; opportunities for delays and overruns; and the physical cover-up opportunity presented by plaster and concrete. <p> With whole swaths of Southeast Asia requiring rebuilding after the tsunami, experts worry that construction corruption could take a deadly toll. <p> ""The cost will be lives lost,"" said Eigen, noting that cheap materials and corner-cutting can prove lethal in earthquake-prone parts of the world. <p> So how to battle corruption? Good governance is clearly the No. 1 priority, but TI identifies several other initiatives that can help improve probity. <p> These include vetting contractors and blacklisting those with shady records, ensuring competitive bidding for deals and assuring independent auditing and multilayered monitoring involving local communities, rotating staff in sensitive positions, and encouraging donors to disburse funds in a timely fashion to reduce pressure on local officials and prevent accounting trickery. <p> ""We are simply making the case that a series of norms should be applied which make it much more feasible to avoid the kind factors driving corruption,"" says Lawrence Cockcroft, chairman of TI UK. <p> • Dan Murphy in Baghdad, Beth Kampschror in Sarajevo, and Peter Ford in Paris contributed to this report.",News, News,

5,"The following table summarises the relevance of Objective 3.1 in achieving the purpose of the Resource Management Act: <p> Purpose of RMA <p> Achievement <p> Sustain the potential of natural and physical resources to meet needs of future generations <p> Objective 3.1 provides for the sustainable management of natural and physical resources by recognising the importance of the inter-relationships and shared values between resources. This objective aims to ensure that the effects of land activities do not adversely impact on water bodies and the marine area and vice versa. To achieve this will also require a co-ordinated approach across local authority jurisdictional boundaries. Decision making for management of resources must take an integrated approach that will protect the potential of the region's resources for future generations. <p> Safeguard the life-supporting capacity of air, water, soil and ecosystems <p> Objective 3.1 recognises that co-ordinated management of resources must take place to ensure that the life-supporting capacity of water bodies, the marine area and the surrounding land is safeguarded. In particular, the objective seeks to ensure that water bodies and the marine environment are not just seen to be a 'receiving environment' for discharged pollutants from land-based activities. The objective has the potential to contribute to safeguarding the life-supporting capacity of air, water, soil and ecosystems. <p> Avoid, remedy or mitigate adverse effects of activities on the environment <p> Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that activities that are likely to have adverse effects on natural resources are managed in an integrated way, rather than looking at resources in isolation. An integrated and strategic approach to decisions relating to activities provides an understanding of the wider effects of an activity, including cumulative adverse effects, and enables strategies to avoid, remedy or mitigate adverse effects. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their social wellbeing <p> Natural resources such as water bodies, riparian areas and the coast are a significant part of most New Zealanders' social and recreational experiences. Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that people can continue (into future generations) to enjoy a range of experiences involving natural and physical resources. In this respect it is critical that an integrated approach is taken to managing the use of these resources. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their economic wellbeing <p> Water bodies and the marine area are a significant economic resource for industries (such as agriculture, fishing, marine farming) as well as for communities (such as tourism support services). Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that people can continue (into future generations) to gain economic advantages from water bodies and coastal resources. In this respect it is critical that an integrated and strategic approach is taken to managing the use of these resources. <p> Enable people and communities to provide for their cultural wellbeing <p> Water bodies and the marine area make a significant contribution to people's and communities' cultural wellbeing. In particular, for tangata whenua, the protection of coastal environment, rivers and water bodies is part of their role as kaitiaki which is an integral part of Maori culture. Water resources are viewed as a holistic unit and this objective seeks to reinforce this approach by recognising that these resources need to be managed in an integrated manner. Objective 3.1 also recognises the historical links many people have with these environments by ensuring that decisions regarding activities in these areas are based on a balanced approach that recognises the inter-related nature of resources. <p> By recognising the integrated nature of these environments, Objective 3.1 seeks to ensure that natural resources such as rivers and the marine area are not degraded by land-based activities. In this respect managing the quality of water and of kaimoana through integrated management decisions contributes to the health and safety of people using water bodies and marine resources.",Opinion/Argumentation, Information/Explanation, well-explained

7,"Contents <p> Introduction <p> Doxygen allows users to quickly create documentation for our code by extracting the relavent information from the code and comments. It is able to document all the code structures including classes, namespaces, files, members, defines, etc. Most of these are quite simple to document, you only need to place a special documentation block before the declaration. The special documentation blocks take the form of a javadoc style comment. A javadoc comment is a C style comment with 2 *'s at the start, like this: <p> The intermediate asterisks are optional, but please use them to clearly delineate the documentation comments. <p> The documentation within these blocks is made up of at least a brief description of the documented structure, that can be followed by a more detailed description and other documentation. The brief description is the first sentence of the comment. It ends with a period followed by white space or a new line. For example: <p> If you need to have a period in the brief description, follow it with a backslash followed by a space. <p> Blank lines within these comments are interpreted as paragraph breaks to help you make the documentation more readble. <p> Special commands <p> Placing these comments before the declaration works in most cases. For files however, you need to specify that you are documenting the file. To do this you use the @file special command. To document the file that you are currently in you just need to use the command followed by your comments. To comment a separate file (we shouldn't have to do this) you can supply the name directly after the file command. There are some other special commands we will be using quite often. To document functions we will use @param and @return or @retval to document the parameters and the return value. @param takes the name of the paramter and its description. @return just describes the return value, while @retval adds a name to it. To specify pre and post conditions you can use @pre and @post. <p> Some other useful commands are @todo and @sa. @todo allows you to place reminders of things to fix/implement and associate them with a specific class or member/function. @sa lets you place references to another piece of documentation (class, member, etc.). This can be useful to provide links to code that would be helpful in understanding the code being documented. <p> Example of Simple Documentation <p> Here is a simple header file with doxygen comments added. <p> Grouping <p> Doxygen also allows for groups of classes and member (or other groups) to be declared. We can use these to create a listing of all statistics/global variables. Or just to comment about the memory hierarchy as a whole. You define a group using @defgroup and then add to it using @ingroup or @addgroup. For example: <p> This places stat1-3 in the statistics group and stat4 in the subgroup. There is a shorthand method to place objects in groups. You can use @{ and @} to mark the start and end of group inclusion. The example above can be rewritten as:",Instruction, Instruction,

10,"Detailed Description <p> The QScriptEngineDebugger class provides a debugger that can be embedded into Qt applications that use Qt Script. The debugger enables the application user to inspect the state of the script environment and control script execution. <p> To attach the debugger to a script engine, call the attachTo() function. <p> Once the debugger has been attached to a script engine, you can proceed to evaluate scripts as usual, e.g. by calling QScriptEngine::evaluate(). The debugger will be triggered when an uncaught exception occurs, or when a debugger statement is encountered in a script. It is also possible to interrupt script evaluation at an arbitrary time by triggering the InterruptAction. For instance, to start the debugger when script evaluation starts, you trigger the action before you begin to evaluate() the script. <p> By default, the standard debugger window is shown when evaluation is suspended. This can be changed by calling the setAutoShowStandardWindow() function. <p> The debugger defines a set of actions that are available, such as stopping execution or printing the contents of a variable. It also provides a set of widgets (components) that display the information available from the debugger and that trigger the actions on request. The actions available are identified by the DebuggerAction enum, and the widgets are identified by the DebuggerWidget enum. <p> Access to the individual debugger widgets is provided by the widget() function. This makes it possible to arrange the widgets in a custom manner. Similarly, the action() function provides access to the various debugger actions. <p> The createStandardToolBar() function creates a standard toolbar, and the createStandardMenu() function creates a standard menu; these functions can be useful if you are creating a custom debugger configuration. <p> The evaluationSuspended() signal is emitted when the debugger has suspended script evaluation and entered interactive mode, i.e., the mode in which it accepts input from the user. The evaluationResumed() signal is emitted when script evaluation is resumed, i.e, when execution control is given back to the script engine. The state() function returns the debugger's current state. <p> When calling QScriptEngine::evaluate() it is useful to pass a descriptive script name (file name) as second argument, as this is the name that will be displayed by the debugger in the ScriptsWidget; if a name is not passed, the script will be labelled ""anonymous"". <p> When evaluation is suspended, the debugger will also suspend the event loop of the script. In the following snippet, the call to QScriptEngine::evaluate() causes the debugger to be triggered, and the function call does not return until the user has finished interacting with the debugger. <p> When the Qt Script debugger is running, the C++ application itself is not ""frozen"". This means that it is possible that more scripts are evaluated, even though the debugger has suspended evaluation of the current script evaluation. For example, a C++ timer might trigger that causes a script function to be called, or the user might click on a button in the main application user interface whose clicked() signal is connected to a script function. This kind of nested evaluation is permitted. The debugger will enter interactive mode for the new script if an exception is thrown or a breakpoint is reached. Note that it will not stop when encountering debugger statements. <p> Nested evaluation requires some thought when deciding how the debugger is presented to the user; for example, whether a modal dialog is suitable, or whether some parts of the main application user interface should be disabled while the debugger is running. <p> Debugging inside of a paintEvent() is currently not supported. If you need to debug painting-related script code, that code should be evaluated outside of the C++ paintEvent(), e.g. by rendering to an image, like the Context2D and Tetrix QtScript examples do. This will make the code safe for debugging. <p> The debugger adds some special properties to the script engine: __FILE__ holds the name of the script in which the current evaluation occurs, and __LINE__ holds the current line number. These are useful when doing print()-style debugging (the messages appear in the debugger's debug output widget). <p> The Qt Script Debugger Manual describes how to use the debugger. The Context2D example shows how to integrate the debugger in applications. <p> Member Type Documentation <p> enum QScriptEngineDebugger::DebuggerAction <p> This enum specifies the action that the action() function should retrieve. The actions retrieved can be connected to any slot and connected to any widget. Please see the Qt Script Debugger Manual's Console Command Reference for a detailed description of these actions. <p> Description <p> enum QScriptEngineDebugger::DebuggerWidget <p> This enum decides the widget that the widget() function should retrieve. We treat these widgets in more detail in the Qt Script Debugger Manual. <p> Returns a pointer to the specified action. The actions available are given by the DebuggerAction enum. <p> With this function, you can add the actions to your own widgets, toolbars, and menus. It is also convenient if you, for example, wish to spice things up with your own groovy icons. The code example below shows how to add actions to a QToolBar. <p> The debugger will install a custom agent (using QScriptEngine::setAgent()) to monitor the engine. While the debugger is attached, you should not change the agent; however, if you do have to perform additional monitoring, you must set a proxy agent that forwards all events to the debugger's agent. <p> void QScriptEngineDebugger::evaluationResumed () [signal] <p> void QScriptEngineDebugger::evaluationSuspended () [signal] <p> This signal is emitted when the debugger has suspended script evaluation for whatever reason (e.g. due to an uncaught script exception, or due to a breakpoint being triggered). <p> Sets whether the standard debugger window is automatically shown when evaluation is suspended. If autoShow is true, the window will be automatically shown, otherwise it will not. <p> Returns a pointer to the instance of the specified standard widget. The widgets available are defined by the DebuggerWidget enum. <p> A main window containing all widgets is returned by standardWindow(). If you do not want to use this window, you can fetch the individual widgets with this function. For instance, the code example below shows how to set up a layout containing a code window and a stack widget. <p> Note that you need to set setAutoShowStandardWindow() to false; if not, the standard window will be shown regardless.",Instruction, Instruction,

12,"Where we can talk about some of our reactions. My friend and I did a test game. He ran Dark Elves, I ran Empire. Granted, we don't have the FAQs, so maybe we did some things wrong. My dice turned treacherous, I think the Hobgoblin drink was sneaky and manipulated my dice... as my handgunners were forced to deploy on their own on the far right flank where nothing of my opponents deployed. Beginning and end of game, my dice were horrid. In the middle, they were good. Two magic phases I had 12 power dice, albeit with no ""Wizards Proper"". I had a couple priests, popemobile, and the Ring of Volans. Getting WS10 I10 spears via the Golden Griffon on the Pope Mobile on a 5+ was nice. I got that off twice! For those who doubted the power of horde spears, I can assure you... they are brutal. My spears were not horde, to gain some extra ranks. My opponents were. We both had hatred (he being DE, and my having a priest). He stilled out killed my spears by quite a bit. Meanwhile my spears, when charged by frenzies corsairs, outkilled them significantly. The random charges really changed things. Still not totally sure how to feel about that. It really does get rid of that 'game' of trying to deny the charge and all. Though I just wish the ranges were less extreme. The changes in ranks negating really sold me on detachments. I almost never took them in all of 7th edition. Less than 5% of the time I played Empire, as I felt they really didn't do a whole lot... or earn their points. Now with firing in two ranks, small handgunner detachments are worth their points. Also 15 strong Sword detachments work very well, as they can negate the ranks and might have the distance to do it without being to far forward. Dark Riders just got a lot nastier, they really did. As did Shades. Comments from opponent: <p> So I played my first game of 8th last night and liked how the changes went. I played a 2250 game against Robert Elmer's Empire. My rough List: Dreadlord General BSB Lvl 2 Sorc Fighty Lvl 2 Sorc 39 Spears, FC, Armor piercing Banner (10 wide) 19 Corsairs, FC, Frenzy Banner 10 Crossbows, Musician, Shields 2 units of 5 Dark Riders w/ Musician 17 Black Guard, FC, +1 LD Banner 6 Shades w xhw Hydra Rob's List: Captain General Arch-lector on Pope-mobile 2 Priests BSB 38 Spears, FC,Armor piercing banner, Detachment of 6 Hand-gunners, Detachment of 15 swordsmen 38 Spears, FC, Detachment of 6 Hand-gunners, Detachment of 15 swordsmen 2 units of 10 Hand-gunners Cannon Mortar 18 Flagellants Tactically, the only mistake made by rob was not running his spears 10 wide as he tried to go for the extra ranks to gain stubborn. Some of the things I saw that were cool were: On my third turn I charged his pope-mobile with my crossbows and sorceress. After casting a spell from the lore of shadow, I was able to switch her with my general, which locked them into a challenge and ended up killing his Arch-lector. My frenzied corsairs with my combat mage charged his unit of spears and got whiped and chased away. not taking the wounds from the front really makes a difference. Later on Robs spears charged my Spears. Rob then made his spears WS and In 10. he killed 6 of the 38 models I had, and I returned the strikes. Even with needing 5's to hit, I still did enough damage that he needed snakes to hold. I broke him and gave chase. I then charged into his other unit of spears while running down his first unit. because of the hoard rule, I still had 28 models attacking, and again breaking his unit by a lot. So, in all, loving the new rules with hoards and spears, and Dark Elf Spearmen Rock. Also, I really like the lore of shadows. <p> FORGET AoS.

21,"SAP NetWeaver on VMware Cloud on AWS Overcommit Sizing Example <p> Note: SAP certification for VMware Cloud on AWS is currently in-progress. Follow us on twitter to know when the certification is complete: https://twitter.com/vmwarecloudaws <p> In this article we show an example sizing of an SAP landscape on VMware Cloud on AWS. The SAP landscape refers to the multiple SAP systems from production to non-production required in the implementation of SAP business functionality. A VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool is available online that allows us to estimate the compute and storage resources required for a SDDC deployment on VMware Cloud on AWS. Before we can use this online tool, we need to establish the SAP sizing requirements. Here are two SAP scenarios: <p> Greenfield installation – treat the cloud SDDC as an on-premise vSphere implementation. We can following standard SAP sizing methodology e.g. SAP Quick Sizer. <p> SAP installations already running on vSphere on-premise – VMware tools are available for measuring existing resource usage. This is part of a migration assessment and is covered in the PREPARING FOR VMWARE CLOUD ON AWS Planning Guide . <p> The example here is based on a sizing of an existing on-premise installation. The scope is for a non-production SAP NetWeaver landscape where we are sizing for SAP systems deployed on non-HANA databases (e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, SAP Sybase, IBM DB2, etc.) and we are considering CPU and memory overcommitment. <p> Overcommit is defined as: <p> The number of vCPUs scheduled on an ESXi host is greater than the number of physical cores. <p> The sum of configured memory of all virtual machines on an ESXi host is greater than the physical memory of the host. <p> We have chosen non-production as resource overcommit is more viable in this environment. The workloads across the different non-production systems are expected to peak at different times. Also, non-production environments are likely to have systems running idle for some periods of time. <p> We will first describe the sizing of the SAP landscape and the resource requirements for different virtual machines (VMs). We then use this data as input to the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool to determine the SDDC resources required for VMware Cloud on AWS. <p> Because this is a sample scenario, variations and alternatives with higher or lower degrees of overcommit are possible. <p> SAP Sizing Results / Output <p> The example here is based on a non-production SAP NetWeaver landscape and is derived from an actual sizing with some changes (e.g. not all SAP systems are shown). The methodology of a virtual SAP sizing to determine the VM vCPUs and vRAM is not covered here – for an example see this whitepaper. <p> The non-production environment can include many different systems with various functions such as: development of new SAP functionality; support for production code fixes; future upgrade testing; training. The following table describes the different systems in this example. <p> To quantitatively size for overcommit, an initial priority (high, medium, or low) is assigned to each non-production system. The priority determines the probability/prediction of how much of the configured vCPU and vRAM the VM is likely to use. The priority and sizing impact are defined in the Appendix below. <p> Final SAP Landscape Sizing <p> The spreadsheet below shows the final sizing with adjustments made for overcommit based on the priorities of the different SAP systems. This spreadsheet is an example of a working sheet used in a pre-sales sizing engagement and variations are expected. <p> SAP Sizing Spreadsheet – Example <p> The columns in the spreadsheet above are described as follows: <p> ""SAP Product / Module"" – in this example we are sizing for three SAP products each of which has its own database, application servers and Central Services (handles special SAP services) : ERP = SAP Enterprise Resource Planning software; BW = Business Warehouse; Portal = SAP's Portal solution. There are multiple installations of each SAP product across the different non-production environments. <p> ""DB vCPU"","" App vCPU"", ""CS vCPU"" – these are the estimated vCPU requirements for each architectural component. This value is an output of the SAP sizing project (the method by which this was derived is not part of scope for this article). These components can be: all installed in the same VM ; or distributed across separate VMs. <p> ""VM Memory"" – this is the estimated memory requirement for all the architecture components of each SAP product. This value is an output of the SAP sizing exercise. <p> ""Example Priority"" – priority assigned to the SAP system based on its business impact. <p> ""Resource Adjust Factor"" – probability of resources being used. This is based on the priority setting (see Appendix) <p> ""ESXi Host cores"" = ESXi host cores required to support the vCPU sizing = ""Total vCPU"" x ""Resource Adjustment Factor"". <p> ""ESXi Host Memory"" = ESXi host memory required to support the memory sizing = ""VM Memory"" x ""Resource Adjustment Factor"". <p> The totals at the bottom of the spreadsheet above allows us to estimate that we can support 122 vCPUs of VMs and 1220GB of total configured memory on a set of ESXi hosts that total 100 cores and 1000GB of physical memory. The total number of VMs = 24. <p> In this overcommit scenario, if all virtual machines try to consume 100% of their configured CPU and memory simultaneously, a performance issue may occur. VMware Cloud on AWS can address this with Elastic DRS (eDRS) – this is a feature that uses the resource management features of vSphere to analyze the load running in your SDDC to scale your clusters up or down. Using this feature, you can enable VMware Cloud on AWS to manage your cluster sizes without manual intervention. <p> The priority settings and adjustment factors shown here are examples only. They must be re-evaluated for specific implementations. For example, if you expect high levels of simultaneous Development, Testing, and Training activity by a large team of external consultants and/or system integrators, who cannot afford idle time due to performance bottlenecks, you can justify assigning a high priority to several non-production systems thus reducing the degree of overcommit. <p> We will now use the output of the above sizing spreadsheet to input data into the online VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool. <p> The online tool is available here – click on ""Start as a Guest"" to start the sizing. We will input the data from the above SAP sizing spreadsheet. For SAP we will use the i3 instance type which is based on ESXi hosts with 36 cores and 512 GB RAM. The input data values are shown in screenshots below. <p> The tool provides the following output/ recommendation. <p> The sizing results show that with HA requirements factored into the final solution the total number of required ESXi hosts is 4. This results in a cluster with total 4 x 36 = 144 cores and 4 x 512 = 2048 GB of RAM i.e. the number of cores and memory in the SDDC cluster is more than the SAP sizing requirements. This is expected and is the same case when sizing and designing high availability SAP cluster environments on-premise. Acceptable overcommit in this example will occur in the case of a host failure which is only temporary until a new host is provisioned. The time to provision a new host after a failure is quick in VMware Cloud on AWS due to the auto remediation feature. To increase overcommit more VMs can be added to the 4-host cluster but this could lead to unacceptable resource constraints (albeit only temporarily) in the case of a host failure. Adding more sandbox VMs that have a low SLA and do not need to be immediately recovered after a host failure will help to increase overcommit ratios without impacting SLAs during a host failure. Generally mixing high priority SAP VMs with low priority VMs in the same cluster enables overcommit. Applying the same overcommit method to production landscapes can be challenging as typically all production VMs are considered high priority. Mixing production with low priority non-production systems can yield overcommit scenarios without impacting SLAs. Production / high priority VMs are protected with memory reservation settings. <p> Key Points <p> We showed an example greenfield sizing for an SAP landscape based on overcommit of CPU and memory. The SAP sizing model included a method to quantitatively size for CPU and memory overcommit for non-production. We chose non-production as this is where we typically see overcommit for SAP environments. <p> Mixing high priority SAP VMs with low priority VMs in the same ESXi cluster facilitates overcommit. <p> We used the output of the SAP sizing as input to the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool which generated a recommendation for deployment on VMware Cloud on AWS. <p> Generally sizing of SAP environments is conservative with minimal to no overcommit. As workloads of different SAP VMs peak at different times the resulting utilization of ESXi clusters can be low. Elastic DRS (eDRS) available in VMware Cloud on AWS can scale clusters up or down to meet the resource needs. <p> Auto-remediation in VMware Cloud on AWS enables faster recovery of a SDDC cluster after a host failure. <p> In conclusion the VMware Cloud on AWS Sizer Tool can help you quickly determine the host and storage requirements for a SDDC deployment and facilitate the transition to cloud for your SAP environments. <p> Thanks to my colleagues for their inputs and feedback: Dan Florea; Bill Roth; Gary Hamilton. <p> Appendix <p> The following table shows the priorities assigned to the different non-production systems and the sizing impact. <p> The Priority in the second column corresponds to an assessment of 1) the importance of each environment from a business standpoint and 2) the likelihood of resources being used by users. <p> The ESXi host Resource Adjustment Factor in the fourth column is linked to the priority and corresponds to an estimate of the fraction of resources that will be consumed. For example, a value of 0.75 corresponds to a prediction or probability that 75% of configured CPU and memory resources will be used. <p> The ESXi Host Sizing numbers in the last column are the number of physical ESXi host cores and memory required to support the environment. These resources equal the total virtual resources of vCPU and memory adjusted by the Resource Adjustment Factor (defined by the priority setting). <p> Note: The resource adjustment factor values in the table are suggestions.",Information/Explanation, Instruction,

27,"""The Roots of Racism"" <p> by Sargent Shriver Peace Institute | Mon Apr 29 06:00:00 EDT 2019 | Quote of the Week | Justice | Human Rights | Civil Rights <p> Our Quote of the Week tackles an important topic that continues to influence the systems in which we operate and to adversely affect the lives of people of color: racism. The quote is from Sargent Shriver's keynote address at the first gathering of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice; Sargent Shriver was serving as the Conference's chair at the time. In his capacity as President of both the Chicago Public School Board and the board of the Catholic Interracial Council, Sargent Shriver fought alongside African American community leaders throughout the 1950s to successfully desegregate schools, housing developments, hospitals, and other institutions in Chicago. <p> It's important to note that Sargent Shriver's Catholic faith informed his views on racism in particular and on inequality in general. Quoting St. Paul in his speech, he reminds the audience that human beings are ""are spiritual beings united in a real and effective way into one body – a living, acting body, busy in the work of saving the world from the effects of sin, death, corruption, fear, pride and prejudice."" When we recognize each other's humanity and when we act with love, argued Sargent Shriver, we live in community with each other and avoid the conflict and violence that comes from what today we would refer to as ""othering,"" deeming those who are different than we are as threatening or inferior. <p> Sargent Shriver's desire to combat racism and inequality stayed with him throughout his life. It is visible in the values he asserted when he led the Peace Corps, the War on Poverty, and even Special Olympics later in his life. You can read more about Sargent Shriver's civil rights work here. <p> Many things have changed since Sargent Shriver spoke these words in 1958, but it would be irresponsible to ignore or to downplay the impact of racism and racial violence on us today. An honest look around will show that divisions based on race affect so much of our daily lives. From lack of equal treatment in the criminal justice system, to unethical banking practices that still show the remnants of redlining, to workplace discrimination, unjust and inhumane immigration policies, and violence triggered by white supremacy, we still operate within a system based on white privilege that makes it impossible for all of us to be treated as equals and to live in peace. We need to keep talking about race and to stand against racism whenever we have the opportunity. <p> Like this quote?

Items I expected to see ' steak Florentine and hearty bean soup, for example ' were nowhere to be found, while all the pastas with cream sauces on the menu weren't exactly indicative of Tuscan cuisine. The fresh-baked bread, a Tuscan fundamental, was wonderfully light and airy with a crispy crust, but serving it with cold squares of butter rather than extra virgin olive oil was a little surprising. We thoroughly enjoyed the salmon carpaccio ($9.95), every slice undoubtedly fresh, superbly smoky and embellished with creamy goat cheese, red onions and capers, served with roasted red peppers and olives. A heavy sauce weighed down the eggplant alla parmigiana ($8.95), but the substantial starter (along with the bread) could easily satisfy diners on a shoestring budget, particularly the Rollins College students who frequent the place. Same goes for their thin-crust pizzas ($11.50 to $13.95). <p> Pastas dominate the mains. The gnocchi ($12.50), done in the Sorrento style, was bathed in the requisite sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil leaves, even though the potato dumplings were slightly overdone and on the soft side. Still, that was the sole fault of this otherwise rewarding dish. Pollo di Babbo ($13.95), a holdover from the days when Martorelli ran Babbo in College Park, was a thick, rich and completely filling second course. The corpulent breast stuffed with spinach, ricotta and mozzarella was served atop a bed of spaghetti drenched in a creamy sherry wine sauce. The sauce had life, but the breast, surprisingly, was lackluster. <p> A decent wine list emphasizes Italian varietals (a glass of chianti is practically a must), and if you require assistance in your selection, the knowledgeable waiters are sure to help. Service, it should be noted, was impeccable, polished and professional, though placing all our leftovers in tinfoil was bizarre. Sure, it's more enviro-friendly than Styrofoam, but I didn't appreciate finishing mushy leftover tiramisu ($6.95) the following day. No matter, it was still good. Same goes for the homemade cannoli ($6.95) with its generous filling, restrained cinnamon essence and perfectly done shell. <p> Trattoria Toscana isn't perfect, and it may not even be totally Tuscan, but the restaurant shows a lot of promise.

33,"The front page of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun claimed a world-exclusive interview this morning. The interviewee - President Donald Trump, who is in the U.K. right now. And Trump was not mincing his words in this interview. He said that Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, had wrecked the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. He also praised one of the prime minister's political rivals. And he slammed the mayor of London, who he has had a long-running war of words with. <p> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You have a mayor who's done a terrible job in London. He's done a terrible job.

But I think that all of this immigration has really changed the fabric of Europe. <p> GREENE: NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, who hosts All Things Considered, is covering the president's visit to London and just sat down with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Mary Louise, good morning. <p> MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Good morning from London, David. <p> GREENE: Well, so where exactly are you? <p> KELLY: Well, so I did just interview Mayor Khan here at city hall at his office. We are - I'm speaking to you now from up by the roof of city hall, looking down over the Thames River, boats crawling up and down. The Tower of London is in the background. It is quite a day in London, glorious weather too, which will be working in favor of the protesters which are expected later today. <p> GREENE: And they sound like they're going to be pretty sizable protests greeting President Trump on this trip. <p> KELLY: They are expecting thousands and thousands of protesters starting at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon here. They're going to walk down one of the main streets of London and end up at Trafalgar Square, which is about as close to London gets to having a central square. And there, you know, you never know, but there is tremendous buzz about it. And a lot of groups, a lot of people organizing to get people out to protest everything they do not like about President Trump. So that's all coming up this afternoon here. <p> GREENE: Well, I want to get to exactly what the mayor told you.

We don't know quite what she knew last night as this interview was about to break, if she knew it was coming or what exactly had been said. <p> And now aides on both sides, the British delegation, American delegation here trying to figure out how the heck do we go forward with the day's meetings on this working lunch that's been planned when President Trump has thrown, you know, a wrecking ball, a firebomb - pick your metaphor - into what they were supposed to be negotiating over? <p> GREENE: OK.

So tell us about what those attacks were and then, of course, what he had to tell you in this interview. <p> KELLY: Well, as you heard, President Trump there saying he - President Trump says Mayor Khan has done a terrible job as mayor, he's done a terrible job keeping the city safe. There have, of course, been a number of recent attacks in London in the last year or so. So I asked Mayor Khan about this, and more broadly, just about this whole Sun interview ripping Theresa May and others. And here is what Mayor Khan told me. <p> SADIQ KHAN: Well, he's entitled to have his views. I'm not going to rise to the individual things President Trump says. I'm hoping during the course of his visit, he sees a city and a country very comfortable in ourselves, very comfortable in our diversity, see it as something we should celebrate, not be scared of. <p> KELLY: So you hear - it's Mayor Khan basically adopting the Michelle Obama mantra. When they go low, we go high. He's refusing to slam back quite in as unmincing (ph) words as President Trump came out with, but clearly taking exception to just about everything President Trump said in this interview. <p> GREENE: Reminds me a little bit of Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, too, after he met with President Trump recently. And Trump left those meetings in Canada saying, you know, France, we are a proud country. We're comfortable in ourselves. We don't need to engage in this kind of stuff. Let me just ask you, Mary Louise. There's been all these stories about this blimp, a blimp like a balloon of a baby Donald Trump the protesters have up. Didn't they need to get permission from the mayor to have this? Did the mayor talk about that? <p> KELLY: They did. The blimp is up. The mayor did sign off on it, which is controversial. And I asked the mayor about that, you know, defend why this is a good idea. Here's what he told me on the blimp. <p> KHAN: Can you imagine what your listeners would think if their politicians curtailing free speech, curtailing the right to protest simply because somebody is offended, what's next? One of the things that we should be really proud of, both Americans and Brits, is the rights we have to protest and to express our views. And the key thing is it should be done in a peaceful manner. It should be good-spirited. <p> GREENE: All right. Have you seen the blimp? <p> KELLY: So Mayor Khan there making the case. It is up, and we're on our way there next.

34,"Network where the action is <p> June 18, 2010 <p> I'm not good at networking or socialising. At least I never thought I was. People kept telling me to go to certain parties, but until recently I thought I'd just make a fool of myself, trying desperately to impress ""the important people"". <p> But then I realised that maybe I had the wrong conception of these kind of things. It turned out that I just had to get to talk with people, be myself, tell something about me, and to have a bit of luck. And suddenly I had a great opportunity at hand! <p> But before I realised that, I came to understand something else: It's never wrong to be where the action is. I was in Cannes during the film festival this year. I did not have anaccreditation and I was aware I wouldn't be seeing much (which turned out to be completely wrong, but that's another story), I just came to enjoy the athmosphere and the sun. <p> On day one of my visit I had already seen my first red carpet show and was so thrilled about it and happy with my visit that I thought the day was over. So I went to a bar to celebrate all by myself. But that day wasn't over by far and I wasn't all by myself for long. Within minutes I got talking with two Americans at the next table. At first I was a bit disappointed that they weren't film people, but they were nice and I stayed for longer than I had anticipated. And after a while I found out they were pilots of a private jet belonging to a Hollywood producer. <p> Actually, I didn't care much about this fact as I didn't look at this as a business contact. But later I told one of them about the film script I'm working on. He was suddenly all interested and asked a whole lot of questions about it and then said, well, give it to me and I'll give it my boss. For some reason I didn't take this too seriously either and just kept on talking about something, wondering why the hell he wasn't listening, but talking on the phone, until I heard the words: ""I'm sitting here with this young, interesting, european film-maker. Could she send you her new film script?"" And then he handed over the phone to me! <p> And there I was, talking to a Hollywood producer at 2 am about my screenplay. And he did invite me to send the script over! <p> The next day it took me a while to realize what really had happened that night, but the fact is, I got my first connection to Hollywood and whatever the outcome will be, at least I know now what being in the right place at the right time and talking to people can be worth. <p> Carmen Moreno is a young filmmaker from Sevilla, Spain. She is the granddaughter of the famous toreador Enrique Moreno, whose autobiography she is currently adapting into a feature screenplay.

37,"S&P 500 vs. Total Stock Market <p> This article compares the S&P 500 with the Total Stock Market. The two indices are very similar but contain important differences. Is there an advantage to owning a Total Stock Market fund instead of the S&P 500? Or is it the other way around? After reading this article you will have a solid understanding of these similar yet different indices. <p> Who Cares? <p> Before launching into a detailed discussion lets pause for a moment and ask ourselves an important question: Who cares? The unfortunate answer to this question is ""Not many."" The next question we ask is: Who should care? The answer to this question is ""Still not many, but a few more than last time."" The astute reader has probably deduced that there a few people who should care about the differences between the S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market but do not. Read on to find out if you are one of those people. <p> Introduction <p> The S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market are both market-capitalization weighted indices. The S&P 500 represents the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States, accounting for a few other factors such as liquidity and industry grouping. The Wilshire 5000 and MSCI US Broad Market Index are indices that contain all active publicly traded U.S. stocks which at current count numbers more than 6,7001. There is little difference between Total Stock Market indices and this article will not distinguish between them. <p> The S&P 500 and Total Stock Market indices can be purchased through a variety of mutual funds or ETFs. I recommend purchasing the Vanguard funds VFINX for the S&P 500 and VTSMX for the Total Stock Market. <p> Similarities <p> Diagram 1: Comparison of S&P 500 vs. Total Stock Market <p> Diagram 1 shows a comparison of the S&P 500 and the Total Stock Market. The comparison spans roughly 10 years from June 20, 1996 to January 22, 2006. Over this time period $10,000 invested in the Total Stock Market would have grown into $22,119.01 at a respectable rate of 8.67% per year. $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 would grow into $21,180.82 at a rate of 8.14% per year. The Total Stock Market returned nearly $1,000 more than the S&P 500 (or 0.53% more per year). <p> Does this chart alone mean the Total Stock Market is the superior index? Certainly not. How would the results differ if our time period ended in June 2000 instead of January 2006? According to Diagram 1 the S&P 500 performed better than the Total Stock Market until June 2000 at which point the trend reversed. Therefore if our time period ended in June 2000 the S&P 500 would have performed better than the Total Stock Market. This shows that it is dangerous to measure performance using a small amount of data. Ten years is not enough. <p> If you have difficulty understanding which index is performing better, think about the chart as if it were a horse race. The distance between the lines can also represent the distance between two horses. Until June 2000 the S&P 500 horse pulled ahead of the Total Stock Market horse meaning it was running fastest, or performing the best. After June 2000 the Total Stock Market horse closed the gap between the S&P 500 horse, meaning it was running faster than the S&P 500 horse even though it was still losing the race until April 2005. <p> The only valid conclusion we can draw from Diagram 1 is that the S&P 500 performance closely matched the Total Stock Market performance from June 20, 1996 to January 22, 2006. In reality, the S&P 500 will always perform similarly to the Total Stock Market. This is true because the two indices are nearly identical: 80% of the Total Stock Market ingredients are the S&P 500. To illustrate, observe the top five holdings of each index in Diagram 2: <p> We see that both indices have the same top 5 holdings in roughly the same amounts. For example, consider $1,000,000 invested in both indices. This would purchase $36,100 of ExxonMobil in the S&P 500. In the Total Stock Market it would purchase $28,700 of ExxonMobil which is about 80% of $36,100. <p> If both indices hold roughly the same stocks then we would expect them to perform roughly the same. Thankfully this is true and the logical order of the universe is not breaking down2. If 80% of the Total Stock Market is the S&P 500, what's in the other 20%? <p> Differences <p> The Total Stock Market is comprised of many more companies than the S&P 500. It is more than ten times larger, in fact. How is it possible that their performance is so similar? The answer is that both indices are market-capitalization weighted. This means that each stock in the index is weighted proportionally to its market cap. Lets run through an example: <p> The current market cap of the entire US stock market is 13.8 trillion dollars. The current market cap of General Electric (GE) is 348.3 billion dollars. 348.3 billion divided by 13.8 trillion is 0.0252, which can also be written as 2.52%. This means that GE represents 2.52% of the total US stock market. Looking at Diagram 2 we notice that GE composes 2.52% of the Total Stock Market index as well. This is not a coincidence. Lets take a look at a different company, Somanetics (SMTS). Somanetics weighs in at a market cap of 274.9 million dollars which is less than one thousandth the size of GE. This represents 0.0019% of the total US stock market. Therefore we would expect Somanetics to compose 0.0019% of a Total Stock Market mutual fund such as VTSMX3. <p> Now we should understand how the Total Stock Market can contain so many stocks and still perform similarly to the S&P 500: The additional stocks in the Total Stock Market have a small impact on performance because they make up a small portion of the index. In our example the price movements of GE are over one thousand times more important than the movement of Somanetics. As of January 24, 2006 the Total Stock Market is composed as follows: <p> Since small and medium cap stocks represent a smaller percentage of the Total Stock Market, one might think they are not important. This is far from true. Owning small and medium cap stocks diversify the Total Stock Market holdings and may increase performance in the long run. Lets take a look at another diagram: <p> Diagram 4: Total Stock Market components: NAESX (small) VIMSX (medium) VFINX (large) <p> Diagram 4 shows the performance of small, medium and large cap stocks from May 28, 1998 to January 23, 2006. Small cap is red, medium cap is blue and large cap is green. We see that large cap stocks win the race until about June 2000 when they begin to lose value rather quickly. At this point in history many people became quite unhappy as their net worth began to approach zero. People whose portfolios consisted mainly of large cap stocks were the most unhappy of the bunch, although not quite as unhappy as those who owned technology stocks. If you remember the beginning of this article (I know, it's long. I'm sorry.) then you remember that the Total Stock Market began to perform better than the S&P 500 at about this same time. What was previously a mystery is now solved. The Total Stock Market performed better than the S&P 500 because it contains medium and small cap stocks which have recently outperformed the large cap stocks in the S&P 500. Since the Total Stock Market index is diversified in small and medium cap stocks it was less affected the poor performance of the S&P 500. The other side of this coin is that it will also be less affected by strong performance of the S&P 500. No free lunch here.",Information/Explanation
38,"Oregon Communities and Developers Face Significantly Heightened Standards Following ESA Consultation on National Flood Insurance Program <p> On April 14, 2016, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) released its Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7(a)(2) Biological Opinion regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in Oregon (Oregon BiOp). <p> Similar to the 2008 Biological Opinion issued by NMFS regarding the NFIP in the Puget Sound region (the Puget Sound BiOp), the Oregon BiOp concludes that the Oregon NFIP allows and encourages floodplain development that jeopardizes the continued existence of 16 ESA-listed anadromous fish species and Southern Resident killer whales, and results in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat for the fish species. In contrast to the Puget Sound BiOp, where NMFS permitted FEMA to rely heavily on local governments to implement more restrictive floodplain development standards, the Oregon BiOp takes a different approach to the ""reasonable and prudent alternative"" (RPA), and directs FEMA to change significant portions of the NFIP at the national level. Specifically, NMFS directed FEMA to change mapping protocols and the minimum floodplain regulatory criteria that all local jurisdictions must adopt to participate in the NFIP (enabling residents and businesses within their jurisdictions to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP) and to enforce NMFS's proposed new national standards against local governments in Oregon. <p> The magnitude of the Oregon BiOp is startling. If implemented as written, it could force local governments in Oregon, and ultimately other jurisdiction around the country, to apply much more restrictive development standards to larger floodplain areas to maintain eligibility to participate in the NFIP. For both public and private property owners and developers near a river or coast line, these changes could effectively prohibit the majority of development options, significantly reducing the value of previously high priced lands. <p> The Oregon BiOp includes a six element RPA, which directs FEMA to implement a series of immediate and longer term changes to the operation of the NFIP. In the short term, RPA Element 2 directs FEMA to require local jurisdictions in Oregon participating in the NFIP to adopt ""interim measures"" intended to protect floodplain habitat and listed species while FEMA adopts changes nationally to the NFIP. These measures include requiring that all development in the 100-year floodplain in Oregon be mitigated to achieve ""no net loss of natural floodplain functions"" through a combination of compensatory flood storage (at ratios higher than 1:1), and eliminating or mitigating for the use of impervious surfaces (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, etc.) in the floodplain. Further, Element 2 directs FEMA as an interim measure to identify a ""riparian buffer zone"" (RBZ) in Oregon measured 170 feet horizontally from the ordinary high water mark of perennial or intermittent streams, and limit the types of development allowed in the RBZ to: (1) water dependent uses, (2) habitat restoration activities, (3) activities that result in a beneficial gain for the listed species or habitat, and (4) activities that will have no adverse effects on listed species or habitat, i.e., activities that will not degrade or limit natural floodplain functions in any way. The BiOp sets forth a narrow definition for ""water dependent uses"": ""a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless located or carried out in proximity to water."" The Oregon BiOp directs that FEMA must complete implementation of Element 2 by March 15, 2018. <p> Concurrent with implementing the interim measures in Element 2, RPA Elements 3 and 4 direct FEMA to change both its floodplain mapping program and the minimum floodplain development criteria at the national level. If FEMA opts to move forward with implementation of these Elements as currently written, they will represent a dramatic shift in the requirements and operation of the NFIP. Specifically, Element 3 directs FEMA to begin mapping erosion prone areas as ""E Zones"" on FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS) and to designate them ""high hazard areas."" (FEMA has not previously mapped E Zones.) These E Zones would encompass the entire channel migration zone (CMZ) for most rivers except where the CMZ has been disconnected by existing infrastructure or development. Further, Element 3 directs FEMA to begin depicting the ""Area of Future Conditions Flood Hazards"" on its FIRMS, including accounting for climate change and anticipated future development/build out. Element 3 also directs FEMA to expand the boundary of the regulatory ""floodway,"" to accelerate issuance of updated floodplain maps and to use more elaborate floodplain modelling techniques (e.g., multi-dimensional and unsteady state hydraulic models), and to require ESA-compliance for proposed FIRM amendments. <p> Element 4 directs FEMA to incorporate an ""ESA performance standard"" into its minimum floodplain management criteria, and then to develop region specific guidance based on the particular ESA listed species and designated habitat in each region. This element would have the effect of applying ESA-based protection standards to purely local floodplain development permits – permits which are not currently subject to ESA consultation requirements. Element 4 further directs FEMA to change its regulations to prohibit new development or substantial improvements in ""high hazard areas,"" defined as the expanded regulatory floodway and E Zones (per Element 3), except for (a) open space uses, (b) habitat restoration activities, (c) low intensity recreational uses, (d) water dependent uses (as defined above), and (e) bioengineered bank protection, all subject to appropriate mitigation. The Oregon BiOp calls for FEMA to implement Elements 3 and 4 no later than January 1, 2021, with earlier interim deadlines. <p> If implemented as written, the Oregon RPA will significantly expand the mapped floodplain and tighten regulations applicable to floodplain development within Oregon, and ultimately across the country, through changes to FEMA's floodplain mapping and minimum floodplain regulation criteria. FEMA has signaled significant concern with the Oregon BiOp's RPA to NMFS, the State of Oregon and local communities, and has suggested to local jurisdictions that they await further direction from FEMA before jumping ahead and trying to implement the RPA as written. <p> Overall, the Oregon BiOp appears to be the next step in an ongoing ""show down"" between FEMA and NMFS that is likely to result in significant changes to the way floodplains around the country are mapped and regulated. For more information regarding the Oregon BiOp and its RPA, please contact Molly Lawrence.",News

44,"Severus the Magnificent! <p> Severus' story begins in February of this year on a walking trail in Everson, PA. Two girls, Callie and Gena called our answering service and asked if FosterCat could help with a stray cat that had been obviously abandoned and that they had found when walking on this trail. <p> Apparently Severus had approached both girls meowing and continued to follow them on the trail until they stopped and petted him. They noticed that he had a wound on his leg and was limping and knew they could not just leave him in this wooded area. They immediately picked him up and took him to a vet to get medical attention for his leg. Thankfully, the vet said that there was no bone or muscle damage and after cleaning the wound, Severus was put on antibiotics. After a few weeks, Severus was neutered, given his vaccinations and tested for feline leukemia/FIV. The results were positive for FIV. We thought we would have a hard time placing Severus because of that diagnosis, even though we knew he could live a long and productive life. Severus was dealt yet another blow when the vet noticed that his eye was very cloudy. After a close examination, it was determined that Severus had an iris melanoma. FosterCat immediately took Severus to an eye specialist where they confirmed the diagnosis and recommended that his eye be removed. Poor Severus had gone through so much during his rescue and transition and now needed to have major surgery! Jordana, one of our foster parents, stepped up and offered to foster Severus during his long convalescence from eye surgery. Recently, her senior cat who had been in renal failure, sadly passed away and she felt that she needed to help another cat in distress. Severus was lucky to be that cat! After the surgery, Jordana made sure that Severus had everything he needed so that he would have a speedy and comfortable recovery. <p> Well, as they say, the rest is history. Severus had his surgery and it was a success. More importantly, Jordana and Severus bonded! She decided she could not give up this little guy and decided to adopt him. Needless to say, all of us at FosterCat were absolutely thrilled! As you can see by the pictures, he is doing well and is living and loving each new day! <p> There are so many more cats out there who need happy endings like Severus. We have two cats, Gulliver and James Bond (007-licensed to thrill), that have similar stories and just need someone like you to open their hearts and home. Both are wonderful, loving cats that need a second chance at the ""good life."" Please go to FosterCat's website, www.fostercat.org and take a look at these wonderful cats! They are waiting for a special home like yours! <p> Severus is very lucky! His story is only one of many, many cats outside who are in trouble and need our help. Because of your generous support, FosterCat has been able to lend a helping hand to many of these cats in need, just like Severus. We will never give up on these cats. While we may not be able to help all of them, FosterCat will continue to save them, ""one cat at a time."" <p> We would like to keep you informed by sending you updates and information about important events, like our upcoming Bingo Fundraiser.

You can specify FosterCat, Inc as your charity! <p> Eight is Never Enough <p> Late in February of this year, Kim Z., our foster parent, noticed on Facebook that a woman (Kimmie) posted that she was feeding multiple cats at her house in Verona and was asking for help. One group was able to get a few of the cats to the vet for TNR, but ""Kimmie"" kept noticing more and more cats were showing up at her house to be fed. Kimmie was extremely worried as she noticed that many of the cats were calicos and the thought of more multiple litters of kittens being born outside scared and overwhelmed her into seeking help. Kim was able to call and lend her traps to get the ball rolling. When visiting Kimmie to check out the situation, Kim noticed that one particular male cat (Sylvester) was older, not exactly friendly and not neutered. Kim immediately surmised that he was the father of most of these cats and that he should be neutered immediately. Kim was able to get Sylvester into a carrier, and off to the vet he went. Once he was vetted and released, Kimmie noticed that he was much calmer and pretty much hung out around the house. <p> Traps were immediately set for the remaining cats and after much diligence and perseverance during the coming weeks, one cat after another was trapped and spayed/neutered. It was then Kim noticed that most of the calicos and many of the males were friendly and could be adopted out. Needless to say, all of us at FosterCat were thrilled to know that we could place these cats into permanent, loving homes. We started with Andy and Bonnie. They were just the sweetest cats and we were able to place them into a loving home with Holly T. and her husband, who are indeed two very special people. Holly writes..""The kittens are doing great. It didn't take them long before they were sitting with us. They played with their toys for hours last night and we got them a cat tree for Valentine's Day which they love. Thank you so much for giving them to us. They will be loved so much."" <p> The next two who were adopted out were Vinnie and Guiseppe (now Lil Ace and Bandit)! These two also got a wonderful home with Dan S. Dan writes ""The cats are doing fantastic! I am extremely glad that I adopted both cats. The entertainment those two provide on a daily basis is incredible! Thank you for giving me this opportunity."" <p> Ginnie and Mira have also been adopted, along with Maya. We are awaiting updates and pictures. Delta is still in foster but we are hoping to get her a wonderful home as well. I call them the 'Verona Eight!' <p> You are probably wondering at this point why I decided to do a story on these eight cats. I wanted to emphasize how important it is to ìreach out and ask for helpî when feeding stray or feral cats. Two cats can quickly turn into 22 cats, so I can't stress the importance of reaching out to a rescue organization (Homeless Cat Management Team, Animal Friends, Homeless Cats of Butler, Fix UR Cat, Merlinís Safe Haven, etc. to name just a few) so that they can give you information on TNR (trap, neuter and return) or for upcoming clinic information. Please remember that feeding the cats is only the first step! Itís important to follow through and do the right thing for the cats. Spay/neuter is the only answer. There are free and low cost clinics out there so why not take advantage of them. If you don't know how to trap, numerous organizations will show you, but you have to reach out and ASK! <p> For these eight cats, it meant the difference between just existing outside; exposed to the elements in the bitter cold of winter with no food, clean water or shelter. The cats end up having flea infestations, worms, ticks, and upper respiratory infections, not to mention predators. These poor females have litter after litter with no end in sight. No tame cat or dog deserves to live a miserable life outside (through no fault of their own) when we can get them indoor homes to live out their lives in comfort. Don't they truly deserve that much? FosterCat is determined to continue its mission of 'Saving lives one cat at a time.' That my friend is what FosterCat is all about. <p> Blessing of the Animals Update <p> Seventy five dogs, cats and a few guinea pigs received a special blessing at Unity Presbyterian Church's second annual Blessing of the Animals event on June 1st. Pets and their families also received a blessing certificate with their petsí names on a commemorative frame and sleeve. FosterCat was among several area rescue and foster groups participating at the event that day. This was a significant part of the event and afforded the groups a chance for community exposure often reserved for larger area shelters.

49,"Are You A Knuckle Dragger? <p> I'm college educated and most of my friends and family are in law enforcement or are rescue & medical professionals so I really don't get much stereotyping. I do on rare occasions have to explain the difference between a ""Jailer"" (aka ""guard"") and ""Corrections Officer"" but for the most part everyone around me knows what I do and all the training I have gone through for the sake of the job. I think the BEST remedy for the image of CO as goon lies with the officers themselves. If more CO's had more interest in training, education, professionalism and physical conditioning then that stereotype wouldn't be quite as widespread. How many of you work with at least ONE semi-literate, overweight, lazy, rude (or any combination thereof) CO? How many of your coworkers are just there for a paycheck and aren't very committed to the job itself? How we conduct ourselves on the job and off goes a long way towards shaping how people regard our profession. <p> Yeah Cq I know they lowered the standards. I've seen a few of 'em, and frankly I think one CO is a bit on the mental slow side. It's scary. Knuckle Dragger? Naw.. most of my inmates look at me 1) Like I'm crazier than they are, 2) Know I'm prior military, 3) Don't put up with any crap, and finally 4) Know I don't mind a good fight. So it all tends to keep things on an even keel in my part of the ""insane wing"". I push education with the ones that are the medical detainees, and will work with them if they need help with their studies. Hell I don't mind as long as they want it. I've told 'em that I have a B.A., M.A., and M.B.A. mebbe I can figure things out a little. <p> Of all the Public and Law Enforcement services I would have to say that we in Corrections would have the Darkest and most Twisted sense of humour of all. But then again look at the environment that we work in and the people we work and deal with. Is it any surprise. Our Job is completely unique in every way. Sure we even have our own language. I remember being out one night with friends from work and some Humans (what we call civilians). Half the time the Humans couldn't understand what we were saying and the other half puzzled and at times horrified by what we found funny. <p> I'm fairly short so my knuckles are close to the ground, but they don't quite drag! Good thing, draging my knuckles would totally ruin my nails! <p> And to think that I thought that it was only the dry air and old age making my hands cracked and calloused. It wasn't untill tonight, after I got to work and found a few peddles and dirt in my knuckles that I realized what you all where talking about. <p> It looks like every state has openings in corrections but few answer the call. We've had posts in the past where we talked about seeing corrections staff who don't take care of their uniforms or even attempt to look professional. Is it possible that a lot of potential new-hires shy away because they think the job is beneath them and only a Neanderthal will do it? <p> I totally agree that you can't understand working in corrections and can't appreciate the humor unless you've worked in corrections. <p> Hey Sniper7310, got to agree with the humor aspect. If someone were to tell me the things these idiots do before I got into this business I'd never believed them. As for the recession, look around. It's nation...scratch that, World Wide as our economey effects the World. DSHS is dropping claims as families have exceeded the time frames and are no longer elligable for benefits. For those who are dealing with Labor & Industries in a fight for disability, only adds to the stress and depression. The result will increase in crime and suicide. In WA, they have lowered the standards so new recruits may get hired on....lol <p> No one will really understand what we do until they have done it themselves. No documentary can begin to show what it is like and what we put up with every day. I will give some credit Hard Time (nice job ODRC) is good but still will never be able to show what its really like. Then they think they know what its like and look at us like we are completly nuts because of our warped sense of humor. If you cant laugh about the warped things you will go crazy. One thing though that I cannot figure out. Ohio is in a huge recession, highest unemployment rate in how long, so the new officers coming in ARE THE BEST WE CAN FIND.....REALLY? <p> Unfortunately unlike the Police whom the public see every day and look upon as Guardians of their safety, we are hidden behind high walls and razor wire. And apart from a few Documentaries on TV. Most of the media portray us as lowly educated Neanderthals in uniform. What they don't see is the work involved. Let me take one example. Criminal Intelligence gathering. My colleagues and I in O.S.G. (Operational Support Group) work very closely with the Police sharing gathered intel. Which has lead to some stunning victories against the criminal gangs both inside and outside the prison system. And until the day comes when the media give us a fair shake we will always be thought of as Knuckle Dragger's. <p> I have a couple of nephews that have been in and out of jail/prison and like most all inmate mothers/grandmothers/girlfriends they believe everything they tell them hook, line and sinker. So them I'M the one that's looked on with suspicion because I'm one of them big, mean prison guards their little darling told them all about. I've tried to set the record straight a couple times in as gentle a manner as possible but you can tell they're always going to believe them more than me. <p> There is a lot of buzz about the economy, especially here in Ohio. When state workers (in general) complain about cutbacks, a common response is ""If the job is so bad, quit!"" It's difficult to respond to that statement in a sentence or two, but one reply might be ""If the job is so good, come join us."" <p> Money is a big consideration to just about any job, regardless of what the job is, and I freely admit that I wouldn't be working Corrections if the state paid minimum wage with benefits like most private employers offer. <p> We work side by side with people that the general public wouldn't want as next door neighbors, and the general public doesn't realize what we deal with day after day. It's more than simply watching and feeding prisoners. My friends and family understand what I do, but even they don't REALLY understand what the job is all about. They do, however, know me on a personal level and they know I'm not in this job because I think I'm going to get rich. <p> Do you have any neighbors, friends or family who still think we are knuckle dragging ""prison guards?"" Do you still respond to their inaccurate perceptions of what you do, or have you given up?",Forum

They're all startups from the clever folks at Mint Digital. Check out DeskBeers and Boomf at your leisure, but today we're talking bathtime with The Bathory and their custom-made, hand-blended bath soaks. <p> The Bathory invited me to have a go at making my own soak a little while ago. It's a pleasure to browse the lovely site and choose the perfect ingredients for your very own bath-time invention. First you pick a base of salts, either designed to soothe, detox or just bask. <p> Then you can layer on three essential oils: information is given about the properties and effects of each fragrance so you can pick ones that revive, relax or inspire you. Pop your choices in the basket and a few days later a beautifully-designed little bag lands on your doorstep. <p> You can clearly smell the fragrant oils even from outside the packaging! I couldn't wait to give it a go. The jar is pretty enough to display on the shelf all the time and is enough for several happy bathtimes. <p> I went for a detox base with grapefruit, bergamot and rosemary oils, and it smelled absolutely amazing. You need to add quite a lot to get a truly scented bath, but my favourite way to use it is in the shower: mixed with a little olive oil it's a dreamy shower scrub. It made my skin really soft and the scent lasted after I dried off. I'll definitely be replacing my jar when it runs out – the question is do I stick with my current blend or try a new one...? <p> The competition is now closed. Congrats to the winner, Louise and thanks for all your entries. <p> Thanks to The Bathory for giving me a soak to review and one to give away.",Opinion/Argumentation
53,"Related Posts <p> Comments (53) <p> I went for a sooooothing bergamot, grapefruit and lemon. I think it would make a good morning shower scrub. Uplifted and inspired. Super ready to take on the day! Yay! <p> Thank you for drawing my attention to this innovative start-up! Baths are so precious and it's lovely that someone is bringing something special to the market for bath-time. <p> Personally I'd go for the following: lavender (I can't sleep without smelling some of this beautiful scent each night), rosemary (this reminds me of the Swiss thermal baths of yesteryear), and ylang-ylang (because who doesn't want a little bit of sexiness in there too?!). <p> Ohh, many decisions to be made but a detox with grapefruit, lavender and ylang ylang. I have some grapefruit and lavender soap that I love and I think ylang ylang would just add a lovely warmth to it. <p> These look incredible, and would be perfect to soothe and revive me in my current mad dash to finish my PhD thesis! I would go for a base of epsom salts (because who doesn't want their bath to help slim them?!) with Bergamot, Ylang Ylang and Frankincense, to give me a boost and make me smell like a vixen afterwards! :-) Thanks for the giveaway! Congratulations to the winner (who I am secretly hoping will be me!). <p> Turn me into a CITRUS! I would pick Detox Salts, Lemon, Grapefruit and Chamomile. Hopefully, I will come out smelling like a Citrus but not resembling the fruit itself. <p> Oooh, what to choose? I think I'd go for a detox with lavender, rosemary, and ylang ylang. Might have to go and run a bath right now, I forget how lovely they are! <p> I've been desperate to try these guys out but hadn't quite worked out how mang baths/soaks a bottle would give you? What do you reckon? Either way I'd love to win since coming back from travelling I've actually turned into The Little Mermaid and love baths more than anything. I'd go for Ylang Ylang, Rosemary and Chamomile. x <p> Wow these look incredible! I would probably pick lavender as I love floral aromas and maybe infuse it with chamomile to add a relaxing edge :) <p> After a couple of years without a bath, I'm really looking forward to long soaks especially after a hot bike ride! My combo would be a citrus-tastic happy one of lemon, grapefruit & bergamot. x <p> For me baths are definitely about relaxing so I'd go for the Soothe base with the lavender (I am basically addicted), rosemary and sandalwood oils. This company sounds really amazing. Thanks for writing about them. <p> Wow! I've been looking for something like this for a while. I just had a look at the checkout process to pick my favourite and what a fantastic experience it was. I was a bit nervous to pick oils that didn't clash but they'd figured everything out for me – so easy and relaxing, I wish more sites would take note and have less painful purchase processes! And with worldwide shipping for $3, what's not to love! The ingredients list displayed clearly is also a massive bonus for those of us who try to avoid using a lot of chemicals. <p> My dream blend would be Soothe (honey, oatmeal and buttermilk) with lavender, frankincense and rosemary. Ahhh, just thinking about it makes me want to go take a bath right now. That's ok, at 9.30am, right?? <p> Great giveaway! I would like to try all of oils and salts.:-) But I am choosing Soothe base with lavender, rosemary and frankincense. Just noticed that girls comment has the same ingredients.:-) Thanks! <p> Hi Katie! I don't read on a regular basis, but I really appreciate the effort you put into each blog post. <p> Custom bath soaks – just what I've been waiting for. I'm kind of addicted to the smell of chamomile, it's so relaxing and ever since the Kneipp company discontinued their Chamomile bath a few years ago I've been desperate to find a similar product – yet without success so far. That's why I'd choose chamomile as my sole ingredient. <p> By the way – in a few weeks I'll be in London again. As far as I remember you are a vegetarian but do you have any recommendations for not too fancy restaurants or pubs where they offer nice sunday roasts? Thanks in advance! <p> Think I'd opt for Soothe with Ylang Ylang, Camomile and Grapefruit. Sounds delightful! Love the look of the website and simplistic design of the bottles. <p> Wow! What a fab idea, and thanks for the giveaway! It's a popular choice, but I love the idea of of a zingy combination of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit in a soothe base <p> Ooooo! I'd pick the detox salts with rosemary for a bit of magic, lemon to add some zing and grapefruit for inspiration. It sounds totally delish! x <p> I originally saw The Bathory after your first tweet about them! I loved the look of them so bought my mum one as a treat, as I felt guilty buying myself one but loved the idea and brand! I got her a soothe blend with lavender, chamomile and bergamot. I'd go for something slightly different I think, like a detox blend with grapefruit, eucalyptus and bergamot. Summery and fresh : ) <p> Oooh, this looks lovely. I'd have a detox bath with Frankincense, Bergamot and Rosemary, to relax, revive and inspire me after a particularly stressful couple of months. <p> Wow, what a great company, love blog posts like this that introduce new ventures! <p> I love a bath every now and then as a treat so I would definitely go for Soothe – with Ylang Ylang, Bergamot & Grapefruit (my favourite scent!)",Forum
54,"Professor of Materials Science <p> MA University of Cambridge PhD University of Cambridge <p> Polymers and Medical Materials <p> Together with Professor Serena Best, I direct the Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials. My research focuses on materials which interact therapeutically with the body. <p> Ice templating 3D environments for the control of tissue growth <p> The availability of tailored three dimensional environments for control of cell behaviour is a key step in the regeneration of healthy tissue in the body and can also enable model tissue creation for drug screening and cancer research. We are using ice templating techniques to create materials that mimic the complex orientational and spatial anisotropy of natural tissue, and that impart defined biochemical and mechanical cues. This is enabling us to develop bespoke cellular environments for clinical contexts including cardiac, dental and orthopaedic repair, cancer research and diagnosis, and blood cell production. <p> Biodegradable polymers and composites <p> Resorbable polymers and composites may be used in temporary load-bearing applications such as sutures and pins, in scaffolds for tissue engineering and in drug-delivery devices. We are exploring the intricate temporal and spatial relationships between the processing and morphology of the material, the diffusion rates of water, drug and degradation products, the degradation rate of the polymer and ultimate properties. An understanding of these factors allows informed device design. Our study of composites ranges from the micro co-continuous to the nano-scale, for orthoapedic and other tissue repair. <p> Biostable implants <p> In many surgical applications, the implant material must not change over time within the challenging environment of the body. Issues we addressing include those spinal and cardiac surgery. <p> Drug delivery and pharmaceutics <p> We have interests relating to drug delivery to the body including drug polymorphism, tablet design and inhalation delivery systems. <p> Collagen scaffold imaged using X-ray Microtomography to reveal its 3D structure.

63,"Former HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell once told President Barack Obama she couldn't make a meeting because it was her daughter's birthday (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) <p> It's just before 8 o'clock on a recent Wednesday morning, and former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is getting settled in the Speaker's Dining Room on the House side of the Capitol. <p> She's meeting with a handful of female lawmakers, but she's not there to talk policy. She's there to talk parenting. <p> ""It's important for us to discuss and share experiences and to share both opportunities and challenges as moms,"" she told HoH shortly after the get-together. <p> Mathews Burwell was a mom of two before she became a member of President Barack Obama's Cabinet. And to hear her tell it, sometimes that needed to take precedence, even amid an Ebola outbreak. <p> It was a Friday evening in 2015 when Obama called a last-minute meeting to discuss the crisis. He planned it for the next day, and although Mathews Burwell was no stranger to working on Saturdays, she already had a commitment on this particular weekend. <p> ""I sent an email and said, 'I'm happy for my team to represent me ... but I can't make that time because it's my daughter's birthday,'"" she recalled. ""And so the president moved the meeting."" <p> Don't hide ""from the fact that you're a mom,"" Mathews Burwell told the ""Moms in the House"" meeting. Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz organized the group at the beginning of the year Congress welcomed a record number of newly elected members who were also mothers. <p> The ""Moms"" meet monthly. While the type of event varies, several have been scheduled around breakfast, according to Wasserman Schultz. Past guest speakers have included Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel and Running Start CEO and founder Susannah Wellford. <p> ""It's really important that we have that bond of sisterhood and a network of women who have lived through this experience and done so successfully,"" Wasserman Schultz told HoH in January. <p> Massachusetts Rep. Katherine M. Clark went on MSNBC last Wednesday to weigh in on the group of House Republicans who stormed a closed-door impeachment hearing. But hours before she made an appearance on national TV, she was at the long table inside the Speaker's Dining Room, with fellow Democrats Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Grace Meng of New York, and Debbie Dingell of Michigan. <p> Although Wasserman Schultz's ""sisterhood of support"" is a bipartisan effort, most mothers of young kids this year are on the Democratic side. Freshman Reps. Kim Schrier of Washington and Sherrill are two examples. <p> We have a record number of moms in Congress right now. We bring an important voice to the Hill, and are here fighting for our families and yours every day! pic.twitter.com/BfVWUQubpD <p> ""We go through some unique experiences as moms, generally, that involve guilt and not being able to be everywhere at once,"" a hurried Schrier said on her way to her next appointment for the day. <p> Del. Stacey Plaskett, a mother of five, is no stranger to that ""guilt."" The Democrat from the Virgin Islands felt it from her oldest kids who once questioned her commitment to being a full-time mom while juggling her congressional duties. <p> ""Would you tell me that if I was your dad?"" she'd respond rhetorically. ""Don't give me that s---,"" she quipped to the other women in the room who responded with laughter. <p> Their meeting felt more like a group of girlfriends swapping stories about husbands and kids than a meeting among policy wonks. <p> And while a convenient continental breakfast, featuring an assortment of muffins and bagels, was on display in the prestigious dining room for these moms-on-the-go, the preferred source of energy wasn't necessarily the carbs.

I have moved on to All the Light We Cannot See. <p> Just finished ""The Honourable Schoolboy"" by John LeCarre, the middle book of the Smiley-Karla trilogy. No need for this to be so long. And, no Karla! Now, on to the final one: Smiley's People. A little shorter, in number of pages. <p> Oathbringer was incredible. I'm sure viv waxed on about it, so I'll leave it at that. <p> The IQ series by Ide is pretty fun. <p> Really enjoying Michael Sullivan's riyria books. they're not heavy.

They're still funny, so I'll keep going, but not even close to being as good as The Dresden Files <p> Read a bunch of Christian books, most of which I really loved. Trying to read more non fiction, especially theology and devotional, so hopefully this trend will continue. <p> Just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire and just started The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest (last of original author, Larsson, in series). <p> This book was much better for me the second time I read it, when I knew to not wait for Karla, and when I realized how much it was going to be about Jerry Westerby. It also serves some other functions I didn't figure out until I'd finished the trilogy. This whole book gets skipped by the BBC series, which I think is okay, but I did grow to like these characters, or at least feel sympathy for them. <p> Ugh, this came up as available in my library Overdrive hold queue, but about two chapters in I realized how much I'd forgotten, so I had to let it go. Now back to read the first two! <p> I did too, but you don't need that much, and (for me) what I did need came back.

73,"Bills to protect U.S. elections from foreign meddling are struggling, senators say <p> Erin Kelly USA TODAY <p> Published 6:48 PM EDT Jun 12, 2018 <p> WASHINGTON – Bipartisan bills aimed at protecting U.S. elections from foreign meddling face unexpected opposition, prompting members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to appeal to Trump administration officials for help Tuesday. <p> Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, complained that some American businesses oppose his bill, which would strengthen enforcement of a law requiring lobbyists for foreign governments to register with the Department of Justice. <p> Grassley's bill, the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would require Justice to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Companies don't want to have to register as foreign agents and oppose a provision that would require international businesses with U.S. subsidiaries to register. <p> ""We're running into opposition from some business groups that I don't think have a legitimate reason to oppose it,"" Grassley told Adam Hickey, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's national security division, during a committee hearing Tuesday. ""I wish you'd look at it and consider supporting it."" <p> The Foreign Agents Registration Act – passed by Congress in 1938 to expose Nazi agents before World War II – has received increased attention in the past year. <p> Special counsel Robert Mueller charged two former Trump campaign officials with violating the law as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. <p> Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was charged with – among other things – failing to properly disclose his work for the Kremlin-backed government in Ukraine. Richard Gates, who served as the campaign's deputy chairman, was initially charged with violating the same law, but that charge was dropped when Gates pleaded guilty to two separate crimes. <p> Despite Mueller's actions, the law has rarely been used to prosecute lobbyists, and Grassley and others pushed to step up its enforcement. <p> Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced a separate bill with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who serves on the panel. That bill would require the attorney general to create a section within the Justice Department to enforce laws against suspected operatives or agents of foreign governments. <p> The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill by Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., in January that is identical to Grassley's, but the senator's bill stalled in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Feinstein-Cornyn bill – the Foreign Agents Registration Amendments Act – also awaits action there. <p> Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said her separate, bipartisan bill aimed at protecting state election systems from cyberattacks by the Russians or other foreign governments is blocked by Senate Republicans despite the fact that it is co-sponsored by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. <p> The Secure Elections Act would streamline cybersecurity information sharing between federal intelligence agencies and state election officials and provide security clearances to state officials, so they could get classified information about cyberthreats. <p> The senators are trying to attach the bill to a sweeping defense authorization bill the Senate is likely to pass this week, but Klobuchar said their amendment faces opposition from GOP leaders. <p> ""For reasons I do not understand, our bill ... is being hung up,"" Klobuchar said Tuesday. <p> Russian hackers tried to breach the election systems of 21 states during the 2016 election, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The Russians succeeded in penetrating Illinois' voter registration database. There is no evidence that any votes were changed. <p> Hickey said he could not endorse any specific bills but promised to work with senators on their legislation. He said he expects the Justice Department to issue a public report this summer on interference in the 2016 election and ways to prevent meddling.",News

82,"GCube and Modern Energy Management partner on Indonesian wind farm project <p> Modern Energy Management (MEM), a specialist in delivering project lifecycle certainty to renewable energy developers, financiers and investors, is to carry out marine warranty surveying (MWS) services at Indonesia's first utility-scale wind project, Sidrap Wind Farm, on behalf of GCube Underwriting Ltd (GCube). <p> Under the terms of the agreement, MEM will provide risk management services related to the offloading of wind turbine generator components for the 75MW wind farm. As the pace of wind energy development in the emerging markets increases, there is an urgent need for supporting infrastructure to be properly integrated into the supply chain process. Although relatively lowly ranked by the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, Indonesia is undertaking significant investment in its ports and harbours in order to better facilitate the import of capital equipment. Whilst this process takes place, however, wind energy developers require the confidence of a secure and comprehensive marine warranty service to ensure that large parts and components arrive at the project site undamaged and on time. GCube selected MEM for this work ahead of local survey companies due to the firm's clean energy specialism and expertise in the emerging Asian renewable energy markets. A key factor in the decision was ensuring the necessary depth of experience to comprehensively assess on-site and logistical risks, and prevent these leading to project delays. The Sidrap wind farm, located on a series of ridges in Northern South Sulawesi, will consist of 30 Gamesa turbines and is scheduled for completion in January 2018. The site's remote and challenging landscape poses unique logistical challenges for the construction team, and will require components to be offloaded at a jetty specially-constructed for the project. MEM will oversee the components' offloading, before they are transported to the project site itself. ""As Indonesia begins to develop in clean energy, investors need to have the confidence that their projects may be de-risked throughout the development timeline,"" says Lars Lund, Director, MEM. ""Deploying wind energy in remote regions requires a full understanding of the project risk profile. Our own development experience informed the survey work we carried out at Sidrap, and will allow us to put procedures in place to best mitigate these risks."" Charlie Richardson, Senior Underwriter at GCube, commented: ""GCube's specialised expertise in renewable energy underwriting, coupled with MEM's local knowledge of the Indonesian market, has enabled us to develop a detailed understanding of the risks related to offloading turbine components and transporting them across the country. ""Partnering in this way will ensure comprehensive oversight of what was a technically and logistically challenging element in the Sidrap Wind Farm's construction, helping the project to realise its full potential.""",News

85,"Soil erosion problems are not only limited to water erosion in Iowa, although it is the dominant one due to high rainfall events and their significant impacts on sediment transport to lakes and streams in the state. However, wind erosion at this time of the year can be very significant and contribute to serious topsoil loss given the high winds experienced in the state during recent weeks. Soil loss by wind erosion may not be physically noticeable on the field, but it can be significant in terms of its effects on air, soil, and water quality over time. <p> This spring most parts of Iowa have had plenty of rainfall, causing many producers to enter fields at less-than-ideal soil conditions. High soil moisture increases soil compaction caused by field traffic and machinery. Over the past decade the size of Iowa farms has increased, leading to larger and heavier equipment. However, equipment size is only one factor among many causes of the soil compaction problem. Rushing to the field when the soil is wet can increase chances for severe soil compaction combined with the weight of equipment and traffic pattern in the field. <p> Spring rains come with unexpected quantities and force, causing significant amounts of soil erosion to unprotected cropland. Spring is the most critical time for soil erosion because of degraded crop residue, tillage in preparation for planting, and lack of crop canopy. Residue cover is not only good for preventing soil erosion, but it will cut down sediment transport to water bodies and contribute to the improvement of water quality. <p> Providing the crop an even start with weeds is still the first step in successful weed management, although the importance of this practice has diminished in many farmers' minds. An even start is provided by planting soon after the final seedbed preparation tillage pass, or in no-till by applying a burndown herbicide soon before or after planting, or use of early preplant treatments prior to the weed establishment. <p> Soil Management <p> The weather is gradually improving and most Iowa producers are getting closer to working in the field. Some have already started fieldwork. <p> However, there is still time to finalize preparation of tillage implements for spring fieldwork. Producers are encouraged to check and evaluate the design of soil-engaging components of their tillage implements, assess the potential for soil erosion, and think about their chances for a successful crop. <p> Carbon and the 'carbon cycle'. Over the past century, CO2 levels have risen significantly. There is considerable debate about the reasons -- whether it's a natural cycle or the result of increased CO2emissions due to human activities-- but there is general agreement that human activity accounts for part of the increase, especially in view of the continuing increase of CO2 levels following the on-set of the industrial age. <p> A conservation planning should be part of every Iowa farm management plan. Now is the best time to conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of conservation plans, based on field observations and the outcomes seen during the 2003 growing season. Residue management, soil erosion control, improved water quality, soil productivity and moisture conservation and its impact on yield can be used to measure success of your plan. <p> Harvest conditions in fields this fall will be determined by the extent of drought damage to each crop, especially soybeans. Decisions about equipment use for harvesting the drought-damaged crops must consider the plant moisture content, crop use, and equipment availability if owned, leased, or custom. <p> In most cases, plant moisture content has already dropped below the 60 to 70 percent recommended moisture level for ensilage. Forage material still may be collected in bales or stacks if plant material is dry enough for appropriate storage.",Information/Explanation
86,"Being ordained for the Diocese of Belleville, Illinois, next door to the heart of the Bible Belt, I figured I would be spending lots of time dealing with Protestants, converting and arguing with these Scripture-quoting folk. I wanted to make certain no one could throw a Bible verse my way with the taunt, ""I bet you never heard that one before."" Having read the whole book, I could honestly answer, ""Yes! I have."" <p> Ironically, after 54 years of ministry, I have rarely tried to convert or argue with Protestants. I spend the vast majority of my time teaching, converting and arguing with Catholics! People of my own denomination provide the most problems for me. I certainly never saw that coming. <p> But then again, I have always thought it important to remember that during my ordination in Rome's St. Peter's Basilica, my classmates and I had to weave our way to the Altar of the Chair of St. Peter through scaffolding set up for the Second Vatican Council. That church-quaking council affected more than just my path to that particular altar; it has changed the path of my entire ministry.The biblical authors of this month's liturgies can identify with my change in direction. If their own discipleship had given them a direct path in carrying out God's plan, they probably would never have written the readings on which we are reflecting. For most, the turnabout they experienced prompted the passages we have been given. <p> Jeremiah's pericope on the First Sunday of Advent is one of the exceptions. At this point in his ministry, the prophet still believes Yahweh will rectify the abuses he has encountered in the ""normal"" way: through the Davidic leadership. When the right king sits on the throne, things will change for the better. Paul, on the other hand, has experienced a 180-degree directional change. He writes 1 Thessalonians – the oldest Christian writing we possess – for Gentiles, not for the Jews he originally presumed he would be evangelizing. Instead of first converting all Jews, then starting on Gentiles, he has reversed the process. In his revised plan, once Gentiles are turned into other Christs, jealousy will prompt Jews to follow suit. <p> In a similar turnabout, Luke seems to be the first Christian writer to abandon the general belief that the risen Jesus will return in his lifetime. He is convinced this Parousia will eventually happen, but it is going to take place while he is already enjoying heaven with the Christ, not before. That's why – writing in the mid-80s C.E. – he is so insistent that his readers stay ""vigilant."" That unique event is still going to happen, even if it is not following its original schedule. In situations like this, one can only join the psalmist in praying, ""Teach me your paths."" They are certainly not the paths God's chosen people originally started down. <p> As we know from the Second Sunday of Advent, Paul is confident that in spite of all the change in directions, ""the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ."" It is understandable that Baruch encourages his people to look forward to people returning to Jerusalem after the sixth century B.C.E. Babylonian exile, but it is important to remember what Deutero-Isaiah discovered: Most Israelites refused to accept that a non-Jew – Cyrus – would be the ""new-Moses"" who would actually bring about that return. It is one thing to pray Psalm 126, confident that Yahweh will ""[bring] back the captives of Zion."" But it is a whole other thing to agree with the process that will make that glorious day a reality. Just as Luke can see the Roman Empire as an agent of Yahweh working in the world, so his John the Baptizer can see the crooked paths, deep valleys and high mountains he encounters as the way in which God is working, even before they are straightened and leveled. It is evident that few others were able to look out on their mixed world and actually ""see the salvation of God."" If everyone could pull that off, we would have no Scripture. <p> One of my favorite ""Peanuts"" cartoons has Linus making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when he suddenly stops and looks at his hands. ""These hands,"" he reflects, ""could be the hands of a terrific scientist, or a life-saving doctor, or a great artist."" His sister Lucy looks him and points out, ""Those hands have peanut butter and jelly on them."" <p> In some sense, this is what we find on the Third Sunday of Advent. Our sacred authors could not speak in more idealistic terms of Yahweh, or the risen Jesus working in our lives. Zephaniah, for instance has confidence that the seventh century B.C.E. reforming King Josiah will restore Yahweh to the majestic place he/she deserves, actually causing God to ""sing joyfully ... as one sings at festivals."" Isaiah, the composer of today's psalm agrees. Since Yahweh is on our side, we have nothing to fear. Paul believes the risen Jesus now fulfills that role in our lives. We only must ""make your requests known to God"" through Christ and we will ""have no anxiety at all."" Beautifully and optimistically said. <p> But then, John the Baptizer – our Lucy – comes on the scene. When asked, ""What should we do?"" he leaves the idealistic language behind, simply saying, ""Share your cloaks and your food. Stop cheating and extorting. Don't lie and be satisfied with your wages."" John focuses on the peanut butter. Unless we first change our basic direction in life, there is no sense worrying about what God can achieve through us. The best might still be to come, but we will only be part of it after we clean our hands. <p> Yet as the Fourth Sunday of Advent teaches us, we will also be part of it only after we change to another direction in life: from big to small. Though St. Thérèse of Lisieux is usually credited with developing the popular theology and practice of the ""little way,"" I am afraid her insight was predated by our biblical authors. (Because Scripture was rarely a part of 19th century spirituality, I don't think she copied from them. She, like other saints, seems to have developed the concept on her own.) <p> It is consoling to look at God as the psalmist's majestic person enthroned ""upon the cherubim"" (thankfully not the baroque baby angels inhabiting many of our churches). Here we have the kind of God we presume is in charge of everything and everyone. Yet when that God gets down to the nitty-gritty, he/she works through the most insignificant people around. Micah, for instance, reminds us that the family of David, which will eventually ""save"" the chosen people, had its start in the village of Bethlehem – not the town we would expect to find on a messiah's resume. <p> Even those most involved in the conception and birth of Jesus weren't individuals we would write home about. Elizabeth, the Baptizer's mother, points that out in today's Gospel passage. She wants to know why Mary is visiting her, and not hobnobbing with some high muckety-mucks. The only thing she and her relative have going for them is that they believe God can personally work through their lives, as insignificant as they are. <p> The author of Hebrews joins in their amazement, applying the same standard to Jesus. He is not known for his good looks or superior mind. The one thing all his followers can imitate is his determination to do God's will, no matter where that will take us, or no matter how often it changes direction. I wonder how frequently, before the historical Jesus fell asleep at night, he reflected on how many parts of his ministry had changed that day. I simply presume God's will wouldn't have truly been fulfilled if by nightfall, it was still the same as it was in the morning. <p> We hear the readings of the Christmas Mass during the Night so often they have lost much of their original ""sting."" When Isaiah, for instance, first proclaimed the early eighth century B.C.E. birth (or coronation) of King Hezekiah, he was talking to a people who for a generation had been forced by his father Ahaz to practice a pagan-riddled faith, going so far as even sacrificing their sons to the local fertility gods. The prophet was confident this boy – consumed with the zeal of Yahweh – would bring a total turnabout. <p> In the same way, just as those who had experienced Hezekiah, so those who experienced Jesus would never be the same again. Everything has changed. Though we wax poetic over angelic interventions, remember how our sacred authors employ these otherworldly messengers: Scholars contend they are simply literary devices who interpret events for their readers. We are to take their message, not themselves, literally. In this situation, this humbly born child is gifted to us by God in order to bring peace into our lives. But as the author of the Letter to Titus reminds us, the peace for which we long isn't going to happen automatically. Before this golden age, we are obligated ""to live temperately, justly and devoutly."" Lawlessness does not disappear on its own. No wonder the responsorial psalm on this night talks about singing a ""new song."" If we insist on revolving our celebration around the usual schmaltzy, comforting feelings ""of the season,"" peace will never be ours. Only when we change will our world change. <p> Perhaps that is why it is good that the next feast is that of the Holy Family. Those, who like myself, have problems with Joseph and Mary actually being anxious about ""losing"" God, should read Raymond Brown's Birth of the Messiah. The late scholar presumes Luke, at this point in his Gospel, is employing a source that knows nothing about annunciations to Mary and Joseph. Their anxiety and questioning are for real. Jesus' parents are constantly learning who their son is. They have received no special, angelic information about his personality. Though I presume they had troubling questions about his conception, on many other levels they are just like us. They aren't ""faking it"" for the Bible's sake. <p> That is why our other two readings are important. They apply not only to us but also to them. The three certainly agreed with the author of Colossians, constantly developing concrete ways to show ""compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience."" These virtues didn't appear automatically. Some worked better than others. It certainly took hard work to produce the kind of family harmony the author of Psalm 128 envisions, as it also took a lot of sacrifice, as Sirach mentions, to relate gently to aged, forgetful parents. <p> Good families only ""happen"" when all family members are adaptable. Unless we are willing to constantly change direction in life, we will never be able to figure out the will of God for our families or for the world. <p> It reinforces my belief that Christianity should make the cockroach its ""totem insect."" No living critter has evolved more over the millions of years it has existed. Only its ability to change and adapt keeps it alive.",Opinion/Argumentation

The sleek modern minimalist design ensures your choice of shower pod will blend seamlessly into your bathroom environment. The smooth high-gloss finish of the surface gel coat is easy to clean, only requiring a wipe over with soapy water or a non-abrasive proprietary cleaner. <p> Installation could not be simpler. The shower pod shell does away with the need for traditional tiling, and with that goes a time consuming job. No tiles means no grouting. No grouting means no maintenance and no possibility of leaks over time. No leaks means you won't suffer from the associated smell of mildew, so your bathroom will always smell clean and fresh. <p> The Envirotec pod is designed so it simply cannot leak. Conventional shower enclosures rely on the integrity of the joint between the shower tray and the tiled wall to prevent the escape of water. The Envirotec pod has a moulded upstand that reaches far up the wall where it joins to the upper panel hence nowhere for water to go except down the drain. <p> You can buy the shower pod shell without the doors <p> Unlike most shower pod manufacturers Envirotec offer their shower pods in component parts. If you simply want to do away with tiled walls and leaky shower trays then choose the shower pod shell only. To this you might wish to fit a curtain and rail, or a door configuration from your favoured manufacturer. We do of course offer several complete packages, but the choice remains yours. <p> To complete the picture, Envirotec shower pods are available in a choice of three colours - porcelain white, black granite and sandstone granite. Shower pods are available with or without legs facilitating low access with an under-floor waste or above floor waste with legs and plinth panel. <p> Please take a while to look through the comprehensive range of options offered within the Envirotec range. It's sure to wake up the creativity within! <p> Shower pods are leak free, maintenance free, strong and durable <p> The concept of the 'shower pod' is fast catching on in the UK albeit a product that is firmly established in other countries around the world - particularly the USA. <p> The simplicity with which installation takes place cuts fitting time considerably. Wall surfaces need not be great as the shower pod shell covers imperfections. There are no 'advanced or specialist' abilities needed to carry out the fitting task which puts installation within the capability of a competent DIYer or trades person with basic plumbing and building skills. <p> A shower pod with options of low entry or a leg riser kit <p> Envirotec shower pods can be installed so the waste trap and pipework goes beneath the floor or above the floor on which they sit. <p> With a below floor configuration a very low step in height of only 50mm can be achieved. <p> If for any reason you wish to run your waste pipework above floor level then a riser leg and plinth panel kit is available as an optional extra. <p> In either case, the feet are adjustable to enable easy levelling of the shower pod tray.",Promotion

96,"Valedictorian's speech <p> Many great events go down in history, the birth of Christ, the building of the pyramids, the Titanic and all that other stuff we learned about in Mr. Moffet's history class. And as much as we would like to compare our class and the commencement of high school to some memorable moment in time, we probably relate most to the Titanic as that, too, didn't go as planned. It seemed to be smooth sailing for most of this trip we call high school, but towards the end most of my classmates can agree we hit quite the iceberg of senioritis. Nonetheless, with a little help from our parents and all of our teachers, we made it here. <p> High school may have been a brief four years, but for some of us the history of our class goes back many more. And with each year spent growing up together came change. For example, in first grade I got my only red ticket because I snuck my flip phone into reading group. Well, that might be a bad example, because I've lost every behavior point in Mr. Wehr's class because of that same reason. Some things have actually changed though. Instead of fighting every day over who got to sit on the big swings at recess, we get into heated debates that usually last weeks, even though they were supposed to be a one-day deal. The intense middle-school PE dodgeball games where the boys would all gang up on us was pretty fair payback for when us girls used to make them pretend to be babies when we played house in kindergarten. The field trips to museums turned into skip days to ride roller coasters. Counting to ten and the ABCs turned into AR reading tests which then somehow turned into stoichiometry and quadratic equations, even though we probably won't be using much of those again. <p> Through all this change, we learned some things along the way. Of course there was the math assignments and essays, but some of the lessons that helped us get here today aren't your typical high school lessons. Like when you hear high heels click-clacking down the hallway, Mrs. Nelson is coming, so you probably should look like you're doing something, even though half the time those high heels turn out to be Mrs. King. When it comes to Mr. Schuh, Desmos* is your best friend. If you want some candy or a cup of coffee, Ms. Caler is your hookup, and recycling bins have more than one purpose. <p> Our class turned out to be quite the fun group. Within our 14 kids, you can find the Harry Potter enthusiasts, the athletes, the shopaholics, the artists, the hunters, the overachievers and just about everyone in between. With our unique mix of strong personalities, we proved to be quite the handful for our teachers, and I'm sure every one of them, from preschool all the way until now, would back me up on that. So, to all of the teachers that taught us everything from how to tie our shoes and zip up our coats to how to build resumes and prepare for the real world, thank you. To our parents who packed our lunches, stayed up late while we finished our homework, made sure to come to every game, and our friends' parents who were there to fill in anytime they were needed, gave us countless rides home and always cheered us on, we could never thank you enough. <p> The stories we have from our time here are some you would never hear anywhere else. I doubt any other kids we meet will have had a song written by their teachers for them at their graduation. They probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble for sneaking off during the walks to the golf course during PE. They probably couldn't tell you what it was like to have to stay the night in the Chicago airport. I doubt they know what it's like to have to drive 45 minutes just for some McDonald's. And I can almost guarantee they didn't grow up within walking distance of almost all of their friends' front porches. <p> I'm sure every one of us complained at some point about growing up in a small town or having to move to one, but looking back it has given us some pretty special experiences. Usually, your high school sports teams don't have the same starting lineups as your peewee teams did. Most of the time, the girls who used to play dress up at sleepovers don't get to spend hours getting ready for the prom together. And the kids who used to ride their bikes to the pool don't get to spend summers at the lake together. Odessa is a little different though. Many of us got to grow up together and we were lucky enough to add a couple of new kids along the way. <p> Sure, things have changed growing up, but I think we all turned out pretty good. Over the next few months, we'll all be going our separate ways. We'll be seeing new things, meeting new people, and just trying to figure out how to navigate being an adult. The next time we walk into a classroom, it won't be filled with the same familiar faces. The next path we take in life won't be alongside our childhood friends. But no matter where we end up going, our roots are all the same. There's no telling where we are headed, but Odessa has left us all with some pretty cool stories to tell, and I wouldn't have wanted to make those memories with any other group of kids.",Opinion/Argumentation
97,"PC Disposal <p> PC Disposal Guidelines <p> When you wish to dispose of a computer (desktop, laptop, or server), you must first remove all the data (sensitive or otherwise) that is on it. Southern University Property Management will not accept a machine for disposal unless you confirm that this process has taken place. <p> Hard drive ""sanitization"" is important for two reasons. First, you do not want the next user of the system to have access to sensitive information (like research data, student info, financial data or patient information); and second, you do not want people to have unauthorized access to licensed software, such as Microsoft Word. Even Personal Digital Assistants, like Palm devices, should be reset, so that all data and programs are wiped from them. <p> However, merely using the ""delete"" command or dragging items to the trash does not remove the data from the disk. There are many, widely available programs that can restore data deleted in this manner. A plain ""format"" command is somewhat better, but a determined person could still access sensitive data. Some operating systems offer a ""format and zero out all data"" command, which is better, and is sufficient for machines which are just being moved around within the University. <p> The easiest and most secure way to remove the data is to use a ""wiping"" program that not only deletes the data, but also overwrites each sector with garbage data multiple times. Be aware that the process will take some time (potentially hours if the drive is very large, or if the processor is slow). If you do choose to do the cleanup yourself, you will need the following: <p> 1. A software program to wipe the disk and overwrite it with data. Some tools you could use are: <p> **NOTE: To obtain a copy of Wipedrive software visit or contact the IT Security Office. <p> 2. A disk or CD to boot the computer from before you run the tool, so that you can sanitize the whole drive. <p> Make sure that the tool you use has a feature to wipe the whole drive, not just empty space. This is the only way to make sure that all files, settings, license keys, etc. are removed. There are many tools that can perform this function, so if you are unsure about whether a particular tool is sufficient, check with the TNS Network Security Services.",Instruction

99,"FileSwitch Key Features <p> "" Key Features <p> Key Features <p> Filenames <p> Earlier versions of RISC OS only supported filenames with a length of up to ten characters. This restriction has now been removed from version 4.02 onwards. The storage medium used must, however, support long filenames for this to work. <p> Certain characters have special meanings and cannot be used within a filename. A general rule of thumb is not to use top-bit-set characters, even though FileCore can support them. <p> Meaning <p> 1 Available on FileCore-based filing systems, and any other that choose to do so. <p> Note: In RISC OS 2, wildcard matching would be specific to either file or folders, but not both. Later versions of RISC OS changed this, so that a wildcard match would act on all file objects. i.e it will try and find a match on both files and directories. <p> Directories, also known as folders on other Operating Systems, are used to group lots of files, and possible other directories together. Objects within the currently selected directory may be accessed without reference to the directory name. The names of objects must be unique within a directory. <p> The root directory of a storage medium is accessed via $ character. As $ is the root directory, there is no parent, and trying to access its parent will simply result in access to the root directory. <p> File in directories other than the root directory can be accessed by either prefixing the desired object with a directory path, or by setting the currently selected directory (CSD) and then accessing the object. <p> The use of the '.' (period) character is used to separate directories in a hierarchal structure. <p> Path <p> Meaning <p> File 'Miami' in directory Holidays within currently selected directory <p> File Attributes <p> File attributes are used to store information relating to the read/write access available. They are stored using 4 bytes (32 bits). The top 24 bits are filing system dependent, where as the lower byte has the following standardised interpretation: <p> If both bits 6 & 7 are set, then the file is super-hidden. The top 24-bits are filing system dependant. e.g. NetFS uses them to store the date. <p> Filing systems that have been created to use the features of FileCore, such as ADFS and RamFS, ignore the settings of bits 4 and 5. This is so that files can be moved freely between ADFS, RamFS and NetFS without losing information on their public read and write access. <p> Bits 2, 6 and 7 should be cleared when creating file attributes for a file, as they may be of use in future versions of RISC OS. <p> File Type <p> Unlike many other Operating Systems, RISC OS does not use file extensions as its native method of identifying the type of file. Instead, a three digit hexadecimal code, that is not part of the file name, is used instead. <p> Applications that can load and/or save a file of a specific type, usually inform the Operating System of this, and can assign a Sprite to the file type. Any files 'seen' by the Filer will then automatically display files of that type with the sprite, and if double-clicked upon, will use the application to load the file. <p> The file type information is stored as part of the Load and Execution Address fields. <p> It is possible to list the file types currently known by the computer at any given time, by using the following command. <p> For a list of commonly used file types by RISC OS, please see the File Types section. <p> Load and Execution Addresses <p> All files have in addition to their name, length, type and attributes, two 32-bit fields that are used to describe the file. These are set when the file is first created, and have two possible meanings. <p> File type and Date Stamps <p> In the case of a simple machine code program, two memory addresses are specified; the load address specifies the memory address where the file should be loaded, and the execution address specifies where the program should commence. The table below shows the format of the memory addresses: <p> Load address <p> Execution address <p> Note: The execution address must fall within the load address and load address + the length of file. <p> In addition, if the top twelve bits of the load address are all set (XXX = &FFF), then the file is assumed to be date-stamped. <p> Date Stamp <p> If the top 12 bits of the load address are all set (see Load and Execution Addresses), then the remaining bits are used to store the date/time stamp of when the file was created or last modified, and the file type. <p> The date/time stamp uses 5 bytes (unsigned) to store the value. The start value begins at 00:00:00 1st January 1900, and each successive value is in centi-seconds. The most significant byte of the date is actually stored in the least significant byte of the load address field. <p> The format of how the data is stored using each of the 32 bit fields are shown below:",Information/Explanation

The result was the Oilhead, which is an Airhead engine warped 20 years into the future. The term Oilhead comes from the fact that this engine type is oil cooled, and has oil flowing up into the heads. These engines really are drastically redesigned Airheads, with the basic layout being the real resemblance to the Airhead. Fuel injection is used instead of carburation. Engine control computers are normal on these bikes. New materials were used in the construction of the engine. The bike which goes around the engine is also different, with a greatly upgraded suspension, gearbox, clutch, appearance, etc. <p> On Board diagnostics (OBD) monitors the Electric Control Unit and system responses for errors during normal vehicle operations.

This information is transmitted to the ECU in the form of electric signals, which are converted to digital form and processed for use in controlling the various final-control elements. <p> The ECU processes the engine operating data received from the sensors. From this data, it uses the programmed ECU functions to generate the triggering signals for the fuel injector, the throttle valve actuator, and the canister-purge valve. <p> The oxidation catalytic converter operates with excess air, and employs oxidation, i.e. combustion, to convert hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into water vapor and carbon dioxide. Oxidation catalytic converters provide virtually no reduction in nitrous oxides. With fuel-injection engines, the oxygen required for oxidation is usually obtained from lean induction mixtures.

113,"The relative abundance of seagrasses in coastal waters is a key indicator of coastal and estuarine ecosystem health. Like other plants, seagrasses produce food using photosynthesis, but they require significantly more sunlight than terrestrial vegetation. The amount of light that is available to them for photosynthesis is dependent on water clarity, as is their potential range; where there is good water clarity, they can grow in deeper water. The suspended sediments, organics, and microorganisms present in seawater affect its transparency, and therefore the amount of sunlight that can reach the leaves of seagrasses. As light passes through water, its intensity decreases, and this reduction over a given distance is known as light attenuation. The main contributors to light attenuation in the water column are turbidity, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter. Light attenuation can also occur at the surface of the leaf due to the growth of algae/epiphytes. <p> Light availability: Not all wavelengths of light are equally usable for photosynthesis by seagrasses and other submerged aquatic vegetation. Generally, wavelengths in the range of 400-700 nanometers (nm) can be used. Special optical sensors have been developed to measure this photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in surface water. PAR is normally quantified as μmol photons/m2/second, which is a measure of the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), i.e., how many photons in the selected wavelengths pass through the water in a finite period of time. <p> Light falloff in water can be expressed as a light attenuation coefficient, k.

119,"In the past day or two an interesting piece of news has been making the rounds. Earlier this year the police department of the city of Seattle, Washington set up its own wireless mesh network for what many people are saying is for the purpose of keeping people under surveillance. The hardware was purchased from Aruba Networks; it is unknown whether or not the company set up the gear, or if another outfit was contracted for installation and maintenance. Each of the nodes is apparently broadcasting frames containing ESSIDs that reflect its location (such as 4th Avenue and Union Street), which is probably why some people noticed in the first place. The nodes are undoubtedly handling more traffic but without packet captures there's no way of knowing (hint hint, cough cough). The Seattle PD isn't saying much so all we have to go on is a handful of facts, knowledge of how wireless networks work, and I'm sorry to say a lot of ill-informed rumors. Let's try to sort things out as best we can. The first logical question to ask is, why use wi-fi? The best hypothesis I can come up with is that police may not be able to gain access to cellular records in what they consider a timely fashion. It is well known and understood that cellular providers track the IMEI of every cellphone that pings every tower on the cellular network at what time, and that information can be handed over to law enforcement (and other) agencies without warning. Cell companies maintain detailed inventories of their gear, maps of where every cellular tower is, and what cellular nodes are positioned where on them. Log a certain IMEI on a certain transceiver on a certain tower and you know roughly where that device is. Log the same IMEI on several transceivers on several towers and you can figure out where the device is in a lot more detail. Analyze the pattern that IMEI makes and you can plot the device's trajectory on a map. However, that often means hitting up several cellular providers at the same time and hoping that they all respond fast enough for police to find someone. That probably isn't the case. Wi-fi gear is much less expensive than cellular equipment (even if it was technically paid for by DHS and not the city of Seattle per se) and requires less bureaucratic overhead (such as FCC licensing) to deploy. In case you're curious, here are a few ways you can find out the IMEI on your mobile device. It seems plausible to state that this network could be used, in part at least to track people based upon the locations of their mobile devices. Smartphones, tablets, and MP3 players which are wireless enabled will, if they are not powered down or if wireless is not disabled, periodically probe for the presence of wireless networks they've been a part of in the past by sending association frames in the hope that the access point is still out there and will respond. Those association frames contain, among other things, the MAC address of the wireless chipset in the device, the ESSID of the access point, the supported data rates of the chipset, and any additional capabilities of the device (which may be sufficiently unique to help fingerprint a device, and later the device's owner). While this leaks some potentially identifiable data (like the name of your network at home), it could also just as easily broadcast the network name of any of the bazillion Starbucks franchises undoubtedly squatting on corners in Seattle like mushrooms after a summer rain ('attwifi', if you care). It is possible that apps installed on or semipermanently baked into the firmware of your device may broadcast additional identifying data, but without a packet capture there really isn't any way of knowing. As an aside, MAC addresses are not globally unique. You can bet your goldfish that at least ten other people on the planet have wireless devices that have the same MAC address. However, there are 2^48 possible MAC addresses, which is a big but finite number, and it is statistically unlikely that two mobile users will have the same MAC in Seattle. That seems sufficient to follow the movements of a single mobile device. Taking into account the set of ESSIDs the mobile device may try to associate with provides additional information with which to uniquely identify the owner of a device. Additionally, the wireless MACs of mobile devices are notoriously difficult to change, even if the device has been rooted. The wireless chips may not support soft MAC changes (but pretend that they do). The chips may power cycle themselves to get back to a known-good state and ask to be reconfigured without the user knowing after they've been frobbed, too. If the sensors also sniff other forms of traffic emitted by mobile devices that traffic can be characterized and used to identify the device (and then its owner) more precisely. The countermeasures for this are remarkably simple: Turn wi-fi off on your mobile device before you leave. Not only will you save the battery, but you won't be trackable via wi-fi emissions. The more paranoid are advised to pull the batteries on their mobiles entirely, if feasible. It would not surprise me one bit to discover that this network had several other uses. Radio communications in cities, especially densely packed ones are unreliable. Line of sight is key for radio, and if you don't have it (and you usually don't in big cities) there's a good chance that your signal might not get through at all. Sometimes buildings are so large that they prevent any signal at all from propagating very far. Sometimes buildings refract RF in such a way that the signal goes in the wrong direction or scatters so much that you can't make anything out. Repeaters aren't found everywhere, just in a few strategic locations, and being able to hit one with a radio isn't a sure bet. Mesh networks are, in fact, a good way of setting up reliable comms in such areas because they can work around many of those environmental obstacles. Additionally digital radios are becoming more and more popular with law enforcement agencies, and digital modes readily lend themselves to working in mesh topologies. So, I would be unsurprised to find that these units in Seattle were set up with mesh repeaters to make police radio communications more reliable. Were I solving such a problem, that's what I would do. I will concede the possibility that the wi-fi ESSIDs broadcast from the nodes could be for the purpose of remote maintenance. So much kit these days plugs into the Net so it can be managed remotely, and industrial grade wireless access devices are no exception (I've worked with too many of them over the years). Naming the device after its location is good practice in that it's self documenting; to put it another way, you don't need a Captain Midnight Secret Decoder Ring to figure out that the AP air5Pohk is at Sixth Avenue and Union, it would logically call itself 6th&Union. On the other hand, for a municipal project this is really, really bad practice. If you announce what something is and where it is, chances are somebody's going to get curious and go poking around. Like the people who wrote these news articles and then you have to contend not only with the press but with people who take it upon themselves to cause trouble for you. This possibility doesn't seem to jive with official statements to the effect of, ""Yes, this is a mesh network,"" not without more data from the field. The mailing lists of a couple of projects that I monitor (as well the ones I'm part of) have also had some discussions about these news articles. Mainly, they're concerned that the reputation of community wireless networks will be adversely impacted. The big concern is that, due to the fact that a municipal mesh project in Seattle is in a position to put an entire city under surveillance, our own projects might be thought of in the same way. Some might think that we're setting up our own surveillance network, when in fact we're not. This could hurt the adoption of community wireless networks across the country (moreso than state and local laws already have). It's also too much to tell people to look at our code and see for themselves. Let's face it, there are a lot more non-coders than there are coders, and that's just going to make people more mistrustful. The best, and really the only thing we can do is be personally active in our communities. We can't just set up a bunch of equipment and hope people are going to use it, we have to tell people about it. We have to tell people what it is, what it's for, and more importantly who it's for. They're going to come to us with their fears, especially due to news articles like that. And we're going to have to lay those fears to rest however we can.

It's forbidden,"" Michael Newdow, a Sacramento-based lawyer and physician, said in an interview Friday. <p> In a suit filed in U.S. District Court here this week, Newdow said House and Senate chaplain positions compromise a constitutional ban on government-sponsored religion and religious requirements for public servants. The suit names as defendants the Congress and other administrators. <p> Newdow's suit seeks to abolish the jobs, but makes no specific request for damages. <p> ""It's a civil rights case ... atheists are second-class citizens in this society,"" Newdow said in the telephone interview.

125,"Queens' next District Attorney is a queer, latinx Democratic Socialist who ran on a platform of ""de-carceration"" <p> Queens is the most populous district in the USA, with a population (2.359m) larger than many states; the District Attorney of Queens wields incredible power, and now that power has shifted dramatically. Like many of New York City's elected offices, the real race for DA is decided by the local Democratic Party machine, as the electorate is overwhelmingly Democrate-voting. In the case of the DA's office, the retirement (and subsequent death) of 30-year DA Dick Brown created an opportunity for one of Brown's proteges to step in and continue Brown's legacy of incarceration for minor offenses. A predictable crop of usual suspects presented themselves and one, Queens borough president Melinda Katz, got the establishment endorsement, including the blessing of Joe Crowley, the finance-friendly 'Democrat' who lost a primary race to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year. Enter Tiffany Cabán: a 31 year old, Democratic Socialist, queer, Latinx public defender in New York City who stepped up to run against Katz and the other establishment candidates. Billed as a long-shot, Cabán won the endorsements of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and ran a grassroots campaign that saw her raising money from three times as many local supporters as any of the other candidates (the other candidates still outraised Cabán, by bringing in big checks from wealthy out-of-district donors). Cabán's campaign was also popular outside of Queens. I -- along with many other leftists and members of the Democratic Socialists -- donated small sums to her. When Joe Crowley lost his primary race to AOC, the Democratic establishment claimed that it had been taken by surprise -- and denied that the upset represented any deeper structural shift in the American mood or the Democratic Party's base. They can't make such a claim this time around: the Democratic establishment pulled out all the stops to crush Cabán's campaign -- and last night, Cabán declared victory. Cabán's apparent victory is a show of force in New York for the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which worked hard for Cabán early, as well as for the Working Families Party and Real Justice PAC. Larry Krasner, the Philadelphia district attorney elected with the help of Real Justice on a similarly radical platform, was in attendance at Cabán's election night party. The most significant endorsement, however, likely came from Bronx and Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The district attorney has jurisdiction over all of Queens and its some 2.4 million residents, but Cabán put up huge margins in portions of Queens represented by Ocasio-Cortez, which is both a reflection of their aligned politics and the influence of Ocasio-Cortez. A year ago, the party establishment could claim – whether it was true or not – to have been caught off guard by Ocasio-Cortez. That rationale is absent in Tuesday's race. The eyes of the country were on Queens, and the machine was as prepared as it could be. It simply couldn't muscle out the vote. ""Take nothing for granted,"" said Daeha Ko, who spent his day canvassing for Cabán in Astoria, early in the night to a fellow supporter. By the end of the night, he might have been talking to Queens Borough President Melinda Katz.

128,"Michael Korda's Hero is the story of an epic life on a grand scale: a revealing, in-depth, and gripping biography of the extraordinary, mysterious, and dynamic Englishman whose daring exploits and romantic profile–including his blond, sun-burnished good looks and flowing white robes–made him an object of intense fascination, still famous the world over as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" <p> An Oxford scholar and archaeologist, one of five illegitimate sons of a British aristocrat who ran away with his daughters' governess, Lawrence was sent to Cairo as a young intelligence officer in 1916. He vanished into the desert in 1917 only to emerge later as one of the greatest–and certainly most colorful–figures of World War One. Though a foreigner, he played a leading and courageous part in uniting the Arab tribes to defeat the Turks, and eventually capture Damascus, transforming himself into a world-famous hero, hailed as ""the Uncrowned King of Arabia."" <p> In illuminating Lawrence's achievements, Korda digs further than anyone before him to expose the flesh-and-blood man and his contradictory nature. Here was a born leader who was utterly fearless and seemingly impervious to pain, thirst, fatigue, and danger, yet who remained shy, sensitive, mod-est, and retiring; a hero who turned down every honor and decoration offered to him, and was racked by moral guilt and doubt; a scholar and an aesthete who was also a bold and ruthless warrior; a writer of genius–the author of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, one of the greatest books ever written about war–who was the virtual inventor of modern insurgency and guerrilla warfare; a man who at the same time sought and fled the limelight, and who found in friendships, with everyone from Winston Churchill to George Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, from Nancy Astor to NoËl Coward, a substitute for sexual feelings that he rigorously–even brutally and systematically–repressed in himself. <p> As Korda shows in his brilliantly readable and formidably authoritative biography, Lawrence was not only a man of his times; he was a visionary whose accomplishments–farsighted diplomat and kingmaker, military strategist of genius, perhaps the first modern ""media celebrity"" (and one of the first victims of it), and an acclaimed writer–transcended his era. <p> Korda examines Lawrence's vision for the modern Middle East–plans that, had they been carried through, might have prevented the hatred and bloodshed that have become ubiquitous in the region. Ultimately, as this magisterial work demonstrates, Lawrence remains one of the most unique and fascinating figures of modern times, the arch-hero whose life is at once a triumph and a sacrifice and whose capacity to astonish still remains undimmed. <p> ""Few come closer to appraising the man in all his protean grandeur, and essential mystery, than Michael Korda. . . . One of the most compelling books I have read in a long time."" <p> –Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, author of A Savage War of Peace <p> ""Lawrence of Arabia, one of the great heroes of any age, has found the right biographer in Michael Korda--a keen judge of the human condition and a master story teller who can separate myth from reality without diminishing the grandeur of his subject."" <p> –Evan Thomas, author of The War Lovers <p> ""Hero is a full-scale, major event, [and] a great biography. . . . The triumph of the book is Michael Korda's brilliant, always balanced portrait of the infinitely fascinating Lawrence of Arabia, the relevance of which, now in our time, is of greater importance than ever."" <p> –David McCullough <p> ""A splendid biography about a most unusual and extraordinary individual."" <p> –Hugh Thomas, author of The Spanish Civil War <p> ""Comprehensive. . . . An accessible, textured story of one man who intimatelyknew the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."" <p> ""This magisterial biography of British soldier and adventurer T.E. Lawrence celebrates a life spent subverting authority in the most glamorous--and bizarre--ways. Korda's vivid portrait of Lawrence and his warring impulses captures the brilliance and charisma of this fascinating figure."" <p> ""Michael Korda's new biography of Lawrence of Arabia is big-hearted and provocative–a page-turner that also helps us understand how the Middle East became the confused mess it is today. Hero is a magnificent achievement."" <p> –Nathaniel Philbrick <p> ""Much has been written about him, but no one has succeeded in illuminating the quintessential Lawrence of Arabia so profoundly and so well as Michael Korda. Hero is a work of brilliance, discernment and meticulous scholarship that surely will be hailed as the gold standard."" <p> ""T.E. Lawrence is next to impossible to fix on the page. Yet Michael Korda has done so, delivering up a crowded, improbable life in a page-turning biography, every bit as rich as its protean subject.

132,"AR15 Triggers: <p> The trigger is one of the most crucial elements in achieving the highest level of accuracy from any firearm. Installation of a quality trigger will permit a light pull with little or no creep and overtravel. The trigger should break cleanly and consistently at a predetermined level usually measured in pounds. Triggers should be selected for the application in which the firearm will be used. A two pound match trigger has no place in a service rifle and a National Match Rifle will not perform well with a twelve pound mushy unpredictable trigger pull. Fortunately for AR15 owners are there is no shortage of companies manufacturing improved triggers. A quick search on the Brownells web site returned a search result of two pages of AR15 triggers. <p> AR15 triggers are available in several different installation configurations. Typically there's two approaches for replacement. The first approach is a drop-in trigger which replaces the stock trigger group with a new hammer, trigger, sear and spring. The parts are installed identically to the stock trigger. An example of this would be the Geissele Automatics. The second approach is a module that arrives fully assembled. The module contains the new trigger group parts encased in a housing pre fitted and adjusted. This module is secured by the same pins that secure the stock trigger. An example of this trigger would be the American Trigger Corporations Gold Modular Trigger. Within the two categories mentioned previously the triggers can be broken down into sub groups. These would be single stage, two stage. <p> Single stage trigger is what almost all shooters are familiar with. It is the industry standard on just about every mass produced firearm sold. A two stage trigger is common on military rifles and is supposed to be safer than a good single stage trigger. (Real firearms safety, of course, is between the ears of the shooter and has nothing to do with trigger type.) <p> Two stage trigger has a long initial movement. The shooter pulls the trigger back to take up this slack until a sharply increased resistance is felt. (That is the first stage.) Then the actual surprise break trigger pull that will fire the rifle is begun, and from that point on the two stage trigger operates like a single stage trigger which then can be broken down again into adjustable and fixed. <p> The triggers can be broken down again to a subset of adjustable and fixed. Fixed is exactly as the name implies. What you install is what you get. Adjustable triggers can be had in several configurations. Some of these triggers might just be adjustable for pull weight while other may have adjustments for pull weight, take-up, overtravel and engagement. <p> Therefore to select the appropriate type trigger decide which installation method, drop-in or modular, type of pull,single or two stage and fixed or adjustable. Note: If you have a Colt AR15 you need to determine the size of the pins in your lower receiver before selecting a new trigger. Read about the pin sizes here.",Information/Explanation
133,"Self-contained trigger/assembly installs in minutes and delivers a light, smooth, match-grade trigger pull free of grittiness, with an ultra-crisp letoff and short reset. Simply remove factory trigger and safety selector, drop in the module, reinstall selector and pins, and you're ready to shoot. Completely new engagement geometry design produces the light 3-lb. pull and crisp release without compromising reliability or safety. The two-stage design is adjustable for sear engagement and overtravel, with a first-stage take up of approximately 6 ounces, followed by actual sear movement taking up the rest of the weight, the reverse of the military two-stage AR trigger pull profile. Instead, the shooter can build force steadily, maintaining precise control and keeping his attention on the target. After release, reset travel is only .030"", less than half the .070"" typical of standard match triggers, to aid in fast, accurate follow-up shots. The sear captures the hammer at the back instead of near the pivot point to help produce the light pull and maintain safety. A second, independent, intercepting sear is positioned to block the hammer if it slips off the primary sear, as when the weapon is dropped or suffers hard impact. If the intercepting sear captures the hammer, pulling the trigger will still fire the rifle, though with a heavier pull weight. In addition, the AR Gold system uses the rifle's factory safety to positively capture the hammer, like an M1 Garand, and roll it back below the primary sear for an extra margin of safety. A lightweight aluminum housing contains the entire system and maintains the correct tolerances between the working parts. The receiver pins serve only to anchor the module in the receiver, with no effect on trigger function. Hammer and sear are wire-EDM cut from ultra-hard S7 tool steel to exceptionally tight tolerances with precision-ground surfaces for consistent contact and smoothness. <p> This remains my favorite drop-in modular trigger at any price if not my favorite trigger. <p> Upgrade that gritty ol' single stage to the LWRCI Enhanced fire control group! Plated in our proprietary nickel coating this hammer, trigger, disconnector combination provides you with one of the finest mil-spec triggers available. No grit, no slop just smooth shooting.

Set first stage pull weight by bending the legs of the trigger spring; set second-stage weight within a pre-set range by turning its adjustment screw. Another screw on the trigger lets you adjust overtravel for clean, crisp letoff. Lightweight hammer provides a 50% reduction in lock time over factory hammer, yet uses standard weight hammer spring to ensure sufficient energy transfer for reliable primer ignition, even on AR-style .308 weapons. Trigger shoe is positioned 1/8"" farther forward than factory shoe for comfortable finger position during the squeeze. All contact surfaces are wire EDM cut to exact dimensions for full, precise engagement free of unwanted play. <p> Available to fit both large (.169"") and small (.154"") pin receivers; small pin models include spare hammer pin to aid in proper fit on receivers with slightly oversized holes. Service model provides nominal 4 1/2 lb. pull weight required for NRA High Power Service Rifle competition and is also approved for CMP-sanctioned competitions. Most of the pull weight is loaded on the first stage, followed by a quick, clean second-stage break. First stage, 3.2 to 5 lb.; second stage, 1/2 to 1 1/2 lb. Match model allows a very low combined pull weight for superb trigger control on highly modified raceguns used in unlimited NRA High Power Rifle competition. Helps you shave those extra hundredths of an inch from your groups for a competitive edge. First stage, 1.3 to 3 lbs.; second stage, 4 oz. to 14 oz.

Allows a high rate of semi-auto fire; an experienced shooter can fire 30 rounds in as little as 4 1/2 seconds. First stage, 1.3 to 3 lbs.; second stage, 1/2 to 1 1/2 lbs. <p> SPECS: Steel, black finish. Available for receivers with .154"" (military, current aftermarket, older Colt) and .169"" (current Colt without sear block) hammer and trigger pins. Kit includes trigger and hammer assemblies, plus oversized hammer pin, compact pin punch, three hex wrenches, tube of GA No. 1 grease, bottle of GA No. 2 oil, and complete illustrated instructions. <p> The GEISSELE AUTOMATICS SSA TRIGGER is without question one of the best non-adjustable combat AR-15 triggers you can obtain. <p> The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) Trigger is the semi-auto only version of a select fire trigger that Geissele makes for customers in the U.S. Special Operations community. The SSA is a non-adjustable combat trigger, it is not a match trigger. The second stage break is like a carrot rather than an icicle. Suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and mid-range carbine work, the Geissele SSA is also the perfect trigger for Squad Designated Marksman (SDM) rifles. A short summary of the Geissele SSA features and advantages follows. <p> Performance Advantages for the Shooter - The Geissele SSA has a pull weight of about 4.5lb. 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable by the shooter. Trigger and hammer are made from quality tool steel. Sear surfaces are cut by a wire edm machine. Sears cut this way are very accurate and the non-directional surface finish of the wire edm gives a smooth trigger pull without the associated grittiness of directional machining marks left by a milling cutter. The initial force needed to start the disengagement of the sear surfaces is low and the force linearly increases at a low rate. This helps the shot to fall at the initial point of aim and aids in building shooter confidence in his weapons ability to put the rounds where his sight is pointing. The Geissele SSA trigger allows the shooter to slap through the trigger pull on close in shots but also set up a long range shot with a crisp trigger break. A full force hammer spring is used for quick locktime and positive ignition of all types of ammo. No lightened hammer spring is used. The hammer is lighter than a standard AR15 hammer. The lightened hammer favorably decreases locktime and increases accuracy of the weapon, especially for snap shots. <p> Advantages for the Armorer - The Geissele SSA is a simple design that is very similar to the original M16 trigger. The number of parts is identical. There are no adjustment screws to come loose. All springs are captive; they will not get lost during disassembly in the field. The entire trigger can be dissembled for cleaning (no rivets or staked parts) The trigger can be installed without removing the safety. Sear engagement is pre-set from the factory. Hammer and trigger pins are a close slip fit into nominal receiver holes so the trigger can be installed and removed with rudimentary tools. Triggers come with a slave pin for the trigger/disconnector assembly for easy installation. <p> Safety Advantages - The Geissele SSA is a 2 stage trigger where there is generous overlap of the sear surfaces which contributes to safety and a low tendency of any inadvertent movement of the trigger to discharge the weapon. The Geissele SSA has a patented pseudo sear that is almost identical to the standard AR15 single stage sear. However, this secondary sear has surfaces that never touch during normal operation. This sear prevents the hammer from falling unless the trigger is pulled. The secondary safety sear contributes to shooter confidence in dynamic/vehicle situations where a fellow shooter's muzzle may cover him. There is firm knowledge that even with the safety in the fire position the weapon can never discharge unless the trigger is pulled. Trigger timing is robust and parts have been sized to operate with a certain amount of wear to the working surfaces. The trigger is designed to operate in dusty, abrasive environments that cause wear. <p> The JARD AR-15 Trigger System come in two models, an adjustable model and a non-adjustable model. The adjustable model will let you fine turn your trigger the way you like it. The non-adjustable gives you a quick and easy upgrade to your AR. <p> Easy to install, non-adjustable, AR-15 trigger replaces the heavy, gritty-feeling, factory hammer and trigger for a smooth, clean-breaking pull that's sure to improve accuracy. Unique, single-stage design positions the sear engagement point behind the hammer for added leverage and a dependable, 3-pound pull weight. High-performance, low mass hammer reduces lock time. Precision-cut engagement surfaces are heat-treated for low wear. Requires gunsmith fitting in receivers with a sear block. <p> Single-stage trigger kit reduces pull weight to improve accuracy, without gunsmith fitting. 2, 3, and 4.5 lb. models provide the perfect pull weight for hunting or competition. Adjustments for sear engagement, trigger over-travel, disconnector engagement and safety lets you achieve a smooth, consistent trigger pull. Sear engagement point located behind the hammer improves leverage to reduce pull weight; low mass hammer gives faster lock time. Engagement surfaces are hardened and polished for a smooth, clean-breaking pull. <p> Patented trigger mechanism provides outstanding reliability, function, and performance for benchrest, varminting, and other types of precision shooting. All internal components are CNC machined from stainless steel, then heat-treated to Rc 58 for extended service life. Adjustment screws are fitted with a nylon insert to maintain your trigger settings without using thread locking compounds. Features a two-stage pull that is uniquely adjustable from above the lower receiver for first stage pull weight, second stage sear engagement, second stage pull weight, and overtravel. Models available to fit rifles with small and large hammer/trigger pins. <p> Drop-in, two-stage trigger/hammer system requires no gunsmithing to give your small-pin AR-15 a rugged, reliable trigger with a smooth, consistent pull. Ready to install as-is, straight from the package, or add two optional setscrews (included) that let you adjust take up and overtravel for a precise, match-grade pull. Setscrews are accessible from above for adjustment, and can be installed after the trigger is installed in the receiver. Grinding fixtures custom designed by CMMG engineers are used for final grinding of 10 separate contact surfaces on the trigger, disconnector, and hammer for a crisp, precise, consistent hammer release. Bronze bushings reduce friction to help ensure an ultra-smooth pull and exceptionally fast lock time. Rounded, low-mass hammer further speeds lock time and reduces wear on contact surfaces. Each trigger is function tested before it leaves the factory to ensure correct operation; works equally well in .22 LR conversions. Standard-weight trigger and hammer springs included; will work with aftermarket <p> Redesigned geometry adds a clean-breaking, smooth-feeling trigger with a light pull to any AR-15. Speedlock hammer and disconnect are EDM-cut from solid stainless, then heat treated for durability. Trigger and hammer feature improved sear angle and notch with neutral engagement for lighter letoff and minimum creep. Adjustable for weight of pull from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 lbs. <p> Drop-in, match grade trigger provides a crisp, 4 1/2to 5 lb., 2-stage, trigger pull to improve accuracy for competition or varmint shooting. Sear engagement point is located behind the hammer to reduce pull weight. Low mass hammer speeds lock time. Includes trigger and hammer pins. Fits AR-15 receivers with .154"" hammer and trigger pins. <p> Self-contained, preset trigger group replaces the heavy, factory trigger found in most commercial AR-15s and provides all the advantages of a single-stage, match-grade trigger without the need to fit and adjust multiple components. Rigid, steel trigger housing holds all the precision-fit, factory-tuned, internal components in proper alignment for easy, drop-in installation. Generous, precision-ground sear/hammer engagement surfaces offer a remarkably clean, crisp release while preserving reliable function. Each trigger assembly is tweaked at the factory to minimize take-up and over-travel, with a fixed 3 1/2lb. pull weight. Threaded sleeves provide an ultra-smooth, pivot surface for the hammer and trigger. Completely eliminates conventional trigger pins to save wear, reduce friction, and prevent trigger wobble. Two, slightly oversized center pins replace the standard, trigger/hammer pins to secure trigger in receiver; E-clips at both ends prevent pin walk. Available with Flat or traditional Curved trigger shoe. Small Pin models fit mil-spec receivers that use .154"" hammer and trigger pins, except Colt rifles with sear block. Large Pin fits rifles that use .170"" pins. CMC Triggers <p> Why settle for a sloppy trigger which can cause a good rifle to shoot badly? Now shooters can replace creepy two-stage triggers with one that is smooth and breaks crisp. The trigger is factory preset with a pull weight of either 3 or 4 pounds. Installation is quick and no adjustments are necessary, 100% true drop-in trigger. The trigger module installs using your rifle's original hammer/trigger pins and the proprietary design eliminates pin rotation and walkout. Since it was founded in 1946, Timney Manufacturing has built a reputation based on the quality of its products. Because of the precision machining and workmanship that goes into each and every Timney product they are often referred to as ""The World""s Finest Triggers"" and they are used exclusively by some of the world""s best custom gun manufacturers. <p> Drop-in trigger module fits any mil-spec small-pin AR-15 and delivers a light, superbly crisp trigger pull right from the box, with no adjustment or fine-tuning. Single-stage, 4-lb. pull has zero take-up and an ultra-clean break that's closer to a bolt action than a typical tactical rifle. Exceptionally short, positive reset gets you back on target and ready to take the next shot almost instantly. Unique hammer geometry keeps weight to a minimum for ultra-fast lock time, yet provides plenty of kick to ensure reliable ignition, even on hard military primers. A secondary rescue sear grabs the hammer if the primary sear fails when the weapon is dropped or severely jarred, meets military specifications for drop safety. CNC-machined, hardened tool steel hammer, sear, and trigger body with precision-ground contact surfaces are built to run hard in competition or combat, all contained in the rugged machined aluminum housing.

139,"The tie around Zack's neck felt like it had a strangle hold on him as he watched the private jet sent by the council start to come in for a landing. This was it. The new alpha had arrived. <p> And depending on how the man felt about the disrespectful behavior of the inner circle in not greeting him personally, Zack may or may not survive the next ten minutes. The alpha could easily kill him for the slight, and with no repercussions from the council. It was almost unheard of for an inner circle not to greet the new alpha. <p> Oh man, Zack's life would have been so much easier if his former alpha hadn't been such a dick and challenged someone bigger and stronger than him. But the guy was an idiot, and most everyone in the pack knew it. <p> Well, truthfully, Dawson was actually pretty damn smart. He was just a cruel and evil bastard that took sadistic pleasure in other people's pain. He was hated by every member of the pack except for the members of the inner circle, who were just as bad as Dawson. <p> The wheels of the private Lear Jet set down, and Zack felt his heartbeat stutter just as the wheels did when they hit the tarmac. He pulled at his collar again, feeling like the tie was tightening around his throat. <p> The jet slowed and then slowly turned toward the private hanger where Zack waited. The airport was small but so were the town and the pack. They had a mere sixty one members and were one of the smaller packs in the Northwestern Shifter Territory. And that was a lot of territory. It consisted of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. <p> Zack liked having a smaller pack. He knew each member by first name. He knew who they were related to, who was having pups, what couples were mating, and when a member needed a little extra attention. He knew the members of his pack like they were in very own family, and to him, they were. <p> There was no telling what the new alpha would do. Most alphas cleaned house when they took over a pack. Sometimes, members were banished or killed in challenges. Other times, new members were brought in. <p> Zack had lost his own parents when Dawson took over as alpha. They had been banished from the pack because they opening disagreed with the man when he outlawed their right to mate with humans. His parents had been forced to join another pack several hundred miles away. Zack had been an adult and was no allowed to leave with his parents. He hadn't even been allowed to see them in the last ten years. <p> Maybe the new alpha would change things. <p> Maybe not. <p> Zack stood up straighter and dropped his hands, clasping them behind his back, as the jet pulled to a stop in front of him. He'd be lying if he said his heart wasn't beating a litter faster and his throat wasn't drying up like the Sahara Desert as the door opened and a set of stairs lowered. <p> His throat grew even dryer when a tall man stepped out of the plane. He wasn't dressed as Zack thought a new alpha coming to meet his new pack would have been dressed. Where there should have been a suit, instead there were tight faded jeans, short sleeved black t-shirt, and black leather boots. <p> No matter how the man was dressed, though, he was still Zack's alpha and deserved his respect. ""Alpha Khenti."" Zack nodded when the man reached the bottom of the stairs. <p> The man pulled down his dark sunglasses with a single finger in the middle of the frame, and peered over the top at edge at Zack. ""Afraid not, dog boy."" <p> Zack pressed his lips tightly together. One, he didn't want to open his mouth and give credence to the insult just handed to him, even if it was to deny it. For two, Zack suddenly understood who this man was even if he had never met him before. He was an enforcer. <p> If he was a council enforcer, Zack could be in a shit load of trouble. No one crossed a council enforcer and lived to tell the tale. It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Zack nodded to the man, trying to seem as unthreatening as he possibly could. At six foot three, that was usually pretty hard to do. With this man, who stood several inches taller than he did, it wasn't so hard. <p> Zack actually felt a little intimidated. <p> ""Zack. I was sent by the Aberdeen Pack to greet the new alpha and take him back to pack territory."" <p> ""Identification?"" <p> Really? <p> The man that held his ID, looked at it for a moment, and then looked at Zack. And then he lifted his wrist to his mouth and began speaking into a bracelet that looked like it was made of black paracord, stating Zack's name and giving his description. Communication device? <p> The man apparently heard what he wanted to hear because after a moment, he nodded and then handed Zack back his license. Zack breathed a sigh of relief as he placed his ID back into his wallet and then put his wallet back into his back pocket. <p> He glanced up toward the doorway leading into the airplane, wondering where his new alpha was, and then back to the man just standing there staring at him as if he was waiting for something. <p> Zack felt like a bug on a windshield. He didn't want to be standing on the tarmac like a damn idiot. He'd rather get the new alpha home and then go off to do–pretty much anything else. <p> ""Well, boys?"" came a voice from the doorway, catching Zack's attention. ""Are we done measuring the size of our dicks?"" One perfectly manicured eyebrow lifted as a smirk crossed the small man's face. ""Because I can assure you, mine is bigger."" <p> Zack's jaw started to drop as he gazed up at the man standing at the top of the stairs. He was dressed simply enough–a white button down dress shirt and a pair of faded jeans. He even wore a pair of black biker boots like the enforcer–complete with silver wolf heads on each side. <p> Zack's jaw continued to unhinge as the man swaggered down the steps, dropping just a little further with each gentle sway of the man's hips. By the time the golden man reached the tarmac, Zack's jaw felt like it rested on his chest. <p> ""I'm Ibenré Khenti, but you may refer to me as Iben.""

140,"ANALYSIS: Brandon Allen entered his second professional game aiming to upset the Vikings to go 2-0 in the season, but he couldn't keep up his early success and finishing carrying the loss. That didn't mean he had a terrible game, though, as he finished the day with 240 yards and a touchdown on 17 completions. He threw an interception but avoided any fumble, and he was even able to add 18 extra yards on the ground by carrying the ball three times. <p> Replacing Flacco since Week 9 (with a bye in Week 10), Allen will end the season as Denver's starter given backup Drew Lock is injured. Allen is now on a two-game streak of scoring 17-plus fantasy points, something other more renown quarterbacks can't claim for them. He played a much safer game against Cleveland by throwing just 20 passes and completing 12 for 193 yards and two scores with no picks. <p> Allen has more than enough tools to exploit in the Broncos offense. The main ones to boost his fantasy value are WR Courtland Sutton and TE Noah Fant, both top-20 players at their positions, although the presence of a two-headed monster in the backfield (Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman) also helps him by keeping defenses honest against the run. <p> While Allen might keep producing in the 17 to low twenties fantasy points per week, he could turn into a safe option at the position when it comes to scoring weekly points for your team.

143,"From Ethiopianness to Ethnic Fragmentation: the Adversity of Retrospective Logic <p> A leitmotiv of ethnic politics in Ethiopia is the use of retrospective logic as an essential argument to justify its ideological stand. By this I mean the view that Menelik's southern march, which is responsible for the creation of modern Ethiopia, was nothing else but a violent destruction of preexisting nations. Such statements as ""Ethiopian colonization"" and ""the invention of Ethiopia"" as well as the description of Ethiopia as ""prison of nations and nationalities"" all signify that modern Ethiopia has emerged on the ashes of annihilated preexisting nations. <p> Far from me to deny the violent and annexing character of the southern expansion. But it is one thing to point out conquest and domination, quite another to speak of eradication of existing nations. The present ethnonationalist discourse is a product of the derailment of modern Ethiopia. It does not predate modern Ethiopia; rather, it is what modern Ethiopia has given birth owing to its socioeconomic failures. What is in play here is a thinking that throws back into the past what is but a product, thereby transfiguring the effect into a cause. <p> Unsurprisingly, objections proliferate. The Eritrean insurgency, peasant uprising in Bale, the Oromo mutiny of 1966 led by General Tadesse Birru, etc., are events that not only occurred prior to the Ethiopian revolution of 1974, but were also eminently part of the general discontent that brought down the imperial regime. Agreed, but the whole question is to know whether these uprisings, including the Eritrean one, were really triggered by nationalism or whether they were part of the general demands of the Ethiopian people for equality, justice, and economic development. The fact that the forces that destroyed the imperial regime were inspired by the then prevailing Marxist-Leninist ideology suggests that social divides and subsequent confrontations were more based on class alignments than on identity politics. The debate within the Ethiopian student movement over the question of knowing whether the primary contradiction is the contradiction between classes or nationalities is proof enough that the issue of the primacy of identity politics was by no means a settled matter. <p> To be sure, groups promoting ethnonationalist ideologies were present, but their presence was marginal for quite some time. Precisely, their influence started to grow as a result of the Derg's repressive policy and its utter inability to respond to the demands of equality and economic development. Stated otherwise, what was an issue of equality progressively grew into ethnic alignments as the new regime not only dashed all the hopes raised by the Revolution, but also aggravated all the ills of the imperial regime. Last but not least, the revolutionary regime could not even defend the integrity of the country: its shameful military defeat against armed ethnonationalist forces announced the beginning of the downward trend of Ethiopian nationhood in favor of ethnonationalist movements under the hegemonic control of the TPLF. Once in control of Ethiopia, the TPLF launched an active and deep-going ethnicization of the country, which is essentially a policy of divide and rule by which alone it could sustain its hegemonic position. <p> This is to say that ethnonationalism in Ethiopia is a product of all the above prior developments and occurrences, and not, as the retrospective logic claims, a fact that existed prior to the formation of modern Ethiopia. The correct expression is not ""the invention of Ethiopia,"" but the invention of ethnonationalist movements in Ethiopia. In so saying, my purpose is not so much to demean such movements as to assert that, as any ideologically driven movement, ethnonationalism is a construct by which elites vying for the control of power mobilize people. Still less am I implying that its posteriority to modern Ethiopia turns ethnonationalism into a negligible political nuisance. On the contrary, I am stressing the undeniable fact of changed Ethiopia to the point that any viable and lasting remedy for the ills of the country must include the ethnic factor. <p> Understanding ethnonationalism as a byproduct of modern Ethiopia is a theoretical position that has a great beneficial outomce. It views ethnonationalism as a protest rather than as a clash between incompatible or alien cultures. Protest is manageable being but a demand for reforms, however far-reaching the reforms may be. By contrast, the view that modern Ethiopia resulted from the sequestration of already existing nations has nothing to offer but the dismemberment of Ethiopia or, as the TPLF's solution demonstrates, the preservation of a political unity so structured as to ensure the hegemonic position of one ethnic group. Obviously, this last solution does nothing more than defer the inevitable dislocation of the country. <p> To sum up, the retrospective reconstruction of Ethiopian history puts us neither in the path of peace and stability nor of democracy. Stability and democracy demand concessions and compromises, neither of which is possible with the claim that today's Ethiopians actually belong to different nations.",Opinion/Argumentation
144,"Master & Margarita Book <p> Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than The Master and Margarita. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a ""translator"" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: ""Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz."") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is necessary: ""What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?"" Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. The Master and Margarita is a different book each time it is opened. --Mary ParkRead More",Opinion/Argumentation
145,"Reverend William Stryker assaults the Xavier Institute with a handpicked army of mercenaries, Nimrod's arm, and God on his side. <p> In the closing of the second story arc since M-Day, the newest mutants to walk through the halls of Xavier's mansion are faced with mounting troubles. Reverend Stryker, claiming the righteous Hand of God is at his side, has brought doom to the mansion, intent on slaughtering any and all who get in his way. Along with his cadre of assassins and mercenaries, he sneaks past the defenses and the slaughter begins. In there somewhere, the reader is ""blessed"" with a nod to the movie franchise, a shocking character change, and a subtle, but telling inference to a certain African wedding drawing near. <p> Craig Kyle and Chris Yost are doing their level best to torment these poor kids. Since they took over the writing chores the population at the Xavier Institute has been decimated. Some were shipped away, some ran away, and several were killed...by Reverend William Stryker on a mad mission from God. I can't say if Kyle and Yost are trying to make a statement about the dangers of zealousness, or if they are simply trying to tell an exciting tale; either way, they are succeeding in both endeavors. They have changed my opinion of the book. <p> Where I once read it for a simple mutant fix and to try to guess at the longevity of the characters, now I read it for the story. The New X-Men behave like teenagers, cringing at villains, crying, screaming, not understanding anything, and being as unpredictable and exciting as their hormones will allow–which oftentimes is off the scale. Not only that, but the horror of what they are going through seems real, the deaths seem permanent, and the sadness in their words and behavior is clear. It is like Laguna Beach if those kids had super powers, real problems, and were even mildly likable. <p> Paco Medina and Juan Vlasco only add fuel to the Laguna Beach comparison fire with their art. Medina pencils the students at the Xavier Institute like he sits in a high school cafeteria during lunch, watching teenagers' mannerisms, clothing, and expressions. Though at times it may be difficult to tell the age difference between the likes of Hellion and Emma Frost, the fact that the teens really do look like teens is enough to overlook some of the smaller things. And thanks to Brian Reber, the art has a bright, in your face kind of feel, which would totally and completely contradict the story in any other book, but since this sad, shocking, and sometimes disturbing tale is about teens, it fits nicely. <p> The New X-Men have grown up quite a lot in the last year. They have dealt with Decimation and death like teenagers do: dramatically, and they have looked good while doing it. If this run keeps up the pace it now has, it won't be long before not only the closing of the school, but some of these kids become Uncanny, Astonishing, or adjective-free X-Men and thousands of fans are combing back issue bins for their first appearances.",Opinion/Argumentation
146,"Part 3 Mana Pools <p> After an uneventful flight from Kariba our little plane was met at the airstrip & we were soon heading for Vundu Tented Camp on the Zambezi shore, Benson, forever vigil, soon had us in the company of a Nyala & calf. This shy antelope soon disappeared into the bush. <p> We were met at the camp with cold drinks & a refreshing towel. The two guests already at the camp would ship out the following morning leaving us as the only occupants. We were shown the facilities by Fiona & instructed on the use of the whistle in the tent. See ""Something big & Unpleasant"" under ""Jokes Related to Africa"". <p> Vundu camp is nestled in a grove of trees on the banks of the mighty Zambezi River. The five double walk-in tents have en-suite facilities, flush toilets and traditional bucket showers. The dining room is on a patch of sand under the spreading branches of a tamarind tree, just a few feet away from the river. Yet again the food & hospitality was fantastic, we wanted for nothing. <p> On our evening game drive we met our first Eland of the trip & as with Eland everywhere they soon set off at a trot away from us. We have never ever been able to take a good photograph of Eland the largest of the African antelopes but one of the shyest! They always set off at a steady trot with dewlaps swinging long before we get close! <p> Again our first drive in a new area was for Benson to read spore & discuss the areas news with whoever we met! The main reason for visiting Mana Pools was to see & photograph Painted Dog (African Hunting Dogs) we encountered a young Leopard as we returned to camp. <p> Over the Bushdrums we learned that a known den of a pack with five pups had been raided by Hyena & the new den site of the dogs was unknown. Over the next couple of days we set out by vehicle & on foot to find them & to see how many pups had survived the attack! <p> Benson had, unbeknown to us, spotted fresh activity at Aardvark holes as we had come into land & we set out on foot to take a look. He found plenty of dog spore but a day or so old, they had been checking out the area & holes, with some minor excavations, for a new den site. But, alas, we found no dogs. <p> The day before we arrived there had been heavy rain, which had dispersed the animals away from the river for food now that the water holes would be full but the promised rains had not yet arrived & they were soon returning to the river area for water. We did notice that the dry sand over the three days took on a green hue as grasses sprouted due to the shower of rain! There was plenty of bird life to console us for our lack of hunting dog. <p> We also encountered the most laid back bull elephant ever! He had found a fallen tree & the pleasure he was getting just chewing on sticks was evident from his expression. If this had been the sixties I bet he would have had flowers in his hair & used words like ""Yea Man! Cool!"" & ""Just chill out man!"" A hippie Elle! <p> In our quest for the dogs baboon alarm calls were heard, nothing spotted through the bino's so we set out on foot to investigate.....Oooops!....Nearly walked into lions laying in a gully about 20 meters in front of us, taking refuge behind a termite mound they totally ignored us. This was our last day. <p> During the afternoon siesta, I watched Benson & Rick, camp manager, fishing for Zambezi tiger fish. The national sport of Zimbabwe! Kath had found a book with a picture of wild dogs, we photographed it & showing them the screen on the camera we nearly convinced them that hunting dog had been at the camp while they were fishing! <p> The staff had brought the tea & muffins to the fire area for our tea before setting out for our last game drive, I was sat waiting for Benson & Kath when there was a commotion behind me, a large bull elephant had crept up behind me & shook his head to indicate his displeasure of me being there. Slowly I retreated to allow him right of way. Who was I to argue? Rick by now had joined me as the bull stepped into the clearing, we thought we had said goodbye to the muffins but no he stood for a while then walked past the chairs down to the river bank stopping to feed on the trees before disappearing into the bush. He disturbed not a single item as he deftly negotiated the chairs in his passing! <p> Tomorrow we would fly out to Vic Falls, Johannesburg & home. Yet again hunting dogs had eluded us. That night in camp it was discussed ""Game drive out in the hope of finding them or one last quick try?"" We decided that at first light we would have a quick last try in a different area but we would have to be back in camp early to ship out to the air strip. <p> Dawn was just a light on the horizon as we left camp, heading north out of the protected area. Upon reaching the hunting conservancy we turned back. Oh well! Next trip! <p> A herd of Impala was spotted running in the distance, we stopped, eyes straining, binoculars scanning! Then a growl or a rustle in the dry scrub! They were there! Hunting Dog with a kill! The light was still poor & the carcass was soon stripped of flesh, the dogs spooked on the arrival of a lone hyena but were soon back feasting until, with bloated bellies, as one, they left the scene at a fast trot! The speed at which they covered the ground was amazing. We followed but lost them a few times in the bush until finally we left them as they returned to their new den somewhere ahead of them & we for a hurried breakfast back at camp before our trip out. Alas there were now only three pups we assume two had been taken in the hyena attack on the old den. <p> On our return to camp I had my earliest celebratory beer of the trip at 0645 in the morning, a habit I had acquired from South Africa. Celebrate a good sighting with a beer! At any time of day! <p> After a two hour flight we sadly bade our farewells to Benson at Victoria Falls airport, a couple of hours wait at Johannesburg airport then home to the UK. Unfortunately we discovered our luggage had been tampered with & equipment stolen! A week or so later we learnt that arrests had been made for baggage thefts at Jo'burg airport. <p> Unfortunately Virgin Atlantic refused our claim, ""Not their responsibility! Read the small print!"" Two camcorders were stolen, one was old & faulty, the other new, they were in a special carrier disguised in a padlocked rucksack, we can only assume the cams were spotted & selected as they were X-rayed. Our insurance did not reimburse us the full amount even though we only claimed for the good camcorder. <p> Except for the theft, an excellent trip arranged by Ngoko Safaris. Our thanks to Fiona for her organization & to Benson for his skills & friendship. <p> All photo's were taken by ""Bridge cameras"" that cost less than £300, some editing with Video Studio or Elements 5. The Hunting Dog photographs at the kill have been enhanced because of the poor early morning light. <p> For further photos and full size images, please visit the photo gallery.",Opinion/Argumentation

156,"Genghis Tron: Revenge of the Nerds <p> With Dead Mouth Mountain, Ghengis Tron has stepped up their songwriting game <p> A bus whizzes by, then a homeless man stumbles past us as we trudge into the alley outside The Pic Pub inVancouver. Mookie Singerman and Michael Sochynsky from Genghis Tron have a few minutes before they storm the stage. <p> This grindcore-electronic-metal trio have been touring all over North America, kicking ass and taking names to support their CD Dead Mouth Mountain. With this CD they have taken their grindcore meets industrial music hybrid to the next level. And they are doing something that no one out there is doing right now. <p> Leaves and discarded newspapers whirl around in an eddy further down the alley. The cold wind makes us huddle together and get down to business. <p> Scott: Everyone loves your name. People who have no idea who you guys are immediately perk up when I tell them that I am going to see Genghis Tron tonight. It sounds like an evil Transformer, but it also fits what you do so perfectly. <p> Michael: A friend of ours actually blessed us with the name. As sad as it is, we didn't come up with it. But, it turned out to be pretty appropriate. 'Combining the brutal with the futuristic' is the lamest way to say it, but it ends up describing it pretty well. <p> Mookie: Our friend's band was a jazz funk fusion band. He's proud to have us using it. <p> Scott: A lot of people have a hard time describing your music. I remember reading 'Depeche Mode meets Death Napalm.' When I read that I was like, ""Hmmm that wouldn't sound at all like them."" I wouldn't want anyone to pick up Dead Mountain Mouth thinking they were gonna get Dave Gahan's dulcet tones. <p> Mookie: One thing we've learned over the past couple of years... Music critics can be super, super lazy ... We get some ridiculous comparisons. 'The Postal Service meets Agoraphobic Nosebleed' was my personal favorite. And, like yeah, we have these weird sort of ethereal electronic parts, and these brutal grind parts–but it goes a lot further or deeper than that. <p> Michael: The other thing I would add... I'm 23 and the other guys are 22. I've been listening to music since I was ten years old and we all have pretty diverse backgrounds... to just narrow it down to just two bands... like a synth pop band from the 80s... sure there's some of that somewhere in there... but our influences are very wide and all over the place. <p> Scott: Absolutely but it's part of the critic/reviewer job to lead people to music right? They need to be able to say, 'Ok this is Genghis Tron and you're gong to like them because they are sorta like this and this...' Thinking about it that way, how would you guys turn other people on to the Tron? <p> Michael: Uhm... It's really, really tough. I worked in a record store and the music guy asked me to write a blurb for my own CD. It was really, really hard. One band that we surprisingly don't get compared to that much, but I think is an influence on us, is The Locust who are a hardcore grind-esque band that mixes in electronic stuff. Obviously they are doing it in a different way than us, but I would say they are an immediate influence on us. Of course Nine Inch Nails is the one band the three of us grew up loving. Even though we don't really sound like them at all, the idea of combining these electronic elements into a more live... <p> Mookie [interrupts]: ...Loud rock context that's where they've really been a huge influence. Also if you listen for it, you can hear some clear musical Nine Inch Nails influence on us... <p> Scott: You can definitely hear the skeleton of NIN on Dead Mountain Mouth. I got into you guys when I read that your sound was almost an intellectual experiment of what a grindcore-electronic music hybrid could be. <p> Michael: It started more as a comical, almost tongue and cheek, and then when once we noticed the songs were turning out pretty good, we started taking a more serious approach to combining disparate genres and blending a lot different stuff from our musical backgrounds. But I wouldn't say it was just slamming two genres together. We try to be–especially with our CD Dead Mountain Mouth–a little more delicate with how we are combining things and trying to develop a more cohesive sound than just grind and metal and then electronics and then back and forth. <p> Scott: The back and forth is a really unique styling of your music. I was reading one quote from a reviewer and he was talking about a 'poignancy as you segue from on genre to another.' That's a great way of describing it. But I read interviews where the band started as an idea that you weren't sure if you were going to be able to actualize it. <p> Mookie: It was a struggle, the first year in a half, translating it to live setting, and also making it cohesive enough sound to not run out of ideas, and to be able to succeed with a full length CD. I feel we hit a brick wall in a lot of senses after the first EP was written. There wasn't much more we could do just slamming the two genres together. There was a lot of element of surprise in the EP and that's why it was so successful–people didn't know what was gonna happen next. After the EP came out and we started the new record, we realized that we had to step up our songwriting game and make it a lot more cohesive. Instead of taking as many different genres as possible and slamming together, try and take those genres and transform into something unique and new. As far as the live show goes, we spent a year and a half building up all the gear that we need to be as powerful and loud–and as sonically awesome–as all the metal bands and everything else we grew up listening to. ...It still is a struggle. We're pretty happy about here we are now, in terms of the technical stuff. <p> Scott: It's cool you guys are trying something so different. You guys don't have a drummer and it's talked about in every interview about you. And I've been looking forward to see how that will come off in the show tonight. Even electronic rock bands like Nine Inch Nails will have a drummer onstage when they're performing. <p> Michael: It's funny that you mention Nine Inch Nails, a band that we really admire, that have a lot of electronics on their album and [who are] able to convincingly to perform it live. As far as us not having a drummer, when we started the band we were writing the songs, having no idea we would ever be playing them live. We never knew that we were gonna put a record out, or tour, or anything. It wasn't really a consideration at the time. Once we stared playing live, we made an effort to make as much of it live, except for the drums, which are prerecorded and stuff. I think people are impressed we are able to pull off the other electronic elements, in terms of the synthesizers, and a lot of the weird guitar stuff is all recreated in the live setting. In addition to that, we learned the hard way we need to be as loud as a band that would have a live drummer. <p> Mookie: As far as the Nine Inch Nails thing... Trent Reznor has millions of dollars at his disposal to get a really solid hybrid set up with his drummer who can play all the electronic stuff convincingly through a live-ish kit. We are a hand-to-mouth band, so we don't have the luxury of buying thousands and thousands of dollars of equipment. And also, I feel to say that we don't have a live drummer implies that all our drums sound live–half of the drums are very electronic sounding. They sound like Boards of Canada or Squarepusher or bands like that. None of those bands have a live drummer and it would be impossible to do so. In many ways, it would be impossible for us to incorporate a live drummer completely, because half the music is based around electronic, sampled, programmed drums. And that really makes us who we are, and makes us unique. <p> Scott: It does make you guys unique, but when you think of most typical hardcore bands... They all have a drummer and that's an integral part of the energy onstage. That must be a huge hurdle for you guys–or is it? <p> Mookie: We've caught lot of flack for not having a live drummer, but we catch a lot of flack before they see us... I think we pull it off and I've heard nothing but solid things from people who've seen us. <p> Michael: At first they are suspicious, but then by the end of the show, they seem to buy it. In terms of comparing us to other hardcore bands, people at first are confused, because they often will often watch the drummer for visuals cues as to where the songs go next. Even though we're playing intense music, people often will be watching us instead, as opposed of flippin' around and movin' around. Most of the time, people are more interested to see what we are doing onstage. So there's definitely visual activity onstage, but it's different than a drummer energetically flailing his drums onstage. <p> Scott: Cool. I thought we had to address it, since you are asked it all of the time and it does make you guys unique. It's funny... Hardcore is supposedly this rebellious genre, but when you do diverge from the formula, it's like, 'Whoa! What are you doin'?' <p> Mookie: Yeah... but at the same time, right now, especially in the more brutal experimental music... It's going through an awesome period... Bands like Sunn O))), anything on Southern Lord or Hydra Head... Any number of those bands are doing really crazy, unheard of things with harder music and reaching large audiences. People are more receptive in that community to weird, untraditional things. So, it's a good time to be in our band. <p> Scott: In a lot of interviews, I've read a lot of references to you guys laughing at the 'absurdity of the music.' And it's funny... I played some tracks to a friend who is into classic heavy metal, like Scorpion, and told him that Genghis Tron is three guys from Vassar. And we just started laughing too. [Note: Vassar is a prestigious and exclusive liberal arts college in New York State.] <p> Michael: Yeah we get called nerds and dweebs in a lot of interviews ...because we look like it. <p> Mookie: A lot of people think the music we're making would come from drug-addled maniacs. When it comes down to it, we are just three dweebie dudes who are holed around a computer for 10 hours a day, programming drums. It's not like the traditional rock'n'roll super-metal lifestyle. <p> Scott: When I hear, 'Three guys from Vassar...' I'm thinking of strumming guitars and knit sweaters. <p> Mookie and Michael laugh: Yeah, there is a lot of that. <p> Michael: We have these weird sort of ethereal electronic parts, and these brutal grind parts-but it goes a lot deeper than that Vassar is in Poughkeepsie, which has a tremendously huge hardcore scene. We never played there, because we couldn't get accepted into the brotherhood-oriented hardcore scene there, because the promoters knew that were from Vassar, not from the streets of Poughkeepsie. That was frustrating, but there was much we could do about it at the time. <p> Scott: Do you still get that? <p> Michael: Even though we like to think we could appeal to any one who has a respect for experimental music or anything that's sort of out there and heavy, a lot of our fans seem to come from that hardcore background. And I am totally happy we can reach those people, the kids who like a lot of hardcore metal bands, or metalcore as they call it nowadays. <p> Scott: Well, I am glad you guys are finding an audience, because you are doing something really innovative. Dead Mouth Mountain is a challenging album, but also a very rewarding album. And that leads me to the other thing I wanted to mention... It's also very short. <p> Scott: Oh sure, but here's the thing... If we look at other metal albums, there's like big long solos, there's a lot of, for lack of a better term, wanking. <p> Mookie: A big part of the band is we try to cut all the wanking out. The first EP was 12 minutes long. It was the music we wrote, and I feel we are the closest people in the world to it–and even we couldn't imagine listening to it for mote than 12 1⁄2 minutes. When we got to writing the full length, we didn't want it to be more than half an hour, cuz we thought that would be far too much to abuse your ears with... <p> Scott: A half an hour is pretty short. <p> Mookie: It is pretty short, but there's a lot in that half an hour. <p> Michael: We made it very dense on purpose. We try to give every element a purpose; not really have any songs that were filler or have long extended parts that don't really go anywhere and things like that. For me personally, I find it a challenge to get all the way through. I really enjoy it, but it is definitely a workout of an album. I couldn't imagine it being longer than 31 minutes. <p> Mookie: The best allegory or metaphor for our music would be like a piece of really decadent, rich cake or cheese. It's not very big, and when you get it you're like, 'Aw, what the fuck?! This is not much food at all.' But then you put it in your mouth and there's a lot going on. And at the end of it, you are glad it's over. <p> Tune in to the interview show with host Scott Wood, every Monday @4:30pm on CJSF 90.1FM for more interviews with your favorite indie artists.

159,"Fiber Painting Procedure <p> Overview Optical cross-talk is a concern with closely packed fibers. An air gap between fibers is an excellent way to minimize the possibility of optical cross-talk, but for the tagger microscope's 17 closely packed fiber bundles this is not an option. Therefore, the individual fibers are painted in the section that comes in contact with the other fibers. <p> Procedures <p> Before painting the paint should be mixed with water to thin it out. It was found, through experimentation, that a 50/50 mixture by weight of white titanium dioxide paint and water yielded the best results as far as coverage and ease of use were concerned. If the paint is too thick, it will clump up in the paint gun, but if it is too thin, it will not cover the fiber well enough. <p> Open the lid to the scale. <p> On top, place an open Tupperware container and tare it out. <p> Into the plastic container squeeze 20 - 30 grams of paint. <p> Add, using a pipette, an equal weight of clean tap water. <p> Place a lid on to the container and shake vigorously until the paint and water are well mixed and smooth. <p> It was found that mixing/stirring the paint did not get rid of paint clumps, so shaking is the preferred method. <p> Pour the paint into the airbrush reservoir until it is about 3/4 full. <p> The lid should seal any unused paint in the plastic container. When the airbrush runs out of paint, it can be replenished from this source. <p> Use the airbrush painter to apply a thin, even coat of paint to the fiber. <p> Start at the scintillating end of the fiber. <p> To avoid painting the face of the scintillating fiber, butt it up against a flat surface and apply paint to the sides. Be careful not to lift the fiber from the flat surface until all of the painting is done on the scintillating fiber.",Instruction

167,"Nurse Survey <p> What and when they report <p> I interviewed* 200 hundred nurses chosen randomly (with 2 exceptions) from the list of 140,000 nurses who are registered in the state of Ohio. Among the questions I asked were: <p> 1. How long have you been a nurse? 2. Have you ever filed an incident report** with a state board or agency? <p> The 200 nurses represented approximately 3000 years of nursing. In those 3000 nurse-years not one single nurse even considered filing an incident report with a state board or agency. I know they never considered it because that is what I asked next. Frequently the response was, ""Why would I do that?"" <p> This is consistent with findings of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. In their study, medical facility employees proved the least likely source for identifying a sentinel event (less than 1% of the total cases). <p> Most of the nurses I surveyed had filed 6 or 8 incident reports internally at some time during their careers. Lawyers have taught me that reports filed internally are as good as shredded the moment they are filed. Even county prosecutors cannot get access to them. <p> Ohio has mandatory reporting laws. Unless one believes that it is possible that in 3000 years there no problems, it means that something is more important to nurses than patient safety, and mandatory reporting laws do not overcome it (see loyalty and nurse training - the ""Next"" button below links to them). <p> Michelle Long in Boise, ID, when studying to be a nurse, said that the emphasis was on avoiding liability rather than on the well-being of the patient*. The behavior and small habits that grow from that outlook result in a culture dedicated to covering up problems rather than protecting patients. <p> I wanted to know more about the nurse's situation. I wanted to know how Dr. James Burt could mutilate so many women for so many years without any of those patients being able to get anyone to listen to their complaints. Eventually there were so many of his injured patients in the community that they found each other and collectively worked to stop him. I wanted to know why the hospital didn't listen and the state medical board didn't listen and the police didn't listen (as they still don't - see Kashyap). I wanted to know how a surgeon could be so confident that no nurse would report him. I talked to nurses. I did research in a medical library and on the web. But there were questions to which I was not getting answers. So I did this survey. <p> It was a preliminary survey to prepare for a more formal one, but before I could get to it, people who wanted to shut me up filed lawsuits against me that made it so expensive and damaging to speak that I have not been able to work on it more. One of the suits was filed by a nurse who did not want anyone to know how she was taking advantage of patients. In polls year after year nurses come out on top in terms of admiration from the general public. Doctors don't lag far behind. So no one thinks to examine them beyond looking for the occasional well-intended error. And so there are no mechanisms set up to respond to crimes committed against patients by caregivers. But there are powerful mechanisms set up to protect caregivers from the patients they have victimized. <p> *I mailed questionnaires in the beginning. I telephoned in the end. <p> **An incident report is what is supposed to be filed to report accidents, problems, abuses, and other things that go wrong. If a doctor carelessly sets a syringe down facing the wrong way causing a nurse to get stuck with it, it should be the subject of an incident report. But an incident report is a political thing. For a nurse, the politics involve not just the doctors and employers, but even other nurses. Careers can be damaged by appearing to have turned on a colleague by filing a report. More than one nurse told me it even could result in dismissal. The resulting disinclination to report has a devastating impact on patient safety. We end up not knowing what the landscape looks like - what kinds of problems reoccur, and when and under what conditions. We cannot solve them if we don't know what they are. People working in healthcare carry on naively assuming things are pretty much O.K. For them it probably is. It's only the patients who are dying.",Opinion/Argumentation

171,"Transforming Urban Economies: What Could You Do With $100 Million? <p> I recently had the pleasure of sitting in on an interesting discussion sponsored by Living Cities (www.livingcities.org), a collaborative of major foundations and financial institutions focused on investing to support healthy and prosperous urban communities. Held in Detroit, the session brought together some of the nation's leading experts to address the question of what can be done to change the trajectory of an urban economy. <p> Our discussions were triggered by a desire to assess lessons learned from two fascinating experiments underway in Cleveland and Detroit. In Cleveland, the Fund for our Economic Future (http://www.futurefundneo.org) has been investing for many years in a whole series of projects designed to revitalize Northeast Ohio's economy. Detroit's efforts, under the auspices of the New Economy Initiative (http://neweconomyinitiative.cfsem.org), are somewhat newer–having been in place for about 18 months. <p> The experiences of these two projects offer a number of enlightening lessons for how to move challenged urban economies in new directions and for how foundations can play a catalytic role in supporting effective economic and workforce development efforts. A couple of important themes emerged from our discussions earlier this month. <p> Think Big: The common practice for many foundations is to provide one-time grants to worthy projects with the assumption that these pilot efforts will then evolve and generate their own outside funds. This project focus is well-meaning, but has led to too many promising projects that soon fade away after foundation investments end. In Detroit and Cleveland, investors have instead stressed their engagement over the long haul. While they are still making project-specific investments, they have committed to supporting programs with significant dollars over an extended period. <p> Convene: Many distressed urban economies suffer from a leadership vacuum as elected officials lack credibility, or, in the case of Detroit's former mayor, have faced criminal prosecution. To a certain extent, foundations can fill this vacuum by using their ""civic power"" to convene key stakeholders around the goals of economic transformation. Foundations cannot do it alone, but they can start critical conversations. <p> Connect: In both Cleveland and Detroit, investments focused on building connections across regions, across organizations, and across disciplines. Seeding networks has emerged as a critical part of this process. For example, Northeast Ohio's Jumpstart (www.jumpstartinc.org) has emerged as the region's pre-eminent entrepreneurship network. Jumpstart operates its own finance and mentoring programs, but it also operates to connect all of the region's entrepreneurs to one another and to opportunities and assets that exist elsewhere. <p> Seed Talent: It's often said that access to talent is the key success differentiator for companies and for regions. The places that attract and retain talent are more likely to be competitive in the 21st century economy. Recognizing this reality, both Cleveland and Detroit are making big investments to grow their local talent pools. In Detroit, for example, NEI hopes to fund a number of efforts to help improve workforce training in key clusters (e.g. health care, energy). It has also backed the establishment of a creative economy incubator, focused on arts and design-related entrepreneurs, located in downtown Detroit. Keep Score: Both initiatives have placed great emphasis on effective performance measurement, benchmarking, and program evaluation. Many economic developers pay lip service to research and analysis, recognizing its importance but investing few resources in the effort. Both Cleveland and Detroit are ""walking the walk,"" using this research to drive investment decisions and to make the public case for change. Leaders in both regions believe that their ability to make a compelling case with hard data has been a critical component of their success to date. <p> Very few communities are blessed with the large scale philanthropic resources found in Cleveland and Detroit. Thus, it may be difficult to put together a $100 million fund in many cities. But, nearly all urban areas do have access to foundation leadership–in the form of community foundations and other philanthropic organization. Where possible, these resources need to be better connected to the critical mission of opening up economic opportunities for the residents, families, and the entrepreneurs working in urban communities. <p> We've been remiss in updating the EntreWorks newsletter and website as a result of a new web design.

174,"[2] 'Abu'l-Hasan Mírzá, known as Shaykhu'r-Ra'ís (1847 - 1917). He was a grandson of Fath-'Alí-Sháh (reigned 1797-1834). His father, Muhammad-Taqí Mírzá, was one of the princes who rebelled against Muhammad Sháh (reigned 1834-1848), was imprisoned at Ardibíl in Ádharbáyján, but escaped to live out his life relatively undisturbed in Tabríz. 'Abu'l-Hasan's mother, Khurshíd Bagum, taught him the Bábí Faith when he was a child. When he was young, he was sickly, losing the use of one eye due to smallpox. He escaped a cholera epidemic in Tabríz, and was soon sent for tutoring in the capital with his father. He studied logic and Arabic syntax under Mullá 'Alí-i-Núrí, and advanced rapidly. His father died when 'Abu'l-Hasan was about 14, and his brothers, partly because of jealously of his gifts, forced him into military training. At the military school, he was able to continue his literary studies, determined to fulfill his father's wish that he become a cleric. After two years, he left the military school and moved to Mashhad. By this time, he had demonstrated signs of a great poetical and literary gift, and, at 17, he was inducted into the clerical ranks by Hájí Qavámu'l-Mulk. He entered the theological academy and studied Arabic, mathematics, philosophy and theology under some of the most enlightened men of the time. From Mashhad, he went on to further studies in Najaf and Karbilá in 'Iráq, then served as apprentice under Hájí Mírzá-Muhammad-Hasan, the greatest Shí'ih divine at that time, for two years. After receiving the power of issuing religious decrees and judgements from his master and making his pilgrimage to Mecca, he returned to Mashhad to preach. He quickly became beloved for his speeches at the pulpit. He was then forced to leave Mashhad for Qúchán, due to the hatred of the Ásafu'd-Dawlih of Shíráz. After one year in Qúchán, he briefly was in 'Ishqábád, before again journeying to Mecca and Medina. On his returned, he again gained great renown in Baghdád, but was encouraged by Shaykh Muhsin Khán, the Persian ambassador, to return to Persia. The favours presented to him by Nasiri'd-Din Sháh's family aroused jealousy in certain circles and he was banished Kalát-i-Nádiri. When freed, he collected his family in Mashhad and moved them back to 'Ishqábád. After touring Transoxania, and receiving gifts and high praises from Sultán 'Abdu'l-A'ziz, he finally journeyed to Beirut, Jerusalem, and finally to 'Akká, where he attained the presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá'. The Master commanded Shaykhu'r-Ra'ís to teach the Faith, but with great caution. This he did, proceeding to Burma and India, then returning to Shíráz in 1896. He again ascended the pulpit and great crowds flocked to listen to his lectures. Opposition from the 'ulamá again forced him to flee, this time to Isfahán. In that city, he resumed preaching, only to arouse the animosity of no less a figure than Shaykh Muhammad Taqíy-i-Najafí, stigmatized by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'Son of the Wolf'. However, due to his position, Shaykhu'r-Ra'ís could not be harmed.

175,"Clinical trial with alpha particle radiation treatment attempts to target and destroy cancer cells <p> On July 23, researchers in the NIH Clinical Center treated the first patient in the U.S. with radioisotope Thorium-227 for mesothelioma. The clinical trial uses Thorium-227 to target and attack a protein called mesothelin, which is highly expressed in many cancers. <p> Thorium-227 is an unstable radio-isotope that emits an alpha particle upon undergoing radioactive decay, explained Dr. Frank Lin, Chief of the Targeted Radionuclide Therapy Section at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). According to Lin, who is the clinical authorized user for the radioactive administration of the thorium at the NIH Clinical Center, most current forms of systemic radiation therapy using radionuclides emits radiation particles that are very small such as beta particles. But, the higher the mass or energy of the emitted particle, the more tumor damage can be done. Alpha particles, such as Thorium-227, are several thousand times larger than beta particles. Before now, alpha emitters have never been used to treat patients at NIH. <p> The new drug being tested (BAY 2287411) is made up of two components that are combined into one molecule. First is an antibody that allows the drug to locate and target the mesothelin protein on the cancer cells. Second is the Thorium-227, which is the ""active ingredient"" of the combined molecule. This is akin to having a smart bomb against cancer cells, where the antibody provides the targeting system, and the Thorium-227 is the radioactive payload. Once bound to tumor cells, the thorium undergoes its natural radioactive decay and exposes tumor cells to lethal doses of alpha radiation. <p> ""Our goal is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of this drug and to get preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy,"" said the study's principal investigator, Dr. Raffit Hassan, the Chief of the Thoracic and GI Malignancies Branch and Head or the Thoracic Oncology Section at NCI. ""This is a treatment for patients with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer who have failed standard therapies and provides a new treatment approach for treating their cancer."" <p> For more than two decades, Hassan and colleagues have been investigating the protein mesothelin as a target for cancer therapy. <p> ""It feels exciting thanks to the work by Frank and [the NIH Office of Research Services] Division of Radiation Safety. They have been critical in working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow us to use the Thorium radio-conjugate here. It is a very complicated process, but because of a lot of their work we were able to do it and hopefully this opens the door for Alpha therapies not only for targeting mesothelin but other cancers,"" Hassan said. <p> While it may take a number of years to conduct the trial and assess its effectiveness, Hassan said if successful, it could be used on other cancers such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.",News
176,"African LNG Exports To Get Boost From Offshore Projects <p> DAKAR, July 27 (Reuters) - Cameroon plans to begin exporting liquefied natural gas later this year using a newly designed offshore plant that analysts say could slash production costs and unlock African reserves not previously considered economically viable. <p> West and Central Africa's Gulf of Guinea has seen a wave of new oil and gas exploration, particularly since Tullow Oil discovered Ghana's huge Jubilee gas field in 2007. But the cost of pipelines and onshore liquefaction facilities means that relatively few gas finds have been developed. <p> However, a new technology has the potential to boost West and Central Africa's efforts to exploit its vast gas resources by allowing smaller plants to ship gas from less accessible fields. <p> A specialised vessel owned by Golar LNG will dock offshore Cameroon's Atlantic coast in the coming weeks for testing. It will liquefy natural gas produced in nearby offshore fields for shipment directly overseas. Russia's Gazprom has the rights to ship the gas to customers in Asia, Europe or South America. <p> ""Deploying offshore liquefaction facilities bypasses some of the difficulties associated with building infrastructure onshore. Sometimes, offshore is simply easier,"" said Jean-Baptiste Bouzard, sub-Saharan analyst at Wood Mackenzie. <p> In sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Angola already export over 20 million tonnes each year (mtpa) of LNG, mainly to Europe and Asia. But those kinds of onshore facilities, which require large refrigeration units and storage tanks that take up acres of land, can be prohibitively expensive. <p> The dominance of cheap diesel and fuel oil in the region's domestic power markets also hindered the exploitation of reserves. <p> ""Demand in the region is, at present, insufficient to justify the development of such big gas reserves for domestic consumption only,"" CITAC analysts said in a report this month on LNG in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Consequently, most projects...are liquefaction units for exports."" <p> The new offshore vessels will do the same job as the onshore facilities, albeit in smaller volumes, for a fraction of the cost in infrastructure. <p> Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Congo Republic are already developing four such offshore plants. Together they are expected to cost around $6 billion, a price tag comparable to that of some single onshore facilities. <p> In Senegal, BP is also considering using similar technology to export newly-discovered gas in deep waters there. <p> The exact volumes produced by the new offshore projects is not yet clear. Cameroon's project, a joint venture between Golar, Perenco and Cameroon's state-run SNH, will produce 1.2 mtpa. <p> Together, the four planned offshore projects are unlikely to produce much more than 7 mtpa of LNG. <p> But small scale has its advantages. In a market already glutted by a 7.5 percent growth in supply last year, having the cheapest gas will help win customers. A smaller-scale plant could help keep costs down. <p> Only one other plant like the one in Cameroon currently exists. It went online in Malaysia in March, and the market will be closely watching progress in Cameroon. <p> (Additional reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic in London; Editing by Joe Bavier and Susan Thomas)",News
177,"Abu's Birth Story <p> November 9th, 2013 RaVae Erickson <p> Boo was born in eight hours. I was SO calm during labor with her-it wasn't until transition that I freaked out at all. I awoke around 6:00 with an urge to pee(nothing new by this point). When I stood up to go to the bathroom my water broke. It wasn't a huge gush, but I was certainly glad I was on my way to the bathroom anyway! I sat there for awhile and then crawled back in bed and asked Hubbin if he was ready to be a Daddy, because it was happening today. Neither of us could go back to sleep, so I got up and went to take a bath....and there I stayed until 8:15 when the contractions were only three minutes apart and lasting for 30-45 seconds. <p> We finished packing the hospital bag and I made Hubbin move some furniture around so Boo would have a place to sleep when we came home. Then we headed to the hospital. <p> Hubbin will tell you we stopped at Walgreens on the way-which is both true and untrue! We did stop at Walgreens, where we got snacks that remained untouched during labor, but it was NOT on the way since we only lived a block away from the hospital and Walgreens is five blocks away. <p> At the hospital they checked us in....and didn't believe me that I was truly even having contractions! I had to test myself to see if my water had broken-ha! It totally had! I felt so vindicated because the nurse was treating me as if I was an idiot for even thinking my water had broken. So much so, that she didn't check me during check in. <p> We got in a room, got my IV (I was group B strep positive with Boo), and then the nurse checked me.... Good Lord! Talk about some pain! Contractions were nothing until she did that! I was at a four and 90% effaced, so I asked about the tub. The filled it with water and in I went! Ah! But only for awhile, after getting in the tub contractions continued to get longer and stronger and closer together for about an hour, until the nurse came in And told me to let her know right away if I felt the urge to push.....I hadn't thought about it, but on the very next contraction it was definitely there! I told Hubbin, who told the nurse, and as all of this was happening, I hit transition! Yikes! <p> I lost it, I had no time to regain control and calm down in between contractions and I started freaking out! Hubbin did his best to calm me, but between that and the nurse telling me she needed to check me, and me not wanting to move or be checked because I knew the tub felt the best, and being checked hurt like hell (sorry, but it did!), I just lost it. They finally convinced me that I could be checked in the tub, so I said fine. She checked and I was at a nine and a half and 100% effaced. And THAT dear friends is when I really lost it! <p> By this point I had resigned myself to getting the gosh darn epidural because I could NOT, and I mean could NOT recover between contractions. This left me panicky and scared. I decided the epidural would allow me to calm down so I could push the baby out since, you know, I was already through transition! Anyway, I started bawling when she told me where I was, and both Hubbin and the nurse asked what was wrong, I practically yelled, ""that means you're not going to let me get the epidural!"" To which the nurse very sweetly responded, ""oh sweetie, we will get you the epidural right now."" And she left to go get the anesthesiologist, also known as my hero, aka, the epidural dude! <p> During the next five minutes they got me out of the tub and up to the bed, NOT my idea of a good time! The epidural dude came in and I calmly endured that process while pretending a super-long needle was not, in fact, going into my spine! Ugh! I still can't believe I let them do that! But oh! It was totally worth it! Relief came quickly, and I was able to calm down and regain my wits. <p> I was allowed to labor down for about an hour before I could really feel baby moving down low with each contraction. They got Dr Revoal and I started pushing...and pushing...and pushing, for an hour and fifteen minutes. With every push I could feel Boo moving lower, getting closer to coming out, but it wasn't painful at all until the very end, but even then it was only a tiny bit. I was allowed to push on the squatting stool until they thought she was ready to come out. I still regret not demanding being allowed to stay up there on that thing for the birth! I think I wouldn't have torn if I had...oh well, live and learn. <p> I pushed, and then she was crowning, I was so focused, so calm, working so hard, and Hubbin was talking and laughing with the Dr. I pushed and then she was here. 1:56 PM. All slimy and wet, and covered in goo, and on top of me. My very first thought was, ""this is mine."" Immediately followed with, ""this is mine! How do I take care of her?!"" <p> They let me hold her and love on her and talk to her for awhile (during which time I was given a local, and stitched up-only a few stitches and a second degree tear. You ladies with worse are my hero! I don't know how you did it!) and then they asked if they could weigh her, so they weighed and measured and vitamins K gooped her eyes before giving her back. 5lbs 9oz, 19.5 inches long. We let family know she was here! <p> Hubbin held her on the way back to me, and then we took our first family photos. I looked aweful! I looked so tired. But I treasure those pictures because they were our first family pictures. <p> I asked to pee. The nurse said she would be right back because they needed two people to help me stand the first time....she came back an hour later! I asked to pee again, and was told the same thing, she let and came back....and hour later! By this time I had not only seriously considered just getting up and going myself, but had turned to the edge of the bed and was trying to convince Hubbin to just help me! When she came back She saw this, and apologized-they had had two emergency C-sections and all staff had gone to help. And she let Hubbin help me on the side.....not that I needed help, I was totally fine walking, just not to ally fine with the grossness still oozing out of me! <p> It then took another hour before we were moved to the other section so people could see us and Boo. Our first visitors were Grammy and Grandpa followed closely by a steady stream of aunt, uncles, and cousins! Everyone commented on how tiny she was. We didn't truly know how tiny she was until the next day.... <p> The next day a steady stream of doctors and nurses visited us...all asking what I had done wrong during pregnancy to have such a low birth weight baby! I was mortified and pissed! I had done nothing wrong! Other than eat a little soft serve ice cream a few times. By the forth Doctor I had had enough of it. It still infuriates me just to think about it! <p> The following day, at 2:15, we headed home a family of three, and the real adventure began!",Opinion/Argumentation

That is, how well do students of teachers trained in one program do compared to students trained in another program? <p> Missouri researchers Koedel, Parsons, Podgursky, and Ehlert raise big questions about whether there are measurable differences across teacher training programs in MO.

Then they asked whether the average score for students from teachers in the best program was much different from the score from the bottom program. <p> At first glance, it looks like scores are quite different–implying a big difference in programs. But! Measured differences in programs are statistical estimates, meaning that even if programs all had identical results some would randomly look high and some would randomly look low. Researchers know this and adjust using estimates of the extent of the randomness. What the Missouri team did differently was to use a much more sophisticated measure of randomness. Doing so, wiped out the results.

200,"An Important Message <p> September 26th, 2011 deackychu <p> Hello everyone. <p> I'm going to take a moment to reflect on something that has happened in my community recently which has struck a very deep chord with me. Last week, on September 18th, a young 14-year-old boy committed suicide because he was bullied at school for being gay. His name was Jamey Rodemeyer. This came several months after he posted a video to the ""It Gets Better"" project to help other adolescent teens cope with their emotions by telling them that as time goes by, things will get better. <p> While I didn't know Jamey personally, nor had I ever spoken to him, I was in a similar situation when I was in high school many moons ago which is why this hit me so hard. He was vocal online with his problems and often wondered just what it would take for people to realize how much he was bullied. Sadly, he decided to take his life so that the world over would be aware of what he had endured for so long. It was a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Growing up, I too had contemplated suicide because I was confused about my sexuality. I endured torments from my peers after word had gotten out that I 'may or may not' like guys. <p> He was an ardent follower of Lady Gaga, taking to heart many lyrics from her Born this Way album. Shortly before his untimely passing, he tweeted ""Mother Monster"" with a heartfelt thanks for what she has done for him, before saying farewell. Just recently, Lady Gaga paid tribute to him in one of her performances, which was something that brought tears to my eyes. It was an selfless act on her part, which has turned many peoples' opinions towards her around. She told fans in her performance that ""bullying is for losers"". I wholeheartedly agree. However, just as much as I agree with this, I'm just as guilty for doing it in the past. I think we've all had our fair share of being bullied or being the bully. This fact is undeniable. <p> So, I'd like for people to take a moment to reach out to friends, your brothers, your sisters, your cousins... anyone who you think may be the victim of bullying, not just because they may be questioning their sexuality, but for any reason: whether they're fat, nerdy, geeky, questioning, sad, depressed, etc. This shouldn't continue. People shouldn't have to suffer. <p> Regardless of it all, every little bit helps. Whether it's just reassuring someone by letting them know you are there for them or just having a candid talk out of the blue. Together we can do our part in putting and end to all of this. Educate and reciprocate.",Opinion/Argumentation

That makes me proud that there are more people like this. <p> As you, I don't know the guy, I'm not gay/homossexual, so I can't say I know this type of bullying, but that's still no reason for me to be against them. I am a humanist, and as such, I do what I can, be it in debates with known people or in the internet, or even if I can help in a more psychological way, but to fight for more just world where everyone can be themselves, always with logic as I usually try to stay updated with some new discoveries about human behaviour or, in this case, human biology. <p> There are still a lot of irrational ""knowledge"", that caused a lot of misunderstings in the public view, like the war that came to be between christians and muslims, racism and even white supremacy/neo-nazism, the already old but just recently noticed homophoby, and people are dying, but even worst, some people like that it happens... <p> Well, not sure if it helps, but, let's try to remember, there are a lot of things about the past that are still present, like superstitions, and some of them cause these problems even today. It's important to report and be sure to fix these, or else, you can expect even worse things in the future, done by our descendants. <p> It's hard to respond to this because I never would have imagined something like this while doing my usual visits to my usual Gundam haunts. However, I want to express my admiration for you, Deacky. It takes a lot of courage to speak so openly and honestly on a platform you know will be read by a large number of people. <p> I want to tell you that I'm a high school teacher and bullying is a problem that has been going on for a very long time. It's a problem that every school district, whether it be rich or poor, mixed ethnicity or not, struggles with. The story of Jamey Rodemeyer is a story which is coming more and more common. All I can say is that the education community has taken notice and the ""powers that be"" are moving to put things into place that will prevent bullying, at the very least, prevent it from becoming the tragedy we're talking about now. <p> If Gundam has taught us anything, it's we need to strive towards tolerance and understanding, not hate and discrimination. <p> Deacky, Thanks for sharing with us, such a personal posting. The more we try to understand and open up to one another, we can one day strive to peaceful co-existence.",Forum
202,"Home > Sci-tech > Google Chrome's built-in ad blocker will go live on February 15th <p> That has changed today, though, with an official announcement revealing that Google Chrome's built-in ad blocking will launch on February 15, 2018. It's banned all full-page ad interstitials, ads that unexpectedly play sound, and flashing ads, and this week announced the Better Ads Experience Program, which provides guidelines for companies to improve users' experience with online ads. <p> Yesterday, the Coalition announced that the standard will go into full effect for all members starting January 2018. After 30 days of failure to adhere to the new standards, ads are removed. <p> In an effort to further diminish Edge's role as ""the browser you use to install Chrome"", Google has published a Chrome installer application to the Microsoft Store. A list of unacceptable ads is available here. The Ad Experience Report contains all ads that may have violated the Standards, so Google is making use of this intel to ensure that the Chrome user experience isn't tainted. <p> In fact, it appears Google will only be blocking ads on websites who have registered with the Coalition for Better Ads, and registration is voluntary and may actually carry some fees. The big change is set to happen on February 15 when Chrome removes all ads from sites with a ""failing"" status in the Ad Experience Report for over 30 days. This is also where alleged violations can be appealed by website owners. <p> The native ad blocker in Chrome will block all ads on a webpage even if a single ad doesn't follow the aforementioned standards. This extends to ads from Google's own advertising network. That said, we fully expect some teething problems in the first couple of months; at least while Google sorts out the last few bugs in the system. <p> There is no official release date yet for the final version of Chrome 64, but Google plans to bring more updates over the course of next year.

204,"Process Stability Strategies in Milling of Thin-walled Inconel 7182011In: 4th Manufacturing Engineering Society International Conference / [ed] Manufacturing Engineering Society, 2011, p. 1-8-Conference paper (Refereed) <p> Trends in Aerospace development have led to thin-walled, reduced-weight engine designs. The demands in manufacturing have forced production speeds and material removal rates (MRR) to increase. As component wall thickness gets thinner, the consequence oftentimes is an increase in chatter vibrations. This paper suggests that a correctly chosen tool-to-workpiece offset geometry may lead to a robust and chatter free process. The results show the differences in force response for three geometries while varying the height overhang of the workpiece. This is part of a concerted effort to develop a robust methodology for the prediction of chatter vibrations during milling operations of thin-walled Aerospace components. This paper gives guidelines on how to accomplish robust machining practices. It also answers the following questions: How critical is the choice of offset between tool and workpiece during milling setup? And what effects do the entry and exit of cut have on system vibrations? <p> Process Stability Strategies in Milling of Thin-walled Inconel 7182012In: The 4th Manufacturing engineering society international conference (MESIC 2011): 21–23 September 2011, Cadiz, Spain / [ed] M.

206,"Abstract <p> The 2005 consensus proposal for the classification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) presented an agreed and uniform nomenclature for HCV variants and the criteria for their assignment into genotypes and subtypes. Since its publication, the available dataset of HCV sequences has vastly expanded through advancement in nucleotide sequencing technologies and an increasing focus on the role of HCV genetic variation in disease and treatment outcomes. The current study represents a major update to the previous consensus HCV classification, incorporating additional sequence information derived from over 1,300 (near-)complete genome sequences of HCV available on public databases in May 2013. Analysis resolved several nomenclature conflicts between genotype designations and using consensus criteria created a classification of HCV into seven confirmed genotypes and 67 subtypes. There are 21 additional complete coding region sequences of unassigned subtype. The study additionally describes the development of a Webresource hosted by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that maintains and regularly updates tables of reference isolates, accession numbers, and annotated alignments (http://talk.ictvonline.org/links/hcv/hcv-classification.htm). The Flaviviridae Study Group urges those who need to check or propose new genotypes or subtypes of HCV to contact the Study Group in advance of publication to avoid nomenclature conflicts appearing in the literature. While the criteria for assigning genotypes and subtypes remain unchanged from previous consensus proposals, changes are proposed in the assignment of provisional subtypes, subtype numbering beyond ""w,"" and the nomenclature of intergenotypic recombinant. <p> This study represents an important reference point for the consensus classification of HCV variants that will be of value to researchers working in clinical and basic science fields.",Information/Explanation

208,"In 1992, Patrick Geraty founded St. Louis Composting [2]. Patrick was in the landscaping industry and was looking for a way to diversify his business. ""I was also wondering what to do with all this yard waste,"" he tells me. His solution was to recycle the dead plant matter into mulch and compost, which can then be used to enrich topsoil. <p> As his business grew, he began taking on local governments as clients. Many public spaces produce plant waste that needs to be disposed of, and cities also need mulch to cover ground in public parks. <p> Privatization can be controversial, but there are some instances where everyone agrees privatization is a smart move. Municipal mulching services seem to be one such case. <p> In 2010, the city of St. Louis contracted out its green waste disposal to St. Louis Composting. The move saved the city an estimated quarter-million dollars annually. <p> ""Privatization just made sense,"" said Greg Hayes, St. Louis's forestry commissioner. ""Antiquated equipment made our operation inefficient. It saved the city from having to invest a significant sum in new specialized machinery. St. Louis Composting is a well-capitalized, accomplished specialist that knows the business inside and out."" <p> This seems to be a common story. As a city's older machinery needs to be replaced, it makes sense to contract out with a specialist like St. Louis Composting rather than burdening a city with the purchase of expensive new machinery. <p> Patrick estimates that his company now has contracts with around 20 to 25 cities in the eastern half of Missouri. His company even handles much of the animal bedding for the St. Louis Zoo. <p> I asked Patrick about the environmental aspect of his business and he tells me that soil quality has decreased in the last 30 to 40 years.

209,"Welcome to Gamekeeping.org! <p> In this website, we will give you vital information about the profession and what it means to be a responsible and modern gamekeeper in the UK. <p> What is gamekeeping <p> Gamekeeping is a modern profession in the UK. Contrary to what you may believe, this is not a career that simply makes sport of killing wildlife. More than anything, this career is all about land management. They look after fields, hedgerows and woods – and all the wildlife thriving in it. In most cases, gamekeepers protect the land from immediate poachers and make sure that hares, pheasants, deer, partridges and grouse are able to thrive in their respective habitats in the countryside. The skills of a gamekeeper (practical, organisational, and observational skills) plays an important role in shaping and conserving the UK countryside – both the uplands and lowlands. <p> This is a profession with specific codes and practices that are patterned according to the national standards of the country. The Gamekeeping Vocation Qualification is a necessary step for anyone who want to be a licensed gamekeeper. In most cases, employed gamekeepers are required to complete land based management degrees that include the basic skills and training for the profession. <p> Gamekeeping is typically a family occupation. Modern gamekeepers usually have other members of the family who are in the same career. In fact, they are probably working as a team. A lot of the gamekeepers got their skills from relatives who practiced the same profession. The skills, training, and know-how are passed down from one generation to the other. However, an emerging number of young gamekeepers also got their training from land based management degrees that include the basic skills and training for the profession. <p> It is a strong culture among gamekeepers and even some of their hobbies can be similar. One example of these types of hobbies are board games and some online games as well. For online games the slot game Troll Hunters which can be found on VideSlots casino is good example. <p> The role of gamekeepers <p> A gamekeeper is reminiscent of the Victorian era. In the past, gamekeepers are viewed as a destroyer of wildlife. They are heartless shooters who kill animals for fun. <p> That is further from the truth for modern gamekeepers. <p> Gamekeepers are responsible for a balanced environment. They ensure that game birds and their nests are protection from crows and rats while hares can run freely in the field without being harmed by foxes. They have to make sure there is enough game in the land for sport shooting. After all, this is how they earn from their profession. <p> Among the specific responsibilities of gamekeepers include the following: <p> Cooperation with police when dealing with crimes (land and animal-related). <p> Basic knowledge and application of veterinary medicine. <p> Basic agricultural practice. <p> The gamekeeping industry plays an important role in conserving the countryside and making sure that the wildlife is managed and protected. To date, there are 5,000 gamekeepers in the UK. Combined, gamekeepers cover more of the countryside compared to the nature reserves and National Parks.",Information/Explanation

217,"Looking back 18:21 HD • Shooting an Epic in India 17:56 HD • The Funeral 13;34 HD • Madeleine Slade : An Englishwoman Abroad 9:40 HD • Director's Chair - On casting / music 7:03 <p> • The Words of Mahatma Gandhi (1:58) • The Making of Gandhi Photo Montage <p> Description: Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 multiple-Oscar winner (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Ben Kingsley) is an engrossing, reverential look at the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who introduced the doctrine of nonviolent resistance to the colonized people of India and who ultimately gained the nation its independence. Kingsley is magnificent as Gandhi as he changes over the course of the three-hour film from an insignificant lawyer to an international leader and symbol. Strong on history (the historic division between India and Pakistan, still a huge problem today, can be seen in its formative stages here) as well as character and ideas, this is a fine film. <p> The Film: <p> In the middle of this epic film there is a quiet, small scene that helps explain why GANDHI is such a remarkable experience. Mahatma Gandhi, at the height of his power and his fame, stands by the side of a lake with his wife of many years. Together, for the benefit of a visitor from the West, they reenact their marriage vows. They do it with solemnity, quiet warmth, and perhaps just a touch of shyness; they are simultaneously demonstrating an aspect of Indian culture and touching on something very personal to them both. At the end of the ceremony, Gandhi says, ""We were thirteen at the time."" He shrugs. The marriage had been arranged. Gandhi and his wife had not been in love, had not been old enough for love, and yet love had grown between them. But that is not really the point of the scene. The point, I think, comes in the quiet smile with which Gandhi says the words. At that moment we believe that he is fully and truly human, and at that moment, a turning point in the film, Gandhi declares that it is not only a historical record but a breathing, living document. This is the sort of rare epic film that spans the decades, that uses the proverbial cast of thousands, and yet follows a human thread from beginning to end: GANDHI is no more overwhelmed by the scope of its production than was Gandhi overwhelmed by all the glory of the British Empire. The movie earns comparison with two classic works by David Lean, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, in its ability to paint a strong human story on a very large canvas. The movie is a labor of love by Sir Richard Attenborough, who struggled for years to get financing for his huge but ""non-commercial"" project. Various actors were considered over the years for the all-important title role, but the actor who was finally chosen, Ben Kingsley, makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen. Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words. Apart from all its other qualities, what makes this movie special is that it was obviously made by people who believed in it.. <p> Gandhi had some incredible cinematography for its time - over 25-years ago. The Blu-ray image has impressive moments, but the muted palette softness seems an intentional factor of the original source. Because this doesn't appear as vibrant or pristinely sharp as a new film-to-hi-def does not make the presentation weak - it towers above its DVD counterpart in all areas. It is dual-layered with the 3 hour feature taking up over 43 Gig of space on the first, of two, Blu-ray discs. Daylight scenes dominate the film and the visuals can be staggering at times if not consistently reporting abilities beyond the original appearance. This Blu-ray has a nice realistic film-like feel and close-ups are highly impressive. Grain exists though not abundantly overtaking the smoothness and clarity of the image. Contrast works well with black levels and shadow detail alike and the ever setting sun creating a perfect balance within the frame. Nothing leads me to believe that this transfer is anything but and accurate high-definition presentation of a monumental epic. <p> A TrueHD track but representative of its age more than anything <p> . Some of Ravi Shankar's music dominantly comes out of the rears and the mix doesn't seem to have decent balance. I wouldn't say it is poor but it doesn't envelop the room evenly as one may have hoped. There are large crowd sounds, gunfire, trains, horses and appropriately silence that never seem to separate (even from each other) with the crispness that more modern films project in this HD track. Dialogue is clear and consistent from the center channel and there are a host of subtitle options, on both Blu-ray, (and 3 foreign language DUBs on the 1st disc) confirming this release as region FREE. <p> There are duplications from the 2-disc SD DVD with the short introduction by director, Sir Richard Attenborough, and his, sometimes drawn-out, commentary on the first disc. This also included Blu-ray bells and whistles with a 'Gandhi's Legacy picture-in-picture track' and BD-LIVE for those who wish to indulge. <p> There is a second Blu-ray disc stacked with information including 10 minutes of vintage newsreel footage of Gandhi, 20 minutes of Sir Ben Kingsley Talking About Gandhi and multiple other segments pieces, some of which are in HD, like In Search of Gandhi, Reflections on Ben, Looking Back, Shooting an Epic in India, The Funeral and much more. This is complete and covers immense production and historical ground. <p> BOTTOM LINE: Certainly a must-own film and the Blu-ray i <p> s the way to see it in your home theater. Purchasers should simply temper their expectations of an image and audio without extensive depth as neither attribute can compete as 'demonstration' material. This doesn't make the film any less impacting, educational or relevant and the Blu-ray gives the best viewing I've seen outside for a theater. For under $20, we surely recommend... <p> Gary Tooze <p> February 15th, 2009",Opinion/Argumentation

221,"Adds RIN price context. <p> Houston, 24 September (Argus) – President Donald Trump's administration will within weeks renew efforts to allow the year-round sale of higher-ethanol gasoline blends, according to multiple sources in biofuels and refining industries. <p> The administration will announce changes to allow the year-round sale of 15pc ethanol gasoline in October, according to sources familiar with the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. Exactly what they would offer US refiners and importers to support the change remained unclear and under discussion today. Strategies for quick approval of the change risk an almost certain court challenge. <p> US air quality laws restrict gasoline's Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) – a measure of how easily the fuel evaporates – in certain markets during high-demand summer months. The law included a specific waiver for gasoline with up to 10pc blends of ethanol. <p> Ethanol groups seeking greater market share have demanded EPA expand that waiver to 15pc blends. <p> Approving the waiver could ease some of the farm-country displeasure with Trump administration trade actions ahead of fall elections. Battles with China have cut off major soy and corn markets for US farmers. Agribusiness and renewable fuels companies have pushed the administration, rather than Congress, to make the change. <p> Refiners have said they would support a change – as a package with changes that reduce their costs or obligations under the program. <p> But industry representatives have repeatedly warned that any unilateral change to the waiver would head to court. Critics of the environmental consequences of the change, including US senators Peter Welch (D-Vermont) and Tom Udall (D-New Mexico) also warned that the EPA could not make such a change. <p> ""Previously, EPA has publicly concluded that it does not have the statutory authority to issue such a waiver, and the reported decision to reverse this conclusion appears to be driven by political considerations, rather than scientific or legal analysis,"" the senators said in July. ""The plain reading of the Clean Air Act and EPA's long-standing interpretation strongly suggest that EPA lacks authority to unilaterally allow year-round sales of E15."" <p> Agriculture supporters carefully targeted Pruitt, not Trump, in this year's push for the waiver. Senators and trade groups singled out the increasingly embattled administrator, casting him as interfering with presidential directions drawn from occasional Trump comments in support of the policy this year. But acting administrator Andrew Wheeler has not moved on the proposal since assuming EPA leadership in July. Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue told farmers in Iowa last month that Trump supported the change as part of a larger fuel sector bargain. <p> Increasing fuel blending would increase the number of available renewable identification numbers (RINs) needed to comply with federal fuel blending mandates called the Renewable Fuel Standard. The risk of more RINs has helped to pressure already-low prices for the credits lower. RINs associated with ethanol blending fell by 8pc to 14.5¢/RIN today, the lowest settlement since late January 2013, based on Argus assessments.",News

Mankind's widely exaggerated obsession with Cuban cigars is about to be replaced with an even finer Cuban product that goes by the name of Christina Milian. <p> Born twenty years ago to Cuban-native parents in New Jersey and raised in Waldorf, Maryland, Christina simply thrived to become the starlet that she is today. Her career in the spotlight began at a very young age when she was cast as Annie Warbucks in the theatrical musical rendition of Annie. <p> Shortly thereafter, Christina made her next big move to the Disney Channel. No, she wasn't part of that cult-like Mickey Mouse Club that has somehow spawned today's generation of pop stars, including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake. <p> Actually, she declined an offer from the club altogether. A very bold move on her part and at such a tender age, we might add. Instead, she worked as a junior journalist on Disney's Movie Surfers. Apparently, she had her sights set on bigger and better things. <p> This exposure to the world of entertainment helped inspire Christina to pursue her acting career even further. At thirteen years of age, her mother helped her pick up the pace by bringing her to California. It was there that she was able to take her next big step by appearing in a flurry of TV sitcoms. This was a huge boost for Christina as her face was now being seen on shows such as Clueless, Sister, Sister, Smart Guy, as well as portraying a recurring character on Get Real. <p> Once she found herself submerged in the small-screen acting scene, she took an even bigger leap in her career and appeared in the 1999 film The Wood, and did a voice-over for an animated character in A Bug's Life. <p> During her stint in California, she also made some prosperous connections in the music biz. After a meeting with Rodney Jerkins, he inspired her to take a stab at recording music. Lo and behold, a few years later, after a great deal of hard work and determination, Christina appeared in Ja Rule's #1 single ""Between Me and You."" At this point she had fans worldwide sit up and take notice while wondering to themselves, ""Who on earth is she and where did she come from?"" From this point on, it's been all uphill for Christina. <p> After completing her debut album, she wowed audiences far and wide as the opening act on *N Sync's stadium tour. Her album was finally released in October 2001, much to the excitement of her newfound fan base across North America. <p> With the recent release of Christina Milian, the singer has been extremely busy with touring and promotional stints. Her first music video to be released, ""A.M. to P.M.,"" has created buzz for the 20-year-old beauty. It features Christina as a rebellious teenager who cleverly sneaks out of her house in the middle of the night in order to hit the dance clubs.

B's were considered failing grades and only God knew what would happen to you if you ever brought home a C. Neither I nor my siblings cared to test out that scenario. We worked hard to live up to and exceed the expectations our parents placed on our shoulders. Life has taught me that not everyone had that same experience. In fact, I think my tough-love upbringing is becoming quite the rarity in today's world and average is unfortunately becoming the accepted norm in our touchy-feely society. <p> How different would life be without the overachievers of the world? What if Edison had decided that candlelight was good enough or the Wright brothers felt that train service could get you anywhere you needed to go in a decent amount of time? Would using a flip phone or a rotary land line be acceptable to anyone in 2016? What if Yo-Yo Ma was thrilled with learning how to play ""3 Blind Mice"" on the violin or the Fab Five USA Women's gymnastics team decided somersaults were all they needed to know and stopped practicing and training? I know I'd be miserable in a world where we decided standard-definition TV was tolerable. Admit it. You would not accept average service at a restaurant with a 3-star Michelin rating, sub-par performance from an employee, or wi-fi that only works sometimes. Why do we expect less from our children, whose success and drive will determine just how ordinary or extraordinary our future will look? <p> My students come from all walks of life: two parents, single-parent, adopted, supportive, unsupportive, present parents, nannies, etc., yet I treat them all the same. I care about them and support them, I give them the tools and information they need to be successful and I expect the very best from them. In seventeen years of teaching, I've seen many success stories. Some of my former students are doctors, lawyers, marketing executives, professional chefs, engineers, and some of the best parents to some amazing kids. While I am ""spread-my-peacock-feathers proud"" of the work ethic and dedication it took for these students to reach their goals, my favorite success stories are of those students who came to me as average Joe's, happily floating along in the middle, barely getting by and cheering when they earned a D- because they calculated just how many questions they needed to answer correctly on the final exam to pass for the year. Seeing these students reach their true potential is a beautiful sight to me. It's amazing what a little attention and confidence can do for students at this age. <p> A ""Good job!"" here or there, a pat on the back for increased effort, one great test or quiz grade leads to another, and if it doesn't, there is a new frustration they haven't felt before and never want to feel again, so they work harder the next time. As hard as we try, we don't always get the chance to instill this winning spirit in all of them during their four short years of high school. It takes some of them getting knocked around by life experiences, wanting to be a better person for that special someone, or having their first child look up to them as a motivator for success. Social media allows me to keep in touch with these late bloomers and ""like"" their later successes. It doesn't matter to me when it happens or if it happens after several failures, as long as they do realize the value of the untapped potential inside each of them. <p> Professional football, basketball, soccer--they all have championship games and VIP awards. The music industry has the Grammys and the CMA Entertainer of the Year award, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards Oscars. You can make honor roll, but you can also be the valedictorian. The Army encourages enlistees to ""Be all that you can be.""

When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.

The Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center has in fact released an official statement calling it a hoax.

Johns Hopkins did not publish the information, which often is an email attachment, nor do we endorse its contents. <p> Facts about the Message <p> The anonymous writer whoever has written this message must have used the reputed name of the Johns Hopkins institution only to gain credibility. The viral email claimed that the standard cancer therapies of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy will not work against the disease and so people should instead choose the variety of dietary guidelines prescribed. <p> Research studies in the past have shown that these traditional therapies of treating cancer do work, the evidence of which is the millions of cancer survivors around the world. It is a fact that these treatments can be associated with some side effects, and do not work in every patient, and sometimes these therapies work for awhile and then stop working. These are the types of cancers that are difficult to cure, and for this, there is ongoing cancer research around the world. <p> In their statement, the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center has discussed and clarified each and every point mentioned in the message. You can read it from the reference section below. <p> This message was not released/supported by the Johns Hopkins. Although there might be certain benefits associated with the anti-cancer dietary and lifestyle suggestions, it may not prevent or cure the cancer.

235,"Stoke City FC – March Player Of The Month Vote <p> With the two week international break that I lamented in my previous article in action, there's not much going on around Stoke City at the moment, so I though I'd use this chance to introduce something I've been considering for a while, a player of the month vote. Can anyone who reads this please post a comment at the bottom of the article with which of the options they vote for, or if it's someone else, who and why. Any feedback as to whether this is a worthwhile feature to continue with in the future would be appreciated. Thanks <p> March has been a good month for the club, seeing us pulling away from the relegation zone at the foot of the Premier League, towards the promised land of lower mid-table, which we'd all so happily accept as the result of our first season's efforts after promotion from the Championship to the Premier League. Starting in stunning fashion, with a late, late fightback to earn a 2-2 draw at high-flying Aston Villa, and ending with a vital 1-0 home victory over Middlesbrough, Stoke's record in March is pleasing, with two wins, a draw, and just a single defeat coming from the four games played in the month. <p> From the excellent comeback at Villa to the crucial win over Middlesbrough, March has been a good month for Stoke <p> Option One: James Beattie Though Beattie scored just once in march, a well-taken goal in the win against Bolton, he certainly showed his class in other ways, with several impressive performances and a superb assist for Ryan Shawcross's goal at Aston Villa. <p> Option Two: Ryan Shawcross The month culminated with an England Under 21 call-up for the young defender, and deservedly so, as he put his costly late own-goal against Portsmouth last month behind him to make several classy and commanding displays in March. He has also found his goalscoring touch at just the right time, scoring three times in the month, including the vital winner late on against Middlesbrough, having not netted for a year previously. <p> Option Three: Thomas Sorensen The Danish 'keeper was at his best with clean sheets achieved against Bolton and Middlesbrough. he did have a poor game in our loss at Everton though, making two costly mistakes, but happily this seems not to have affected his confidence. <p> Option Four: Glenn Whelan Having been a fringe player for most of the season, the Irish international seems now to have established himself in the Stoke midfield, having featured heavily in all four games in March. His strike right at the death at Villa, which was excellently taken given the highly pressured circumstances, could be seen to have kick-started our season. He also provided a clever header assist for Beattie's goal against Bolton. <p> Option Five: Andy Wilkinson Looking more and more the Premier League player with every match, Wilkinson has had another fine month, dealing well with quality wingers like Ashley Young and Stewart Downing. Already Stoke's longest serving player, aged just 24, he has also said this month that he wishes to remain at Stoke for the rest of his career. I hope he does. <p> (Visited 190 times, 1 visits today) <p> Steven Goran Erikkson",Opinion/Argumentation
236,"26 March, 2009 at 22:13 <p> Very good one-off feature VJ, and from first sight, I would be over the (blue) moon if this were to continue. Good layout and a lovely distribution of pictures amkes this article ever so readable. <p> To the serious stuff, and my vote goes for ......... ANDY WILKINSON. He has grown into his role of Premier League full-back, adding decent positional play to his undoubted willingness and audacity. Certainly one to keep an eye on for the future, and deserves this month's award. <p> On paper a center back scoring 3 in a month should win it hands down but his defensive displays have looked slightly edgy the last month. Still trade it in for the goals any day but for me performance-wise i'd have to agree with selecting Wilko. Not qite sure about the audacity of wilko though! Becoming more and more consistant and definitely tenacious and commited but he must be up there with titus bramble and brede hangeland as the least audacious player in the premier league. <p> I think Tom, given my knowledge of Steven's sometimes slightly dodgy lexical choices, he means tenacity, rather than audacity, which certainly makes more sense. Thanks for voting both. <p> You're right Little VJ about my incorrect and misguided misuese of 'audacity', an error of which I am ashamed of and deeply regret. Clutching at straws however, 'audacity' will undoubtedly derive from the Latin 'audax', meaning bold or daring. Therefore, in a slightly altered reference, it could come to pass as tenacious, but probably not!! <p> I'm going to go, with my limited knowledge of Stoke's performances in March, for Ryan Shawcross, as I saw him score on MOTD. Am I alone in thinking that Shawcross and Wilkinson look like a pair of convicts? <p> i have to go with shawcross he has become a rock for us at the back and since scoring that own goal v pompey its only made him stronger and with the added bonus of the goals he's chiping in with he has to get player of the month. GOARN RYAN!!!!! <p> A bow and a handshake to all, across the waters, from New York. From this distance (watching whenever I can) I see the value of Shawcross and Beattie. The heart goes towards someone like Wilko. And, being Irish, I have a soft spot for Whelan. In the end, however, despite the Everton howler (there was really only one), our goalkeepers never quite get the attention they deserve, and so Sorenson gets my vote. He has kept us in the running really, and brings a base, a solidity, a commanding presence, to the defence. Sometimes football, especially goalkeeping, is as much about personality as anything else, and he seems to ooze passion. It's as if he has been given a new lease on life, is thankful for it, and wants to protect the fans who literally have his back. Sorro without the w. <p> for me it's got to be ryan shawcross who is fast becoming mr reliable, he could of suffered after the own goal against portsmouth but did'nt, if anything he came back stronger and has weighed in with a couple of goals. p.s great site v.j makes for a very good read. <p> Ryan Shawcross form me. Not only has he defended so well but his goals have dragged us out of the relegation zone. The call up for the U21s was well deserved and I am sad for him that he had to withdraw – although part of me is happy that he won't pick up a worse injury on International Duty.",Forum

238,"Metal detecting on our land <p> We don't allow metal detecting on our land unless it is part of a clearly-defined archaeological project. Our metal detecting policy, and the conditions under which we might grant an Archaeological Research Agreement, are explained here. <p> These conditions apply to all Trust land, including beaches. <p> Metal detecting is a popular hobby that can help increase our understanding of the past. We work with metal detecting clubs and individuals on research projects that can help us unearth finds on our properties for future generations to appreciate and to increase our understanding of the places we look after. <p> To make sure metal detecting is carried out in a safe and responsible way we do not grant 'metal detecting licences'. We only allow metal detecting as part of a clearly-defined archaeological project supported by a Research Design which sets out, among other things, the research aims of the work and arrangements for the recording, conservation and archiving of any finds. Once the Research Design is agreed, the Trust will issue an Archaeological Research Agreement. <p> These conditions apply to everyone, whether they are members of metal detecting clubs, amateur archaeologists, students, academics, professional archaeological companies or private individuals. We take this approach as we believe it is the best way to continue to look after the special places in our care. <p> We know most metal detectorists have a genuine interest in history and archaeology, and take care to report their finds, but we need to guard against finds being removed without proper recording or archaeological supervision. All Trust land has archaeological potential and has been entrusted to our care for the benefit of everyone – when finds are taken out of context we lose a piece of the jigsaw, making it harder for us to care for our archaeology and tell the stories of our places. <p> Archaeological Research Agreements <p> These are written agreements between the National Trust and metal detectorists or other archaeological researchers that give permission to metal detect on Trust land as part of a research project. We do not allow any metal detecting on our land without an Archaeological Research Agreement, even where it's under the plough. To obtain an Agreement, applicants must work with a National Trust Archaeologist to produce their Research Design. <p> Under exceptional circumstances we might allow metal detecting as part of non-archaeological activities, for example to locate underground services or for the recovery of lost personal objects. Whatever the reason for the work, however, detecting must always be under the supervision of a Trust Archaeologist. <p> Only a National Trust Archaeologist can issue an Archaeological Research Agreement. Other members of National Trust staff, tenants and farmers are not authorised to give permission to metal detect on Trust land. <p> Please note that in Northern Ireland, as well as meeting the above requirements, applicants would also need to obtain a licence to excavate from the Historic Environment Division, Department for Communities. Holding this licence, however, does not guarantee the Trust would subsequently grant an Archaeological Research Agreement. <p> For metal detecting on Scheduled Monuments, as well as an Archaeological Research Agreement a Section 42 Licence would also be required from Historic England, or Cadw in Wales. To metal detect on a Scheduled Monument without a Section 42 Licence is a criminal offence. <p> Finds and treasure <p> All finds, with the exception of 'treasure', remain the property of the National Trust. Under the Treasure Act 1996 anything that might be considered 'treasure' must be reported to the local Coroner or Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) within 14 days. <p> What happens if I metal detect without an Archaeological Research Agreement? <p> You will be asked to leave the property and we will take action to reclaim any finds made on Trust land. We will report unauthorised metal detecting on Scheduled Monuments to the police. <p> We will always consider genuine research proposals, so if you have a specific project in mind and would like to discuss the details of your Research Design, let us know where you want to do the work and we can put you in touch with the appropriate regional Archaeologist.",Information/Explanation
239,"How many of you can sit there and say that you have plowed with a mule? Well I would say not many, but maybe a few. This story is about the day my Grandfather Brown (true name) decided along with my parents to purchase a new Ford tractor. It wasn't really new except to us. <p> The year was about 1967 and my father found a good used Ford 601 tractor to use on the farm instead of ""Bob"", our old mule. Now my grandfather had had this mule since the mid 40's and he was getting some age on him. So after some long and very intense thinking he gave his okay for the tractor. <p> So my father and mother purchase the used tractor and had it delivered to our farm some 75 miles away. Once the Ford tractor was unloaded and the truck had left my grandfather asks ""now then, how are we getting this contraption across that there creek?"". You see, we lived on the other side of a 20 feet wide creek and the only way we could get across was by walking a swinging bridge for there were no roads over to the house. We did have a fiord (creek crossing for you city slickers) that we had used with the mule and sled but the tractor was to heavy for this sandy fiord. <p> After some heavy thinking my grandfather said that there may be one (fiord/creek crossing) that we could use at our neighbors farm just about a quarter of a mile below us. After getting our neighbors okay we headed down the road on our new (really used) Ford tractor. <p> There it was, the way to the other side. So I headed our tractor into the creek crossing in fist gear not wanting to get wet myself. Suddenly the water was getting deeper and deeper and before another heartbeat our new Ford tractor was dead in the water and up to its spark plugs and this old farm boy had to wade in water up to his waist to get out himself. After about an hour of thinking what to do we finally had to call a wrecker from a nearby Ford auto dealership. They arrived and we hooked up a snatch block on the opposite side so we could at least get it on our side of the creek. <p> I guess the moral of the story is always think safety before anything when it comes to tractors. Had we had done that....we would had been plowing three days earlier with our tractor instead of draining oil, changing plugs and cleaning it up after its inaugural bath.",Opinion/Argumentation

Here, she talks about the advice and encouragement he was able to give her. <p> 'I was introduced to IntoUniversity through my school. At first, a few members of IntoUniversity came to help me and other students at my school with writing personal statements as well as choosing universities. <p> By the time you get to sixth form, you have to make a really difficult decision and answer one of the hardest questions – ""what do I want to do in the future?"" I always knew I wanted to study Medicine, but I didn't have enough confidence to pursue my career. The careers advisor at my school got me in touch directly with one of the members of staff at IntoUniversity, Robert, who has been my mentor ever since. <p> I did not know what to do as I wasn't sure I would get into Medicine with my grades. Before I knew it, Robert had answers to all of my questions. He researched possible universities that I could apply to, and not only did he guide me through the UCAS process, but also other things such as UKCAT that I had to prepare for. Robert was there every single time I needed help, even during summer holidays I could always email him and he would always reply ASAP. The most difficult part was writing a personal statement, but again it was Robert who was there ready to help. <p> Charles, a student from IntoUniversity Hackney South, and James, a Deutsche Bank volunteer, were matched together on IntoUniversity's Oxbridge Mentoring Scheme in 2011. Charles and James get on fantastically and met frequently at the Hackney South centre to receive on-to-one support advice about many different aspects of university and Charles' plans for the future; the pair also went on an IntoUniversity residential trip to Cambridge in the summer of 2011. <p> James was able to offer Charles invaluable advice on university and college life, and provided support with structuring his revision when it came to exams. Charles achieved the results he needed and began studying Law at St Catherine's College, Cambridge in September, 2011. James continued to support him with regard to settling into college and managing his workload, and the pair continued to meet when Charles was in London. <p> Even though they finished the scheme in September 2012, James and Charles still meet up once a term when Charles is back in London and speak regularly via phone, text and email. Charles has also met with students on the 2012 scheme, and we are thrilled that James hopes to volunteer again this year. <p> 'James has been a massive help to me! He's given me such great advice and has really helped me to settle into the previously unknown world of university life. <p> Without him, I don't know where I would be in life. When he came into my life, it was like a light switch being flipped in a dark room. He's even taken his time out to talk to me about future careers and has given me tons of advice on applications to investment banks for spring programmes. I honestly think that he has changed my life.' <p> Rebecca is in Year 9 and attends a secondary school in the borough of Haringey. Nobody from her family has ever attended university. <p> ""I have been coming to Academic Support at IntoUniversity Haringey North since the centre opened. I was told about it by my school and I decided to come to get help with my homework. It is a quieter environment than at home and there are more books and resources. <p> As a reward for coming to Academic Support I was matched with a mentor last year. My mentor, Clare, studied Medicine. She was very friendly and we did activities such as cooking together and chatting about my future. We also made a board game about the steps that you can take to go to university. It was great because she let me know a lot more information about university - it opened my eyes to all the opportunities open to me. <p> In the summer term I took part in the Careers in FOCUS programme and I learnt about different jobs that I could do. I went to some amazing workshops run by professionals including a lawyer, sports manager and graphic designer. I am very sporty so I also got help to research careers in sport and through this I decided that I would like to become a physiotherapist. <p> During the summer I took part in a Sports Science FOCUS Week at IntoUniversity. We did sports activities such as football and archery, and visited Brunel University to see the campus and to have a graduation. It was fun to see what you can do and it was good because one of the student ambassadors was studying physiotherapy so I found out about the different things within the course. I want to go to university now, possibly even Brunel University! <p> I love meeting new people at IntoUniversity and I have got much better at working with others as well as working independently.

243,"Limit CMS message length to allow for adequate reading time at high speeds. <p> Changeable Message Signs (CMS) are clearly an important device in aiding in the safe and efficient movement of people and goods through the transportation network. CMS is an outstanding example of ITS using computing and communications technologies to support traffic management and provide travel information directly to the audience that needs it most. While CMS have been in use for years, improving technology and a changing climate has necessitated, or provided the opportunity for, greater and more diverse uses of CMS. However, there is a balance to be struck between the variety of new uses possible for CMS with practices that are best suited to the use of these devices. CMS for the use of travel times, homeland security and AMBER Alerts are still, to varying extents, new applications for these devices. One overall theme in the document was to recognize the requirements of the motorists and respect them. Others can benefit from the experience of those that have deployed CMS by limiting the length of CMS messages to allow adequate reading time at high speeds. Based on the experiences of several states, a few lessons have emerged related to providing an adequate and reliable message length that can serve as a basis for guidelines on CMS operations: <p> Recognize the expectations of travelers when receiving information via CMS. We live in an information world and are constantly bombarded with information delivered through many different media. Consumers have come to recognize bogus information and quickly label the source of the bogus information as unreliable. To work in this environment successfully, agencies are urged to maintain CMS to keep them in top condition (no burnt out sections on CMS) so that they function properly. <p> Provide adequate information to ensure proper driver action. When providing information that you want the driver to respond to, don't just tell them what to do, but why the action is needed. An example: ""right lane closed"" versus ""right lane closed- accident ahead"" provides the driver with a sense of urgency and full understanding of the required actions. <p> Limit messages to account for restricted driver reading times. The majority of CMS are located on high speed facilities, as a result agencies need to limit the use of paging (requiring drivers to read more than one screen of information) and recognize the limitations of drivers to read and react to long messages when traveling at high speeds. Recommendations have been made that drivers require 1 second per word (not including prepositions) to read a CMS message. An Arizona State University study found that fiber optic CMS provide average legibility at 835 feet. That number is reduced to 685 feet when taking into account the loss of visibility due to the roof of the car, leaving about 6-7 seconds of reading time when traveling between 65 and 75 mph, suggesting a maximum message length of 6-7 words (not including prepositions) to provide adequate reading time to drivers. <p> Always work to build credible and useful information. The value of CMS and the messages they display significantly influences their credibility. <p> This lesson suggests that agencies should take these guidelines into consideration when designing, deploying and operating CMS to achieve optimal benefits. Optimal benefits will help achieve ITS goals that include: improved safety, mobility and customer satisfaction by providing adequate, concise messages that can be read at high speeds allowing the traveling public to make informed decisions based on reliable information. <p> Lesson Comments",Instruction

245,"Understanding <p> Effective Techniques You Can Apply To Motivate Employees To Track Time. <p> Tracking time is crucial for any company and mostly for those in charge of a business. This tool allows managers and owners to keep track of the amount of time a project takes to completion. Tracking allows for more specific numbers that can be analyzed later and these managers to make effective changes to improve productivity. Different methods can be applied to appeal to employees to track time as explained below. One of the things that you can do is to try and convince employees to value tracked time is by explaining the connection between this task and their billable hours. Mostly employees care about the amount of money they are paid for their services than other things in the company. Employees will be happy to learn that there is a way you can improve the billable hours. You need to highlight how time can track progress and help employees remain focused on finishing the project. This will help managers get optimal productivity and also can be used to the employee's advantage. The employees should know that having progress logged effectively can be used as a proof of value which means employees can use their progress sheets to prove that they deserve a promotion. Using this tool will help the reluctant workers be more productive at the workplace and use time tracking to show their progress that will earn them promotion. <p> Explain to your employees that you are not using tracked time to micromanage your team. For this tool to be effective the employees should know that the purpose of the tool is to scrutinize their progress. Employees should know that the importance of introducing this program is to highlight the efficiency of employees. You need to demonstrate to the employees how easy it is to use this program. You should do a presentation to show your employees that they can download the app and start tracking time which is easy to do. Employees should know there are different ways they can apply to track time and encourage them to start tracking time immediately. You need to inform the employees when time-sheets are due as a way of encouraging them to track time. This will motivate employees to turn up and fill the sheets, and those that are not interested may follow the rest. When the time-sheets are filled at an expected time people will move with the crowd including those may be resisting to do so. You can use this effect to your advantage since a lot of people cannot resist it. <p> You need to create a job that helps you monitor tracked tome and enforce the concept. This will give the employees someone to talk to if they are having issues adapting to this tool. Appreciate employees those that use tracked time effectively by rewarding them after a month or weekly.",Instruction

248,"Don't forget to send a computer chess program and a Macallan twenty-five-year-old single-malt Scotch bottle while you're there John! I'm really freezing my harse here! <p> I love Jacob's Ladder. I saw it when it opened at the historic Cinerama Dome and, while I and my friends knew it was something special, I distinctly remember the air of befuddlement in the packed house and knowing it would die at the box office. In retrospect it seems the last hurrah of genre film for adults. We had a pretty good run from Psycho to Angel Heart and Jacob's Ladder, but since then it's been pretty slim pickings. On a side note, I was approached a while ago about doing a remake of Jacob's Ladder. I spent the meeting trying to talk them out of the idea, but succeeded only in talking them out of hiring me. <p> I saw JACOB'S LADDER when I was too young to appreciate the nuances. It just gave me nightmares. I remember thinking ""why can't he escape!"" Every time he seems to get out, it's an illusion. Of course, I was something like 12 at the time. <p> Okay, having watched THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD for the umpteenth time, I have a complaint: is this the only print extant? It oscillates between decent, acceptable black and white to fuzzy, overly contrasted black and white. I assume these differences in quality are due to different reels, but I haven't paid particular attention to the cigarette burns to correlate the changes. I think this film is due for a serious restoration effort. <p> Dan to jmill: <p> That was a TERRIBLE print shown on TCM yesterday. Some of the scenes -- such as the ""bondage scene"" with Captain Hendry tied up while Nikki fed him whiskey -- were removed from all TV prints for decades and there were other short ""added scenes"" revived by TCM more than a decade ago, but the old DVD released years ago with those scenes intact is a MUCH higher-quality print. (Of course, playing even mediocre DVDs on a Blu-ray player ups the quality quite a bit.) I do wish that my friend Bob Harris and his partner James Katz -- the top film restoration experts in the world -- would turn their attention to ""The Thing (from Another World)"" but they've been too busy doing minor films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Vertigo"". <p> It'd be nice to have a DVD of the classic ""The Thing"" with some extras and commentary as well. But in the meantime, be assured that the horrible print you saw on TCM Saturday is not the last word. <p> I confess that I've always wanted to write a direct sequel to that movie, set in 1951, of course. The star, Ken Tobey, died a few years ago, but somewhere out there are 21st-Century actor equivalents to Tobey and the actual top-billed actor in the movie, Margaret Sheridan. (She was the best of all the brunettes in all the sci-fi-monster movies of the wonderful 1950's, and there were A LOT of brunettes in those leading female roles with giant ants, giant grasshoppers, dinosaurs from the deep, etc.. For some reason SF-horror monsters and blond female leads never really went together.) <p> I was wondering if I was crazy, or was that ""bondage scene"" a bit risqué for 1951? I never noticed it before, and now I know why: it was cut from many of the prints. <p> It's funny that you should wish to write a sequel to the film, because I have always wanted to see a sequel to BOTH versions. I've even imagined a scenario that would continue the Carpenter version from that final scene. <p> To carry on the Nyby/Hawks version, how would you revive the alien peril? I can think of a few different ways: a second spaceship frozen in the ice (if it was an invasion, wouldn't they send more than one ship?), or one of the seeds survives, either accidentally or on purpose (renegade scientist?). And would you change the alien to the Campbellian version, i.e. the take-over-your-body alien, or would you stay with the Nyby/Hawks concept? <p> Actually, the 1951 ""The Thing"" is one reason I tell people (and interviewers) to relax when they say something like ""Aren't you afraid a movie adaptation of your work wouldn't be faithful to your novel?"" I'm the first to admit that ""The Thing (from Another World)"" totally left out the most important taking-over-and-replacing-another-living-thing's-body plot, but everything John W. Campbell ever published was a simple -- HERE'S THE PROBLEM, LET'S USE OUR MINDS AND SCIENCE TO FIGURE IT OUT tale. So the story's over as soon as Macready or somebody finally gets around to sticking a hot wire in blood samples (""since each part of the creature is a whole entity unto itself and will want to survive""). It's been done to death since. <p> For 1951, the classic ""The Thing""'s view of a giant, bloodsucking carrot was frightening enough for me. (If nobody else volunteers to do a commentary for a better DVD version, I will. The heart of all scary movies is getting a character alone right before you slaughter him or her. How many of you have noticed that not a single character is ever alone in any scene or shot of the 1951 ""The Thing"". In fact, Hawkes and Nyby fashioned shots where as many as 15 characters are gathered around. (There are 14 in the scene where they're watching the disembodied hand.) Those shots are crafted and framed like classic Dutch paintings. And everytime I watch the movie, I think that it could be re-titled ""And All Heads Turn Each Time a Door Opens"". That trick is used beautifully, with the few payoff shocks being spare and powerful. <p> Mostly though, if I could write a sequel to the 1951 ""The Thing"", I'd try to catch the optimistic, humourous ""We've seen worse than this and survived"" attitude of the characters, most of whom in the foreground were in bombing raids of Germany not so long before. What's a single bloodsucking carrot (even if he is growing hundreds more of is kind in the greenhouse, using the scientists' blood for fertilizer) once you been in an 800-plane raid over Regensberg? <p> The John Carpenter version was written and made at a time when all movies popular with the young audiences had to have ""rebellious"" and anti-social obscenity-spouting characters (preferably stoned to the gills), even though that profile is exactly the kind of personality any real Antarctic research facility would screen OUT of their team. Unlike the air crew and civilians in the original film, who cooperate beautifully for their own survival (with the exception of the oily, foreign-looking Dr. Carrington . . . wearing a fur-collar city coat and hat at the north pole!), the people in the Carpenter version never really cooperate until it's too late and they've burned out or blown up any chance to survive there or escape. I don't like any of them, and while I don't demand that I LIKE a character to enjoy a book or film, I have to believe they have some inner reality, some hint of an inner life. This was a bunch of sorry-assed hairy social misfits -- more representative of a penal colony than a research station -- that any self-respecting body-stealing alien wouldn't touch with a 10-foot tentacle. <p> So, supposing Carpenter's THE THING was set in a penal colony, with a non-discerning body-stealing alien, featuring the same basic plot, would you be more forgiving? <p> DS comments: <p> No. Where do the inmates in a penal colony get all those fershtugginer flamethrowers? <p> I agree. Jacob's Ladder is one film that probably can't be done any better and a remake shouldn't be tried. I'm sorry that it cost you work, but if you're a screenwriter it may be for the best.",Forum
249,"Teenager Lynelle Cantwell Was Voted One Of The ""Ugliest Girls"" At School & Reacted In The Best Of Ways <p> It was like something out of a teen movie, where bullies in high school banded together and decided who's hot and who's not. At Holy Trinity Regional High School in Torbay, Newfoundland, a handful of students created a ranking of the ""ugliest girls"" in school, including Lynelle Cantwell . Horrifying as that sounds, it gets worse. The poll, posted on Straw Poll, invited other students to vote for the least ""pretty"" students, making the whole thing a school-wide affair. According to MTV News, Cantwell decided to take this as an opportunity to speak about self-acceptance and self-love upon hearing that she ranked fourth from the bottom, refusing to let the hurtful actions of others change the way she saw or felt about herself. <p> Cantwell took to Facebook to give her bullies a message, and the response has inspired people to the point of being shared over 5,000 times. She told BuzzFeed Canada, ""I felt hurt, like really really hurt. Not gonna lie, it tore me apart a little bit."" But instead of reacting with anger, she instead wanted to spread the knowledge of what real beauty is: Sticking up not only for the other girls that fell on the list, but for anybody else who has ever been hurt by careless words and unfeeling actions. <p> Cantell decided to list all of the beautiful parts of herself that the list-makers missed, pointing out, ""I'm funny, nice, kind, down to earth, not judgmental, accepting, helpful, and I'm super easy to talk to. That's the same for every other girl on that list that you all put down."" <p> When BuzzFeed Canada asked why she responded in that way, Cantwell answered, ""I wanted the person who posted it to know what they did doesn't affect me. I wanted to let them know they don't know me as a person, they don't know what I'm about, they're not going to bring me down by one anonymous post."" <p> This brave young woman's actions prove that even when you are hurt, you can still react with love. And even if someone tries to tear you down, it's your decision whether to fall or not. <p> To inspire you to stay strong no matter who tries to bring you down, here are three other times bullies got put back in their place through beautiful and inspiring counter arguments. <p> 1. When A Community Stuck Up For One Of Its Own <p> When Tennessee teen Kristen Layne got bullied online, her community stuck up for her in a beautiful way. When she posted on the Facebook group ""For Sale in Sumner County, TN,"" she was just hoping to sell her junior prom dress to get funds to buy a new one for senior year. But she was shocked and hurt when two male aggressors took it upon themselves to bully her, calling the smiling girl in her prom dress ""unattractive."" <p> The members of the group were horrified by the bullying, and quickly stood up in her defense, telling the men to stop, praising her for the way she handled herself, and telling her to pay no mind and that she's beautiful. On top of that, they started a GoFundMe campaign called ""Kristen's Senior Prom Dress"" and raised over $2,000. The kindness of strangers, man. <p> 2. When A Victim Chose To Educate & Not Punish <p> When recent high school graduate Gavin Joseph was beaten up by bullies for being ""weird"" and ""creepy"" because of his Asperger's Syndrome, he decided to respond in a beautifully forgiving way. Instead of pressing charges, he requested that his attackers become educated about Asperger's and do community service to help others with disabilities. <p> He wanted to get to the root of their problem – ignorance and fear – instead of punishing them, with the hopes that understanding would change their reactions towards future people they meet with disabilities. <p> 3. When The Bullied Decided To Own It <p> When 14-year-old Carleigh O'Connell found out that a couple of bullies decided to label a large cement rock as ""Carleigh's ass,"" O'Connell decided to roll with it. Instead of feeling body-conscious and down, she climbed on top of the rock in her bikini bottoms and gave a wide smile over her shoulder. <p> O'Connell told TODAY.com, ""The biggest message I want to get across is just to be strong, and that anyone who is experiencing bullying and anything like that, that they're not alone and there's people there for them – and I'm one of them."" <p> All of this goes to show that even when we feel hurt over people's mean words, we can still make something beautiful come out of it.",News
250,"Great Divide Releases Hoss and Tripel <p> Denver, CO (Aug 2009) - Great Divide Brewing Company, one of America's most acclaimed microbreweries, has spent almost all of 2009 releasing new seasonal beers, from Claymore Scotch Ale and Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout to Belgica, Double Wit and more, and on August 14, it will complete this ambitious new lineup with two unique new beers: Hoss and Tripel. <p> Hoss is based on the Märzen lagers of Germany. Rich, layered malt notes, with hints of cherry and dark fruits, dominate, while the unique addition of rye imparts a slightly earthy, spicy character. Hoss is vibrantly red-orange in color, and it features a crisp, dry finish. <p> ""Hoss is our first commercially released lager ever,"" notes Great Divide founder and president Brian Dunn. ""We wanted it to have those classic German-lager qualities--to be clean, drinkable--but we also wanted to put our own twist on it. The rye is subtle, but it gives the beer a nice jolt of liveliness and makes it unique. We think it makes a perfect beer for late summer."" <p> Hoss, which will replace Belgica in Great Divide's seasonal lineup, will be available in six-packs and on draft through October 1. It sits at a stout but still sessionable 6.4% alcohol by volume. Tripel is Great Divide's nod to the classic strong abbey ales of Belgium. Fruity yeast character dominates throughout, while a balance of sweet malt and noble hops gives way to a bit of warmth in the finish. Tripel is straw-hued and medium-bodied, and is dangerously drinkable for a beer at 9.3% alcohol by volume. ""We've really enjoyed experimenting with Belgian styles, and Tripel is our biggest, richest Belgian-style beer yet,"" says Dunn. ""The great abbey ales are a lot to live up to, but we think Tripel will stand up to the best of them; it'll send off the new seasonal series with a bang."" Tripel will be available in 22-ounce bottles and on draft through October 1. Great Divide will hold a release party for Hoss and Tripel on August 14 from 7-9 p.m. at the brewery. For $15, partygoers can get snacks and all the Hoss and Tripel they can (responsibly) drink.",Promotion

252,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 2, 2009 <p> Moss Point, MS – The brand new Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve headquarters in Moss Point, MS, may soon achieve one of the highest ratings for green construction available thanks in part to its rainwater harvesting system supplied by BRAE Complete Rainwater Solutions. <p> Working with the coastal vernacular design from the Atlanta office of Lord, Aeck & Sargent in collaboration with Studio South Architects of Pascagoula, the BRAE system allows the new research and education facility's design to use 40 percent less purified water for flushing and boat washing than it would without the BRAE rainwater harvesting design. The recently completed complex hopes to receive LEED Gold certification, confirming its commitment to the highest principles of environmentally sensitive design, construction and operation. <p> The 18,000-acre Grand Bay Reserve provides research and training to decision-makers about sensitive ecosystem management. The reserve contains several rare plant and animal species in an essential nursery habitat for coastal fish species. Its new headquarters will serve as a center for scientists and students to test, observe and document the environment of this sensitive southeastern Mississippi nature preserve. The Reserve is operated by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. <p> Jim Nicolow, the director of sustainability for Lord, Aeck & Sargent, said the firm, which has worked with BRAE on other projects, collaborated with the company to achieve design goals that would demonstrate the potential of sustainable construction. <p> With a leadership team combining 75 years of experience, BRAE offers an effective alternative to the piecemeal approach typical of many efforts to capture rainwater for landscape irrigation and other non-potable end uses like toilet flushing. By manufacturing and distributing proven systems from the rain gutter to the point of discharge, BRAE ensures full system integration with building demands to provide efficient collection and delivery with the greatest environmental protection. <p> BRAE's complete rainwater harvesting systems can be found throughout the Southeast in such prominent projects as the Home Depot Smart Home at Duke University in Durham, NC; the Cherokee Mainstream Green Home in Raleigh, NC; the North Carolina Botanical Garden; P. Allen Smith's Cottage Home Retreat in Little Rock, AR and the Old Civil Engineering building on the campus of Georgia Tech. <p> ""The installation of this system demonstrates BRAE's potential for water conservation and environmental protection in even the most challenging locations,"" said G. Edward Vangiesen III, BRAE's policy coordinator. ""We are proud to be part of this important research facility."" <p> David Ruple, manager of the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, said the installation of the rain harvesting units created great anticipation among the facility's staff. <p> ""In an effort to reflect our environmental philosophy, I feel that it is not only important to do good conservation work, but also to demonstrate how we can build and live more sustainably,"" Ruple said. ""I believe that the design and materials incorporated into our new facility will reflect that philosophy. We first had the idea of a green building in 2001 as we developed the master plan for the reserve. We were fortunate to receive the support and funding needed to build it as we envisioned. While we live in a very rainy part of the country, we feel it is important to demonstrate good water conservation practices, capturing and using that abundant rainfall on site."" <p> For more information on residential, institutional or commercial rainwater harvesting systems, visit http://www.braewater.com.",Promotion

255,"Young woman seated in a landscape with a unicorn Late 1470s <p> The style of this drawing, in which a young woman is seen pointing at a placid unicorn that she holds by a leash at her left side, indicates that it was probably produced early in Leonardo's artistic career, sometime during the late 1470s. <p> The technique of diagonal parallel hatching is not consistent and the outlines themselves are not entirely confident in their handling in comparison to later pen and ink drawings by the artist. The framing outlines around the composition suggests that while no painting exists of this subject, it seems likely that the artist intended to paint one at some point. <p> According to medieval folklore, the unicorn was a symbol of sacred and profane chastity. Leonardo's account of the mythical animal in his fables of animals that he wrote in his notebooks indicates that the symbolic meaning of this drawing is to demonstrate the maiden's chastity. The maiden was taken as analogous to the Biblical Virgin: <p> ""The unicorn...because of its intemperance, not knowing how to control itself before the delight it feels towards maidens, forgets its ferocity and wildness, and casting aside all fear it will go up to the seated maiden and sleep in her lap, and thus the hunter takes it.""",Information/Explanation
257,"Combined Sewer Overflow Control Project for Alewife Brook Area Moves Forward <p> Relief for the Alewife Brook from decades of combined sewer overflows is on the way. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) and the Cities of Cambridge and Somerville are finalizing plans for a $75 million series of projects to significantly reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) into the brook. The impacts and benefits of the project are currently in a state environmental review process with the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Unit (MEPA). MWRA and Cambridge expect to submit a Response to Comments document for MEPA review and public comment by mid-May. <p> Portions of Cambridge and Somerville are served by combined stormwater and sanitary sewer systems, common in older cities. There are eight CSO outfalls on Alewife Brook (map), which discharge untreated CSO (a mixture of wastewater and stormwater) during moderate and heavy rainfall to relieve the system and prevent sewer backups into homes, businesses, and streets. In addition, bordering communities also have separate drainage pipes that collect stormwater runoff and carry it to the brook. Discharges from CSOs and from separate stormwater pipes include bacteria and other pathogens, oxygen-demanding pollutants, solids and other contaminants. Public health officials recommend avoiding contact with the brook during and for 48 hours following rain storms, as there may be increased health risks during these periods. Contact with floodwaters should also be avoided as they may contain similar contaminants and pose associated health risks. <p> As part of a federal court order, MWRA together with the Cities of Cambridge and Somerville are implementing an ambitious CSO abatement program to minimize the impacts of these CSO discharges and reduce discharges by an estimated 84% yearly. Earlier sewer separation work and other system improvements by Cambridge and Somerville, done in the 1990's, has already allowed closure of several CSO outfalls and significantly reduced the CSO discharges to the Alewife Brook area. <p> The $75 million project consists primarily of ""sewer separation."" By removing stormwater from the combined system, sewer separation creates more room in the sewer pipes during storms, thereby reducing the amount that overflows. The newly separated stormwater is then redirected through new pipes to the Alewife Brook. Cambridge's sewer separation work will involve state-of-the-art measures to improve the quality of the stormwater flows as well as to attenuate, or dampen, the discharges to avoid any effect on Alewife Brook water levels. Flooding along Alewife Brook has long been a problem, so Cambridge has taken great care to ensure that the new stormwater outfall project will not worsen the existing flooding situation. In addition to the sewer separation work, relieving constrictions at key connection points (""hydraulic relief""), will allow more flow from the local system to get into the regional pipes, thereby reducing the overflow amounts. <p> Separating stormwater from the combined sewer system in neighborhoods east of Fresh Pond to eliminate CSO discharges from the Cambridge004 outfall (Early phases of this work were completed in 2002.) This work will ultimately include constructing a new stormwater outfall and an innovative 3.4 acre stormwater wetland to attenuate peak flows to the Little River/Alewife Brook and improve stormwater quality. <p> Separating common manholes in the CAM400 area (bounded by Alewife Brook Parkway, Whittemore and Massachusetts Avenues) to reduce CSO discharges. <p> Increasing the size of connections between local sewers and the MWRA interceptor to reduce CSO discharges. <p> Increasing the size and capacity of the Rindge Avenue siphon to reduce CSO discharges. <p> Installing mechanisms at all remaining Alewife Brook CSO outfalls to control floatable materials. <p> Under the current state variance, the MWRA, Cambridge, and Somerville are also in the process of completing their CSO planning in the Alewife/Mystic Watershed to determine if further CSO controls are affordable and cost-effective. A CSO Reassessment Plan will be completed by July 1 for public review. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the U.S. EPA are expected to make a final decision on the appropriate level of CSO control and water quality standards for the Alewife Brook after a public review process. MWRA's CSO program is also overseen by a federal judge as part of the Boston Harbor court case. MWRA, along with the CSO communities, is implementing 25 different CSO control projects along Boston Harbor and the Mystic, Charles and Neponset Rivers. <p> Final design of the Alewife project is slated to begin in 2004 and construction will take several years to complete. While the CSO project will reduce bacteria levels in the brook after rainstorms, there will continue to be significant sources of pollution in the watershed during both dry and wet weather conditions. Various community and watershed organizations are working to identify and reduce these contaminant sources, and to deal with the causes of local flooding conditions. <p> More information on on CSOs and the CSO Abatement Program is available on the MWRA website. contact MWRA at 617-788-1170 or website at www.mwra.state.ma.us or visit the Cities of Cambridge and Somerville websites at www.cambridgema.gov and www.ci.somerville.ma.us. <p> Updated information on water quality in the Alewife Brook watershed can be found at the Mystic River Watershed Association website, www.mysticriver.org and at a ""real time"" site co-sponsored by the City of Somerville at www.mysticriveronline.org.",News

269,"Why entrepreneurship? That's a good question, and one that we sometimes get here at the Albuquerque Community Foundation. Why are we so focused on funding and supporting entrepreneurs? Shouldn't we be trying to lure businesses to Albuquerque instead of encouraging business creation? Doesn't our collective insistence on growing local businesses leave out people who don't want to own a business (or frankly never even thought about it)? <p> Research shows 80% of job growth will come through small business growth and development. <p> Maybe it's the word entrepreneur. Most people think of an entrepreneur as a middle-aged man in a blue button-down shirt who has lofty goals to take over the world. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, held up as the ideals of entrepreneurship, started in garages and basements. Both were simply looking to solve a problem. Both had an idea they could provide something of value to the marketplace. Neither had a lot of money. In fact, neither had any money. And, no one wanted to fund them in the beginning because their ideas were unproven. <p> We've now learned that anyone can be an entrepreneur. The woman making jelly in her kitchen is an entrepreneur. The recent immigrant who teaches other immigrants to sew clothing is an entrepreneur. The native New Mexican growing vegetables to sell at the farmer's market is an entrepreneur. And so is the tech visionary designing a new app that makes e-commerce easier and faster. <p> What they all have in common is the desire to provide a product or service that helps people. And more often than not, these small business people won't get on ramfunding from traditional institutions – for lots of reasons. Many are poor. Some live in poverty stricken neighborhoods. They have no collateral. They don't have an education. They aren't ""good risks."" Instead, they rely on friends and family, lots of intangible business support from incubators, non-traditional lenders and now, philanthropic programs such as City Alive designing navigator programs to help guide nontraditional entrepreneurs on their path to success! <p> When we think of entrepreneurs, we should increasingly be thinking of people like Robert Herjavec, a Serbian immigrant to Canada, now known as one of the ""sharks"" on TV's Shark Tank. Watch this video interview to hear him explain how he arrived in Canada from Serbia as a small boy and without speaking the language, and the obstacles he and his family faced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95xBnPuwJ3E. <p> With drive, determination, and an entrepreneurial spirit, Herjavec now runs a world-wide business empire. More importantly, he supports other startup businesses, many created by immigrants themselves, with his own money and expertise. Read more about him, here: https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278061 <p> Our goal is to empower the makers, the doers and the dreamers in our community. Those whose fledgling businesses have the potential to grow. To create jobs. To bring vitality to our neighborhoods because they provide stable economic opportunities for themselves and others. Who are solving a need. That's why entrepreneurship is a primary focus for us. <p> Global Entrepreneur Week is coming in November, celebrating the innovators and job creators who launch startups that bring ideas to life, and drive economic growth.

270,"The lifelong learner <p> By Judianne Jayme <p> During my two years in the faculty of education, there were a few phrases that quickly lost their novelty. We heard them all the time. One particular phrase was the notion of being a ""lifelong learner."" Yes, things will always change in our field. Yes, new and more efficient ideas will always come up. Yes, we will adapt. But when you're a student, and particularly when you're itching to get out into the real world, this concept was just that: an idea. We were antsy for the real world. We were growing weary of hearing about constantly learning. We wanted to do, do, and do. We wanted to take action. <p> It didn't take long into my first year of teaching that this concept was put into practice. My first group of students used to ask me, ""You're going to another meeting?"" To tell the truth, my current group sometimes asks me this as well. ""Miss Jayme, what are you going to learn this time?"" The best part is that while my first year meetings were mandatory, the consecutive years' professional and personal development sessions have been by my own initiative. I am learning that to remain sharp, I must continuously challenge myself and push past my comfort zone. The comfort zone is cozy, but it's also a place that gets you fast-tracked to boredom and restlessness. <p> The inevitable happened in my first year of teaching. As a child, you always think you will never say things your parents tell you. When you grow up, you hear their words slip out. The same goes for my transition from student to professional. Mere months into my first year, I replied to my students' questions with, ""Well, kids, as we move through life, we need to adapt. We need to keep learning new ideas. We are, after all, lifelong learners."" I nearly cringed the first time I heard myself say it, but I knew it was true. The concept was finally put into practice. I am a lifelong learner. <p> The ability to adapt to your profession is so crucial for your growth in it. With the speed that research, technology, and information spread in our society, you have to be willing to make space in your toolbox of knowledge and ideas. You must be a learner. To sit back passively is to be left behind in this day and age. As a lifelong learner, you don't have to continuously change your beliefs or values. As a lifelong learner, you adapt your practices to accommodate new research, new information, new ideas that will help you work smarter, not harder in your field. <p> Parent tip: learn with your kids <p> A comment I receive annually comes from parents who want to help their students with certain subjects, but either do not remember the concept, or are unfamiliar with the concept the student is asking about. My advice to these parents, and to you, is to begin with a conversation with your child. Ask them what they understand about that question or idea. If you have access to books or the Internet, turn to that. Show them that you are a lifelong learner, and they will value that quality in themselves!",Opinion/Argumentation

272,"Beyond Rooms: Applying Yield Strategies to Hotel F&B Revenue <p> Hotel owners and operators have long used yield management to optimize room revenues. For instance, it's considered smart business for reservations to decline a booking for a one-night stay on Tuesday, even when a room is available, if forecasts indicate that someone else is likely to want that room for Monday through Wednesday. By rejecting the one-night stay, the hotel potentially gains two additional nights of revenue that would otherwise be lost. Hotels that employ such strategies have experienced significant gains in room revenue. And yet those same hotels often overlook other service areas that would similarly benefit from a yield management approach – in particular their food and beverage operations. <p> Yield management was pioneered in the 1980s by the airline industry, spurred by deregulation and the rise of global distribution system technology. A pricing strategy, it is based on the premise that different consumers will be willing to pay different prices for the same product. It is designed to generate the maximum possible revenue from a perishable resource – whether that resource is an airline seat or hotel room. <p> Like an airline seat or hotel room, a restaurant seat is a perishable item. For every meal period in which it sits empty or underutilized or is occupied by a low-spending vs. high-spending customer, that seat represents lost revenue that will never be recovered, no matter what. Today's business is today's and tomorrow's is tomorrow's. That's where yield management comes in. The goal of yield management is to have every seat occupied by the best possible customer at every opportunity. And an effective labor management system provides the smart staffing and scheduling, plus the key forecasting capabilities, to make that possible. <p> Prioritizing High-Revenue Versus Low-Revenue Diners <p> It's not just having any customer at the table that matters. It's having the right customer. If a customer orders a low-revenue item like coffee and Danish, his or her seat is not available for a potential customer who would have ordered a full breakfast. If that second customer declines to wait and decides to dine elsewhere, the difference in meal revenue represents lost income for the hotel. <p> On the rooms end, hotels use yield systems to determine the best customer. But they are less effective at looking at their food and beverage customer mix and tracking what those customers are buying. As a result, low-revenue customers too often tie up seats that could accommodate high-revenue customers. Poor seat utilization can also impact total revenue. For example, despite an extensive waiting line, a restaurant host seats a party of two at a table for four that has been created by pushing two two-tops together. By not separating the two-tops, a table that could have been made available to another party of two is wasted and potential revenue left unrealized.",Information/Explanation

IVF consists of the following steps: <p> Stimulation of the ovaries with the necessary pharmaceutical treatment <p> Thanks to Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis embryos with chromosomal aberrations and genetic diseases can be detected and precluded so that only the healthy ones will be transferred in the woman's uterus. The procedure is not very different from a cycle of In Vitro Fertilization with embryo transfer at the stage of blastocyst, except that it includes the biopsy of the embryos in the embryologic lab. With the process of biopsy, blastomeres (cells) from the embryos are isolated and analyzed in an appropriately trained genetic lab. <p> The training of the embryologists of our Center in the techniques of the Pre-implantation has already started since 2000 and continues until today with the most sophisticated techniques. Besides, this is also confirmed by the high success rates in many cases of thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia as well as in rare diseases like neurofibromatosis, Stargart Syndromes, XLA, etc <p> Embryo Monitoring System (Time-Lapse) <p> During the Continuous Microscopic Monitoring of the embryos special microscopic lenses are incorporated in the incubators. The embryos are placed in appropriate places in the incubators which are connected with these lenses and it is not necessary to move them outside of the incubator for monitoring as the observation of their development is done with external monitors. With the continuous and uninterrupted monitoring we receive crucial information for the development of each embryo and its implantation in cycles of In Vitro Fertilization. <p> Diagnosis & Treatment of Male infertility <p> With Micro-Insemination (ICSI) the fertilization became feasible even in cases of extreme oligo-asthenospermia. However, even when there is azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa during ejaculation) in combination with a testicle biopsy, we can achieve the birth of healthy children. <p> Formerly, we used to believe that with ICSI when the sperm parameters were particularly low there was no effect on the fertilization rate and the success of the attempt. Nevertheless, newest studies associate, in some cases, the failure of embryo implantation and the increase of the clinical miscarriage rate with the male factor. <p> Apoptosis of spermatozoa <p> Apoptosis is a natural process of cell death that all cells of a living organism go through. Infertile people, however, have a bigger rate of apoptotic spermatozoa than fertile population. When the apoptotic index is over 40% there is; a/ limited possibility of pregnancy through intrauterine insemination, b/ increased possibility of automatic miscarriage or premature termination of the embryonic development and c/ limited fertilization rate in case of an IVF process or use of the Micro-Insemination technique (ICSI). <p> Fertilization Method IMSI <p> It is an improvement of the technique of Micro-insemination (ICSI) where morphologically selected spermatozoa are injected during the fertilization (Intracytoplasmic Morphologically-selected Sperm Injection - IMSI). <p> It is used in cases of severe astheno-terato-spermia where in the man's sperm sample there are many spermatozoa with deviant morphology. With the help of special lenses high definition microscopy is achieved as well as enlargement of the image of the spermatozoa at about 6500 times. Therefore, we have detailed illustration of their head and morphology and only the best sperms in terms of morphology are used for the egg fertilization. <p> It is a way of fertilization based on the sperm's and oocyte's physiology, hence the name Physiological ICSI (PICSI). Its difference with ICSI is in the use of special plates and culture mediums where small quantities of processed sperm sample of the husband are placed. <p> In each technique (IMSI or PICSI), used either separately or in combination, we select mature and morphologically normal spermatozoa. Especially for the PICSI method, which is used extensively in the IVF Athens Center, there is distinct improvement of the embryo quality, increased chance of implantation, increase on the rate of clinical pregnancies and decrease of the clinical miscarriages. <p> We are proud to have brought together a team of experts with the highest level of scientific skills and long experience in the treatment of infertility. Everyone in our staff – doctors, embryologists, midwives and administrative staff – is strictly devoted to the highest purpose we serve, ensuring that we meet all the needs of the couples that come to us with responsibility and above all humanity.",Information/Explanation

277,"The diocese included the provinces (amter) of Aarhus and Randers, the islands of Samso and Tuno, and, after 1396, part of the province of Viborg. Frode, King of Jutland, built the church of the Holy Trinity at Aarhus about 900. In 948 Archbishop Adaldag of Hamburg consecrated Reginbrand as missionary Bishop of Aarhus. After the latter's death in 988 all Jutland was united in one diocese, with Ribe or Viborg as its centre. It was redivided in 1060, and one Christian was ordained Bishop of Aarhus by Adalbert I, Archbishop of Hamburg. Another bishop, Ulfketil (1102-34) planned the town of Aarhus. The warlike Svend Udsson (1166-91) founded the Cistercian abbey at Om. His successor, Peter Vagnsen, began in 1201 the Cathedral of St. Clement. Near it lay the wooden church built by Bishop Ulfketil in 1102 to contain the relics of St. Clement. About 1150 the Venerable Niels, Prince of Denmark, died and was buried in St. Clement's churchyard. The offerings at his tomb facilitated the commencement of the new stone cathedral. This was finished about 1263, but in 1330 the greater part of it was burnt down. Peter Jensen Lodeliat (1386-95) and Bo Magnussen (1395-1423) were the prelates mainly concerned in the erection of the fine building extant today. The last Catholic bishop, Ove Bilde (imprisoned 1536), and Paulus Heliae, prior of the Carmelite monastery at Elsinore, attempted in vain to stay the progress of the Reformation at Aarhus. There were in the diocese: a chapter with 34 prebendaries at Aarhus cathedral; Benedictines at Essenbeck, Voer, Alling, and Veirlov; Augustinian Canons at Tvilum, Cistercians at Om, who survived till 1560; and Carthusians at Aarhus. There were also Franciscans at Horsens and Randers, Dominicans at Aarhus, Horsens, and Randers, Carmelites and a hospital of the Holy Spirit at Aarhus.

Consumer behavior hasn't been affected much yet, but if people get a whiff of hard times coming, they'll surely hunker down to ride it out. <p> The signs of a slowing economy are everywhere, but that doesn't imply that the economy will inevitably plunge into recession. The risks are rising however. Tighter fiscal and monetary policies would weaken animal spirits. <p> Remarkable: The market says there is 0% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates this year. A month ago, the odds of a hike were 75%. <p> Pushing China into recession would boomerang on the American economy (as Apple's AAPL, -0.22% warning portends). Locking down the borders (as Trump threatened) would be a disaster. <p> The risks are many. First, that the Trump administration might act deliberately in a way that harms the economy; for instance by clamping down hard on trade or immigration. Second, that an administration ruled by Trump's gut instincts might misplay its hand. <p> Third, that, in a crisis, the Trump administration might be unable to staunch the bleeding because its economic policy makers are inexperienced and untrustworthy hacks. (Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's clumsy attempts to reassure the markets accomplished the reverse. And what was Kevin Hassett thinking when he said on TV that he expects more U.S. companies to warn of declining sales?) <p> Despite all the missteps, the economy is still growing. There may be a panicked mood on Wall Street, but on Main Street, business is booming. <p> Payrolls are expanding at about 200,000 per month, far more than is necessary to keep up with population growth. Real, after-tax disposable incomes are rising at about 2.8% per year. Real consumer spending is rising at the about same pace. Industrial output is expanding at about 4% per year. Consumer confidence is still high. Wages are growing, and profits are high. <p> Housing, never very robust during the expansion, is weakening. Business investment boomed for a short period after the tax cut, but softened quickly. The drop in the stock market could demoralize businesses wishing to expand, and the selloff could damp consumer spending because so much wealth was destroyed. <p> Consumers' expectations for future income growth have fallen, while one poll suggests that a majority of consumers believe a recession is likely in 2019. <p> And of course the trade-war jitters could have a big impact on the U.S. and global economies. <p> That's why a lot of people are sure that both the U.S. and China will back down; each side has far too much to lose to continue the hostilities. <p> I'm not so sure. The more pressure on Trump to cave, the more he may dig in. For its part, China may not want to concede too much because it senses that Trump has been weakened. A workable, face-saving compromise wouldn't be easy for either party to achieve, even if the U.S. side had capable policy makers on board.",Opinion/Argumentation

[Article] China to diversify foreign exchange reserves (China Business Weekly) Updated: 2004-05-08 09:12

China is looking to diversify its foreign exchange reserves out of US dollars, according to its top foreign exchange manager. China's chief forex regulator, Guo Shuqing, said in a recent Financial Times interview the make-up of the country's US$440-billion forex cash pile was being altered to include more European and Asian bonds, given concerns over a weaker US dollar. The mere thought of China offloading some of its vast US Treasury holdings is enough to send shivers down investors' spines, risking a further deterioration in the already-bloated US current account deficit and more dollar weakness... [Article] China says it will not dump US Treasuries to retaliate ( 2003-11-23 09:28) (AFP)
<!--enpcontent-->
China will not retaliate in a developing trade spat with the United States by dumping US Treasuries, a Chinese paper reports, citing the agency in charge of the country's ballooning forex reserves... [Article] <p> The Chinese are getting some great incentives for buying our trash: when Pauslon was in China this past spring, the Chinese demanded six-axis manufacturing tech in exchange for more bailouts. The recent acquisition by Mubadala of GE isn't an accident, either: UAE will buy our junk in exchange for turbines and nuclear tech. I doubt the US would be so keen on this 2 years ago... let's see how truculent the media is the next time Dubai Ports goes for Long beach or something! <p> The point of my query to the readership was the off chance covering China Fanny and Freddy bond dumping was a consideration by our 'representatives' in Washington in the Big Bailout. I've been reading about China's threat to dump treasuries for years too. That's not the point. And what's with that ""braking havoc"" anyways. <p> Just finished a new interview with Martin Mayer. We're doing it in two parts, will talk to him again Monday and publish later in the week. One key point related to this topic that he related that is worth noting. The urgency in passing the Fannie and Freddie bailout asap is that $970B in agency debt is on foreign account at the Fed. It is there to allow US trade partners to hold cash earned in trade locally in local currency. (Deal goes back to the days of Arthur Burns.) If Asian and European central banks came to believe that the US was going to allow Fannie and Freddie and fail, they'd sell the bonds and US interest rates would rise. We'd have our first ""Poom"" due to repatriation of foreign holdings of US paper. A few other points: We are in the incipient stages of a major global inflation (agrees with our position). Difficult to manage because the US is a net debtor, thus a Volcker cure is impossible (agrees with our position). He has little faith that the Bernanke Fed can strike the delicate policy balance between stimulating demand with dollar depreciation and managing the resulting inflation. <p> If you actually read the article, he makes the argument that as the slowdown bites in the east, reduced dollar inflows will slow recycling, and China's buying of treasuries will slow/stop. This will blow out rates at 10-30Y where China is the daddy, maybe inducing them to reverse their accumulation. I think this is a plausible enough argument to merit discussion or at least a reasoned refutation.

296,"Although New Radnor itself exceeded in size any of the other out-boroughs the disparity was not so great as to afford it an easy dominance within the constituency; nor did the fact that its bailiff acted as returning officer give the corporation the power to control parliamentary elections. There was an alternative focus of influence in the person of the steward of the crown manors in the county, who admitted freemen to three of the four remaining boroughs (the exception was Cefnllys) at his courts leet. Yet, as the 1690 election was to demonstrate, the resources of the corporation and the stewardship might not always be sufficient, even if combined, to overbalance a major landed interest, backed by powerful parliamentary connexions. Only if deployed in conjunction with the superior authority of a territorial magnate could their full weight be felt: such was the case after 1690, when possession of the stewardship and ascendancy over the New Radnor corporation assisted in placing the seat entirely at the disposal of Robert Harley. <p> The contest in 1690 lay between Harley and the outgoing knight of the shire, Sir Rowland Gwynne, who had relinquished his pretensions to the county representation in the belief that his ally Richard Williams, Member for the Boroughs in the Convention, would stand a better chance of winning widespread support from gentry and freeholders. For his part Gwynne seemed himself to hold the trump cards in the Boroughs: he was steward of the crown manors, and a common councilman in New Radnor. Moreover, at first sight the coast seemed clear: Harley, the most dangerous of his potential rivals, was occupied elsewhere. By the time Harley decided to withdraw from the contest at Leominster and 'to hasten and secure Radnor' Gwynne either felt he had gone too far to retreat or was temporarily enjoying enough confidence in his own position to resist moral blackmail from the Harleys. So great was the family's local prestige, and in particular the reputation of Robert's father Sir Edward*, that Gwynne found considerable embarrassment in rejecting their lofty demands for him to give way, couched as they were in terms both of personal obligation and party loyalty, to the Whiggism that each of the candidates had traditionally professed. With typical self-righteousness the Harleys interpreted his obstinacy as the effect of an intrigue practised by their Herefordshire enemy Thomas Coningsby*, an inference unsupported by any surviving evidence. As they indignantly brought their own forces into play, Gwynne's self-confidence seems to have wavered. Delaying tactics from both the county sheriff and the bailiff of New Radnor, supporters of Gwynne, put off the election by almost a month, and in that time Gwynne's deputy in the stewardship allegedly did all he could to 'terrify' Harley's voters. Gwynne seems also to have contemplated various permutations of the franchise which might have turned to his advantage, notably the inclusion of three further out-boroughs which were within his jurisdiction as steward: Norton, Painscastle and Presteigne. At the election itself, according to Harley's version of events, Gwynne was given the option of polling either all 'sworn' freemen or all that 'had burgage hold' (presumably freeholders) in the boroughs. He opted for the former, and on this basis the five customary boroughs were polled. When it became clear that the majority would fall to Harley, Gwynne produced the freemen from the three new boroughs: 45 from Presteigne (at least half of whom had been sworn since the teste of the writ), 34 from Painscastle and an unspecified number from Norton. Because of Harley's protests these votes were not enrolled in the town clerk's poll book but kept separate. The bailiff then declared Gwynne elected, and when a scrutiny revealed Harley to have a majority of three in the poll book, the bailiff promptly disallowed two of his votes, polled himself for Gwynne and having thus evened out the totals reiterated his original declaration and made the return. The inevitable petition turned on the question of the inclusion of the three extra boroughs. Other tactics contemplated by Gwynne in defence of his position proved abortive. An insistence that freemen be inhabitants or at least freeholders was evidently not pursued, documents among the Harley papers demonstrating that not only were some of Gwynne's supporters in Rhayader outsiders and two of his principal henchmen in New Radnor had 'no estate anywhere', but also that on a calculation of inhabitant voters in the five boroughs Harley would have enjoyed a majority of 69 votes to 39. Gwynne did make some efforts in committee to 'disqualify' more of Harley's voters but 'upon hearing two witnesses of the other [Gwynne's] side, and the weakness of Sir R. G.['s] defence, the committee were so satisfied not to hear any more proofs'. In fact, Harley was able to respond more successfully in kind, his evidence striking off almost a third of Gwynne's voters. The central point of the debate, the extra boroughs, went equally badly for Gwynne. His counsel relied upon a strained interpretation of a Henrician statute (27 Hen. VIII, c.26) on the levying of the 'burgess fee'; an Elizabethan return, which proved to be so 'torn and obliterated' as to be illegible; and a copy of the 1680 indenture, which was said to have included the Painscastle bailiff among the parties to the return. Against this Harley offered the testimony of two aged freemen of New Radnor, one of whom had served for 20 years as town clerk, that only the five customary boroughs had ever been known to participate in elections. The presentation of an unreadable document, and the surprising information that Gwynne had been desperate enough to cast a vote for himself, reduced the House to laughter. Gwynne compounded the farce by speaking from the floor in his own behalf (one of only three members openly to espouse his cause), and Harley, whose canvassing of his father's manifold connexions in the House paid handsome dividends, carried the decision with ease. The outcome of the report to the Commons was an even greater humiliation for Gwynne, Williams' being the only voice raised against acceptance of the committee's resolutions.3 <p> For all that the Harleys affected to regard this parliamentary triumph as a further providential dispensation, they quickly grasped the levers of power within the constituency in order to settle Robert's occupation of the seat. The struggle over the petition had been too time-consuming and financially exhausting (costing in all £500) for them to contemplate a repetition. New Radnor corporation was their first target. Already, during the summer of 1690, Robert Harley had been admitted a freeman of the borough in what seems to have been a preliminary incursion into Gwynne's domain. Then, almost concurrently with the hearing of the election petition, the Harleyite faction in the corporation made a dramatic advance. Having achieved the election of a sympathizer, John Davies, as bailiff, they succeeded in removing Gwynne and Richard Williams from the common council. To this the 'adverse party' responded by moving for a mandamus to have their own claimant to the bailiff's office sworn instead. Although losing their case, both at King's bench and at the local assizes, where the suit was revived, they came close enough to success to maintain their morale and to induce one of the Harleys' most trusted advisers, Robert Price*, to advocate a compromise. The anti-Harleyites were also emboldened by the intervention of the Herefordshire Tory Sir John Morgan, 2nd Bt.*, who in the spring of 1690 announced his intention to stand for one of the Radnorshire seats at the next election. Despite his partisan affiliation Morgan was willing to throw in his lot with Gwynne and Williams in a coalition whose sole purpose was to prevent the Harleys from engrossing the county and Boroughs representation. The bailiff's election in the autumn of 1691 witnessed a major test of strength between the rival groups. Hugh Stephens, the Harleys' candidate, was opposed by one of Gwynne's lieutenants, Henry Vaughan, ostensibly in a conflict of personalities arising from some local quarrel, but in reality part of a campaign directed by Morgan and Richard Williams to undermine the Harley interest. The result was a victory for Stephens, 'notwithstanding the vapour of enemies', as Sir Edward Harley put it. But once again the Harleys' opponents were far from downcast. Vaughan followed his party's previous strategy of pursuing a claim to be the lawfully elected bailiff, hounding his rival with 'a riotous rabble'. To be sure of their position the Harleys required control of the crown manors as well, and, advised by his brother Edward*, Robert now embarked upon a court intrigue to relieve Gwynne of the stewardship. This proved a decisive blow: at the news of his appointment 'the minds of the adverse party were extremely sore', as one of Harley's agents told him. In a convenient demonstration of the fact that the scales of local political power had now dropped decisively in the Harleys' favour, a by-election for the county in November 1692, in which the same sets of principals were involved as in the Boroughs, ended in the return of Robert Harley's nominee. On this occasion the backlash reached new depths of violence. Two brothers, Thomas and Nourse Lewis, their resentment aggravated by an unwarranted belief that Robert Harley had been responsible for their recent exclusion from the commission of the peace, worked out their grudge in an armed assault on their tormentor in the streets of New Radnor. Having survived what he felt to have been a plot to murder him, Harley took a legal revenge, part of which consisted of demanding Thomas Lewis' removal from the corporation of New Radnor. The peremptory tone in which he addressed the bailiff and common councilmen on this occasion illustrates vividly the authority he could now command: <p> I look upon this attempt [to be] of so base a nature . . . particularly upon examination of some circumstances which make manifest the villainy of the design. I therefore desire and expect that you summon a chamber with all convenient speed and there remove Mr Thomas Lewis from being a common councilman . . . with express mention of the cause . . . And it is the interest of all your gentlemen to do it speedily, that when this matter comes to be examined in a proper place it may appear you have been tender of the privileges of Parliament, and I cannot imagine any of you by opposing this little instance of justice will give the world or myself ground to suppose they had any hand in abetting such a wicked attempt, or do now approve of it. <p> An unfounded rumour in the winter of 1693–4, that a petition was being drawn up in Radnor against Harley for 'overthrowing their charter and bringing people into the corporation unduly', and the violent destruction in 1695 of the booth hall, which stood on Harley's land, show that local resistance to this new monopoly of power did not suddenly become extinguished, but at no subsequent election in this period was a challenge mounted in the Boroughs. Harley's tenure survived untouched his own spells of disfavour at court between about 1693 and 1700, and again between 1708 and 1710, not least because of the disappearance of his erstwhile rivals, the Morgans reconciled with him as a result of his change of party allegiance, and Gwynne deprived of the wherewithal to fight by accelerating indebtedness. By 1700 even Thomas Lewis had made his peace. A judicious distribution of alms to the poor and similar benefactions were an almost superfluous insurance. Elections became a formality. In 1710, for example, Harley's sister reported to Robert that he had been chosen 'with all the expressions imaginable of their satisfaction in your doing them the honour to represent them', and when in the following year Harley was elevated to the peerage his eldest son succeeded to the vacancy as of right.5 <p> Unless otherwise stated, this article is based on the account of the constituency provided in D.

297,"Press Releases <p> A Call For All Member States of the Human Rights Council: End the Gross Violations of the Rights of Girls and Women Raped and Impregnated in Armed Conflict, to Non-Discriminatory Medical Care, Including Abortions, Under the Geneva Convention <p> November 01, 2010 <p> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE–November 2010 <p> A major reason for the near global ""no abortion policy"" for these victims can be traced to US abortion restrictions placed on all humanitarian aid. By imposing these restrictions on foreign aid, the US is forcing foreign governments and humanitarian aid providers to exclude the option of abortions from the medical services made available to victims of war rape. Further, when these funds are comingled with funds from other donor governments, these restrictions, in effect, apply to the entire pot of funding. This impedes other states' ability to comply with their fundamental obligations under the Geneva Conventions, its Additional Protocols and customary international law. <p> Norway has already submitted the following question to the US: <p> We urge all countries to join Norway and question the US on this policy which has deadly consequences for victims who are raped and impregnated in armed conflict. <p> The sheer number of girls and women targeted by sexual violence is shocking. Between 250,000 and 500,000 girls and women were raped during the Rwandan genocide in 100 days and approximately 20,000 children were born as a result of these rapes. In Liberia, one government survey showed that 92% of the women interviewed had experienced some form of sexual violence. The targeted use of rape in war is not new. In 1971 the West Pakistani army raped hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi women resulting in approximately 25,000 children being born of rape due to limited access to abortions. Local health centers in South Kivu, DRC estimate that approximately 40 women are raped in the region every day, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimates that for every rape reported in the DRC, 30 rapes go unreported. <p> Today, the major providers of humanitarian aid to girl and women victims of war rape routinely exclude abortion services. Although a few courageous doctors and agencies, such as MSF, provide abortion services episodically, this provision is a discretionary humanitarian act, not a recognition of a woman's non-derogable legal right. The non-provision of abortions is euphemistically referred to as the ""unavailability of abortions"" and this situation is viewed as an unfortunate but accepted reality in many UN and INGO reports on sexual violence against women in armed conflict. <p> The right to non-discriminatory medical care necessarily includes abortions <p> Under common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and its Additional Protocols require that during armed conflict States provide non-discriminatory medical care to the ""sick and wounded"" including girls and women impregnated by war rape. The Additional Protocols make clear that medical care must be given ""without distinction"" which we argue includes the option of abortions. This principle is now recognized as customary international law and binds all states. Additionally, since this right is enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, it supersedes any local criminal abortions laws during times of armed conflict. <p> The only class of victims who are not granted their entitlement to complete medical care are those that are impregnated from rape. Boys and men who are raped, or girls and women who are raped but not impregnated, are theoretically given the full range of medical care that is necessitated by their injuries. The provision of EC is helpful only for the small percentage of victims who are able to obtain medical care within 72 hours. For example, of the 303 recent victims of sexual violence in Walikale in the DRC, only two presented for treatment within this 72 hour window. <p> The US abortion restrictions on humanitarian aid have a global effect <p> The United States is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in the world. It imposes, as a condition of foreign aid, abortion restrictions on all its grantees (including foreign governments and NGO's). This has shaped the discrimination towards victims of war rape. By applying abortion restrictions to humanitarian aid the US is effectively inhibiting other states from complying with their obligations under international humanitarian law. For example, when the US provides humanitarian aid to Sudan, it prevents Sudan from using those funds to offer the option of abortion in state funded medical care to girls and women raped during the conflict, which it is required to do under the Geneva Conventions.",Opinion/Argumentation
