This repository is divided into two parts:
- creation of genre classifiers and comparison based on cross-dataset prediction - see the folder "Creation-of-classifiers-and-cross-prediction" and the README inside the folder
- applying the created classifiers to MaCoCu monolingual datasets and using the domain information as a weak signal to compare the classifiers (the diversity of their predictions and the level to which their predictions match on the domain level) - see the folder Comparison-on-MaCoCu-data and the README inside.
