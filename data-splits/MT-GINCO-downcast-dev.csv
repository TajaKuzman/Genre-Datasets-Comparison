9,"Melissa is added to teas and preparations for melancholy, restlessness, migraines and to strengthen the spirit. It also works against the herpes virus on the lips. Brings happy dreams <p/> Melissa (Melissa oficinalis) has been used medicinally for more than two millennia. It has been used to treat heart and stomach problems and has been praised for its beneficial effect on the digestive tract. It was generally believed to stimulate digestion, strengthen the heart, nerves and spirit, banish fear and anxiety and provide happy dreams. <p/> Relieves confusion <p/> Both traditional and rational or scientific medicine now advise the use of lemon balm preparations for melancholy, tension, restlessness and confusion. The action of lemon balm is described as sedative and tranquilising. It has been shown to be particularly soothing in nervous disorders, migraine and nervous heart problems. <p/> Relieves digestion <p/> Melissa tea and other preparations are used to treat digestive disorders such as stomach cramps, constipation and lack of appetite. The tea is prepared as an infusion: two teaspoons of the mixture is poured over a cup of boiling water, covered and strained after ten minutes. Drink several times a day. The best tea is made from fresh leaves, so make the most of the summer time when they are abundant in your home garden. This tea, unlike mint (Metha pipperita), can be drunk continuously over a long period of time without worry, as it does not cause any undesirable effects. <p/> For children, the elderly and pregnant women <p/> It is very healthy and also tasty for children and the elderly. It also helps with vomiting in pregnant women and has a beneficial effect on painful or weak menstruation. <p/> Against herpes <p/> External use of Melissa preparations is recommended for herpes on the lips. Melissa has the power to kill herpes and other types of viruses, inhibit inflammation and destroy microbes. <p/> Tea for the forgetful <p/> If you are constantly forgetting things, I suggest a tea mixture of lemon balm and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to boost your memory: a teaspoon of lemon balm and a teaspoon of rosemary flowers are steeped in half a litre of water, covered and left to steep for ten minutes. The treatment should last for three months - drink the tea three times a day for ten days a month, one cup at a time. <p/> Melissa bath <p/> For a soothing and melancholy bath, make an infusion of two handfuls of lemon balm with a litre of water, cover and leave to steep for fifteen minutes. Strain the infusion and add it to the bath water. / source:herasi /",Promotion,dev

At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia will be presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, Legebitra Programme Manager. In the second part, we will talk to Vesna Leskošek about the national survey on violence in the private sphere. <p/> Dear feminists. Welcome to the Sector Ž show on this beautiful winter Saturday, which almost smells like the eighth of March. The strengthened and expanded editorial team of the show will present a new short film by Vesna Vravnik, A Lesbian Club in Every Village. The film premiered last December at the Café at the Trough in Metelkova. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia were presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, head of the youth programme at the Legebitra Information Centre. The report is prepared by Tea Hvala. In the second part, Ida will talk to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> On 10 December 2011, a presentation of the short film and the research, which were produced within the framework of the Legebitra Information Centre, took place at the Canteen at the Trough. Both concern the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia and represent a courageous attempt to expose their - sorry, our - invisibility. <p/> The documentary Lesbian Club in Every Village was made by Vesna Vravnik, a filmmaker and lesbian activist, who said that she struggled to find enough female interviewees who were willing to expose themselves on camera. It was particularly difficult for girls and women living in smaller Slovenian towns, where the fear of being judged and isolated is particularly well-founded - which is not to say that the situation in Ljubljana is ideal. When asked why she titled the film ""A Lesbian Club in Every Village"", Vesna replied as follows: <p/> The high school girls who agreed to participate said that the hardest thing to resist is being judged by those who have the most power over them: their parents and teachers. ""We don't expose ourselves at school,"" said a 16-year-old lesbian from Ptuj, ""because we are afraid for our grades. There are quite a few of us, but we are afraid of the older teachers. ""Another added: ""My class teacher called me into her office and told me to choose another school because I had appeared in the Pride Parade - because 'it doesn't go through with them'"". The perplexing question of why she did not sue the homophobic class teacher and the public school that acquiesced to her threat is urgent, but unfortunately also rhetorical. Why? Because we have to wonder again who even dares to seek legal remedies in a country where even the Constitutional Court is homophobic. <p/> With Team Dresch, the legendary lesbian band from the USA, we can sarcastically conclude that lesbians are again and still underground. Which does not mean, of course, that we will not circle a big YES for equality before the law in the referendum. <p/> We continue with the presentation of the extensive research conducted by the Legebitra Information Centre, which last year prepared an anonymous online questionnaire on the situation of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. Since not much is known about their lives, or ours, they wanted to find out what problems we face, what kind of environment we live in and how (if at all) we shape it. The analysis of the data is not yet complete, so here are just a few excerpts from the presentation at the Canteen at the Trough by Eva Gračanin, Head of Legebitra's Youth Programme. As the concept of ""non-heterosexual women"" is very broad, she first presented the sample of the survey, which included a whole range of gender identities. <p/> The women interviewed were older than those in the film, so it is to be expected that they would have pointed to work, not school, as the most risky environment for coming out. The fact that only 12 of the women came out at work is a testament to the fact that there is a very high chance of losing your job after coming out, or having to ""fire"" yourself because of the pressures. The data on the political participation and social life of LGBT and all other Others was also telling. Eva Gračanin said the following at the presentation: <p/> Perhaps the fear of public exposure and loneliness is easier to understand if we add one more piece of data to the above: only 20% of the women said they felt completely safe in their environment and family circle, and the same percentage of women said their families did not even know about their sexual orientation. More encouraging was the information about trustworthy friends: 60% of the women have such friends. For those women who are not so lucky, we would like to dedicate the song ""Way Out"" by German musician Ellen Allien, and we invite all listeners to listen again in May, when we will focus on a more detailed analysis of Legebitra's survey on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. <p/> In the second part of the programme, we spoke to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> To summarise: Violence against women, which according to the above-mentioned data is a very real reality in our society, is therefore the result of deep-rooted chauvinism and patriarchal structures. So please, let no one tell me anymore that feminism is a finished project, that today we can all have our own room if that is what we want! <p/> At the end of the programme, we call on all listeners to declare themselves, to declare their rights, because only then will they be able to demand a public space. The programme was produced by Tea Hvala and Ida Hiršenfelder. We will be back on the air of Radio Student on 11 March, when the Red Dawn will be rising on the horizon.",News/Reporting,dev

23,"Beans <p/> Related <p/> Superfood <p/> Historically, beans have actually been highly valued, but then important high-class chosen ones, such as Catherine de Medici, decided that beans were a peasant food that was not elegant and special enough for their stomachs. They replaced it with the trend of processed food, which is still not rooted today. <p/> Meat of the rich <p/> Hence the now-famous saying that beans are the poor man's meat, which is no longer true since experts believe that animal protein causes many diseases. For a while, beans were accused of not having as complete a protein composition as meat. It is true that it lacks two amino acids, but it is not difficult to compensate for them if beans are combined with foods that contain them, such as cereals. So you can pour bean sauce over couscous, and more recent findings show that it is not even necessary to consume this combination in the same meal - it is enough to consume all the amino acids in the same day. <p/> (Not) sophisticated? <p/> The reputation of beans as not being a sophisticated food is certainly due to the problems they occasionally cause. Many argue that if legumes are consumed regularly and in small quantities, they disappear. You may also find some of the natural recipes suitable. Look for dried kombu seaweed in health food shops. Add them to the water in which you soak the beans. The algae will not affect the taste of the beans and will almost disintegrate during cooking. Besides, there is nothing wrong with algae particles floating around on the plate. The more familiar bay leaf should have a similar effect, and some people recommend chewing half a teaspoon of aniseed immediately after a meal or at the onset of flatulence. <p/> Easy to prepare <p/> Although there are many types of beans, all of them, from broad beans to white or black beans, cook in a very similar way, just adjust the time to the size of the bean. Always remove any unusually shaped, discoloured or broken beans first. There must also be no holes, however small, in the beans, as they are invisible 'inhabitants' to our eyes. <p/> This will not happen if the beans are stored in a well-sealed ceramic or glass container. It can wait for a year, but do not mix old and new stocks, as the beans will then cook for different lengths of time. Salt, lemon juice, vinegar, wine or tomatoes should not be added before the end of cooking as they slow down the softening of the beans. <p/> Most IN <p/> Due to their easier digestibility, mung beans and adzuki beans have recently become the most popular types. Due to their smaller size, they only need to be soaked for a few hours and cooked for one hour. Season with turmeric, basil, thyme or coriander. Adzuki is known as the sweetest and least 'beany' type of bean. In Japan, where it is said to be native, it is used to make milk and desserts. Most often, the beans and sugar are boiled into a filling. <p/> Both types of bean can be ground into flour. They are highly recommended in Chinese medicine for women, especially during menstruation and lactation, and are said to strengthen the bladder and kidneys and to give courage and energy. <p/> Both types of beans can be sprouted, but mung beans are best known in this form: their sprouts are called soya beans. Interestingly, the sprouts contain vitamin C, which beans do not. To produce your own, soak the beans overnight and then place them in a suitable container in a warm, dark but airy place, making sure they are kept wet at all times. It is not recommended to eat the sprouts raw, so fry them in coconut fat and season them with soy sauce. According to Chinese medicine, mung beans are supposed to cool and detoxify the body, and to relieve inflammation. <p/> The basis of a healthy diet <p/> You can play around with soups, sauces, stews, spreads, purees and salads, but don't forget the spices. You can always add parsley, savory, sage or marjoram to beans. Add a little vinegar to your dishes to make them even tastier. In the end, beans will really prove to you that even a healthy dish can be tasty and cheap. <p/> VIVIN TIP <p/> Superfood <p/> If you soak beans in cold water and cook them very slowly, they retain virtually all their nutritional value. Beans contain zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, manganese and selenium, as well as B vitamins. Folate lowers levels of homocysteine, the build-up of which in the walls of blood vessels causes the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibre from beans helps to eliminate bad cholesterol from the body. Beans even contain substances that prevent certain cancers. It has a good effect on blood sugar due to its low glycaemic index and is also very beneficial for people with high blood pressure (with the exception of canned beans). And it can be eaten even if you are constipated. In addition, harmful substances from the environment do not get further than the pod.",Instruction,dev

45,"World No Tobacco Day this year over advertisers Smoking kills six million people worldwide every year, and in Slovenia it takes 3,600 lives annually. On World No Tobacco Day, there are warnings about the dangers of smoking, including second-hand smoke. The horrifying statistics that six million people die every year from smoking worldwide, 600 000 from passive smoking, and 3 600 lives are lost annually in Slovenia, 900 of them under the age of 60, speak for themselves. If we do not change our tobacco use patterns, as many as one billion people will die from tobacco in the world in the 21st century. <p/> Worldwide, 1.3 billion people smoke. If smoking were reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent, as many as 100 million premature deaths would be prevented by 2020. This makes it one of the most preventable deaths, but efforts are still lacking because the tobacco industry holds the reins. <p/> Stop the tobacco industry's marketing! The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day, first proclaimed by the World Health Organization in 1987, is Stop Tobacco Marketing! Helena Koprivnikar from the Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia warns that marketing is one of the most important causes of the spread of tobacco use and that urgent action is needed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of smoking among adolescents and young adults and to complement measures to reduce smoking among adults. In the European Union, 70% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. <p/> According to the Institute for Health Protection, 24% of the population aged 15-64 in Slovenia smokes, more men (27%) than women (21%). The proportion of male smokers has been increasing in recent years, mainly at the expense of the proportion of female smokers. The proportion of adolescents and young adults who smoke is largely stable, but the proportion of adolescent women who smoke has increased. Among adolescents aged 11-15, just over 29% have tried smoking, more boys than girls. <p/> New Tobacco Directive with tougher restrictions The European Union is currently negotiating a proposal for a new Tobacco Directive that would completely ban the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes the introduction of large composite warnings, which would include colour photographs in addition to text and would cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette packs and rolling tobacco. It also provides for a ban on the sale of tobacco products with distinctive flavourings and additives that give the impression that the tobacco product is less harmful to health. <p/> European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Tonio Borg, urged Members of the European Parliament and European Health Ministers to support the proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive and stressed the importance of efforts to reduce the attractiveness of smoking and tobacco products to young people. <p/> Free smoking cessation programmes in Slovenia Nataša Blažko from the Ministry of Health said that Slovenia is a strong supporter of the new directive as tobacco is a major burden in Slovenia, explaining that the proposal brings changes in a number of areas, but also adds new areas, such as the treatment of electronic and herbal cigarettes. The Ministry of Health financially supports various programmes aimed at preventing young people from starting to smoke and at smoking cessation in all population groups. Slovenia is one of the few countries where primary health care provides free smoking cessation programmes. B. T.

51,"Racist assault <p/> Man charged with attempted murder for alleged self-defence <p/> Almonte, a Dominican, was in the wrong place at the wrong time on 26 March. Shortly before midnight, he was attacked by three shaved heads in the Domžale bar Pri Jurčku. It was allegedly a racist attack. According to the reader's testimony, the young men waited until the stranger was alone and then attacked him from behind. In order to defend himself against the kicks and punches, the attacked man crouched down and then swung a knife at the thugs. He cut two of them and ran away, but then surrendered to the police. <p/> Although this was a reaction in self-defence, the police then only charged the Dominican. Not those who allegedly ""struck first"". Since the end of March, Almonte has been in custody, which has already been extended once, as the court had to hear several witnesses and appoint a medical expert for three people, the Ljubljana District Court explained. The case file, which will be handed over to the prosecutor's office, accuses him of two counts of attempted manslaughter, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. After all the interrogations they have conducted, they believe that the Dominican man came after the Slovenians, not the other way around, and that he used the knife with the intention of killing them. But this is probably not the whole truth. The racist shaved heads allegedly threatened the witnesses of the incident: if they exposed themselves, they would retaliate, the reader wrote. The investigation therefore probably did not cover everyone who saw the incident. Only those who testified in defence of the attackers were exposed. We tried to verify this, but the court refused to grant us access to the file because the case is still pending. <p/> ""I would like to point out that racism exists in this country and is a very serious problem.

61,"DOG - A CREATURE FOR THE LONELY? <p/> Living with an animal is good for the body and soul. Children who are lucky enough to grow up around animals develop more feeling (empathy) for others, the ability to accept the differences between living things, their communication is fuller (it is easier for them to perceive correctly something besides words). They also have fewer allergies and express their emotions more easily. <p/> The above is said in an uiber simple way, in a homey way, a la Nina (jest). But it is an officially recognised fact that. So I did not make it up. <p/> I can tell you from my own experience in therapy with a dog (I don't have many, but I have a few) that children really do sometimes - when they have problems with this - open up more easily to a dog than to a human. Why? Because the dog does not judge. For him you are great when you are sad and when you are happy. It doesn't take your sadness or disappointment as an attack on its personality. So it accepts who you are. And it tries to improve your mood. Even when he is the cause of your disappointment, he doesn't take it out on his own resentment or hurt, but approaches it in a constructive way, trying to make amends in any way he can. It's funny for me to think like that... Funny that a higher evolved being, i.e. a human being, has to learn this extra many times, but a dog is just given it. So, on that point, I say calmly (and I don't mind if someone jumps in the loft about it)... Well, I will say that in some cases, at this point, the dog is more advanced than the human in terms of social skills. In some cases. I just find insensitivity to another's pain an extremely frightening trait. <p/> I have often heard the statement: lonely people have dogs. I always come to two conclusions from this statement, whether it is written or spoken and in what context: <p/> it reflects a person who thinks that he is an extra good soul just because he sometimes gets involved with someone. He does not know that this is not dictated by his character, but by the fact that he is born a social being. There are many ways to be involved with anyone. Roughly in 2 ways: bad or good. If I (magari with the help of animals) had conquered the good, I would know that this statement dilutes by negativity something that does not even need a negative connotation. If you like flowers, you like flowers, if you like animals, you like animals. If you like them, they are not superfluous. Just as simple as that. There is no need for pejorative approaches and words that can only bring pain when a person is belittled and nothing else. To me, that is hypocritical. A lack of understanding of acceptance of other living beings, garnished with the cellophane of (supposedly) trying to understand. A person with feeling for others would not express it that way. He would have benefited from the example of canine companionship. But I am glad he does not. Because it's not the dog's fault. He is not a doormat, he is a living being. <p/> Of course, a dog is a wonderful companion. Among other things because, as I said above, he knows how to coexist. Calm souls show emotions and moods in a relaxed way. We humans are not always and everywhere good at that. When we grow up, we are... well, less uninhibitedly genuine. He is also a wonderful listener and as a rule does not give away secrets. Intermezzo: those who know their animals, or animals in general, well know that they also tell some secrets. Just not, as a rule, in such an extreme way as the currently still famous bullmastiffs. Such expressions are maddeningly rare, because very few animals are so totally nerved - destroyed. I, for example, years ago, denounced my landlord for charging around the flat when I was not at home because of animals. Because I know my animals. In a humiliated confession, he then asked me - how did you know, since I hadn't moved anything? But there is no substitute for human closeness. That goes both ways, of course. No human being can replace a dog's closeness either. And the fact is that the dog as a companion really helps the desperate... because it gets them out, with people! ! ! Not because it replaces them. Because it cheers them up and brings them back to sociability. All this, of course, does not mean that all dog owners are the same. Hello? Are all parents the same? All rugby players? All at the same school? The important thing to say here is that the overly desperate don't snog the dog anyway. Fact. And that like-minded people walking their dogs is no worse than like-minded people playing volleyball.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

All the locomotives on the stamps are additionally described, and I have added to the stamps their philatelic and catalogue value. Special mention is made of some of the steam locomotives of the Slovenian Railways (SŽ) and the Ocean locomotive, with an account of important events in Maribor during the construction of the Vienna-Trieste line. The chapter concludes with a selection of some famous steam locomotives of my choice. <p/> Chapter 2, after a brief introduction, presents in detail Honegger's composition Pacific 231. The composition is interesting because its origin is linked to a mistake made by the composer. This is followed by a short presentation of some of the Pacific series locomotives from France and the rest of the world. <p/> The third chapter shows the link between railways and poetry, or rather the influence of railways on the creation of 'railway' poems. The poems selected are Prešeren's On the Railway Road and Župančič's By Train. This is followed by a description of the locomotives that may have pulled the train that Župančič rode through Gorenjska on his way to Paris. Here again, the content of Župančič's poem does not correspond to the situation on the railway at the time of its composition in 1905. <p/> The chapter on railways and painting, after an introduction showing some famous paintings of railways, is dedicated to the pioneer of the expert treatment of the history of railways in Slovenia and the man most responsible for the establishment of the museum collection and the Railway Museum in Ljubljana. This is the academic painter Stane Kumar. It also describes where overconfidence in oneself, underestimating others and ignoring historical and professional facts in the name of artistic freedom can lead. This is exactly what happened to Stane Kumar. <p/> The last chapter describes the Bohinj railway, its history, important buildings, the landscape and people along it, and two famous locomotives from the past. <p/> An appendix explains some of the philatelic and railway terms that appear in the book. The wheel arrangements of steam locomotives from all over the world are thoroughly explained. A schematic of a steam locomotive and a data table of all the locomotives in the book are also added. In addition to the basic data, the table contains detailed information for those who are more familiar with the subject. (From the author's preface.) <p/> Brief introduction of the author.

74,"Even today - despite the strong influence of school and environment - what Jernej Pavlin wrote more than sixty years ago at the beginning of his story about today's Godovnjak is true: ""What children will ever be like depends most on their upbringing in the home. ""He adds, ""Holy parents sometimes have holy children. ""She is thinking of Brigitta of Sweden, the mystical wife and great saint whose daughter was St Catherine of Sweden, or Karin, whom the Church remembers today. <p/> Karin was the fourth of Brigitta's eight children. She was born in 1331 or 1332. She was put into a convent early on to be brought up. At her father's request, she married a pious nobleman when she was only fourteen. The young couple decided to imitate the virginal marriage of the Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph. Catherine began to dress simply and without excessive jewellery. Her example was imitated by many young ladies, her friends. Her mother, Brigitta, went to Rome after her husband's death and lived a pious life there. Catherine's desire for Rome was also aroused. Her husband defended her at first, but finally gave her permission. Because of his illness, he was unable to accompany her. She came to Rome in 1349, when she was eighteen. She was happy to embrace her mother again. Soon, however, she felt very homesick and was about to return home. At her mother's request, she declared that she was ready to leave everything and stay in Rome for Christ's sake, but she soon came to despise Rome outright and asked her mother's permission to return to Sweden after all. Brigitta considered her daughter's wish a dangerous temptation, and she began to pray. Christ appeared to her and said, ""Tell your daughter that she is already a widow. Convince her to stay. I will take care of her. ""After a long time, Catherine found inner peace. Her mother's spiritual director also guided her, and under his guidance she progressed in virtue because she was obedient to him in everything. She made several pilgrimages with her mother, including one to the Holy Land in 1372. They both had a kind of monastic life, in which prayer, work, rest and charity were interspersed. Her mother Brigitta, in a vision, was ordered to found a new order with its first monastery in Vadstena, Sweden, as early as 1346. She also drew up the rules of the order, which is called the Order of Brigitta or the Order of the Saviour, but it was not until her daughter Catherine that her idea could be realised. <p/> Shortly after her return from the Holy Land, her mother died in Rome on 23 July 1373. According to her will, Catherine transported her body to Sweden, where it was solemnly buried in the monastery church in Vadstena. The nuns of this monastery lived according to the rules of her mother and elected Catherine as superior. But after only a year, she travelled to Rome to seek the leadership of the Catholic Church to have Brigitta declared a saint. She spent five years gathering the necessary material, then returned to Vadstena, where the bishop confirmed her as superior, and she began to prepare for her death: she died on 24 March 1381. Her canonization was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, and her mother Brigitta was declared a saint in 1391.",Information/Explanation,dev

82,"The efficient use of condensing heat is influenced by a number of factors, the main ones being the hydraulic integration of the condensing boiler into the heating system and the temperature of the return water from the heating system. <p/> In low energy houses (NEH) and passive houses (PH), the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems are upgraded with solar systems. When designing solar systems, it is important to bear in mind that modern individual components are not a guarantee of good system performance. It is more important that the components are coordinated with each other and optimally integrated into the domestic heating and hot water system. <p/> Today, most houses have a habitable attic, and there is also intensive construction of attic dwellings. However, many loft dwellers dread the summer. It is unbearably hot in their apartments on summer nights. When building a new or adapted attic, you should also ask about the properties of insulation and other materials. This will save not only sleepless nights, but also later expenditure on ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which are not needed if the roof is properly and sufficiently insulated. <p/> The eco-material label is used to describe a product that is characterised by its ability to minimise the impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. In the case of thermal insulation materials, from the point of view of the user, a division between traditional materials and ecological or alternative materials has become established in practice. This division can be partly disputed, since when choosing any insulation material, one must take into account its good qualities, while at the same time taking into account its disadvantages. <p/> Photovoltaic modules, made up of cells connected in series, convert solar energy directly into direct current. The sun's rays fall on the surface of the solar cells and the sun's radiant primary energy is converted into electricity. The transformation is direct, with no intermediate transformation into thermal and mechanical energy. The incident light on the crystal lattice of the selected substance releases an electric charge. In radiation, light quanta - photons - strike the faceplate of the semiconductor and are absorbed. This releases electron pairs, which remain separated due to the internal electric field and thus generate an electric voltage. <p/> The use of geothermal energy (heat from the earth) as a source of energy which, in terms of the quantity of resources, meets the criterion of sustainability, does not increase global radiation due to CO2 emissions when harnessed, and can therefore be considered as a renewable source of energy.",Information/Explanation,dev

Rihtaštavlje is the 49th place in Slovenia where a water source has been restored with the financial assistance of Helios and the professional support of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning - After the blessing by the parish priest Janko Ivančič, the oldest villager, Terezie Mauko, was poured her first glass during the opening ceremony, with which she proudly toasted the gathered. <p/> In Rihtarovci, in the municipality of Radenci, the completely renovated village well was opened yesterday at noon with a short cultural programme by pupils from the Radenci Primary School and in the presence of many locals and guests. This spring, the municipality of Radenci applied for a call for funding, which for the tenth year has been organised by Helios and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning as part of the campaign to preserve clean Slovenian waters. The village well in Rihtarovci convinced the expert selection committee and the renovation could soon start. <p/> The fountain is located in the central village area, in a small park next to a chapel with benches near the main road Radenci - Ljutomer. It is two kilometres from the centre of Radenci. It is a typical Styrian fountain, built more than a hundred years ago and equipped at that time with a large wooden wheel and a wooden shaft on which a supporting rope was wound with two wooden buckets rising up alternately. It is surrounded by a traditional wooden structure and the roof is made of brick tiles. It lies on a layer of clay up to 8 metres thick, which protects the groundwater from surface pollution and is 13 metres deep. The interior of the well was originally walled with sandstone, which was replaced by concrete channels 120 cm in diameter when it was rebuilt. Some parts have been modernised, but it remains essentially a copy of the decaying well. A submersible pump with a tap was added to facilitate the pumping of the water, and the original stone trough. The villagers used it until the construction of the village aqueduct The water in the well is in the self-purification phase and is not quite fit for drinking at the moment. <p/> The village well is also a popular walking route for guests of the nearby Radenci Spa, and will be of interest to thousands of annual hikers as part of the ""Three Hearts Marathon"". The fountain is also included in the conceptual design of the local water trail ""K stűdenci"", which was prepared by pupils of the Radenci Primary School and awarded a financial prize by the Helios Foundation. The pupils active in the project are working to make the trail a reality in the spring. It has also become a teaching point for the ECO Water System project, which is being developed by pupils from the local primary school. <p/> The restoration work on the well lasted from August to October and was carried out, also as a donation, by local companies and entrepreneurs and, of course, by the volunteer work of active villagers.

126,"Slovenia: Public appeal by the Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia <p/> Ljubljana, 16 June 2012 (MOREL) - The Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia has addressed a public appeal to the government, the National Assembly, university rectors and faculty deans, and the National Agency for Quality in Higher Education, which we are publishing here in full: The results of the negotiations with the trade unions are very painful for public higher education. Because higher education is financed differently from secondary and primary education and because this financing has been carried out in an unconstitutional way for several years, universities have been left out of the negotiations. Not only has the state failed to adopt the law on the financing of state universities and colleges, which is required by the Constitution in its Article 58. It has crowned the unconstitutionality of the previous practice of funding by regulation by deciding the level of funding for higher education politically and arbitrarily, by rebalancing the budget. The State promises students free studies, while at the same time announcing tuition fees in the National Reform Programme. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is trying to artificially lower the quality of studies by putting financial pressure on public universities, thereby triggering the rampant privatisation of higher education. Universities have already had insufficient funds to carry out five years of study, and the new funding will be barely sufficient for the first level. In view of the financial constraints, the three public universities are already preparing to lay off fee-earners and temporary staff, to retire without replacements, and there are various ideas of radically reducing the rights deriving from titles, grades and employment contracts. These ideas culminate in unlawful proposals on unpaid additional teaching work, on supplementing full-time and additional teaching work with low-paid honorary work, and the demand that university teachers themselves provide universities with funds for the research part of their salary, which is already contractually due to them. This is roughly equivalent to requiring judges to generate part of their salary themselves on the market by securing a reasonable number of disputes in which to dispense justice. The non-recognition of research work and the expansion of self-financing part-time study could begin the uncontrolled disintegration of higher education as a public service. The work of higher education teachers and staff has always included both teaching and research. For a full-time or part-time employee, only the direct teaching commitment is defined; the remaining hours up to the full-time commitment comprise the indirect teaching commitment (preparation, examinations, tutoring, etc.), research (as demonstrated by meeting the habilitation criteria) and management work (membership of committees, etc.). The point of the legal regulation limiting the direct teaching obligation is that university teachers and staff are obliged to devote their regular working time to research, the results of which they must prove at the time of their election: every university teacher, with the exception of a minority of full professors, must be habilitated (elected to a title) every five years, and must meet demanding criteria for scientific work. Since habilitation resulting from research is a condition for maintaining employment, it is legally untenable for universities to make this same employment conditional on the independent acquisition of external research funding. The task of a university is not to reproduce existing knowledge, but to create and disseminate new knowledge. Therefore, basic research in universities must have stable sources of funding. The provision of these resources is to be laid down by law, in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution. The Public Finance Balancing Act has allowed universities to modify their programmes autonomously. At first sight, it would appear that the State has thus given universities greater autonomy. In reality, however, it has given their managements all the power to rearrange, cut, merge and abolish study programmes at will. We would like to point out that such measures threaten not only employment, but also the quality of accredited programmes, the right of students to study in the programme in which they have enrolled and to pursue appropriate studies at a second level. We therefore call on the National Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Quality in Higher Education to problematise the reaccreditation of programmes if they are altered beyond recognition due to financial pressures or if they are implemented in a way that is not of the highest quality. Universities have insufficient human resources to carry out their studies, and at the same time the state, by withholding funds, is artificially creating a situation where there are suddenly too many staff. As this is a public service carried out in the interest of all the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, we will initiate the appropriate legal procedures in relation to the undermining of the rights of public employees in universities. We would also like to point out that the rights of students are also at stake. If, under the financial conditions of the rebalancing, an agreement between the Ministry and the student organisation was possible, it is an agreement to destroy public higher education, the aim of which is rampant privatisation. The Ministry's promises that there will be no tuition fees are unconvincing hypocrisy, and the agreement with the official student organisation on free full-time study opens the door wide to the restriction of full-time study and the expansion of self-financing part-time study. The quality of studies will fall. Since the conditions for accreditation by the National Agency for Quality are low, opportunities will open up for private operators, who will be granted concessions by the state on the basis of easily obtained accreditation, according to the interests of individuals and political-economic clienteles. We propose that the National Agency for Quality tighten the conditions for institutional accreditation and demand an impact on the level of concessionary funding granted to HEIs. Above all, it is self-evident to require full funding for programmes already accredited, which are delivered as a public service and which have also been accredited on the basis of cost and staffing needs assessments. This includes professional, administrative and technical staff, who were already on low pay grades and have fallen even lower as a result of austerity measures. These categories of workers have hitherto enjoyed the basic rights that come with civil servant status, rights that may no longer be taken for granted in the forthcoming reorganisations. The State is deliberately depleting public higher education. In the words of the Minister, ""the government is forcing rectors to behave as any crisis manager would behave"". This statement is obscene and shows a complete lack of responsibility for a key area of development, as well as a lack of understanding of the social mission of universities and the constitutional role of higher education in the Republic of Slovenia. Recall that the autonomy of universities (Article 58 of the Constitution) is also to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court in the light of Article 59 of the Constitution, i.e. ""primarily as the autonomy of professors to research and teach autonomously (independently), without restrictions and pressures"" (U-I-34/94). Furthermore, as public servants, employees of higher education institutions perform a public service for the population of the Republic of Slovenia. Unfortunately, the government instead advocates a market-based approach, with an emphasis on corporate governance, consumerism and the pursuit of short-term profit. In this situation, we wonder whether universities will be able to fulfil their role? Will it be possible, in the face of financial cutbacks, to maintain the universal accessibility of education and the level of quality expected by students and employers? How is it possible that universities are playing an increasingly marginal role in the coming 'knowledge society'? The disintegration of higher education as a public service will not only affect the teaching and professional staff employed in universities. Profit-oriented higher education will inevitably widen the social divide between an elite minority who will be able to provide their children with a quality education, and thus with social status and security, and the vast majority of the rest of the population, who will either not be able to afford higher education or will be forced into long-term debt All this gives the unpleasant impression that university and college leaders have been too quick to bow their heads and accept political pressures. We know that crisis management is nothing more than the informal transformation of the university into a business that will serve neither the staff, nor the students, nor the economic and other development of the community, but the interests of local cliques. We therefore call on rectors and deans to firmly reject the destructive role assigned to them by politics and to open a broad public debate on the participation of workers and students in the governance of public universities. We remind university and faculty leaders that employees will not accept a situation in which external financial pressures become an excuse to promote political and private interests within the institutions themselves. We inform the government and the management of universities and faculties that, in a situation dictated by rebel budgets, we may be forced to suspend the study process already this calendar year. We call on students to support us in our efforts to achieve free and quality public higher education,"" said the appeal signed by Marko Marinčič. (end)",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
131,"7. Fridays and Saints' Days <p/> First Friday and the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June. Renewal of our consecration. Maybe for the first time, maybe for the tenth time? For the Diocese of Ljubljana, Bishop Gregory Rozman announced the celebration of nine First Fridays in 1941. Seventy years have now passed since then. That is a long lifetime, but some ninety-year-olds can still remember this inter-war event. The Bishop was concerned about the growing unbelief among the people and he explained the devotion of First Fridays as making reparation to the Heart of Jesus for all offences against God and also against the Church. That year, the war struck with only the first sweep, and the anti-religious spirit had been obviously and secretly at work for a long time. The Bishop called for repentance and respect for God's commandments. Is this call unnecessary today? Let us take a look at two families that call themselves Christian. After all, it does not even matter how many children they have. In the first, the day begins around six o'clock in the morning for the parent, and a little later for the schoolchild. They don't even see each other in the morning. The parents have a quick morning coffee, no time to even cross themselves and they are already on the carriageway. They all have lunch together later in the afternoon, and the aces don't even say goodbye. In the evening, the TV news is on and the schoolboy has a pile of homework for the next school day. It's fast approaching, and because the boy is independent - as he has to be - he takes the time to heat something up in the microwave, have a quick wash and throw his nice, friendly, ""... good night, Mom. ' They go to Mass on Sundays several times and the boy doesn't feel bad at all at the service. But, he thinks, we don't pray much at home, even though Grandma often reminds us about it. They don't even have breakfast together in the second morning, but they pray first before lunch. They also pray together in the evening. On Sundays, they go to Mass in their own way, the parents are the readers of the readings, and the children are the singers and altar servers. The family resolution for the new calendar year is different each time, most often of a charitable nature. Neither the first nor the second family thinks particularly of the First Fridays, but neither of them allows anyone to dishonour any person or any religion. There are many families like this nowadays. If you put their religious life on a human scale, it would probably swing. Nor would a geometric measurement show the same line for the boundary of the spiritual. Let alone in families where there is hardly a whiff of faith left. What about those to whom faith is completely alien. What of those who are opposed to faith. The call to conversion is still needed. Perhaps ever more so. But it is necessary to know how to hear it. Yet, as loud and frequent as it is, it cannot touch ears that do not listen. The condition for a different way through the spiritual world is the willingness not to turn a deaf ear to Christian values and virtues. Faith is chief among them. Bl. It was very dear to Slomšek. He called it the light of faith, faith be your light. How precious light is, however, is best known in the darkness. Do we not find ourselves in darkness even when we cannot help ourselves in difficult circumstances? The smallest bit of faith can make it a little brighter. Trusting in God's mercy and help is that sliver of light. In the mystical vision of St. Faustina Kowalska, Jesus instructed her to pray much for the poor. She was a hidden pray for people she did not know. God would be caught in his own snare if he did not keep his promises. We have no influence on how and when they come true, other than our own perseverance in trust. All things work together for good to those who love God, says the Apostle Paul. Paul says in his Letter to the Romans (Rom 8:28), and adds. We must trust. On Fridays and holy days.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

149,"The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of the Franciscans of Kamnik, located in a corridor next to the presbytery of the monastery church, is a unique piece of Plečnik's art, full of symbolism. The plans for it were drawn up in 1952 and it was completed in 1954. More... <p/> The monastery chapel was used as a prayer room and for the installation of the Nativity scene and the Holy Sepulchre. The architect was assisted by the local pater Martin Perc. Previously, Plečnik had rebuilt the church in Stranja and planned the baptistery in Nevlje on the orders of Father Perc. Plečnik stripped the plaster from the stonework in the chapel and emphasised the intermediate joints. The stone wall is connected to the lower edge of the plastered surface by a corrugation, which has the function of a seam. On the altar table stands a monolithic tabernacle made of underbaked brick, with stone and brass candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle. Behind the tabernacle is a luminous circular screen. The ceiling is a timber structure made of logs, supported on timber lintels on timber cantilevers. Three chandeliers are fixed on each side of the sloping beams under the logs. This is the theme of the tent, which Plečnik took from the famous mid-19th century German architect and theorist Semper. The walls and ceiling are executed in the architect's characteristic late-period sgraffito technique. Inscriptions, symbols of Christ's martyrdom and geometric borders are included. The window looking into the church has a pair of double polished dark marble mullions on each side. Opposite the altar, a figure of the Crucified is mounted on an alabaster slab in a T-shaped frame. The handle on the door is in the form of a stylised dove. The chapel's furnishings contain a great deal of symbolism. Small metal lights, which some believe resemble military helmets, are arranged around the ceiling. They radiate a short beam of light upwards, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The beams on the ceiling of the altar part suggest the stable or manger of Christ, while the monolithic tabernacle symbolises the rock tomb of Christ. Thus, the cycle of Christ's birth, death and resurrection is symbolically completed. <p/> Dr. Andreja Eržen, historian, Director of the Agency for the Development of Tourism and Entrepreneurship in the Municipality of Kamnik, spoke on camera about the furnishings of the monastery chapel.",Information/Explanation,dev

You can find them by searching for general keywords such as: genealogy, genealogy, family tree, etc., or by narrowing your search to more specific search terms.

In this respect, the issue is one of shared causation. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The review is dismissed. <p/> Reasons <p/> The Court of First Instance rules that the defendant must pay the applicant SIT 2 460 020 in damages, with statutory default interest from SIT 36 660 from 1.4.1998 until payment, from SIT 3 360 from 21.7.1998 until payment and from SIT 2 300 000 from 7.3.2003 until payment. It further ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an annuity of SIT 2 000 per month from 1.4.2003 by the 15th day of each month for the preceding month. The Court dismissed the applicant's claim for higher relief. It held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damage suffered by the applicant in the accident of 28.1.1998. It awarded the injured party damages of SIT 900 000 for the physical pain suffered, SIT 200 000 for the fear, SIT 1 000 000 for the mental pain resulting from the impairment of his activity in life and SIT 200 000 for the mental pain resulting from the disfigurement. <p/> The Court of Appeal partially upheld the litigants' appeals and amended the judgment of the Court of First Instance by awarding the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, pecuniary damages of SIT 2 500 000, with default interest from 1 January 2002 to 7 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate less the base rate, and from 8 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in all other respects. It accepted the applicant's plea that the compensation for mental pain and suffering as a result of the injury was too low and awarded her SIT 400 000 for that purpose, while it considered the compensation for the other forms of non-pecuniary damage awarded to the injured party by the Court of First Instance to be appropriate. <p/> The applicant brought an appeal against that judgment on the ground of error of substantive law. The applicant requests the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia to uphold it and to amend the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejects the application, by awarding the applicant, in addition to the pecuniary damages of SIT 2 660 020 already awarded, SIT 2 000 000, with statutory default interest from 14.10.1999 until payment, and statutory default interest on the damages already awarded from 14.10.1999 until 31.12.2001. The applicant submits that, although the lower courts correctly established the factual situation, they subsequently awarded the injured party inadequate compensation for all forms of non-pecuniary damage. In awarding damages for the mental anguish resulting from the impairment of the applicant's activities in life, the Court of First Instance should not have followed uncritically the expert opinion of Dr W. that the applicant's classification as a category III invalid was only 20 % due to the physical injuries sustained in the accident and 80 % due to his medical condition. It was only as a result of the permanent consequences of the injuries sustained on 28.1.1998 that the applicant was classified in category III of invalidity, since he was no longer able to work. He was 48 years old at the time of the incident and will therefore have to endure the mental pain of reduced activity for a very long time. The Courts of First and Second Instance ignored the fact that the accident occurred in 1998 and that the defendant has not yet paid any compensation to the applicant. The decision on the commencement of interest on the pecuniary compensation for non-material damage is also incorrect. Neither the Law on Obligatory Relations (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 29/78-57/89, ZOR) nor any other law provides that interest on compensation for non-material damage is payable to the injured party only from 1 January 2002. In view of the stabilised economic and economic situation in the country, the monetary claim for compensation for non-material damage is payable after the expiry of a period of 14 days from the date on which the defendant received the claim and the documentation. The applicant sent the claim to the defendant on 29.7.1998 and the defendant received it on 30.7.1998, and has therefore been in default of payment since 13.8.1998. According to Article 277 of the Civil Code, a debtor who defaults in the performance of a pecuniary obligation owes interest in addition to the principal. The case-law to date has neglected the function of interest, which consists in the penalty for failure to comply with a monetary obligation in time. Such a decision is contrary to Article 17(1), (12), and Article 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code. <p/> The review was served on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and on the defendant, who did not reply to it. <p/> The audit is not substantiated. <p/> Pursuant to Article 370(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 36/04 - Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, p. 36), the review court and the parties are bound by the factual basis arising from the grounds of the judgments of first and second instance, and therefore, pursuant to Article 371 of the Civil Procedure Act, the review court examined the contested judgment within the limits of the ground raised by the reviser, namely error of substantive law. <p/> The fundamental principles governing the assessment of compensation for non-material damage are the principle of individualisation and the principle of objective conditionality of the amount of financial compensation. The principle of individualisation requires the determination of fair compensation in the light of the intensity (degree) and duration of the physical and mental pain and suffering and distress in the light of all the concrete circumstances of the individual victim. However, in accordance with the principle of the objective conditionality of the amount of pecuniary compensation, the court, in assessing it, must have regard to the importance of the good affected and the purpose of the compensation, and must ensure that it does not give way to tendencies incompatible with its nature and social purpose (Article 200(1) and (2) of the CPA). The Court of Second Instance, by awarding damages for physical pain (SIT 900 000), fear (SIT 200 000), mental pain due to the impairment of life activities (SIT 1 000 000) and mental pain due to disfigurement (SIT 400 000), found that the Court of First Instance had failed to award damages for the following reasons000) correctly met the legal standard of just pecuniary compensation, since the damages awarded are comparable to those awarded for similar harm and take into account all the applicant's individual characteristics, including her age at the time of the harmful event (see the reasons for the judgment of the Court of First Instance on pages 6 to 8 and the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Second Instance on page 3). As regards the mental pain resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the physical injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In that respect, the question of shared causation is one which the courts of the lower instances have resolved correctly in substantive law and in accordance with settled case-law. Since the applicant's current state of health or incapacity for work is also due to health problems which pre-date the harmful event, the defendant cannot be held liable for that part of the damage which is not attributable to the conduct of its insured. (1) <p/> The decision as to the commencement of interest is also substantively correct. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in a legal opinion of principle of 26.6.2002, adopted a position which ties the commencement of statutory default interest on a pecuniary claim for non-pecuniary damage (Articles 179-183 of the Law on Obligations, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 83/01, OZ, or Articles 200-203 of the Civil Code) to the entry into force of the OZ (1.1.2002), provided that an additional condition of delay in performance on the part of the person who caused the damage is also met at the same time. The applicant's legal position, which considers that it is in any event decisive when the insurer received the claim for compensation with the applicant's medical records, referring to the provisions of Articles 12, 17(1), 277 and 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code, is erroneous, since it would lead to unequal treatment of the injured party, contrary to the constitutional principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia) and to the principle of equal protection of the rights of the injured party (Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). <p/> The reality in the field of compensation litigation is that courts generally award compensation several years after a claim has been lodged. This reality means that, in the area of data on damages awarded by the courts, they reflect, among other things, a measure of the time lag between the moment of the decision and the occurrence of the damage. In other words, the amounts of damages awarded, which the Court used for comparison purposes, also took into account the factor of waiting for compensation as an important element. <p/> Since neither the grounds on which the revision was brought nor the grounds which the Court of Review is required to take into account of its own motion are present, the Court of Review dismissed the revision (Article 378 of the Civil Procedure Code). <p/> Footnote (1): The case-law on the issue of shared causation has been settled by a legal opinion adopted at the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia on 15.12.1998, Legal Opinions II/98, page 12.",Legal/Regulation,dev
186,"Zdenko Matoz, kultura Fri, 27.05, 22:29 The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain is usually received with reluctance at first, but by the end of the concert the audience is enthusiastic. The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain was formed 25 years ago and is mainly made up of BBC announcers Dave Suich, Peter Brooke Turner, Hester Goodman, Richie Williams, Kitty Lux, Will Grove-Whit, Jonty Bankes and George Hinchliffe. <p/> Known for their eclecticism, the band love to play punk classics such as the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, grunge classics such as Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, pop classics such as Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and classics such as Wagner's Hedgehog Valkyrie, and will be performing at Ljubljana's Križanke tomorrow, 29 May, at 8.30pm. We spoke to founding member and leader George Hinchliffe about this unusual orchestra and its musical approach. How do people react when they first hear your ukulele orchestra? <p/> Usually audiences hearing us for the first time have some preconceived ideas of what they're going to hear. They usually expect old swing music to clap their fingers to. We do put some hot jazz standards on the programme, but also rock, even grunge and classical music, and a lot of music that is hard to define stylistically. <p/> We're one of those bands for whom word of mouth does most of the publicity, or at least it has so far. Everyone who has been to one of our concerts comes to the next one with their friends so they can see how they react. Usually people expect our concert to be pretty okay, but then they overlook it and say - aha - get rid of their preconceptions, relax and enjoy the concert. <p/> Does it open up a new musical world for them? <p/> That's right. A well-known theatre producer was brought to our concert by his wife. We met after the concert and he said that he didn't actually want to go to the concert, but after the concert he was delighted because it was immensely entertaining. He pointed out that even though we only use the ukulele and voice in our concerts, we showcase our talent and our ability to entertain and communicate with the audience at a high level. <p/>I don't think there is anything wrong with our concerts, we love the ukulele, we love the music even more and of course we love a good time. And if we are having fun, the audience is usually having fun with us. <p/> How do other musicians see you when they see you playing these toy-like guitars? <p/> We've had a lot of compliments from musicians. We try to make sure that there is something for everyone at our concerts, from a wide range of musical styles and performance styles. <p/>We notice that some people can appreciate certain approaches and song arrangements, especially our famous mixing of musical styles, sometimes even in one song, while others cannot. Some like the humour, others enjoy uncovering the musical layers and pieces of the song that we mix. <p/> Is it difficult to stay serious with instruments like that? <p/> It's possible to be serious with any instrument. The ukulele is just an instrument. It can be played a lot, like an organ, a string quartet or a mobile phone. <p/> Sometimes we play with the misconception that the ukulele is a toy or a joke. Although we try to present our music in a fun way, it is played well and bouncy, ecstatic, sometimes even reaching to the heart. <p/> You travel and perform a lot around the world. How do audiences react when they see and hear you? <p/> As a rule, the audience reacts the same everywhere, in Japan, in the US, in New Zealand... Our concert at Carnegie Hall was rated by the New York Times as one of the five best concerts that year in that prestigious hall. We usually get a standing ovation and calls to play an encore or two. I wonder how our style of music will be received by the Slovenian audience. <p/> How do you go about reworking classical and pop pieces for the ukulele? <p/> We play all kinds of music. Classical pieces are first approached with arrangements, usually written by me, then it's the orchestra's turn. We have to find the right way to translate the symphonic orchestral sound into the sound of the ukulele orchestra - for example, the sound of the harp in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and the sound of the brass in Jezza Valkyrie were a particular challenge. Usually with special and not always easy techniques we successfully convey the spirit of the music. Sometimes the notes fit, as in a military march, but sometimes reinterpretation is necessary. Because we mostly respect the music and the lyrics, we take more freedom in the arrangements and the choice of musical genre. Have any authors ever been offended when they heard your version of their song? <p/> A few times it really came to our ears that some composers or record companies were not impressed with our version. But most of them like it because we pay them the copyright. (Laughs. ) <p/> Because we write our own songs and we are a record label, we can do anything. We've done live shows with Yusuf Islam, who used to be known as Cat Stevens, with the Kaiser Chiefs, and we were special guests on the Madness album. David Bowie said we're fun and clever, and Brian Eno said we could be the turning point or the end point in the history of modern popular music. That is a joke that only works in English. (Laughs. ) Has anyone been very impressed by your version? <p/>When we appeared at the same festival as Wheatus and they found out we were going to play their hit Teenage Dirtbag, they insisted that we join them on stage and we sang that song together. Your performances need skilled ears that know the history of both popular and classical music. Sometimes you combine a number of fragments of different songs into one piece. <p/>I am sure that someone who doesn't know much about music will easily enjoy our concert, but the music connoisseur will of course find additional pleasure and a range of undertones. You don't need any special knowledge to listen to our music, but if you have a little more knowledge, you can get more out of the concert. Many people say that our work is multifaceted, which means that the enjoyment can be multifaceted too. What kind of programme have you prepared for the concert at Križanke? <p/> A delightful, stomping, clapping, singing, dancing and enchanting journey through the history of music. As we say in English - ""one plucking thing after another"". We are on a world tour, travelling with hand luggage only, and we hope to give the audience at least some of what they expect, some of what they need, and some surprises they don't know they need.",Other,dev

203,"How does Daddy come into being? <p/>Fatherhood and motherhood are two emotionally completely incomparable and irreplaceable roles, which no one can replace and which are unique. A wife can never make a husband a father unless he chooses to do so and develops fatherhood himself. <p/> Every adult man carries within him the potential to become a father. What is more, nature has equipped the child with everything he needs to communicate to his father and mother how each of them should take care of him. With its smallness, softness, smiles, shaky cries and amorous glances, it arouses in the adult woman an irresistible impulse to lift the child up in her arms and respond to it, and in the adult man a strong impulse to protect and defend this creature. And this is the very foundation of parenthood. <p/> The mother cannot replace the father and vice versa <p/> The child therefore receives a different kind of validation and a different sense of belonging and uniqueness from the father than from the mother. Which means that even a father who feels well for his children and is tender and motherly with them cannot replace the mother, just as a mother cannot replace the father, however determined, organised, physically active and proud she may be. Therefore, a father cannot learn fatherhood from his mother and vice versa. He has to find out for himself, with each child, how he can be the best father for that particular child at that particular time and in that particular family, what that particular child needs most from him, what he wants to express and what is in him but cannot get out of him. <p/> The father-child relationship <p/> The father-child relationship is established from a very early age and is important for both the child and the father. Children are strongly attached to their father from the very beginning. It is precisely because of the differences in the way the child interacts with each parent that fathers play a completely unique and crucial role in the child's socialisation. Fathers play with their children, stimulating them physically and mentally and guiding them towards new activities. Above all, they protect them! The ability to create a secure home is the cornerstone of fatherhood. <The child associates the father with new experiences, with spontaneity and with challenges. They easily become interested in such a father and a reciprocal relationship develops quickly in such circumstances. During the first three years, the father's sensitivity, cooperation and support during joint play are particularly important in the child's later perception of close relationships. His sensitivity during play gives the child a sense of respect and support, understanding the toddler's needs for exploration and contributing to a feeling of competence. Playing with a father who participates, who notices challenges and who encourages the child to challenge, solve and explore, the child develops a sense of importance, uniqueness, trust and belonging to his father. <p/> Daddy does things differently <p/> However, many times it is very difficult for dads to watch mummy looking after the child, finding herself and him feeling awkward and unable to build such a strong and warm bond with the child. He cannot imitate her, because he can never do something like a mother, because he is not a mother. But he can find his own way around her, which will be just as reassuring and just as interesting for the child. This means that he should learn to change in a way that is most pleasant for him and for the child, that he should calm down in a way that calms him, that he should play and have fun in a way that is also fun for him and that makes him feel that the child is comfortable around him and that he can be proud of his father. Fatherhood develops separately from motherhood, the only common point being the partnership relationship, which, if it is secure and confidential, eases a lot of pain, distress and insecurity because the partners can talk about it. <p/> Mothers, tell your man you need him! <p/> Men are far from immune to babies! They are just as vulnerable as they are. Men cry too, but with silence, withdrawal, ... out of a need to belong. A wife can tell her husband to hold the baby, to swaddle it. She can tell him that she needs him. What is more, she must make sure that she is always relaxed enough to be with the child, which means that she also needs his help to get dressed in peace, to eat her lunch in peace, to take a nap if she is exhausted. <p/> Every normal man and father is proud if he makes his wife happy, if he protects her and if his child loves him. Fathers are proud when they put their child to sleep, when they feel how important, beautiful, clever and interesting they are to the child. Husbands can therefore very well introduce children to their chores, to their world, because the child will be amazed by everything, the keys on the computer, the screwdriver, a piece of wood, a book, everything that Daddy does will be sacred to him. When Daddy shows the child what he is doing, what he is interested in, when the child is able to ""help"" him, it will be a great honour for the child, and the man will experience his chores in a completely different way. <p/> Contact with the child is important <p/> The basis of survival today is contact, emotional attunement. If parents cannot provide this for the child, it is a great deficit for the child. It is very difficult to live with such a deficit in the world, because he or she is not good at relationships. <p/> If the partner is afraid of contact with the child (for example, if he refuses to change the baby because he is afraid he will do something wrong), the child's mother is best helped if she can put a humorous spin on it, e.g. if she dares to confide that this father loves her child as much as she loves him. This is the only way that the baby's mother will be able to relax around the baby's father and the baby and live her motherhood to the full, not in bitterness and anger at the baby's father who ""chose not"" to take care of the baby for his own sake, not because she is so incompetent. <p/> Parenting is learned alongside the child and making mistakes is not necessarily a bad thing <p/> Do not be afraid if you do not know everything at the beginning, if you do not know your way around, if you feel helpless. The child has everything it needs to awaken the right response in the parents. A child's nature is made to ""teach"" parents. You can only become a mother and a father by your child's side from moment to moment, not in advance or with the help of a book. As the child develops, so you develop with him as a father and as a mother. That is why the first condition for this development is precisely physical presence. Even if the mother develops a strong contact with the child, the father will have to develop his contact with the child from the beginning, not from where the mother came from. <p/> It is not at all good for the child to have a mother and father who think that they have to do everything right and that they are doing as it says in the book, not as it is written in the concrete child. There is only so much contact with the child before the parents have to develop new ideas, new words, coaxing, comforting and playfulness around the child. The child likes parents who are distracted and learning on the fly, and it is best for the child if the parents acknowledge this helplessness and confusion and know for each other that they can only manage what is emerging on the fly. A child does not need ideal parents, but parents with whom he or she can observe how they invent, how they create, how they find their way. It is a very good feeling for a child to feel that his parents are developing alongside him, that they are changing alongside him, not that they were perfect to begin with, so it is up to him to adapt to them as quickly as possible. <p/> Talk and cooperate! <p/> It is important for the child that the father is happy, that he has a lot of energy, that he is glowing, that she can feel in his eyes that he is alive. This means that he needs to talk to his wife about his fears and insecurities, so that they can talk together, figure out how to move forward together. The ability to confront feelings, to find new solutions, to be flexible and creative develops most easily where a man and a woman are safe around each other and do not make excuses for each other. Then the child will call out for more and more discoveries and will continually reward both father and mother with its own development. This will make them each feel adequate, creative and content, which in turn will help them to be more connected and trusting towards each other. Then both of them will be able to be more and more sensitive, relaxed and loving around the baby, and their relationship with each other will grow ""unintentionally"". <p/> Fatherhood and motherhood develop most fully where a man and a woman are able to work together. A man can only become a father when he has developed his masculine identity to the point where he feels what the child needs from him as a man. In cases where the father does not decide to become a father and does not enter the family emotionally and actively, and consequently the mother takes over the whole parenting role and tries to emotionally take over and fill the father's role as well, it quickly happens that she also loses contact with the children. Fatherhood is the father's sole responsibility and motherhood the mother's sole responsibility. We cannot destroy each other's parenthood, but we can make each other so bitter that we do not even want to look for a parental role anymore. That is an injustice to the child. Parents deserve to feel fully each other's parenthood, but even more deserve to feel that the child loves them and that they are capable of loving the child too. <p/> So let mothers be mothers and fathers be fathers.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

225,"16 March 2010 - We have just five years to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is therefore calling for world leaders to adopt a global action plan at the UN Summit in New York this September to accelerate the achievement of these goals. <p/> ""We must not disappoint the millions of people who look to the international community to deliver on its promises in the Millennium Declaration. Let us come together in September to deliver on those promises,"" Ban said in his Keeping the Promise report, released today. <p/> For the Millennium Development Goals Summit on 20-22 September, the report will serve as the basis for intergovernmental agreements on the Summit's outcome document. The report identifies success factors, good practices, highlights gaps, highlights future challenges and makes proposals for action to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs over the last five years. Further complementary reports are expected, including an annex to the Secretary-General's report in April with basic statistics on the implementation of the MDGs. A more detailed report with statistics on the implementation of the Goals will follow in June, followed by an overall assessment of the shortcomings of international cooperation in early September. <p/> ""We have the knowledge and the resources to achieve the Millennium Goals,"" Ban stressed in his report, referring to the goals of the Millennium Declaration of 2000, which aim to end poverty, hunger, disease and significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by 2015. <p/> The report notes that some countries have made great strides in overcoming extreme poverty and hunger, increasing school enrolment and child health, expanding access to safe drinking water, strengthening control of malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and expanding access to HIV treatment (for more information, see Millennium Development Goals: A stocktaking exercise). <p/>These successes are being seen in some of the poorest countries, proving that the MDGs are indeed achievable if we have the right policies, the right level of investment and international support. <p/> Progress has not been the same everywhere, however, and the report predicts that many countries will not reach the goals. The greatest challenges are faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, and countries facing internal unrest. <p/> The report points out that the MDGs are not being missed because the targets are unachievable or there is too little time, but rather because of unfulfilled promises, inadequate funding and a lack of accountability. The result is a failure to provide financial incentives, services, technical support and appropriate partnerships. As a result, progress in poverty eradication has been unacceptably slow, and some of the hard-won successes are being eroded by the food and financial crises. <p/> Good practices <p/> Global action to achieve the MDGs has been underway for almost ten years and a number of good practices have emerged. The most important of these are development plans at national level. Successful countries are pursuing a pragmatic policy mix, focusing on their own development capacities. International development cooperation needs to support more intensively such national development strategies and actions to strengthen their own development capacities. <p/> Of course we need economic growth, but it is not the only condition for progress. Growth must be inclusive and equitable if we are to achieve optimal poverty reduction and real progress towards the MDGs. <p/> Hard-won progress can be undone by economic and other shocks. Countries need forward-looking macroeconomic policies that can promote balanced growth across the board. For example, the Millennium Goals can be achieved through sustained public investment and development strategies designed accordingly, and universal social protection. <p/> The report stresses that financing for the MDGs must start 'at home'. Developing countries must raise and allocate their revenues accordingly, and donor countries must deliver on their promises to increase ODA. Although development aid reached its peak in 2008, countries are still largely failing to deliver on their development aid promises. <p/> Countries pledged around USD 154 billion in ODA at the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and have not kept their promises. They have under-pledged by $35 billion a year and under-pledged by $20 billion for Africa. ""If promises are not kept, the poor suffer and die in even greater numbers,"" the report points out. <p/> The report outlines a number of promising government proposals to ensure adequate funding for the MDGs, including a new financing mechanism for better health systems and a new global approach to food security, which was elaborated at the 2009 G8 meeting in L'Aquila. These proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible if we are to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and lay a solid foundation for the G8 and G20 meetings in Canada in June 2010. <p/> At the same time, innovative financing schemes must continue to be developed and the MDG Summit in September this year must establish a transparent mechanism to promote the delivery of global development aid pledges. Such a mechanism must have its own action plan with timetables, forms of monitoring and enforcement. <p/> UN Secretary-General Ban calls for a new 'compact' that is not just government-led, but inclusive of all stakeholders, developed and developing countries, civil society organisations, private business, philanthropy and multilateral systems. Each of these stakeholders must strive to make the most efficient use of its own resources. They must act effectively and collectively. This September, the Summit will officially take place as a high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. It will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen collective action and partnerships to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. <p/> ""In September, we will come together to build on the achievements of the past years and to address the existing gaps. We have a shared responsibility to shape a better future for generations to come,"" the Secretary-General stressed. ""Achieving the MDGs is only possible by delivering on our promises, with the right policies, financial incentives and sustained action.""",News/Reporting,dev

262,"News <p/> Archive <p/> Data protection with second-generation deduplication technology <p/> Monday 13 August 2012 <p/> Proper data protection is like an insurance policy. Most of the time it is not cashed in, but it is crucial if problems or damage actually occur. The cost of ""insurance"" in data protection is not only the cost of the equipment and its maintenance, but also the negative impact on business processes if, for example, archiving or restoring data takes too long, if data in remote locations of the company is not adequately protected, or if things are simply not regulated according to the law. <p/> As a direct response to these issues, technologies emerged a few years ago that have had a significant impact on improving archiving processes. In addition to the significant cheapening of hard disks, the development of data deduplication technology has been crucial. While the first generation of this technology brought some benefits to users, it was known even then that most of its potential still lay ahead. HP's deduplication development strategy was launched in 2010 and today the second generation of deduplication delivers improvements in areas such as performance, scalability and data management. StoreOne technology, as it is called, is based on a single deduplication algorithm developed in HP labs and runs on all HP hardware and software data protection solutions. In other words, deduplication technology can be implemented on the HP B6000, HP D2D2500 and HP D2D4000 series of products, and is fully supported by HP Data Protector archive software. A quick look at the main competitor, EMC, quickly reveals that its solutions are based on three mutually incompatible platforms (Data Domain, Avamar, Celerra) (Edison Group report, 2011), which is a stark difference to the single, unified architecture offered by HP.<p>Where does the shoe pinch the hardest when it comes to data protection? <p/> There is a general consensus that the following areas are particularly critical in relation to data protection, and that they weigh on users in one way or another: <p/> Time windows available for archiving <p/> The biggest challenge is to archive more and more data in less and less time. HP is responding to this with what it calls a ""scale-out"" architecture, which allows users to buy only the capacity and performance they really need, rather than having to buy both categories in stock. At the moment, HP's scale-up ends with 768 TB of gross capacity and an archiving speed of around 100 TB/hour. <p/> Data recovery after catastrophic events <p/> It is essential that data is stored in locations that allow it to be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event. There are a number of options for data replication over low bandwidth data links, as only deduplicated data travels between sites. StoreOnce technology allows data deduplication to happen wherever it is desired, either directly at the application or source where the data originates, at the archive server, or directly on the device where the data is stored. Deduplication can, of course, happen before the data is transferred from one location to another, so multiple copies of the same data can be archived in multiple locations at the same time. <p/> Protecting data in remote locations <p/> For companies that operate in multiple locations or even in multiple countries and continents, data is widely dispersed and often not sufficiently protected. With StoreOnce technology, data can be accessed or restored from a central location, no matter where it is. <p/> Data recovery capabilities <p/> Investing in archive solutions means nothing if data cannot be recovered in a reasonable time. Most vendors still focus mainly on archiving capacity, but forget about recovery and usually do not even publish this information to avoid embarrassment. HP's solutions are very much at the forefront here, offering speeds of up to 30 TB/hour, the highest among comparable solutions. <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst (API toolset) is a new enhancement to archive solutions and allows deduplicated data to be moved directly from the archive application between StoreOnce systems, without the need to ""rehydrate"" it first, i.e. bring it back to a baseline state. StoreOnce Catalyst also allows replication of data from one location to multiple locations simultaneously and cascading of data between locations in a deduplicated format (leveraging narrow bandwidth connections). StoreOnce Catalyst technology is also integrated into HP Data Protector 7 software, making it particularly suitable for smaller businesses. <p/> Integration into your environment <p/> StoreOnce technology is widely supported (it is supported by a growing number of market-leading archiving software solutions), so you don't need to change archiving software if you don't want to, for example, when you buy a D2D2500 system. But if that's not a barrier, there are a number of good reasons why you should take a closer look at HP Data Protector. HP Data Protector uses the StoreOnce deduplication algorithm, which makes it easy to transfer deduplicated data to any StoreOnce hardware. <p/> 2. Data Protector supports contextual search of archived data, which means that data with specific content can be recovered, not just data with a specific naming convention (filename). This is made possible by the integrated ""Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL)"" from Autonomy, which has been under HP's umbrella for some time. <p/> What about archiving to tape? <p/> For long-term data archiving, tape drives continue to be offered in a wide variety of configurations, as there is still a significant demand for them in the market. The fact is that long-term archiving to tape is still by far the cheapest option.",Promotion,dev

266,"Business <p/> Cisco's smart desktop phones, widely used by business users, have a serious security vulnerability. At the Chaos Communication Congress in December, researchers Ang Cui and Salvatore Solfo from Columbia University (USA) showed how a small device can be connected to the phone's serial port and loaded with malicious code that allows an attacker to take complete control. This allows the attacker to remotely monitor phone calls and turn on the microphone to eavesdrop on conversations in the room. <p/> Everyone does something stupid at some point. Most of the time, without much consequence, because it stays behind four walls or between four eyes. On the Internet, it's a little different. What appears once on the Internet stays there forever. Even if you delete a thoughtless statement, photo or whatever, there is a good chance that it will still be written down or stored somewhere. ""Look at it this way. Everything you do on the internet is like a tattoo that you'll never be able to erase,"" says Steve Tobak in Business Insider. It would be hard to find a better comparison. <p/> A year after the launch of the Piano system for charging for access to news online, which 11 Slovenian print and online media have signed up to, the sceptics have been proved right. While they would need between 10,000 and 12,000 monthly subscribers to survive, in practice they have been achieving only around 15% of that target in recent months. Igor Vobič in Medija preži reports that between 1,500 and 1,800 users pay a monthly subscription to Piano, which, taking into account the sharing key, represents a failure for all participants.

269,"Proposal for a Spatial Development Strategy (SPR) for the Municipality of Radovljica <p/> J.U.: On the margins of the public debate held on Wednesday, 10 January 2007 from 6 to 8 p.m. <p/> All municipalities in Slovenia are in the middle of a planning process. By July 2007, they should have brought their respective spatial planning acts, which are extremely complex in terms of procedure, into line with the new legislation. Since only a few municipalities are further along than ours (we are in the middle of the beginning), is it to be expected that either the deadline will be extended, or the government will just manage to do as much as it can, and finally, for once, reward those who can do it by the deadline, and the rest ...? <p/> Undoubtedly, these processes are and will be the first serious planning in more than 20 years, in other words: it is an extremely challenging undertaking for the administration, the general and interested public and the planning profession. Since 1980 (self-management), we have been ""tinkering"" with the spatial and environmental planning system on the basis of the non-market economy, which - surprisingly - has been quite good in some parts. <p/> As far as our municipality is concerned: need it be pointed out that the administration's management has approached the matter left-handed in terms of substance and procedure? It simply does not have the expertise in cases of major dilemmas! <p/> Yes, that's the way it is when bureaucrats ignore the rajas! All the indications are that this planning will receive the same treatment as the dog excrement ordinance, which is of course not news in Radovljica. Last night, the Director, in a low-key rhetoric, respectfully stressed the importance of the process and the document, but only actions count. <p/> Let us stress: <p/> everything in the municipality revolves around space. Other departments are also important, but not as fatal as encroachments. The only complete department of the municipal administration, staffed by professional, educated and administratively proficient employees, looks as if they have been successfully weaned off professionalism and accustomed to subservience to politicians, like the MOL, ""when everyone is busting their ass"". This is due to a misguided governmental logic (we are in charge now, if something is not right, we will show that this is the only possible and even the only right thing to do, that is why we have PR) and a touch of servility, only the first silence and eaten professionalism will suffice... <p/> The materials under discussion do not testify to the care of a good steward for the emerging creature, in fact, it could even be argued that something (the ALCs) was explicitly not allowed to be included in it. <p/> Even the operational meetings of the administration with the spatial planning authorities (e.g. KS, sectoral, e.g. agriculture, housing, etc.) could have yielded more if they had been properly conceived and committed to. To be clear: the administration is the planning authority, and the documents are drawn up together with a specially paid team. And if something is left out or selectively drafted, we - with their superficial ""reading"" of our space - are the ones in trouble. If such a document is commissioned and its content dictated by politics, then we are far from a profession (Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth ... ), nothing changes (except for the worse). <p/> What is also missing are proposals from those responsible officials (aren't we making too many synecdoches? ! ) who, in their official capacity, are the first to be responsible for making proposals (obligations of laws, decrees, contracts: local infrastructure, culture, education, etc.). <p/> The situation does not show the slightest concern for the mayor (excused absence abroad, where are the two vice-mayors? ) or for the director of the administration, who should have a project manager, and above all, be trusted to do so. The process thus has no profiled promoter ('municipality', mayor, director, head of department, chairman of the spatial planning committee? ! ) and does not even receive the necessary publicity. If you sell, advertise! There is no campaign, logo or sign that something fatal is in the pipeline to involve as many people as possible in the processes, and consequently a greater involvement of the disciplines. The time around the New Year is, of course, not the right time for unveilings. The administration is merely covering legal formalities, not the substantive reasons for extending the festive blackout. <p/> What stands out from such superficial processes is the ""redundancy"" of planning in the light of the parallel ad hoc actions promoted (elections), and the ""pro forma"" content of the ""development coalition"", the voting machine of the only good thinker who will lead us to paradise anyway, is a little annoying in the new mandate. <p/> Not to mention the occasional carping about the adopted and approved development platforms 2007 - 2013 (we are going to the region for EU money ... ), which are not yet recognised as typical political documents for daily use. <p/> We can be quite calmly critical, because the product under discussion (the decree) speaks of the politicisation of purely professional tasks. The formal inclusion of the CFs (do we have them for that?) and the exclusion of the 11 ""development opposition"" councillors of the municipal council is living proof of paper democracy, or of the scenario of how ""Janko"" (who is the ""broomstick"" here? ) imagines a wonderland where we will all be living like in paradise.... <p/> Everything points to the fact that the understanding of the preparation of the emerging document is reduced to an administrative minimum, everything that exists today without propaganda, if it really is not indispensable, practically does not exist. <p/> (J.U.: more information on the contents will be presented periodically, the public debate is open until 15 January 2007, more information on the decree and the background is on the CoR website). <p/> The public debate, the proceedings and the controversial contents are reported by the main municipal media (website) amongst ""other things"" with only a cursory information on the hearing, the documents are attached. That this is not enough is shown by all the poorly attended hearings, but nothing by the administration! <p/> We will wait with interest to see what the Provincial News has to say about the procedures and processes. It is not worth pointing out that the administration has not taken care - apart from the filming, to which we have been warned a couple of times by the Director of the administration - of the ""public relations"" which otherwise covers the Mayor's every step (ec). Or is it? <p/> HERE'S an excerpt from last night's debate, to prove how recently ago some people took the now fatal spatial interventions lightly and politicised them, and how ""everything"" is politics (only how will they justify them tomorrow? ): <p/> ""... Radovljica's landscape will be by far the most damaged by the semi-tubed AC of all the interventions. The unnatural embankments on both sides take away from the plain what is most valuable and distinctive, or add something alien to it ..."" / Statement by a representative of the KR Institute for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, ... who also informed us that we have insufficiently illuminated pedestrian crossings ...?/. <p/> (J.U.: Madam, just where was she during the mayor's ""semi-digging"" into the AC problems? <p/> Another, this time verbal, proof: <p/> Semi-deepening is of course not ""deepening"" and more than obviously nothing good, useful can be born out of ""semi-(itic) deepening"". <p/> We have evidence, look out of the car window when you drive down the main road ...).",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

276,"Memories <p/> Memories <p/> After the war we lived on food, textile and other necessities. But just because you had a card didn't mean that you could get the goods you needed. Our mothers were queuing outside the shops long before they opened. Hardly expected and essential goods for families were not always in perfect condition. The flour was often (as we used to say) ""alive"". <p/> This meant that moths had invaded it. We did not throw away such flour either. My mother would fry the flour in a large pan on a hot fire to kill the animals, then sieve it on a thick sieve and that was how we used it later. <p/> I also remember what underwear was like in those years. There was no elastic in the underpants, just a plain ribbon, and we had to tie our underpants with it. When the underwear got proud and tore, it would be patched up. It was also often the case that double underpants became single underpants. Men's shirts were also mended. The bottom part was cut off and the collar and cuffs were redone. <p/> Socks that could no longer be mended were also cut above the ankle and a part of the other socks was added. So, once again, a new pair was made from the double worn-out socks. <p/> The dresses were not ready-made, but were made for us by seamstresses who may or may not have been trained in this profession. The dresses were sewn for the children in such a way that the length could be extended by at least 10 cm. We children grew quickly and a dress sewn in this way could grow with us for some time. When we outgrew the length of the dress, a new piece of fabric was inserted into the sleeves, usually in a different material and pattern to the original dress. <p/> Coats were made in the same way. When we outgrew them, despite the lengthening, they would fray and the cloth would turn the other way and be sewn into a new coat for the next child... <p/> Without spots and without cards, we could buy tennis shoes on Partizanska Street near Borovo. These were summer shoes that were made of rubber underneath and canvas on top. They were usually grey in colour. We children brightened them up by painting them with white chalk. I don't know how we got the paint to stay on, we must have got the chalk wet. <p/> In the summer we also wore special summer slippers, which were made of cornhusks. We could get them for free (no tickets). The slippers were so sharp that we often had bloody toes. <p/> In the summer we also wore ""spaghetti shoes"", which were made by a shoemaker. They were made of felt (strong felt), grey in colour. The felt was connected to the sole by a shoelace.

Because he could no longer keep up with the work and the salaries, he terminated our contracts of employment. The problem is that to date we have not received our severance pay, and he owes us three or two more recourse payments. Now, when we go to him to ask when we are going to get this money, we always upset him. He says he has no money. But he has suggested that we should file for bankruptcy. We do not think that is necessary. <p/> In my previous company, I resigned regularly. The director did not give me permission to take 5 more days of the old leave, nor to take a pro rata part of the new leave, but she gave me a decision stating that the pro rata part of the leave would be paid out, but that I still had 5 days of the old leave left??? The pro-rata part was 12 days, because I left my job in June 2009. I would like to know what is the basis for calculating the value of these 12 days of leave, or is it my gross salary. Should I also be paid for my old leave, given that she has refused to respond to my written requests? <p/> When my maternity leave ends, I will move from an 8-hour working day to a 4-hour working day with the same employer. When do I need to sign a new contract, how long before I start work? I will take one more period of annual leave before I actually start work. I would like to know whether it is normal to sign a new contract after the end of the leave, so that the leave is still counted as 8 hours of work - I mean in terms of pay - or to sign a new contract already during my maternity leave (in which case, of course, the start date of the 4-hour work period is given with the end of my maternity leave and the leave is counted - again, I mean in terms of pay - as if I had worked 4 hours at that time)? <p/> In this case, is it sufficient to sign an addendum to the employment contract with the employer? Or do I have to arrange anything else with the CZS? <p/> The annex includes how many hours per day/week the worker will work and the period during which the worker will work part-time and that the worker's working hours are from 8am to 12 noon. And during the period of part-time work, the worker is entitled to be paid for the work done according to the actual work commitment. Is this sentence on pay written correctly? There is no mention of transport to work, payment for snacks, time for snacks, recourse. Is it taken for granted that I am entitled to it as you stated in your previous answer or as defined in the employment contract, or does it need to be further defined and specified in the annex? If necessary, please help me with what it should say. <p/> Dear Sir or Madam, I would like to ask for your help or if you could give me your opinion: I am employed part-time by two employers. I have no problems with one employer, but I have a problem with the other employer: I have been working 4 days a week for 5 hours (verbal agreement, nowhere written down, the contract says flexitime and 20 hour week) and have accumulated about 120 hours of extra work by working Fridays and Saturdays (training, work meetings, etc.) and by coordinating various projects. Now his only offer is not to pay me the hours but to extend my contract and make up the hours and leave during the summer holidays, but there are some demands he is making that I cannot agree to and would prefer to have the hours paid. <p/> Leave: I have a few days left on my contract. I have repeatedly asked him verbally if he will give me written permission to take the rest of my leave. He ignored my request. On the day I was supposed to bring him the written request, I fell ill. I emailed him to ask him to approve my use anyway, but after five days I have still not received a reply. I also mentioned to him that I had already been granted leave from another employer before the end of my contract. So I am forced to take sick leave, even though I would prefer to take my own days, as sick leave is only paid for 90. Hours: I want my hours to be paid. I have seen in one of your letters that there is no such thing as overtime, which is paid from 130-150. Since he is ignoring my e-mail, any agreement with him will no longer be possible and I will probably be forced to go to court. <p/>Questions: 1. Can I sue him for unused vacation days, given that I have neither an approval nor an explanation for why he would not approve it nor an agreement to compensate me for unused days? Would he necessarily have to give me at least one of those things? Until when? At the moment, I have only two requests by e-mail and no reply. What happens if you simply take the leave without consent AND if it is less than 5 days before the end of the contract, that is to say, even an extraordinary termination is no longer possible? 2. As regards hours, I have a computerised timesheet for the last time for the month of May, which clearly shows the use of leave and the contribution of hours, so that the hours are demonstrable. I will also request a statement of hours for June. Does he have to pay me the hours at my recalculated hourly rate of pay, or can he just set the price of my hours as he sees fit? His idea once was that my overtime hours were worth €1 per hour. 3. What is the possibility of paying for these hours, given that I am his part-time employee? Is a subcontract the only option? I have the option of being paid through a private institution of which I am a co-founder and where I am employed for the other half. Is it possible to simply do a cooperation agreement? Is this legally sustainable? 4. What options do you think I have in terms of hours and leave?

I have been employed by my last employer for 5 years and I have received an annual leave decision for 22 working days, 20 days of basic leave, 1 day for professional complexity and 1 day with my last employer, compared to 26 days last year. Have I been deprived of this leave and how much am I entitled to? <p/> I have been offered a part-time job, i.e. 6 hours a day (as a result of the new calls for tenders from the Social Security Agency to subsidise shorter working hours). <p/> On an 8 hour day, my gross salary would be somewhere around €550 plus transport and snacks. Since my employer has opted for 6 hours a day, I am now wondering how I can calculate the drop in salary that comes with working two hours less a day. <p/> So the 8-hour wage is known. What is my possible salary for 6 hours? I have no dependants and I only claim the earnings allowance of less than €8300 per year. Is this calculation simply proportional or are there coefficients for this? <p/> I am also interested in all other contributions. Are there any reductions and which ones? Transport? meal allowances? Pension fund? <p/> I wonder at what age a woman is protected so that the employer cannot dismiss her (so that she is then on the SPIZ)? Can she fire older workers indefinitely to get a younger team?

I wonder by when I have to decide to do this and if I do, can I change back to 8 hours a day at any time after that (if I can't financially cope, for example). <p/> I am writing to you because I am on notice at work.

292,"Lithuania wins, National TV disgraces <p/> The European Junior Basketball Championships concluded yesterday after ten days of competition, with Lithuania winning. After an unfortunate loss to France in the quarter-finals, then to Germany for 5th place, our national team managed to beat Greece yesterday by a huge margin for 7th place. So, out of nine matches, our team won seven and lost two. I am quite satisfied with what the younger members have shown, because they still have a lot of basketball challenges ahead of them, but I am much less satisfied with the coverage of the matches on our national television. <p/> I have to admit that this was the first time I watched the European Junior Basketball Championships, as in previous years I didn't even follow basketball that much, but that changed with the 2010 World Championships. So now I watch our national team whenever I can and I can say that I have never been as disappointed with TV Slovenia's coverage as I was with this year's European Championships. The whole event took place in Slovenia, with matches in Kranjska Gora, Domžale and Ljubljana. The first match was played by the younger members of our national team on Thursday 12 July, when the championship kicked off, against Italy. I did not even know that the matches started on that day, even though I follow TV SLO 1 and 2 quite a lot, because I did not see a single announcement for the championship, as I did, for example, a month ago for the football championship or now for the Olympic Games. It seems that they are much more interested in commercials than in viewers, and the junior championships are obviously less important than the senior championships. But after the Italy game, the news reported: <p/> RTV SLO will broadcast the matches on TV SLO Channel 2 and on the web portal from Monday, when the second round of the competition starts. <p/> Quite interesting, as the competition took place in Slovenia and next year we will be hosting the 2013 European Basketball Championship for Members, also hosted by Slovenia. This deprived me of watching the three games on television, but with the upcoming championships, we could prepare for the best possible coverage in the future. As I mentioned, there was no trailer, and thus no major publicity for the championships, so I missed the first day of the second part of the competition. Fortunately, at least they were posting news about it on their portal, so I caught the end of the second match of the second part. From then on I thought everything would be fine, but it wasn't. I watched the very next match on TV SLO 2 HD and the coverage was so disastrous that I can only wonder what will happen next at the 2013 EP and what will the performance be like then. During the broadcast, the picture was interrupted several times so that only the commentator could be heard, and the footage of the last actions at the beginning and end was played with such a blackout that the whole thing was unwatchable. <p/> After the unfortunate defeat against France, when our national team was still in contention for 5th place, I was already looking for the next broadcast, but I could not find it on the schedule or on any of the channels the next day. There are actually four channels - TV SLO 1, 2 and 3 and the online channel, MMC TV - but none of them had the coverage that many of us who followed the championships missed. The most surprising thing is that after the end of both the 5th place match and the France race (which took place at a time when there could have been coverage on TV SLO 2), there was a clip of the European Football Championship, instead of which there could have been a clip of this match. Fortunately, for the last match for 7th place, they only arranged for a broadcast, which still (for me at least) did not justify the mistakes that they should not have made. <p/>I only hope that for the 2013 European Basketball Championship, coverage will be provided, not only for our team's matches, but also for other matches, because it is nice to see other teams playing as well.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

The players of Elektra Esotecha then showed great fight and heart in the meetings between the eight best Slovenian teams, for which we would like to publicly congratulate them. They managed to beat two participants of the regional league, one of them even in both meetings. Our players also played well in the other meetings, securing their place in the top half of the Champions League standings. Considering the fact that we started this season with a new coach and a thoroughly renewed and rejuvenated squad, the club did not expect that we would even have a chance to fight for a place in the play-offs. That is why the club's management is already publicly congratulating the team on another great success, because regardless of the outcome of the matches in the last round of the Champions League, we will be among the top five Slovenian teams, where we have been for the last three seasons. This is certainly a great success for Elektra Basketball Club, as all the better-ranked teams have a budget from two to ten times bigger than our club's. <p/> On Wednesday, 9 May 2007, the 13th round of the UPC Telemach Champions League took place. In this round, Zlatog and Elektra Esotecha met in a very important match in a local derby. The tension on both sides was high, as the match was almost decided on the third place of the national championship, but at the same time, due to the nature of the local derby, there is always some uncertainty in the mutual meetings. The match was won by the home team after an even game, for which we congratulate them and wish them every success in their future participation in the regional NLB league. <p/> We cannot avoid commenting on the officiating by the representatives of the Basketball Referees Association of Slovenia. In the first quarter of the meeting, when the refereeing was at its most correct, the players of our team were more than a worthy opponent for the favoured home team. However, from the beginning of the second quarter onwards, the judging criteria changed. The changed criterion, which was very clearly against Elektra Esotecha, was most clearly enforced on the floor by referee Dragan Gojkovič from Ljubljana. Even one of the best Slovenian and European delegates, Aleš Kamnikar, did not react to the changed judging criteria. <p/> We would like to point out that this season we have often been satisfied with the officiating, and a few times not so satisfied, but we have taken the decision not to bother with the referees and the officiating. But what referee Dragan Gojkovic allowed himself to do in the middle of the match goes beyond all the unwritten rules on tolerance of refereeing errors, which are based on the nature of their work. Dragan Gojkovic made what we consider to be a number of unusual and unfair refereeing decisions during the match, which he then made some compensatory decisions to mitigate at the very end of the match, when the winner was already decided. This kind of judging and compensation is certainly not honourable for a referee who officiates matches of the highest level. However, in order not to criticise, we would like to publicly praise the young and promising referee Uroš Kolar, who refereed the whole meeting correctly and fairly. <p/> The coach of the Elektra Esotech team made the following official statement after the match: ""I admit that I am guilty because I believed that hard work in the hall - even five or six hours a day - can bring results. Unfortunately, I found out that only stories from behind the scenes and cooperation with various grey eminences count. Today, I am asking the referees how it is possible to make 31 personal mistakes with 'rough' play, even though we were in a zone defence for 35 minutes. How is it possible to have a ratio of 31:20 for personal fouls and 18:35 for free throws. When we made eight free throws in the last minute of the game. I was able to go into the dressing room and look my boys in the eye, who were still in tears 10 minutes after the game. If only someone else had the courage to come into our dressing room and shake their hands for their tremendous play and incredible fight. I made this statement consciously, even though I know that the Premier League Players' Association made a decision before the season not to talk publicly about the trial. ""<p/> The management of Elektra Basketball Club fully supports Bojan Lazic's statement and we expect the Slovenian Basketball Referees Association to explain in this open letter how such a blatant fiasco by the representatives of the referees' organisation could happen in such an important game. At the same time, we expect an answer as to why some Slovenian referees want to decide the winners of the meeting instead of the players on the floor? <p/> In the hope that in the future the refereeing on Slovenian basketball courts will be more coherent, we would like to welcome you and at the same time to inform you that this year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of basketball in the Šaleška Valley and next year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Elektra Basketball Club. We would like to let you know that, based on the rich tradition in the Šaleška Valley, quality basketball will continue to be played in all age categories, regardless of the subjective opinion of individual referees as to how far the success of our club can reach. <p/> On behalf of Elektra Basketball Club and with the full support of the club management.",Other,dev

332,"How is sex marketed? <p/> Adjectives that traditionally market sex well are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and especially tantric <p/> In the early 1990s, massage parlours sprouted up all over our young homeland, where ""professionally trained"" masseuses kneaded the bodies of men, most of them bed-ridden and stressed, eager for invigorating exotic massages: Thai, Chinese and Malay, ordinary and specialised, hand and foot. Was it really in the perfumed, dimly lit rooms that the oldest craft was practiced? The lion's share of the clientele would answer this question with a hand on the Bible, in the words of former US President Bill Clinton: ""We did not have sex with those women. ""The hired girls did, in fact, massage the clients to the best of their unprofessional abilities, and if a part of the client became unexpectedly stiff, they would simply do what was in the job description manually to relieve the client's tension. And that was it. Massage parlours did not, in principle, engage in conventional sexual intercourse, but that does not mean, of course, that what the lay public understands by the technical terms of blow jobs, hand jobs, spankings and whisperings did not take place there. In short, the owners of Slovenian massage parlours behaved in accordance with the political correctness of Western Christian civilisation, which tolerates many things, but not calling it fucking. Or it tolerates the presence of sex in its midst only if you put it in an artistic, installation, authorial, artisanal, institutional, aesthetic, cosmetic or spiritual context. Sex as such is not desirable. Hence the circus around pornography, prostitution and similar phenomena, which are not really about anything in terms of substance. <p/>The adjectives that traditionally market sex well, together with its side-effects, consequences and problems, are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and, in particular, tantric. Tantric sex is a hit. It has infiltrated the terminology of the psychiatric profession, it has taken over the tabloid media, it has possessed dissatisfied housewives who dream of nirvanic continuity and dissatisfied gentlemen who muse at the thought of eight-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour erections, even though they have no idea what they could achieve with their stream limbs in that time. One thinks of His Holiness Guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh, whose revolutionary approach to tantric themes forced him to leave his spiritualised mother India in 1981 and settle in Oregon, USA, with a vast fleet of custom-built Rolls Royces. His Holiness set up a Tantric commune in the middle of Oregon, which traded heavily in enlightenment, and became famous for not granting quantity discounts to even the most wholesale buyers. When names from the music and film show business lined up, many paid obscene sums just to stand in line. And it was only a matter of time before the epicentre of practical Tantric philosophy would move to sunny California, where believer-friendly religions were springing up on a daily basis, and then, like all American fads, it would come pounding down on the old continent and, by extension, Slovenia.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

345,"Description <p/> How do Dawn Journey lollipops work? <p/> Dawn Journey lollipops contain ginger and peppermint extracts. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) helps to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with using a means of transport, while peppermint (Mentha piperita) contributes to the normal functioning of the digestive tract. For best effect, we recommend taking the lollipop half an hour before travelling. <p/> What is travel sickness? <p/> Seasickness, or travel sickness, develops as a result of conflicting information being sent from the senses to the brain. The senses are adapted to collecting information from an environment that is more or less stationary. When this suddenly starts to move when travelling in a boat or driving a car, the information reaching the brain via the optic nerve does not match the information transmitted by the balance organ in the inner ear. <p/> Travel sickness is much more common than it may seem at first sight. It is more common in children, but becomes less common with age. <p/> Tips for travel sickness in a child <p/> In the morning before travelling, your child should eat a light, warm meal. This prevents irritation of the stomach lining and contraction of the stomach walls due to hunger. <p/> Make sure the car is well ventilated before travelling, as bad air and heat aggravate travel sickness. <p/> If the journey is short, do not give the child food or drink during the journey. If he/she is very thirsty, he/she should drink plain water. Do not overdo the food. <p/> Place the child in the central part of the boat, bus or plane, on the centre line, facing the direction of travel. <p/> Do not give the child books or games, do not let him/her watch cartoons or films on DVD. When sailing on a boat, work and general lingering below deck is discouraged. <p/> Try to distract the child as much as possible during the journey. Try to actively engage the child in conversation or play word games with the child that require close observation of the environment as the vehicle passes by. You can also play a fairy tale on CD to distract the child. <p/> Try to remain as calm as possible. Children often feel nauseous precisely because they sense their parents' fear of nausea. <p/> HOW TO USE: <p/> 1-3 lollipops a day. The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. The food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. A varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle are important. <p/> WARNINGS: <p/> Lollipops are suitable for children over 4 years of age. All ingredients in the lollipops are suitable for younger children, but younger children should lick the lollipop under parental supervision. <p/>STORAGE: <p/> Keep out of reach of children!

361,"Ljubljana, 28 November (STA) - The results show that a methodologically adjusted calculation would reduce the internal rate of return of Tesla 6 from 7.59% to 6.91%. Unsubstantiated assumptions allow risks to increase and, if they materialise, the rate could even fall to 5.12 percent, Geert Warringa of CE Delft said today at a presentation of the methodological flaws in the investment programme of Tesh 6. <p/> Such a rate of internal rate of return is far below the nine per cent required by the government in April as a condition for the state guarantee. ""Therefore, the project should not have received state support in the form of a state guarantee,"" pointed out Lidija Živčič of Focus. <p/> The report states that there are some methodological errors in the investment calculations for the construction of the sixth unit of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš 6). Lignite prices are underestimated, lignite consumption is underestimated from 2028 onwards, and CO2 costs are underestimated because process emissions from desulphurisation plants, which will be auctioned after 2020, are not included. <p/> The programme also assumes that the efficiency of lignite extraction will increase, but this assumption is not justified, the report points out. The result would be undervalued lignite prices. Another unjustified assumption, according to the report, is that the peak electricity produced (1000 GWh) will always be in demand on the international market, Warringa noted. <p/> Ms Živčičeva noted that the report also states that the investment programme does not follow the principles of cost-benefit analysis because no realistic alternative for the investment is given. ""The investment programme neither proves that the investment in unit 6 is the best alternative, which should be supported by a state guarantee and the risk should be borne by the state, nor that Teš 6 is the best alternative for energy supply in Slovenia,"" she said. <p/> Piotr Trzaskowski of the CEE Bankwatch Network pointed out that the involvement of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the project is not proof of a reliable economic assessment of the project. He warned that previous Slovenian governments had failed to do their homework and that if the project is granted a state guarantee for the EIB loan, Slovenian taxpayers will pay for their mistakes with their own money. <p/> ""Now that new errors are being revealed in the calculations of the economic bases for Teš 6, the two public European banks have the opportunity to recognise their initial mistake and withdraw from this bad project while they still can. If we add to the errors identified in the report the errors in the procurement of Teš 6, we see that this project has the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the EBRD and the EIB,"" Trzaskowski stressed. <p/> The report was commissioned by the environmental organisations CEE Bankwatch Network and Focus, with financial support from the European Climate Foundation, and prepared by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. <p/> The report will be sent to current and future parliamentarians and government representatives. <p/> The CE Delft report confirms that the Teš 6 project is ""an economically misguided or unjustified investment"", according to Zares Vice President Darja Radić, also a former Minister of the Economy. She recalled that, as a portfolio minister, she had proposed to the government to reject the state guarantee for Teš 6. Among other things, she had stated at the time that the project was economically too risky on key parameters - the price of coal, the price of CO2 credits, the size of the investment and the price of electricity. <p/> As Radićeva also wrote in a press release, the CE Delft report found methodological errors by the investment promoters on the first two parameters: the price of coal and the price of CO2 credits. They conclude that the coal price is underestimated and the cost of CO2 emissions is also underestimated.",News/Reporting,dev

I have a wheelset Mavic Crossride with flat spokes :-) I have also noticed that they are mostly 2mm and I have also seen 2,2. But they usually come in silver or black. Last time I was shopping in a shop in Litija in LJ (I won't advertise) I even got black nipples for 2mm, but luckily they gave me one nipple over, because it turned out that one of them was without a thread :-) <p/> Yeah, you'll probably have a lot of fun with that too. I find it very sad, though. I have no words at all. At least for the bikes they sell, they could have stock for all models, even past ones. I couldn't choose the colour, although black would have been spot on as you can see from the video. <p/> In principle, they have spokes in all bike shops, if they have a bike service next door. If they have a spoke that is the same as yours is another question. If your spoke thickness is the classic 2.0 mm there should be no problem, you just need to find out the length. <p/> Hi David, if you have a cracked spoke on the gear side you will have to remove them. otherwise it won't be possible. Removing the gears is quite easy, but it is true that you need tools. You can see how to remove the gears in this video http://bikebook.si/2011/03/zadnje-pesto-shimano-xt/",Forum,dev

The SIPINA-E-Reader system is able to recognise the speech of users (speech commands and supported speech management) and enables the delivery of information in the form of speech. It connects to the SIPINA cloud-based system via a WiFi connection. <p/> The figure shows the functional architecture of the SIPINA system. The system is based on the concept of distributed processing and technology clouds. The main guiding principles of the SIPINA system architecture are: <p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), <p/> SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System).<p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System). <p/> Structure of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> Technical characteristics of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> SIPINA-E-SPEAKER enables a high quality and efficient delivery of speech modality services. SIPINA-E-SPEAKER consists of a Java GUI and several modules that provide the necessary operation and communication with the SIPINA system: for audio, the tcp/ip protocol, and the RTSP/MRCP communication protocol. For all interaction, the user needs nothing more than a microphone image. The microphone colouring and the audio signal signal the user when the system expects a response from him. While the system is playing the system message or information requested by the user, the microphone is inactive and does not allow control by the user. This ensures that the system speech is not recognised as user speech, which can be a problem with mobile terminals. <p/> The SIPINA-E-RECORDER is designed as a TCP/IP client. It consists of software to run on Android, Blackberry mobile phones, and also platforms such as tablets. The system is based on the Java programming language for mobile terminals. SIPINA-E-BRALNIK allows remote reading of information, if possible connecting to a WiFi network. The functional specification of the software is given in this document. The functionality of the individual modules is also described. <p/> SIPINA-E-RADER dialogue <p/> The dialogue in the SIPINA-E-RADER system is system-managed. The system defines the individual dialogue states and offers the user a set of choices in each dialogue state. The user can select from the given choices and thus determine the further course of the dialogue. The system messages, which are played to the user by the system in the form of voice messages, provide the user with all the necessary information to choose the continuation of the dialogue (self-declared system messages). The user can determine the continuation of the dialogue by speaking individual words or short phrases. The system messages include instructions on which words the user can use to continue the dialogue in a certain dialogue state. <p/> The user of the SIPINA E-BRALNIK system can choose between the following news sources: Radiotelevizija Slovenija, 24ur, Delo, Hefajst. For the selected source, the user can select the news areas covered by each source. The names of the areas for the selected source are transmitted by the system to the user in the form of a system voice message. At the same time, the speech recognition system's grammar (the set of words that the speech recognition system can recognise) is adapted to allow the recognition of the words of the areas of the selected source. The headline of the first news item of the selected source is then played after the selected area. The user can initiate the reading of a news item by saying the word ""read"" or the reading of the title of the next news item by saying the word ""next"". The user can trigger the reading of the title of the previous news by pronouncing the word ""back"". In each dialogue state, he/she can choose to move to another area (pronounced 'another area') or another source (pronounced 'another source').

387,"Interview by the President of the Republic Borut Pahor for Večer <p/> Maribor, 16 May 2013 | interviews <p/> "" I have spoken in Paris and Berlin. Then ..."" <p/> I cannot impose myself on the parties, says President of the Republic Borut Pahor in Večer. Selling companies, yes, but also the bad bank, the fiscal rule and the referendum regime. Brussels is waiting for that. Is the situation so serious that we need an army in front of the palace? <p/> Reporter: Katja Šeruga <p/> Really? The Slovenian Armed Forces Honour Guard will be stationed in front of the Presidential Palace on national holidays? You have decided so. How so? <p/> ""In my capacity as President of the Republic, I have been thinking from day one in the direction of the full regeneration of civic consciousness and belonging. That is what we lack. Even when it comes to purely practical action in a crisis. It is about a sense of self-confidence, of belonging to a community. I think that is what we lacked during the transition. It was lost when we were running after other goods. But now it seems to be very important. For our self-confidence and to cope with the circumstances in which we find ourselves. "" <p/> So serious that we need an army in front of the presidential palace? ! <p/> ""No. It is just that we have to realise that we have had a country for 22 years, that its symbols are a sign of our sovereignty and that they deserve a proper place. Both in our memory and in their presentation to the public, that they must be respected. And if we say that, because of the crisis, which is not only financial and economic but also moral, some old, traditional values are modern again, then it seems to me that, in its own way, it is also modern again to pay due respect to the symbols of statehood. ""<p/> Does this decision of yours entail any additional costs? <p/> "" No. "" <p/> Have you checked? <p/> "" This discussion is at least as old as the country ..."" <p/> ... your predecessor also thought about this, but had to change his mind. <p/> "" It was always thought that a guard of honour would be permanently stationed outside the palace. It would be there every day between 8 am and 6 pm. That would certainly not be financially neutral, as will the fact that it would - at least for the time being - only apply on public holidays. We shall see how our people react to this. ""How do you think they will react? <p/> "" I think very well. Because it is not about cost, but it is also an expression of sovereignty. Paradoxically. This decision comes at a time when there may be a suspension of that sovereignty with foreign help, although my thesis is that there will not be a suspension, that we will solve the problems ourselves, albeit through the eye of the beast. "" <p/>What do you mean? Since you are in Maribor, let me ask you this: is the troika already at Šentil? <p/> "" No. It is still in Brussels. The European Commission will issue a report on 29 May, which will go to the European Council for a decision at the end of June. The government has sent a strong signal that it is committed to consolidating public finances and to measures to stimulate economic growth, with some measures such as higher VAT and the successful negotiation of public sector wage cuts. But if I may take the liberty of assessing these measures, without prejudice to the competences of the government... I am missing two things. One is a much more active role for the state in the creation of the bad bank, where there is a series of activities in the transfer of bad debts. This would have let the European Commission know that we are serious about the rehabilitation of the banking system, which is a major stumbling block in our economic and financial regeneration. Secondly, and I may be wrong because I am not informed, I think that politics these days is significantly under-preparing for the end of the month, when Parliament will decide on the new referendum regime and the golden fiscal rule. The European Commission and the European Council are watching very closely what is happening here, particularly with the referendum legislation. You will recall that already on 14 February, at a meeting with the party presidents, which I hosted and chaired, it was agreed that the issue of the referendum regime would go through, but then one of the opposition parties (SDS, op. cit.) said that the fiscal rule had to be decided on before that. There is really no need to argue here about whether this party has that right or not. Without it, there is no two-thirds majority. However, the golden rule for two-thirds decisions is that the opposition sets the rules. That has always been the case. What is more, I believe that the year 2015 could have been written into the Constitution when the fiscal rule was introduced."" <p/> It is not possible. The coalition, especially the ruling party, is firmly in favour of 2017. That is when the rule should be implemented, that there is no way to a balanced budget before then. <p/> "" The Fiscal Compact allows for a transition period, which in our case would be made possible by an implementing law. No one expects the government to have to resign if it does not achieve a deficit of 3% in 2015. Anyone would understand that this cannot be achieved if the macroeconomic circumstances are actually deviating, if, for example, even a third major recession were to break out. Other countries are also familiar with such deviations. Therefore, I find this quibble about the year to be superfluous. I would have preferred to see a focus on the conditions of the transition period. I well understand the government and the Prime Minister that it would be inappropriate for the government to decide, at the price of rapid deficit reduction, to intervene brutally in the social fabric of the population, thereby also hurting the prospects for economic recovery in the long term. I have spoken about this during my visits to Berlin and Paris, and they understand our dilemma. ""Is it true that you went to Berlin and Paris convinced that the changes to the referendum system to reduce the possibility of referendums when it comes to reform issues would be faster and that the fiscal rule would come into force in 2015? That you promised that to Paris and Berlin, and then there was no meeting on 6 May on these two topics? You did not know? And another thing: during the campaign, Mr President, you were all betting on the involvement of politics. Only together we can do it, you said. Now, however, your cooperation with the Alenka Bratušek Government has not exactly got off to a good start. <p/> ""The cooperation between the government and the President's Office is still exemplary ..."" <p/> ... still exemplary? <p/> "" It is exemplary. But the fact is that after 14 February, when I personally took responsibility for ensuring that the parties were united on three issues - ratification of the accession treaty, labour market reform and referendums - all the parties were no longer in favour of me as President taking a similar role on constitutional change, but felt that it would be better if this process remained within parliamentary life. This means that I can encourage party dialogue, but I cannot lead it and bring it to an end. I went to Paris and Berlin after talking to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. I was confident that on 6 and 7 May Parliament would approve the decision on referendums and the fiscal rule. I have told you frankly that I am concerned that this decision, which may also be complicated, has been postponed until the end of the month. I also believe that the parties should already be talking intensively about this now, but I am not informed that they are. If the parties consider that I can help, I am prepared to do so. But I can see their adherence to the February agreement on changes to the referendum arrangements slowly melting away. It would be irresponsible of me to ignore that, and I think that people voted for me also because I have the experience of being Prime Minister. We can get out of the crisis, but we also need to agree on the fiscal rule and referendums."" <p/> Excuse me, the people also voted for you because you made a firm promise to bring the warring political forces together. Now you are telling us that the parties will not even allow that? That was your key election promise. <p/> "" You must admit to me that I have fulfilled it sooner than I thought. February. More as a joke than for real, we calculated that it took me 25 and a half hours just to coordinate with the parties to reach an agreement. ""Already, already, but the result you want is not there. At least not yet. <p/> ""Back in February, one of the party presidents (Igor Lukšič, op. a.) said that the February meeting was legitimate, but that he was not in favour of the President of the Republic interfering in party life. Until this position changes, I have no mandate to impose myself on the consensus of the political parties. I cannot impose myself, and the Prime Minister knows exactly that I always tell her that I am also here to help her if she thinks that my help is needed. You should know that I put the joker on the table in Paris and Berlin. I said that I would pledge my word that this government would succeed in meeting the expectations of the financial markets and the financial institutions. That no aid would be needed. Do not think that such visits can happen every month, because they cannot. And do not think that you can say that if the facts put you in a different light. If the parties have a clear interest in enforcing the fiscal rule and changes to the referendum regime, they need to start talking about it now. I take the opportunity of this interview to call on the parties themselves, or with my help if they think they need it, to find a solution to get the fiscal rule into the constitution and changes to the referendum regime. "" <p/> "" No, because it does not affect my work and the commitment with which I do it. But I think that the Office has calculated that my salary will be reduced by 263 euros as a result of the agreement with the public sector unions. ""It will not stop there. You will also pay higher taxes. <p/> "" Yes, and that is right. "" <p/> How do you feel when you read in Večer, when your salary is going to be lower and your taxes are going to be higher, that Zoran Janković has obtained a loan of EUR 250 000 from a bank that is not a state bank to cover a EUR 300 000 overdraft, which is something that someone without a real surname cannot obtain? How, Mr President? After five years of crisis and debate, what is there to give up, even for anomalies that, at the end of the day, we all pay for. <I will not comment on this particular case, and you will understand very well why. I will, however, remind you that I was not among the last to say that the value focus of this crisis is a sense of injustice. The only good thing about the crisis is that it has ended a dangerous process of transition that would have wrecked our society to the core, because the trend towards rampant privatisation and looting would have continued. It is also true that the nation's defence mechanism has been awakened. The people are even braver to act than the politicians at the moment. They have come to the common-sense realisation that this crisis is going to take us down, so politics now has more room for decisive action than it is taking. ""But the government has gone ahead with the announcement that it will sell 15 state-owned companies, including the bank. NKBM. Thanks to the SD, the hysteria called national interest may happen again. <p/> "" Please do not let there be anyone among your readers who would like the Troika to sort things out in the country. These are very crude decisions, purely in the direction of austerity and nothing in the direction of promoting growth. We will not be asked anything about privatisation either, about any interest. We are in Maribor. You mentioned NKBM. I have to say this to be credible. When my government's term of office was coming to an end, contrary to my opinion, AUKN misjudged things. It ordered state-owned companies, in the name of the national interest, to recapitalise NKBM at a share price that no sale today will achieve. We have lost a lot of money by doing so, and today we will sell NKBM at a much lower price than it was possible to recapitalise it with private capital at the time. And do not forget the small shareholders who believed in the bank and bought shares. There will be a lot of discussion about this in Maribor."" <p/> Also lawsuits, probably. <p/> "" Particularly in the case of NKBM, it is important to listen to small shareholders when selling. "" <p/> So you are in favour of selling state shares? <p/> "" Yes, absolutely. "" <p/> We recently heard in the German-Slovenian Chamber of Commerce that a German investor was ready to build a factory and create 200 new jobs in the north-eastern part of Slovenia, which is being battered by the crisis. Do you know why not? Because the municipality was not prepared to negotiate seriously on the price of the land. In the end, the investor walked away. To Slovakia. Is this the Slovenian way of creating jobs and attracting foreign investors? <p/> ""In Paris, French businessmen told me that Slovenia is an absolutely attractive country for a number of reasons - geopolitical, transport, value, security. But it has such a complex bureaucratic structure that it takes courage in the middle of the road. Then they go to Slovakia, where everything is simpler. But I am not in favour of going to the other extreme, of giving up all the regulations that protect the environment and the Slovenian worker, for example, but there are a whole series of completely unrelated regulations that are being abolished by all governments, but at the same time they are being redone. Simplifying the legal system is one of the essential tasks of the current government. We need to realise that we have made the country too expensive and too complicated. At a meeting with the mayors in Oplotnica, the mayors told me that investors end up coming to them too, and they cannot even explain what an investor has to do in order to be able to do business and employment in their municipality. "" <p/>You also said in that meeting with mayors that municipalities are an important pillar of stability in the country. Really? All 211 municipalities? <p/> "" The cost of discussing which municipality should be abolished will be much greater than the savings. It will be a political cost, it will be a material cost, and you will upset people. And you know that I have been a supporter of fewer municipalities all these years ..."" <p/> ... because that is exactly why. <p/> "" But today I have to estimate that if the question of reducing the number of municipalities were to be raised, we would also raise the question of which municipality to abolish, how many municipalities to abolish. We would be fighting people, we would be fighting parties, and the savings would not outweigh it. "" <p/>To draw the line slowly. We have had a crisis for five years, and you have been Prime Minister for three years in that time. Your most fatal wrong decision, which we are all paying for today, was? <p/> "" You were there when I said that. When neither you nor your colleagues expected such a sincere confession. That I realised too late what a fatal problem the banks are. I admitted it, I think, in January 2012."" <p/> No. I remember that. It was just before the presidential election. After you fell off the horse. <p/> "" Exactly. After the holidays, in September. I did not pay enough attention to the bailout of the banking system because of the preoccupation with Croatia. Even then, Minister Lahovnik proposed a bad bank, and I agreed with him, but both on condition that the bad bank would be made by NLB itself, not imposed by the state. Whereas, for example, Minister Gaspari advised against the creation of a bad bank at the behest of the state. At that time, we had about three per cent toxic claims in the banks, now it is about one fifth. I told the Prime Minister frankly that I knew she had reservations about the bad bank, that when the PS was still in opposition she was considering a referendum on the bad bank, but that now the bad bank had to be set up. Do we have a better solution than the recapitalisations that have already been tried and have failed? Beware, this is fatally linked to corporate over-indebtedness. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Bank of Slovenia also let off all the brakes on lending. No one considered whether these companies would be able to repay these loans. In 2009, however, we ran aground on over-indebted companies, which were further hollowed out by the crisis for their development."" <p/> "" You are now taking advantage of my poor character to make sure that I do not miss an opportunity to be quiet. I would not be surprised if the Commission said that it was giving Slovenia extra time to implement the things that it had announced but had not yet implemented. That would be a relatively favourable outcome. "" <p/> Do you expect a lower score? Alarm? <p/> "" It could be worse if the decisions on the referendum regime and the fiscal rule do not go through. A relatively favourable outcome on 29 May would reassure financial markets and the other two rating houses (S&P and Fitch) would not follow Moody's. But we have to be honest. But if the Commission had proposed to the European Council fines for Slovenia, which would have cost €35 million or a percentage of GDP, and a programme to correct macroeconomic imbalances, perhaps another rating house would have been moved. This would mean that Slovenia would virtually no longer have access to international financial markets. """,Other,dev

411,"How harmful is one cigarette? <p/> Doctors warn of dangers of a single cigarette <p/> Anyone who thinks that an occasional cigarette won't harm them is honestly mistaken. So-called ""social"" SMOKING and passive SMOKING, i.e. SMOKING where you inhale cigarette smoke from other smokers, can also be harmful to your health. These are as dangerous to the blood vessels, heart and lungs as regularly SMOKING several cigarettes a day. <p/> People tend to fear lung cancer when they smoke, which usually takes years to develop, but cigarette smoke starts poisoning our bodies with its 7,000+ chemicals as soon as we take our first ""smoke"". Damage is caused to the cells of almost every organ. ""That one smoke can be the cause of a heart attack,"" explains Regina M. Benjamin, a well-known American surgeon who advises people to avoid smoking, as well as second-hand smoke. <p/>A recent report on the impact of cigarettes and cigarette smoke says that any inhalation of cigarette smoke is harmful to health. Dr Terry Pechacek from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warns of the dangers of passive smoking. Inhaled cigarette smoke immediately enters the bloodstream and changes its chemistry, making the blood more sticky and putting it at immediate risk of clots, especially if the person has a pre-existing blood vessel problem. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals, 43 of which are known carcinogens. There are also several toxins in the smoke, such as nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, etc. Within six seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine reaches the brain. In small amounts it acts as a stimulant, but in larger amounts it already interferes with brain function and affects the heart, blood vessels and hormones. <p/> L&M makers reveal cigarette ingredients <p/> An American tobacco company has revealed a long-kept secret about the ingredients in L&M cigarettes, which are also available on Slovenian shelves. The move by the Liggett Group follows efforts by the state of Massachusetts to require all manufacturers to disclose all cigarette ingredients on cigarette packs, which most tobacco factories have so far resisted. Liggett believes that every consumer has a right to know what they are buying. In addition to tobacco and water, L&M cigarettes contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, natural and artificial liquorice flavour, menthol, artificial milk chocolate, valerian root extract, molasses and vanilla extract and cedarwood oil. There is also glycerol, propylene glycol, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid and 3-methyl-pentanoic acid. Although tobacco companies send a list of the ingredients in cigarettes to the Department of Health and Human Services, government officials are not legally allowed to give out information on this. Sound like a conspiracy? <p/> Other dangerous ingredients in cigarettes <p/> For anyone who wants to quit smoking, the following list of ingredients already found in cigarettes by experts would no doubt help to sway the decision: <p/> Ammonia: an ingredient also found in some household cleaners <p/> Angelica root extract: causes cancer in animals <p/> Arsenic: an ingredient in rat poison <p/> Benzene: Used to make paint and synthetic rubber <p/> Carbon monoxide: poisonous gas <p/> Cadmium: contained in batteries <p/> Cyanide: deadly poison <p/> DDT: banned insecticide <p/> Formaldehyde: used to preserve dead animal specimens <p/> Naphthalene: an ingredient in mothballs <p/> Methyl isocyanate: a poisonous gas that killed eight thousand residents of Bhopal, India, in 1984.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

425,"How to buy a phone <p/> A normal smartphone is the same in hardware as a computer from a few years ago. Because we always have it with us, it is a powerful productive tool that is always at our disposal. Computers have made us more efficient, why not smartphones? <p/> With hundreds of millions of smart devices and the same (if not less) productivity, the main question that arises is whether it might all be too much? We carry a games console, a web station, a music box, a mailbox, a navigation system and the list goes on. Too often, we choose a phone because it is overloaded with features, and we end up using only five per cent of the hardware and software. The situation is reminiscent of the power ratio in word processors, where Microsoft Word is still the leader, even though most of us use only a handful of bundled features that could easily be covered by any free alternative. As with tablets, the most important thing is to know what we want from a smartphone. <p/> Choosing a smartphone is, at first sight, very similar to deciding on a tablet companion. The operating systems are almost all the same, they have the same applications, advantages and disadvantages. In principle, there is no difference between a phone and a tablet. In addition, it is wise to have both devices in the same camp, so that we do not buy apps twice and do not catch ourselves while working with the user interface. Unfortunately, it turns out in practice that smartphone buyers do not make their choices based on hardware. When they buy, they often even overlook the attractive design and usability of the bundled apps, because the pace at which devices fly off the shelves is dictated by mobile operators, which is why sales figures for different phones vary so much from country to country. If the country's biggest mobile operator drops the price of the best Finnish Nokia model to one euro at the time of bundling, it will outperform, say, Samsung's champion overnight, even though the Korean sells like hotcakes around the world and nobody wants a Scandinavian Windows phone despite its excellence.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

451,"US urges Romania to defend independent judiciary <p/> Bucharest, 11 January (STA) - The United States today urged Romania to defend the rule of law and expressed concern about attacks by politicians on the independent judiciary. Victoria Nuland, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, criticised the Romanian authorities and warned that ""an independent judiciary is essential for a strong democracy"" during a visit to Bucharest. <p/> After years of total impunity, several high-ranking Romanian politicians, including former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, have been convicted of corruption and landed in prison in recent years. This shows, according to analysts, that the independence of the judiciary in this Balkan country, which has been an EU member since 2007, is strengthening, albeit slowly. <p/> ""You have made great strides forward, especially in the last five years, and I call on all Romanians (...) to fight even harder to defend the independence of the judiciary and to keep it out of politics,"" the high-ranking US guest stressed today in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean, the French news agency AFP reports. <p/> The Austrian news agency APA adds that the Romanian authorities, expecting harsh words, had already warned the US before the visit not to raise the issue of Romanian justice and reminded that Romania is not an American colony. But this did not seem to stop Nuland. <p/> Her words referred to the Romanian Parliament's attempt to provide a kind of ""super-immunity"" to MPs and local politicians by amending the Penal Code and the law on amnesties and pardons. This would also protect incumbent politicians from possible corruption charges. In addition, politicians already convicted of corruption could be pardoned, APA writes. <p/> The US immediately branded the attempt at the end of December as ""a step away from transparency and the rule of law"", while the EU and several of its members, including Germany and France, also expressed concern. In the end, Bucharest only caved in under pressure and postponed the adoption of the law until February, but it has not yet been abandoned. <p/> Further discontent was caused by statements by Socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a sworn opponent of the conservative President Basescu, in which he accused the special prosecutor for the fight against corruption, DNA, and the integrity body, ANI, of being subject to the ""Basescu regime"" and of ruling unfairly. Last week, the Prime Minister even compared the recent second corruption conviction of Nastase to the imprisonment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine. <p/> The situation in Romania was most acute last year, when Ponta's centre-left coalition tried to oust Basescu by referendum.

454,"Closing ceremony of the Fabula Festival <p/> To close the successful Fabula Festival, which this year was crowned by the visit of Scottish literary star Irvin Welsh and his performance in front of a packed CD Club, the organisers invited three Slovenian authors and one female author to speak (and read). Stanka Hrastelj, Milan Kleč, Marko Sosič and Dušan Šarotar talked about myths, their influence on our everyday lives, their importance for literature and our (un)conscious involvement in mythical worlds. On this occasion, a collection of short fiction Myths of Our Everyday Life was published with one story from each of the invited authors. <p/> It is not entirely clear why these four authors were invited to participate. Were the organisers guided in their selection by the intrinsic and substantive merits of the selected writings, or was it more than a random selection? Given the diversity of the four stories collected, which sometimes have almost nothing in common with myths or are simply a negation of them (Stanka Hrastelj), the second option seems more likely. Nevertheless, at least for Dušan Šarotar and Mark Sosič, judging by their reflective answers, the subject of myths is not alien to them and served as a good starting point for the emerging story. <p/> Dušan Šarotar pointed out that interpreting myths is something he does all the time, because myths are nothing but memory, and we are all made of memories. Myths, he said, also connect people in time and space, define a community through time and give it meaning and solidity. Marko Sosič agreed that in the field of the unconscious as well as the conscious, we are entwined in Slovenian folk traditions and ancient myths. However, he stressed that we need to develop a critical attitude towards the mythical images of Western society that serve as models and ideals. In order to face the present time and ourselves, Sosič said, we must acquire the distance necessary for critical reflection. <p/> Stanka Hrastelj focused on the female characters that define the Slovenian mythological field. She reflected on two in particular: the beautiful Vida, who seems to be the obvious choice, and the figure of the Cankarjan mother - a suffering mother and wife who sacrifices herself for a man and expects his eternal gratitude in return. This figure - as the author has rightly observed - is still very much present in our society. In writing the short story, however, Hrasteljeva did lean on the character of the beautiful Vida, but added a twist in the form of a happy ending. The author also pointed out that myths serve as a mirror to explain our behaviour, because they are rooted in the behaviour of humanity. <p/> Milan Kleč did not say much. During Šarotar and Sosič's debate, he provided a comic interlude with a story about a skylark that had wandered onto his balcony and was persistently making noises there, disturbing his (peace of mind), as such a squawking was supposedly a harbinger of death. The tale of a heroic confrontation with a winged peace-builder in a residential neighbourhood and its subsequent removal - combined with Kleč's tormented appearance, as he acted as if he would rather be anywhere else than on the stage of the CD Club at that moment - gave the hundred or so visitors to the evening a good laugh. Tina Kozin, who asked the same questions to all the guests, did not let herself be confused and, when it was Kleč's turn to answer again, she cleverly adapted the question to the author's narration (and situation). <p/> At the end, each of the invitees read an excerpt from his short story, with the exception of Milan Kleč, who decided to read a poem by the recently deceased Matjaž Kocbek instead of his own story. Marko Sosič chose the legend of the Lady of Devin as the basis for his story ""Contempt"" and set it in the currently very topical theme of unemployment and the resulting feeling of shame Milan Kleč's story ""Krakow"" describes the fulfilled wish of a poor student and waitress who pays her way to this Polish city and a supernatural exchange, which happens at the end of the story Dušan Šarotar, in the story ""Among the High Clouds That Will Sing"", set the action in Sobota and framed it with the fascination with the stars and the many folk beliefs about the stars that are still present today Stanka Hrastelj - as mentioned above - told a modern story about the beautiful Vida with a happy ending. <p/>Myths are an extremely broad and rewarding subject, and there is, of course, much more that could be said about them. As Marko Sosič pointed out, myths are born out of man's attempt to understand the world, but despite the remarkable scientific advances of recent centuries, man remains essentially the same, as does his need for stories to make sense of the world. <p/> The Fabula Festival 2013, which celebrated its tenth anniversary, has come to a close. It is a pity that the tradition of awarding the Dnevnik Fabula, Slovenia's only literary prize for the best original short fiction collection, has come to an end this year.

The aim is to win three more points to regain top spot in the group two rounds before the end of this competition. <p/> Real Madrid return to the Champions League with the aim of regaining top spot in Group D after their match against Borussia Dortmund (20:45). The Whites will be looking to capitalise on the unconditional support of their fans, who are literally overwhelmed by such Champions League matches and who will be cheering the White Ballet on to an eighth consecutive European victory at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spanish league champions and top scorers in this year's Champions League will take on the winners of last year's Bundesliga and one of the few teams still undefeated in this year's European competition tonight. The importance of the opponent and the objective of reaching the top of the group again two rounds before the end of this part of the competition makes this match extremely serious and predicts one of the most interesting evenings in European football. <p/> More than a month and a half after their first Champions League match, Real Madrid will play their second match in this competition on home soil. The Whites will take on Borussia Dortmund with the aim of winning and returning to the top of the Group D standings two rounds before the end of the group stage.

462,"Movember: Cancer facts and misconceptions <p/> To raise awareness about men's health, Playboy Hall of Fame hockey players asked passers-by, acquaintances and friends what they knew about cancer. They chose 10 interesting statements and asked an expert in oncology, MSc. Mirjana Rajer, MD, PhD, who explained and justified whether the claims were fact or fallacy. <p/> 1. Cancer treatment is more stressful than the disease itself. <p/> Fallacy. Of course, treatment has its co-morbidities, but it cannot be said that treatment is more exhausting than the disease itself. The argument comes from history, when so-called 'supportive care' was not so developed and, for example, patients who received chemotherapy vomited profusely. Nowadays, we have very effective drugs to prevent this. But it is also true that patients often attribute problems to the treatment that are not really caused by it. It is easier for the patient to find the 'culprit' in the treatment. An example might be a patient who is having radiation to the chest area and has pain in his legs. The patient is more likely to think that the radiation treatment is to blame than, for example, that the vascular problems in the legs are the real cause. Nowadays, treatment is more tailored to the patient than ever before. If a patient is going to undergo a strenuous treatment, we talk to them beforehand, explain why it is necessary and they say whether or not they agree with what is proposed. <p/> 2. Any form of cancer is incurable. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are nowadays completely curable. Especially if the disease is detected at an early stage and treated as soon as possible. Rather, we can say that all cancers are curable if they are detected early enough. More than half of all cancer patients are completely cured. Of course, we can also say that the glass is half empty and say that we do not cure half of them, but the results of treatment are getting better every year, and we are all working very hard to do that. <p/> 3. People who get cancer can only lie in bed and be passive. <p/> Fallacy. Patients are physically active to the best of their ability. Many people with cancer continue to lead an active life, which includes both daily chores and sport. Many patients keep in excellent shape, go hiking, dancing ... Cancer does not mean that a patient can just lie in bed. Patients are even encouraged to be active. However, we notice that it is often the relatives who restrict the patient, saying that he or she is not allowed to work in the garden, go out of the house or similar. The important thing is to talk to the doctor, which is usually the time when we resolve any dilemmas about the patient's activity. <p/> 4. Cancer is only curable if you are lucky. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are - especially if detected in time - completely curable. Prevention and early detection are key. People are not sufficiently aware of the importance of screening programmes such as SVIT (for bowel cancer), ZORA (cervical cancer) and DORA (breast cancer). The aim of these programmes is to detect cancer at an early stage, when it is still curable. I often hear that people have received an invitation to take part in SVIT and have thrown the invitation in the rubbish. But when they hear that someone has been diagnosed with cancer and cured through this programme, they dig through the rubbish to see if the invitation is still there, and they go and take part in the programme. <p/> 5. If there is no family history of cancer, then I am not interested in cancer. <p/> Fallacy. Heredity is only one factor and contributes to a small number of cancers. Most cancers are caused by other things, such as environmental damage, smoking, etc... So it is a mistake to think that if no one in the family has had cancer, we will not get it either. <p/> 6. Lung cancer is caused by smoking alone. <p/> Fallacy. Smoking is an important factor, but there are other factors: I am pointing out heredity, the polluted working environment, radon in buildings ... 15-20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. However, smoking is a risk factor that can be prevented, so raising awareness of the harmful effects of smoking is very important. <p/> 7. Chemotherapy is harmful to the body and is only in the interest of pharmaceutical companies. <p/> False. Chemotherapy is one of the established options for cancer treatment. But of course, every drug has side effects. It is an exaggeration to claim that chemotherapy is only in the interests of pharmaceutical companies. Ask a person who is healthy as a result of chemotherapy. <p/> Fact. It is true that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances of cure. At this point, I would like to stress once again the importance of screening programmes. People should take part in them in greater numbers than they do now. <p/> Fallacy. We starve ourselves before we starve cancer. Most cancer patients who are treated for cancer develop metabolic changes that lead to a metabolic stress state. Stress metabolism is also characterised by processes in which glucose is formed from the body's protein and fat stores. Insufficient food intake or starvation further accelerates glucose production. In this way, the body's deterioration in the face of cancer is further accelerated. This does not kill the cancer cells, as they are able to obtain sufficient energy and individual nutrients one way or another. <p/> On the contrary, we have a lot of scientific evidence that weight loss contributes to poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, adequate nutritional support of the cancer patient is part of the cancer treatment according to modern medical recommendations. <p/> You can also find out more about cancer itself and prevention at free lectures organised by Playboy Hall of Fame players as part of the MoGame event.

483,"Rocker.si: Eva, in your long and successful music career you have made history with Make Up2, Laibach, The Stroj, Pointblack and many more. So why did you decide to form a new band? Where did the name Evil Eve come from, are you really Evil Eve? Evil Eve: The guys and I have known each other for a long time and our musical paths have intertwined in the past on various projects from Retrotaether to The Machine. It was kind of just a matter of time before we started our own band. The name Evil Eve came out of nowhere, but it's my nickname from high school. When we had almost all the songs for the album, we suddenly realised we didn't even have a name yet! That was the hardest choice for us. <p/> Rocker.si: The music is mostly written by Jure Golobič, but you're the one who takes care of the lyrics in the band? Your song ' No, I wouldn't, thank you ' has quite humorous lyrics, which at the same time contain just the right amount of provocation, will the rest of the lyrics go in that direction as well? Where do you draw inspiration for your lyrics? Evil Eve: I've worked with Jureto on several projects and I have a lot of respect for him as a writer. I think it's important that the songwriter and the composer are involved in the songwriting process itself and I'm not a fan of 'bespoke' or 'turnkey' songs. So Jure first creates the basis, then the lyrics are created simultaneously, for which I draw inspiration from the vibrations that the music itself gives me, combined with my own life experiences. Finally, we package it all together in rehearsals and each of us contributes a piece to the mosaic. The lyrics on the upcoming album, which is currently about halfway done, will reflect various themes in life - from relationships between men and women to relationships between people in general. <p/> Rocker.si: You recently appeared as a guest at a Requiem concert, losing your stage innocence, if I may say so myself. Kino Šiška is quite a big concert hall for a first show, what were the feelings before the concert? What were your expectations? Evil Eve: Considering that we were the first of two opening bands to play, and at 9pm, and we were still an unknown name on the stage, I was expecting a maximum of 5 people under the stage. When I saw the nice full house, I was shocked and happy at the same time. We didn't expect anything, we just wanted to play well, so the overwhelmingly positive reviews and reviews were a pleasant surprise and gave us even more motivation to keep going. <p/> Rocker.si: At the concert it was obvious that you put on a real show on stage. Among other things, you dressed up quite a few times, you performed as a 'seductive devil' or rather a real rock cat, and you even included a sexy dance by Teja Britovšek, which undoubtedly 'turns on' the male part of the audience... Do you think that the visual performance of the band is an important factor for the concert-goers? Evil Eve: Muses express themselves through all channels, not only through music - so also through photos, videos, stage presence, clothes, and last but not least through answers in interviews... I think it's important that it's consistent with who you are in private as well. I like artists who can offer concert-goers the whole package, not just the exact notes played - and it's not a case of 'bare affnaria': Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Pink - and not least Laibach - for example, do a great job of performing their music through all channels. The fact that Teja Britovšek performed alongside actor Bojan Bešter at the Kino Šiška concert was part of the promotion of our new video - they acted out one of the scenes and threw dollar bills off the stage, which of course has its own symbolism. We had a bit more of a show than usual at Kino Šiška, because it's a big stage. And a big stage allows, if not demands it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, does Evil Eve have an absolute advantage with you now over the other bands you also work with? Evil Eve: That's right, because it's my own project and the only band that I actually started - the others I joined later and helped as much as I could - and in Evil Eve I'm going to combine all the experience and knowledge I've gained over the last 10 years. This band was formed out of our common desire to gig and create, and we have accumulated enough original songs for at least two albums. So we will put all the songs through a sieve first and prepare a set of songs that will eventually find their place on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: You have already recorded songs for your debut album, when can we expect it? What will the title be? Can you tell us maybe some interesting details about your upcoming debut album? Evil Eve: The promotion of the single and the Ne bi hvala video put a bit of a crimp in our plans and took away the time that we would have otherwise spent on the further creation and mixing of the album, but since the track was accepted for the compilation album ' We Want Good Music ', we of course took advantage of it to introduce ourselves to a wider audience. We are planning to release the album in the spring, but we don't have a specific date, because we are doing everything mostly by feel and according to our time and financial possibilities - we all have jobs and we are giving all our free time to the band. <p/> Rocker.si: You also made a video for the song 'No, I Wouldn't, Thank You', which was censored by TV channels for being too sexual and some controversial footage. Did you expect that to happen? How did the idea for such a scenario come about? Evil Eve: The script and the direction were written and directed by Miha Knific, who we hold in high esteem as an artist, and we gave him full control. We are happy that he didn't just shoot the spot, but added his own artistic touch. I am surprised that the spot is being censored, because there are a lot of things in the media today that are really morally controversial. From boys pooing half-naked on the toilet in prime time to cartoons that are dominated by violence. The new cartoon by Micha Knific, 'The Little Chickadee Wants to Grow Up', for example, is a fine example of how I imagine a good, educational, child-friendly and appropriate cartoon to be. I do not understand what is so controversial about our spot. <p/> Rocker.si: Do you want to break down the taboos in Slovenia, which, to be honest, are obviously still there, through Evil Eve and music? Will you continue to look towards provocation and towards forbidden things? Evil Eve: I don't know if our video is too much of a provocation - I see it more as a product that forces the viewer to think about today's society and culture. Otherwise, the point of view from which the viewer sees the spot is actually revealing him/herself, and nakedly so! On the other hand, I wonder, from the point of view of the average viewer, what else is provocation for Eva Breznikar after 6 years with Laibach? The fact that a nun appears in the spot is certainly not, haha. As a band, we are mostly leaving ourselves to our musical imagination in the future and wherever the road takes us, it will take us. It's important to be creative, not calculating. We're staying in the pop-rock vein, although there will be some harder or more alternative stuff on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: What are your goals in the near future? How will you approach the Slovenian audience? Evil Eve: We are aware that no matter what point a band is at, there will be positive and negative reactions. Some people still look at me with a certain prejudice, but on the other hand it's also nice when someone comes to a gig for the first time and then apologises to me backstage, saying they 'made a little mistake'. Most of the prejudice comes from people who have never been to one of my concerts, but on various forums they can conveniently hide behind pseudonyms and make insulting comments without any valid arguments. On the other hand, many people also encourage us. Our goal at the moment is to release an album and we are devoting all our energy to that. We are happy that we have more and more supporters and the gigs are dripping nicely, although we didn't expect them until the album was released, especially in this recession. So it's all the more welcome that we already have a concert repertoire ready, although we are still adding to it, adding to it, taking away from it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, I've heard from you, among other things, that you also work as a designer of unique products under the name Evil Eve. Can you tell us more about that? What do you do, how do you do it, where do you sell your products? So you are the one who takes care of the visual image of the Evil Eve members? Evil Eve: I started designing because I was always on the hunt for good pieces to put on stage, and they're hard to come by here or they're too expensive. So I finally started to do it myself. I was encouraged by a friend of mine who has been making my clothes for the stage for many years and goes by the name Dictator Fashion Lab. Over the years of working together, she noticed that I always had enough ideas for new and different accessories and kept asking me why I didn't make a piece myself. I was very active in the arts since I was a little girl, so it was no surprise to those close to me that I finally started to create bouncy pieces in all sorts of materials - from gears to leather. My work can be seen on facebook.com/EvilEveDesign and it's my hobby alongside music. <p/> The visual image of the members is not my responsibility, but everyone's. My outfits are created by the Dictator Fashion Lab according to the ideas we have in advance together. Every now and then I make a piece for one of the guys. I made a hat for the guitarist and a leather tie for the keyboard player. The boys already have a style that they wear and live by themselves and in their private lives, and it fits nicely with our stage performance. But as a woman, I think it's nice not to have some scruffy, neglected hippies in the band who justify their lack of taste by saying that 'clothes don't matter'. A person's character is reflected in everything, including clothes and style and, last but not least, if you like, in what comes out of someone's mouth. To me, the guys in the band are more than just a band. I know that I can call any of them at midnight and ask for help if I need it. <p/> Rocker.si: You were known as a great swimmer, do you ever find the time to go to the pool, given how many things are going on in your life. Where do you get all this energy from to keep from burning out? Evil Eve: Everything I do comes from sport. Sport has given me more than just medals. I don't have time to go to the pool at the moment. And yes, sometimes I burn out. <p/> Rocker.si: And finally, what would you like to say to the readers of Rocker.si? Evil Eve: Don't judge people (and bands) until you've seen them with your own eyes and ears at a concert!",Other,dev

556,"Turnkey prefabricated houses are available for anyone who wants to live in a cosy warm home. In addition to prefabricated houses, wooden houses are also an excellent choice. All information, benefits, contacts, opinions in one place. <p/> Category Archives. In Slovenia, wooden houses, wooden prefabricated houses are still quite unknown, not widespread. Most of the prefabricated wooden houses are made of logs. In terms of speed of construction, prefabricated wooden houses are built about as quickly as conventional prefabricated concrete houses. So there is no fear of construction taking too long. The main advantage of prefabricated wooden houses, at first sight, for us non-experts in this field, is that the material is wood. And it is high-quality solid wood, which is a completely natural, ecological material. So a prefabricated wooden house is homely, cosy, natural to look at. In addition, prefabricated wooden houses have good insulation, they are extremely safe in terms of seismic safety and, believe it or not, what is not apparent at first sight is that they are very safe from fire. So prefabricated wooden houses are no less fire-safe than a traditional prefabricated house. <p/> In any case, it makes sense to at least consider the possibility of a prefabricated wooden house, because it is a quality, natural, homely construction. Most people who decide to build a house do not even know that they have the possibility of living in a wooden house. And many experts in this field say that prefabricated wooden houses are the future in Slovenia, where we are known for the large percentage of forests. <p/> Building a house is the biggest material project in life for most people (Slovenians even more so). And it is usually a once-in-a-lifetime project, so the decision on what kind of house to build really has to be the right one. Or are we going to say, three years from now, when the neighbour has a special house, ""Ah, let's do it that way...""? No, it is not. So it is a very important decision. <p/>But there are many questions here. More and more people are asking whether prefabricated houses are the right decision. We have already talked about the facts that support prefabricated houses. But the decision is by no means over. When we decide to build a prefabricated house, some say a turnkey house, we have to ask ourselves - do we want a prefabricated house or a conventional house. The layman tends to lump the two together. But the differences are, in the eyes of the experts, extremely significant. Classic turnkey prefabricated houses have the walls made in the factory, then they are just erected on the building site. Skeleton prefabricated houses, on the other hand, require more effort and work on site, where the so-called skeleton is first assembled, then the walls are filled in. <p/> Many people are convinced by the quality of prefabricated houses, despite their perhaps slightly higher price. An essential feature of turn-key skeleton construction is the increased load-bearing capacity of the walls, which in turn means greater seismic safety, greater storm safety and greater fire safety. Turnkey prefabricated houses generally have extremely good characteristics, exceptional quality, and the proportion of these is increasing. Skeleton construction of prefabricated houses is considered by some to be the best quality choice at the moment. In the end, of course, the decision is yours. <p/> quickly built - a few months after the building permit is obtained <p/> extremely easy to build - no guesswork, no searching for craftsmen, no fixing complications, no searching for materials - all taken care of by the company you choose <p/> seismically safe <p/> very economical <p/> made from environmentally friendly materials. <p/> Contact us by filling in the form on the first page - we provide you with several manufacturers or prefabricated houses or wooden houses, and then you choose which one you like best - easy and fastest for you.",Promotion,dev

When the competitors arrived, it was immediately noticeable that the women's part of the competition in particular was going to be very modest in participation this year.

I hope that this will not happen again in the future, as such behaviour by judges may lead to an even greater decline in the number of competitors and thus in the quality of the competition. <p/> Personally, I came back from the competition with good impressions. My competitor Marko Barić won the first place and thus the gold medal in his category. My competitor Meri Anronić, whom I helped in the last week of preparation before the competition, was also successful.

592,"Objectivity in the age of gifts <p/> We all like to receive gifts, and many of us like to give them too. It is only right that a gift should reflect a sincere desire to show appreciation and affection to our neighbour. It is nice if the gift surprises and inspires us with a sense of playfulness, mystery, joy and gratitude. Unfortunately, gift-giving too often degenerates into an alienated, routine and disembodied following of customs. Some gift-givers even see gifts as something that belongs to them, which, when expectations are too high, can lead to ingratitude, disappointment and, eventually, resentment. <p/> A good year ago, the legislator gave us a gift. It made part of the performance-related salary tax-free. But it did so in such a veiled and disguised way that we sometimes wonder whether it was sincere in its intention, because the tax gift announced with fanfare has two flaws that the uninitiated tend to overlook. This is because the payment is not exempt from all taxes, since only income tax is reduced and social contributions are not. And such contributions are not exactly a negligible burden in our country. Moreover, the tax-advantaged payout is not for everyone, but only for those who are successful in business. Business performance is usually determined on the basis of balance sheet data, but this is only finally known in the first quarter of the new financial year. <p/> On the basis of such a muddled solution, some Pharisees can now provoke and blackmail, while the ignorant and deluded demand and resist. A collective performance award is not a gift at the end of the calendar year and must be distinguished from Christmas presents or be properly justified and linked to past performance. <p/> It is right to welcome any gift, including tax gifts. Perhaps the somewhat convoluted tax solution has even awakened in us a forgotten sense of mysterious anticipation. <p/> On behalf of the IKS editorial team, I wish you a peaceful and happy Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

623,"President Pahor at investment conference in Istanbul: ""Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia"" <p/> Today, at the end of his official visit to the Republic of Turkey, the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, attended an investment conference aimed at further promoting the Slovenian economy and presenting current investment opportunities in Slovenia. In addition to the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Borut Pahor, important Turkish investors were also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Mitja Mavko, a representative of the Slovenian Compensation Insurance Company and the Director of Spirit Boštjan Skalar. In his opening remarks, the President of the Republic stressed that Turkey and Slovenia have a long-standing friendship and respect, which is also very important for economic cooperation on both sides. He described Turkey's goal of becoming one of the ten strongest economies in the world in the next 10 years as inspiring and admirable. ""Turkey is of strategic importance for Slovenia and we need to strengthen cooperation at all levels. Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia,"" the President said. Addressing more than 80 Turkish investors, President Pahor presented Slovenia as a dynamic, open and export-oriented country and invited potential investors to come to Slovenia. He highlighted Slovenia's human potential and its exceptional geopolitical position as a meeting point between Central and South-Eastern Europe. In this context, he recalled that he and President Gül had agreed at their meeting yesterday on the utmost importance of the Brdo Process initiative for the stability of the Western Balkans. There are many opportunities for strategic investment in Slovenia, President Pahor said, underlining that Slovenia is very interesting for Turkey, as the two countries have well-regulated contractual relations and have concluded all the most important agreements in practically all areas of common interest. Among the most important of these is the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Yesterday afternoon, the President attended the 6th Annual Conference of Ambassadors of the Republic of Turkey, where he gave a short lecture. After the lecture, the President also met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Ali Babacan. Late yesterday afternoon, President Pahor met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During their talks, President Pahor and Mr Erdoğan noted that the effects of the strategic partnership signed two years ago are already visible and committed to further cooperation. Prime Minister Erdoğan welcomed President Pahor's willingness to open an investment conference in Istanbul today to present concrete opportunities for Turkish investors to invest in Slovenian companies, for more vibrant cooperation between the economies of the two countries, and for a possible joint appearance on third markets. The two also discussed some aspects of the Syrian crisis, which has led to over 600,000 refugees fleeing to Turkey in recent months. In this context, Mr Erdoğan outlined his views on stopping the armed conflict in the light of the forthcoming Geneva 2 meeting, as without immediate action the conflict could take on wider regional dimensions. <p/> Search <p/> Contact",News/Reporting,dev

629,"""Smart working villages"" are now a new trend in Italy. And local authorities are trying to take advantage of the opportunities offered by internet access, which makes teleworking possible for anyone who only needs a computer. <p/> During the pandemic, teleworking has taken off, which means that many people work from home, on weekends or even somewhere on the coast on the other side of the world. Two Italian cities are even offering to pay anyone willing to move in and continue working remotely from a new address, CNN reports. <p/> The municipal authorities in Santi Fiori in Tuscany and Rieti in Lazio are willing to cover half the rent for anyone willing to move to the two cities for a long period of time to work remotely. Rents are already quite low, which makes the offer all the more tempting. But like any other, this one is not without requirements: anyone planning to move here must have a regular job. <p/> Italy - compared to other European countries - has been hit hard by the new coronavirus and the economic and tourism recovery will take several years. But with teleworking, Italians have also started to move to areas and cities that were previously facing out-migration. Smaller, almost deserted towns are now full of life. Italy has thus killed two birds with one stone - as well as revitalising certain areas, there are now fewer people in the larger cities, so the spread of the virus is slowing down, reports CNN. <p/> Santi Fiori, a town near the wine paradise of Val D'Orcia and Siena, is currently home to just 2 500 people. Mayor Federico Balocchi believes that modern technology and teleworking offer the possibility of revitalising his hometown. Rents in Santa Fiora currently range between 300 and 500 euros per month, and the municipality is willing to cover up to 200 euros of rent. This means that prospective tenants could live in the town for two to six months for as little as €100 a month. <p/> There is a choice of apartments in stone houses in the town centre and comfortable villas on the outskirts. The local authorities invite interested parties to visit their website to see all the properties currently available. The town has recently developed a good internet connection and several points where the World Wide Web can be accessed free of charge. Life in Santa Fiora is slow-paced and offers an escape from the chaos and smog of the bigger cities.",News/Reporting,dev

643,"Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest for the most part, so it makes sense for countries to encourage it through various measures. <p/> Finland's wood building promotion programme is already showing results <p/> The use of wood in construction has become more popular again in recent years, with some countries promoting it through specific measures. This is also the case in Finland, where a seven-year wood building promotion programme is already showing results. According to Petri Heino, administrator of the programme, key measures include changes in legislation and financial incentives. <p/> Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest, so it makes sense for countries to promote it through various measures, said Petri Heino of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. ""Governments can provide, among other things, changes in legislation, financial incentives and the dissemination of good practice examples to promote sustainable construction,"" he said. <p/> In Finland, he said, it is by combining these three measures that progress has been made. ""We have been able to involve a wide range of stakeholders in promotional activities,"" he said, recalling the size and indirect positive effects of the construction sector. <p/> Finns have had subsidies for the construction of wooden houses for several years, and since the beginning of this year the government has increased them further. The amount varies depending on the region; for example, in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the subsidy is €15,000. <p/> In Finland, a specific programme is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment to promote timber construction in the period 2016-2022, which aims, among other things, to foster the growth of an internationally competitive timber construction industry, both in terms of know-how and domestic production, and to support the sustainable use of forest resources. <p/>The programme's objectives include a ten per cent annual growth in the construction of wooden residential buildings, as well as an increase in the carbon sequestration potential of wood products, the share of wood in public buildings and the export of wood products. ""The mid-term review of the results, carried out in 2018, showed that the activities have had a positive impact in most of the target areas,"" Heino pointed out. <p/> The use of wood in construction is commonplace in Finland, he said, as they have extensive forests that are producing more annual growth than ever before. It is currently at around 110 million cubic metres, of which between 65 and 70 per cent is felled. <p/> Young Finns are also aware of the importance of wood. According to Hein, a recent study showed that 69 per cent of girls between the ages of 14 and 23 support the idea of increasing wood use. <p/> Slovenia is also working to further promote wood as a renewable resource and an opportunity to enhance the added value of products. Among other things, the country aims to achieve a 30% share of wood in public buildings and to increase domestic log processing to three million cubic metres per year. <p/> Heino said that while the starting points are encouraging, it will be useful to further address these issues in the future through changes in legislation, educational content and various policies. <There are also opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. ""There is already informal cooperation at ministerial level, and we are also cooperating in the research field, where there are opportunities to build on,"" he added.",News/Reporting,dev
645,"Japan - Kyoto and Geishas <p/> The English writer, explorer, photographer and naturalist Isabella Bird once wrote that Japan offers as much novelty as a trip to another planet. From imposing shrines surrounded by fairy-tale forests, to snow-capped Mount Fuji, to shy and agile geishas, to neon-lit skyscrapers, to punctual and fast trains, Japan conjures up many associations... Japan is a unique synthesis of the traditional and the modern, where ancient gods, traditions, skills and arts meet cutting-edge modern technology, futuristic fashion and the latest style and design. Japan is a country that is a feast for all the senses. Japan was still feudal in the second half of the 19th century, but at the end of that century, rapid industrialisation began. But after the Second World War, Japan emerged as a true economic giant. <p/> Kyoto <p/> The former imperial capital boasts many temples, palaces, shrines and gardens. Kyoto is also famous for its highly developed traditional arts and festivals. Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan from 794 until 1868, when Meji moved it to Tokyo. Nevertheless, Kyoto retains the primacy of Japan's cultural sophistication. In a way, Kyoto is complementary to Nara, where the foundations of traditional Japanese culture were laid, culminating in Kyoto. Kyoto has a huge number of attractions, so I will concentrate only on the most important ones. <p/> Kiyomizudera <p/> The Temple of Pure Water - Kiyomizudera - is one of the most important temples in Japan and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 778 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in eastern Kyoto. The main temple as we see it today was built in 1633 by the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, who, among other things, expelled all Europeans and Christians from Japan and closed the borders of Japan, which lasted for more than 200 years afterwards. The temple was built without a single nail. Kiyomizudera Temple is best known for its 13-metre-high wooden platform, which offers visitors a fine view of the many cherry and maple trees as well as the city of Kyoto in the distance. Below the temple is the Otowa Waterfall, which is divided into three smaller waterfalls. The water from each waterfall has its own health and well-being benefits. You can drink the water from a cup located on a long wooden pole. The water of the first waterfall is good for long life, the second for success in school and life and the third for happiness and love in life. But don't be partial, you can only drink the water of one ""waterfall"". <p/> Behind the main hall of the Kiyomizu Dera Temple stands the Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the deity of love and matchmaking. In front of the temple there are two stones 18 metres apart. If you can find your way from one to the other with your eyes closed, you will be lucky in your search for love, but if you need someone to guide you from one stone to the other, you may also need an intermediary in your search for a life mate. <p/> The Higashiyama district is one of the best preserved old areas of the city, located between Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka Shrine. Walking through the narrow streets, between the wooden buildings and traditional shops, it's easy to feel the flavour of the old capital. Many small shops and restaurants have catered for locals, tourists and pilgrims for centuries. On a walk through the quarter, we also caught a geisha going about her business, and she was happy to pose for us. <p/> 1 of 3 <p/> Kodaiji Temple, founded in 1606 in memory of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan's greatest historical figures, and commissioned by his wife Nene, is also remarkable. <p/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a warrior, politician, samurai, general and daimyo - a nobleman subject only to the shogun - who had 26 famous Christians crucified, known as the Japanese martyrs. Kodaiji Temple belongs to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism. The temple is surrounded by gardens and we also walked through a beautiful bamboo grove. <p/> One of Kyoto's most famous shrines, Yasaka, is only a good half hour's walk from Kiyomizu Temple, but of course the walk takes a while, and we could easily have stayed here for an hour longer. The shrine was founded around 650 AD. In front of the main shrine there is a stage with hundreds of lamps that light up in the evening. Each lamp bears the name of a local company that pays a donation. <p/> Fushimi Inari Shrine <p/> Fushimi Inari is an important Shinto shrine in the southern part of Kyoto. It is famous for its thousand orange or brilliant red torii, which lead through the forest to the 233-metre-high Inari Sacred Mountain, an integral part of the shrine. <p/> Fushimi Inari is one of the most important of the thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto goddess of rice. The shrine is also full of statues of foxes, which were the messengers of the goddess Inari. Fushimi Inari Shrine is of ancient origin and existed before Kyoto became the capital of Japan in 794. <p/> 1 of 4 <p/> Arashiyama <p/> Arashiyama is a pleasant tourist district on the western outskirts of Kyoto. The area has been a popular destination since Japan was given its first permanent capital, Naro, in 710. The capital at the time flirted with the Chinese capital. Large Buddhist temples were built at this time. Chinese influence was diminishing, although it was still great, or rather many things were submerged. Perhaps the first association we have with Arashiyama is the extremely attractive bamboo forest. <p/> The most important temple in Arashiyama is Tenryuji. It is one of the five great Zen temples of Kyoto and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This temple also has its own Rinzai Zen school of the Rinzai sect of Japanese Buddhism. The temple was built as early as 1339, when the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji ruled, and was dedicated to the then deceased Emperor Go-Daiga. A walk along the pond and through the temple's tatami trees is a real Arashiyama experience. <p/> Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji <p/> The Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji is a Zen temple whose upper two floors are entirely gilded with gold leaf. Previously known as Rokuonji, the temple was the resting villa of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according to his will, after his death in 1408, it became a Rinzai sect Zen temple. In front of the temple is a beautiful pond. The temple has burned down several times in its history, most recently in 1950 by a fanatical monk, but was rebuilt again in 1955. <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence of the Japanese Imperial Family until 1868, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo. It is located in Kyoto's Imperial Park, along with the Sento Imperial Palace and several other landmarks. <p/> The present Imperial Palace was rebuilt in 1855 after it burnt down. The complex is surrounded by walls and ramparts, with halls and gardens inside. Only the current Emperor Akihito was crowned in Tokyo, the previous ones in Kyoto. <p/> Of course, there are more temples and sights. Kyoto is also famous for its geishas, of which there are around 300, including at least two Europeans.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
646,"The Secret World of Geisha <p/> A geisha is a Japanese artist who presents traditional Japanese arts. <p/> On our trip to Japan, we saw their dances and learned about some of the Japanese arts. <p/> The term geisha is made up of the words GEI (arts or arts) and SHA (person), comes from the Tokyo dialect and has been adopted from there into European languages. Geisha is called hangyoku (semi-precious stones) in Tokyo and maiko (dancing girl) in Kyoto during training. <p/> Geisha flourished most in the 18th and 19th centuries, when their services were in great demand. After Meiji came to power, their role in preserving traditional Japanese art changed. <p/> As early as at least the 7th century, Japan was known for female artists known as saburuke, or what might be called maids. They were girls and wives who were left alone, husbands and boyfriends lost in fights and battles. Somehow they had to survive, some selling sexual favours, while others, more educated, made a living entertaining guests at high society social gatherings. When the Emperor moved to present-day Kyoto in 794, the conditions were created for the start of Japanese geisha culture and soon afterwards these girls became synonymous with the beauty-obsessed elite. <p/> In traditional Japanese culture, men were not restricted from being faithful to their wives. The ideal wife, even of the upper classes, was a modest mother and head of the home. According to Confucius, love is of secondary importance. Men sought sexual pleasure and romantic liaisons not from their wives but from courtesans. From the 17th century, the shogunates had their pleasure quarters, outside of which prostitution was illegal. In these quarters, the yoyo ""actresses"" were ranked and licensed. The highest class of yujois, the forerunners of the geisha, were called tayuuje. They were both actresses and prostitutes, performing erotic dances and skits. <p/> In the 18th century, geisha appear. These pleasure quarters soon became glamorous entertainment centres offering more than just sex. The highly sophisticated courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing and playing music. Some became renowned poets and calligraphers. Gradually, they specialised in a new profession and pursued art and entertainment. The first geishas were men who entertained waiting customers to meet the most popular and talented courtesans. <p/> The rise of the geisha began at the end of the 18th century. Geishas worked in pleasure quarters, were actually imprisoned and were strictly forbidden to sell sexual favours to protect the business of courtesans. While licensed courtesans provided men with sex, geishas occupied a special niche as artists and learned female companions. <p/> At the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, geisha became a female profession and the notorious courtesans went out of fashion. Soon geisha developed their own style of dress and their trends were emulated by fashionable women from all walks of Japanese society. Geishas also began to rank, with some geishas still offering sexual favours, while others strictly entertained their guests with art. <p/> The geisha were dealt a severe blow with the end of the Second World War, when a general mobilisation was declared in Japan and everyone had to work in the fields and factories. Geishas also lost their reputation because some prostitutes pretended to be geishas when they met American soldiers. After the war, few returned to the geisha districts, rejecting the Western influence and returning to their traditional way of life and art, because the status of geisha was shaped by Japan's feudal past, and they maintain the traditional standards of their profession by this way of life if they want to remain geisha. <p/> There is no doubt that in the past, young geishas were also subjected to forced sexual relations and that their virginity was auctioned. After Japan lost World War II, the geishas were displaced and their reputation declined. With Japan's economic boom in the 1960s, the world and the status of geishas also changed. In modern Japan, young geisha are not forced to have sex and their sex life is a private matter. <p/> Is Japan a country where you would go on holiday?

648,"Dear Sir or Madam ! Please post this reflection of mine ! The public sector is financed from the budget, which in turn is ""filled"" by the economy. This same economy has gone through so many crises over the last DECADES and more, but has survived them all. If we remember the last crises, when the same ""now striking administration"" was telling us that the wage bill of the companies is what it is, that it cannot be increased, and that we should find our INTERNAL reserves and share this wage bill.... Where and what is now the face of this same administration, which at that time ""taught us to manage"" , now that the FIRST CRISIS has come for THEM and there is no money to take from the state coffers because they are empty, and it cannot or will not tell itself this. This time there is no solidarity !???!!! Apart from the fact that all DU employees have guaranteed jobs, which is far from being the case in the economy, they have, on average, a higher education than the economy, but not more responsibility because they do what is prescribed for them, mostly leisurely work, and they have good working conditions.... and on and on and on, incomparable to the economy. If any of the civil service workers do not like this and that job, they should resign and come to the economy. Here the working conditions will be different, the salaries the same, no promotions according to seniority.... and there are benefits that do not exist in the economy as in DU. Besides, this government should ""audit"" the entire administration, identify MORE employees and send them to the employment service as in the economy and money is saved immediately in the budget as the benefits from the employment service are much smaller. The introduction of computerisation has simplified procedures compared to the previous manual work and the number of employees in DU is increasing. Where is the logic here ? Isn't this already a blatant mockery of the economy ? We would all do well to ""shut up"" and wait for better times for better wages. I don't mean that DU should not be used, it should just be rationalised, because in some sectors there are even 30-40% too many employees in the JU. There is a MASS for JU salaries and finding internal reserves. If someone is a top it can be both in DU and in the economy and why privilege; a worker from the economy to ""work the stock exchange"", but not a JU employee because the JU does not share its money for salaries, but the contributions of the economy. If the civil service is not satisfied with a salary of between 1 000 and 2 000 Euros and would find it impossible to survive if it were reduced by perhaps 100 Euros, they should think of their neighbours, acquaintances, relatives, pensioners, the unemployed.... who have to survive a month on 250 Euros of social assistance or a salary of 450 Euros for a job that these same gentlemen dislike and are ashamed of. We in the economy are not ashamed of doing any work, but they can be SHAMED of being so 'greedy and uncharitable' towards those who earn money on their, not very small, salaries for the work they do. The cheques have to be paid by us 'little ones' too, but with much much smaller incomes. 'Where there is no money, even the army cannot take it'. This should be the guiding principle of the striking civil service !!! And hello strikers, I would say Bogdan Pleša --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.11.2010 Dear ! I cannot imagine that the state is so DIVIDED with various aids and supports to categories of people who are ineligible or no longer in need. Every 20th of the month I watch how this is played out in M.Sobota. Roma people drive their Mercedes, BMWs, Audis ..... to the NLB car park to get help, raise support, and then occupy the pubs and get drunk. I have already pointed this out to the CSD and suggested that they should find out again who is actually entitled to support, but the ladies won't get off their arses and would go to the field to check the reality of the situation. A family that has a car is not a social problem and, in my opinion, is not entitled to support. How 'difficult' it is to find out who owns a vehicle, if we 'pull' from the vehicle registration database all the vehicles registered in a settlement such as Pušča, it is no easier, you just have to have the courage to do your job honestly - a well-paid and surely 'public job' for which civil servants struggle to get paid. But where is the accountability for their work. Do they realise that in doing so they are cutting off the bread of those who actually need help ? The t.z. should also be checked. ""The 'divorced couples' who are separated only because the lady is a single mother, but in reality they continue to live together. Again, someone has not done their job. Is it the municipality, the KS or another centre that knows the real situation, the CSD that gives help and support and who else? If all the 'salary strikers' would rather do their job as they should and at least be a little bit aware of the responsibility for their work, it would be much much better. It is not really possible to identify all the irregularities, because it is mainly the Roma who are 'cunning', but it is a fact that a great deal of money would be left in the state coffers for other, urgent needs. Mr Svetlik, in particular, needs to reflect on this and put things right in THIS area of his own. If he cannot or will not do this, HE SHOULD RESIGN, because incompetent ministers were disliked by Maria Theresa and are unwanted even now. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, but a cut has finally got to be made in this area too. If you analyse the matter well, you will see that I am right, we just have to do our job as well as we can and for which we are paid, even if it is unpleasant. I am writing all this for the sake of all those who actually need help to survive, not for luxury and drunkenness !

If someone is a top earner it can be both in the JU and in the economy and why the privilege; a worker from the economy to the ""labour exchange"", but not a JU employee, because the JU does not share its money for salaries, but from the contributions of an already severely undernourished economy. If the civil service is not satisfied with a salary of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 2 000, and would find it impossible to survive if it were reduced by perhaps EUR 100, they should think of their neighbours, acquaintances, relatives, pensioners, the unemployed and the unemployed.... who have to survive on EUR 250 a month in social assistance or EUR 450 in salary for a job that these same gentlemen dislike and are ashamed of. We in the economy are not ashamed of doing any work, but they can be SHAMED of being so 'greedy and uncharitable' towards those who earn money on their, not very small, salaries for the work they do. The cheques have to be paid by us 'little ones' too, but with much much smaller incomes. Where is the end of the greed of the public administration or just of Posedi. We used to ""feed"" Belgrade and when it was no longer possible to give more, we were attacked. Will the public sector do the same, destroying the economy and wiping out the country ???

652,"Chronic wrist pain <p/> Chronic wrist pain occurs gradually and is not usually the result of an acute injury. The tendons and tendon sheaths are most commonly affected due to repetitive strain. The most common of these are inflammations of the tendons of the wrist, specifically tendonitis of the extensor tendon of the thumb (Mb. DeQuervain), cysts of the tendon sheaths or the joint capsule, and bursitis in the wrist region. <p/> Wrist fractures due to circulatory disturbances, chronic ligament tears, wrist instability and wear lesions also occur. Tumour lesions are also a possible cause of pain. <p/> Recognise the symptoms <p/> The most common symptom is chronic pain, mostly related to movement or strain. When unstable, the pain intensifies with certain movements in the wrist. <p/> Alarm to see an orthopaedic surgeon <p/> When you experience wrist pain that lasts for several weeks, it is time to see an orthopaedic surgeon. <p/> Path to diagnosis <p/> A clinical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon gives an orientation on the nature of the problem or the affected wrist structures. The basic examination is an X-ray of the wrist in different projections. To clarify the exact situation, an ultrasound or MRI scan of the wrist is performed. In case of suspected instability with wrist ligament tear, additional information is obtained by contrast-enhanced MRI. <p/> Treatment methods <p/> In the case of an inflammatory cause of wrist pain, immobilisation is recommended for a short period. Physical therapy initially includes anti-inflammatory irradiation with high energy laser (HIL), and super magnetotherapy (SIS). This is followed by individual exercises to stretch and flex the tendons. <p/> Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is also an option for early degenerative processes. <p/> In cases of instability, wrist bone failure due to circulatory disorders or other more complex conditions following injury, more complex surgical interventions may be considered.",Information/Explanation,dev
659,"Does algae generation mean the beginning of the end of your aquarium? <p/> Freshwater algae are a threat to aquatic life in aquariums. Algae are extremely tough when it comes to surviving and spreading throughout the aquarium tank, so you will need to be persistent to get rid of this problem. If you don't keep it under control, the aquarium will become a toxic water production system, which will be very harmful to your fish. You can prevent this by getting to know what is happening in your aquarium and what to do about it. With algae, it is best to prevent them from forming in the first place. This can be done by changing the water every week, as algae cannot thrive when there is new water in the aquarium, and by keeping up with other maintenance work. Some species of algae are edible, like much other marine vegetation, and are a food source in many parts of the world. There are hundreds of edible species containing vitamins and minerals. They are also used as fertiliser and food for livestock. In freshwater aquariums, there are quite a few species of algae that survive on nutrients in the water. In some cases, aquarium algae serve as food for aquarium inhabitants such as shrimps and snails, but if their growth is not controlled, they can be a threat to other aquarium life. Brown algae are often found in newly installed aquariums. They also thrive in poorly lit aquariums where phosphate levels are high and nitrogen levels are low. They are slimy and soft algae found on aquarium glass, in the substrate and in decorations. Brown algae will disappear in the presence of strong light, but may still remain in darker areas of the aquarium. In contrast, green algae thrive in aquariums with strong light. They appear as green spots on aquarium plants and on the aquarium glass. Hairy algae and filamentous algae appear as threads in the water. They thrive in aquariums if there is too much iron in the water. They are easily removed by wrapping a stick around them. Filamentous algae grow on the leaves of plants, are found at the tips of the leaves and can reach a length of 30 cm. Hairy algae usually grow at the base of plants, on the substrate and sometimes on the decoration. They are green-grey in colour and grow to about 4 cm. Most aquarists do not bother with this algae as some fish feed on it. However, freshwater shrimps such as Caridina Japonica feed on filamentous algae. A type of algae that enhances the look of an aquarium is the bearded algae. These algae form a carpet, usually covering rocks and plant leaves. They form closer to the light source. They are soft and slippery and grow quickly to a maximum of 3 cm. Bearded algae need a constant light source and are common in aquariums without plants and are quite difficult to remove by hand. By putting algae-eating fish in the water, you are constantly reducing the effect that algae can have on the aquarium. Fish such as Indian minnows, algae-eating foxtails and spotted armadillos are a great help in reducing them. Before introducing them to other fish in the aquarium, make sure they can be kept together in the aquarium, otherwise they will not do a good job of cleaning the algae. In small proportions, algae add colour and vitality to the aquarium. As well as providing food for some of the creatures in the aquarium, they can also provide shelter for small fish. They are also a good indicator of imbalances in the system. Algae show when there are too many nutrients in the water. Too many nutrients indicate that you may be feeding the fish too much and that some plants may be excreting nutrients. Algae can also indicate that you need to pay attention to the aquarium water, as it can be harmful to the fish and plants. The growth of freshwater algae depends on the existing conditions in the aquarium. Algae growth is dependent on three conditions: water, light and nutrients. Controlling these three sources is the main step in preventing them from growing and causing damage. Light can be controlled by placing the aquarium away from sunlight and artificial light should not be used for more than eight hours a day. Artificial light should not be too strong and it is a good idea to install an automatic timer switch. The feeding habits of fish vary from species to species. In order to control phosphate levels, which serve as food for algae, it is important not to overfeed the fish, as this will increase phosphate levels. If the fish have eaten and there are bits of food left in the aquarium, remove them immediately. In addition, regular water changes are important to prevent phosphate and nitrate levels from increasing. Change at least 10 to 15% of the water once a week and scrape off any algae clinging to the glass. Testing the water will also allow you to control algae build-up.

664,"Smoking poses one of the biggest risks to our bodies <p/> 3 June 2019 <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems. <p/> ""Smoking damages the skin and mucous membranes. Smokers age their skin more quickly, their skin sags more quickly, and they lose collagen elasticity. This also causes more people to snore and suffer from other serious health problems,"" said Aleksandra Križaj Dumić, Director of the Križaj Dental and Aesthetic Clinic, which has a tradition of more than 20 years, at a press meeting ahead of World No Smoking Day. <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems - high blood pressure, insufficient oxygen intake, poor blood circulation and brain activity. Airway obstructions can be so severe that people can stop breathing several times a night for a few minutes at a time. For this reason, snoring should be treated seriously and resolved immediately. ""Snoring can also be eliminated with laser therapy. The advantages of this treatment are numerous, but what patients like most is that they have no problems after the laser treatment, they can eat, drink and speak normally, and they can return to work immediately without any problems, as the treatment does not require post-operative recovery,"" outlined Aleksandra Križaj Dumić. Laser surgery is an effective and quick solution if the cause of snoring is a sagging or loose mucous membrane in the soft palate. The NightLase laser therapy includes three visits at the beginning and one annual refresher treatment for non-smokers and two for smokers. Patients breathe easier and snore less at night after the treatment. Laser treatment helps about 80 per cent of carefully selected patients and about 70 per cent of all patients examined. In most patients, snoring time is almost halved. Sleep quality improves as patients take less time to fall asleep and no longer wake up tired. <p/> Before and after laser snoring therapy <p/> A similar procedure is also performed to treat incontinence in gynaecological patients, to increase the tension of the vaginal muscles, to increase the tension of sagging skin on the face and neck, and of the skin in the area of the under-eye area. <p/> Demonstration of laser goat rejuvenation <p/> Smoking therefore also affects the skin. For a youthful, fresh and rested appearance, the clinic uses a variety of rejuvenation techniques to refresh the skin's surface, smooth out imperfections and make the skin look more radiant. The effects are most often addressed with laser rejuvenation, Botox or fillers. ""After laser rejuvenation, the skin gets more moisture, more elasticity and looks fresher and younger.

669,"Organise your life <p/> Spring is a time of awakening, renewal and regeneration, of cleaning up old sins and starting new ones. Make new beginnings also in the organisation of your life. <p/> Stress at work, family commitments, the general fast pace of life are not only tiring but can cause anxiety and general restlessness. Sometimes we feel that we will not be able to do even one of them because of the pile of commitments, our minds wandering from one to the other, unable to concentrate at all and thinking about which is more important. <p/> As spring slowly arrives, it is a good time to rethink life's priorities and try to organise our lives better. <p/> One of the world's most renowned systems of organisation and productivity improvement or time management was defined by David Allen in his book Getting Things Done. In the following sections, we guide you through the basics of organisation that will help you to systematise your life's habits and commitments so that you start to enjoy them. <p/> 1. Gather your thoughts <p/> First, it is important to find the best ways to gather all the information and thoughts that otherwise run through your head during the day. You know: smart people write! Don't try to remember all the information, schedules or ideas that pop into your head. Instead, carry a notebook with you at all times, wherever you go, and write down everything that comes to mind. <p/> Process the information. After you have collected your thoughts in your own way, process them. Start at the beginning - identify what is most important and what is what you don't need. Make decisions quickly and don't delay. Be ruthless and get rid of all the ballast, both in terms of stuff and information. Only delay tasks if you know they require more than two minutes of your time. In this case, put each task on a list, archive it, but get on with it as soon as time permits. Plan <p/> 2. Plan <p/> At the beginning of each week, on Monday morning or even on Sunday evening, decide on one to three most important goals and put them in your weekly schedule. These should be major tasks that - when completed - will make you feel proud. Similarly, divide each day into smaller tasks. From a psychological point of view, it is best to do the most important tasks in the morning, as this will take most of the burden off your shoulders when the day is just getting off to a good start. Make your scheduling system as easy to use and understand as possible - there is no need to waste time familiarising yourself with Outlook or other software on your computer. <p/> 3. Focus <p/> We all know that it is difficult to do every task with complete focus and without interruptions. But this is one of the most basic habits you need to learn, as it ensures good time management. Exclude all possible distractions: e-mail, mobile phones and, if necessary, the Internet. <p/> This way of working may not be so easy if you have a distaste for a particular task. In this case, first consider the positive aspects of the task. For example, it may lead to a new project, a promotion to a better job, or you may just learn something new and interesting. Then break the task into mini-tasks, each of which will take you no more than five minutes. Once you've done the first one, we guarantee the others will flow like clockwork. Reward yourself by completing the first three or four mini-tasks - for example, by reading an email or web portal for five minutes. Then get on with the job. <p/> 4. Organise your work and living space <p/> The perception of being stifled by commitments can also be influenced by the messiness of the environment in which we live and work. Spring is a good time to start reorganising our living and working environment and putting all the things that surround us on a daily basis in their place. First, define a system to store similar things together (e.g. bills, documents). Even if some of us work well in functional clutter, it is systematised for the individual, we just have to find a (dis)order that suits us. Then follow the system, give each item a proper place and start keeping all the related items in a real-time storage. <p/> 5. Review <p/> Regularly review both the newly established storage system and your progress in terms of meeting your objectives. Review your notes and draw a line at the end of the week to assess how well you have done in meeting your commitments. This is important to reaffirm success to yourself or to learn from your mistakes in the future. After the review, set yourself tasks and goals for the coming week based on your past shortcomings and the things you failed to tick off the list. Focus on the most important ones or simplify the ones that are not the most urgent. <p/> 6. Find your passion <p/> Do those things that you really enjoy, that - even if they are professional in nature - you enjoy and that you feel you could enjoy for the rest of your life. The fact that finding the perfect job is difficult is an understatement. But it is worth finding, and we recommend that you never give up the search. Think how easy it would be to do the tasks listed above if they were related to an activity or topic that you are passionate about! If you can't turn your passion into a job, make sure you do something about it, at least in your spare time, because that's how you can regain some confidence or motivation. <p/> Finally, it is important to create your own comfortable routine. Routines are considered by many to be boring and can kill the spirit. To a certain extent this is true, but in times when you are overwhelmed it can make your daily efforts and life in general much easier. It is therefore advisable to develop routines in the area of work habits and patterns - if you make it a part of your blood to collect your thoughts, set goals and plan how to achieve them on a weekly and daily basis, your life will be much easier. <p/> We wish you to enter this spring with focus and determination. <p/> Article by Elvira Leka, translated and edited by Katarina Cvikl.",Instruction,dev

The remainder of the appeal is dismissed and the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance is upheld in part and unchanged. <The parties are ordered to bear their own costs of the appeal. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the applicant seeking an order that the defendant account to her for the gross amount of EUR 3 505,04 in respect of the underpayment of the salary allowance, pay the prescribed taxes and contributions and then pay to her the net sums, together with statutory default interest on the net sums on the gross basis, as set out in paragraph I/1 of the operative part of the judgment. Dismisses the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings (paragraph I/2 of the operative part of the judgment) and orders the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings in the sum of EUR 729,96 to the defendant within 15 days (paragraph II of the operative part of the judgment). <p/> The applicant timely appeals against the judgment on all grounds of appeal under Article 338(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Gazette of the RS, No 26/99 et seq.) and requests the Court of Appeal to uphold its appeal and to alter the judgment under appeal by granting the application in full and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment is based, according to the applicant, on an incorrect and incomplete finding of fact and on an error of substantive law. In the light of the clear statutory provisions, the applicant should have been paid 100 % of the allowance for the time spent waiting for homeworking. The defendant issued the applicant with an order to wait for work at home because it did not have suitable work for her. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 or the defendant's decision of 25 May 2001, she cannot, in her view, be denied the right to the difference since, during the period at issue, that is to say, from April 2005 to July 2007, the compensation for the time spent waiting for work was governed by the Labour Relations Act (LSA, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 42/2002 et seq.). The decision of 31.1.2003 of the ZPIZ did not, by anything in the operative part of the decision, decide that the compensation was 80 %, but only that it was compensation for the time spent waiting for work from 7.7.2001 onwards in the amount of SIT 71 011,61. The 80 % allowance was decided by the defendant by decision of 25.5.2001, against which decision the applicant had no grounds for appeal, since ZDR-02 was not yet in force and, moreover, that decision was not based on the provisions of the Social Insurance Act or the Social Insurance Act, but on Article 34 of the sectoral collective agreement. <p/> The appeal also challenges the decision on costs. The Court of First Instance held five main hearings, at which it took evidence and heard both parties on two occasions, and it was only after that that it decided that the claim was unfounded and could therefore have ordered that each party should bear its own costs. However, if the applicant had to pay any costs to the defendant, the Court of First Instance could have awarded the defendant only one award for the proceedings under No 3012, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance had reopened the main hearing, and the appellant therefore proposes that the Court of Appeal should make a decision as to the costs of the proceedings in such a way that each party should bear its own costs or that the costs awarded to the defendant should be reduced. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant contested the grounds of appeal as unfounded and requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal and to order the applicant to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal. <p/> The appeal is partly well founded. <p/> The Court of Appeal examined the judgment under appeal within the limits of the grounds of appeal raised, taking into account, on its own motion, the substantive breaches of the provisions of Article 350(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No 26/99 et seq.) 1.points 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11, with the exception of the existence and correctness of the authorisation to proceed before the court of first instance, and points 12 and 14 of the second paragraph of Article 339 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the correct application of substantive law. In that examination, the Court of First Instance found that the Court of First Instance had not committed any of the substantive infringements of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure which the Court of Appeal is required to take into account of its own motion. It also correctly applied the substantive law to the facts correctly and fully established and only the decision on costs was partially erroneous, as will be explained below. <p/> The Court of Appeal fully agrees with the legal and factual grounds of the contested judgment of the Court of First Instance (with the exception of the decision on costs), and therefore does not repeat them and, as regards the grounds of appeal which are of decisive importance pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 360(1) of the ECHR, the Court of First Instance does not rely on them in the present case. <p/> The Court of First Instance correctly found that the applicant was entitled, in view of her ability to work, to a wage allowance for the period of waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-1, Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, No. 1, item 360, as amended). No ... of 4 October 2000, in conjunction with the decision of the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A. No ... of 27 March 2001, she was classified in category III of disability due to the effects of the disease and with the right to assignment or employment in other suitable work of a physically lighter nature from 29 September 2000 onwards. The applicant was awarded compensation by decision of the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A., No ... of 31 January 2003, which provided that the employer was to pay the applicant's salary compensation at its own expense. The Employment Relations Act (ZDR, Official Gazette of the RS, No 42/2002) had indeed entered into force before that decision was issued, but the essential point is that the applicant had already acquired the right before that date, and that decision therefore conferred on her the right to wage compensation for the period of her waiting for assignment to another suitable job as from 7.7.2001, on the basis of the provisions of the ZPIZ-1 and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos 12/92 to 54/98). Pursuant to Article 397 of the ZPIZ-1, beneficiaries of rights on the basis of residual capacity for work established under the regulations applicable until the date laid down in Article 446 of this Law, which is 1 January 2003, shall retain those rights after that date, with the proviso that the cash benefits shall be adjusted as pensions are adjusted. The applicant has always been a category III invalid, but it was only by decision of 26.10.2009 that she was classified as a category I invalid as a result of illness from 9.4.2009 and was granted the right to an invalidity pension from 1.5.2009. The appellant's claims that the Court of First Instance failed to establish the facts in full and erred in the application of the substantive law are therefore unfounded. <p/> The Court of Appeal adds that even an appeal by the applicant against the decision of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 would not alter the fact that the applicant has acquired the right to a benefit under the rules on pension and invalidity insurance and is therefore not entitled to a benefit under the ZDR. The appellant's submissions that the amount of the applicant's allowance was fixed by the defendant by decision of 25 May 2001 are also unfounded, since the amount of the allowance was fixed by a decision of the ZPIZ of 31 January 2003 in the amount of SIT 71 011,61 per month. In accordance with Article 137 of the ZPIZ, in conjunction with Article 48 of the ZPIZ-1, the minimum pension base was taken as the basis on which the salary allowance for the period of waiting for employment or assignment to other suitable work was calculated, at a rate of 80 %, and the allowance thus calculated was adjusted in the same way as the pensions and amounted to SIT 71 011,61 as from 7.7.2001. <p/> On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of First Instance correctly rejected the applicant's claim for payment of the difference between the amount of compensation received for the period of waiting for work, which was 80 % of the basic amount, and 100 % of the amount of compensation under Article 137 of the Labour Code. <p/> The appellant, however, submits that the Court of First Instance erred in its assessment of the defendant's necessary legal costs, which the appellant is liable to reimburse. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance reopened the main hearing, the defendant is entitled, pursuant to Tariff No 3012 of the Law on the Tariff of Lawyers (Law on the Tariff of Lawyers, Official Gazette of the RS 67/2008), to only one hearing fee, and the Court of Appeal therefore reduced the amount of the costs awarded to EUR 513,00, namely one hearing fee of EUR 190,80 and VAT of 20 % on that amount. However, the Court of First Instance had no basis for deciding, as the appeal suggests, that each party should bear its own costs, since the applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings. <p/> In the light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal in part in so far as it related to the decision on the costs of the appeal and reduced the amount awarded to EUR 513,00 (Article 351(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 358(5) of the Civil Procedure Code), dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance in the remaining part (Article 353 of the Civil Procedure Code), without any change in that amount. <p/> The applicant was only partially successful in its appeal and the Court of Appeal therefore decided, pursuant to Article 154(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the same Act, that it should bear its own costs of the appeal. The defendant is ordered to bear its own costs of the response to the appeal, since it did not contribute substantially to the decision (Article 155(1) in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the CPC).",Legal/Regulation,dev

745,"Well, come to my house for a visit...my child is currently a meat eater, so I'm almost worried, she's not interested in anything else...she eats sausages out of her sandwich, throws vegetables on the floor for the dogs, leaves potatoes and rice on the plate, and she happily munches on sausages and steak. And she has everything her heart desires at her disposal : <p/> +1 She wants no fruit, no pasta, no potatoes, no vegetables, no fruit ... And his mother eats almost only vegetables and fruit, and his father only starches. <p/> On a neighbouring forum someone was being persuaded not to buy a mix. I quote the part of the text that speaks against buying the mix: <p/> ""...both cavalier and pug breeds have heart problems and that no matter if the dog is a mix or pedigree that you have to know that treatment is expensive, I have a cavalier with pedigree and we have been keeping him alive for 3 and a half years now only with medication, how much did all the visits to the vet, all the medicines cost me, and I don't add it up, but probably about 2000 euros, and probably more, so buying a dog is the cheapest, but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at the age of say 8, 9 years..."" <p/> So why should I buy a dog with a pedigree? Why already? This writing certainly discourages me from doing so. <p/> Maybe you know which tests are mandatory for pugs and cavaliers for breeding? One, several,...? (I really don't know, that's why I'm asking) <p/> but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at say 8, 9 years old, and I know of a case of a non-breeding cavalier who has a grade 4 heart murmur at 4 years old (which mine had at 8 years old). <p/> ALL cavaliers have heart problems. If you buy from a proven breeder, problems will appear at 8,9 years, if not they can appear much earlier. <p/> (it's half a question why a person would want a dog that has heart problems from the start, but ok, to each his own) <p/> @salad Ever since user 007 asked a simple question on the ""neighbouring forum"", in the next 3-4 pages, the ""genealogical automaton"" kicked in and uncontrollably started spewing the same learned phrases, which are TOTALLY not the answer to the question asked, and started to savagely rape the person with its logic, which doesn't allow for a different opinion. Unfortunately, the ""automated slaves"" of the genealogy lobby are also on this forum, and here too they impose their beliefs on the users. <p/>Why? It is just a problematic breed in certain health aspects. Why hide it? I mean, if one paragraph is taken out of context, it's despicable anyway. This dog, if I am not mistaken, is about 9 years old. And it is quite right to warn a person who does not know what he is buying that both breeds can be risky, especially if the parent dogs have not had heart health tests. <p/> And this mix would do nothing to improve health, quite the opposite. And if it has already been used and the dogs are not under control, there is no need for the ""breeder"" to deceive the potential guardians of the calf puppies with silence. Or I suppose it is possible that he has told them, but given the general reaction, I don't think he has. <p/> Are you both saying that the problems should not be talked about? Given that traceability is possible, they can be talked about at all, but not in the case of a mixed breed, which doesn't mean it will be healthy <p/> And to be left in the dark... it is precisely through controlled breeding that things can improve. But without control, without tests, preferably with the first one around the corner, you really can't reduce the incidence of certain defects. Tests are definitely not everything, but they can help with many things, and there is always a risk. We are talking about living beings, not carbon fibre <p>An answer that tells a person what the characteristics and needs of BOTH breeds are and that's enough. But the man has been given a ""lecture"" which he did not commission and is not prepared to pay for. He pointed this out a couple of times and then gave up. <p/> To me, he looked like someone who wanted to buy the cheapest possible gift, and in general he got very comprehensive answers (although he did not expect them to be comprehensive) and even surprisingly he did not just get lessons about not buying animals as gifts. You can only make a conclusion from what is written... what the heck... that's the way it is on the forum... <p/> Yes. Functional illiteracy and/or intolerance of dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just like that on the forum. <p/> There are already too many of those. They were created when standardisation started, which if I'm not mistaken was in the Victorian era. You win ;-) Everyone has their own views on the world, animals etc. You don't have any. <p/> I would like to ask you something else. Maybe somebody lives in Vic. We could get together sometime and go I don't know to PST or the carob. We moved here recently so we don't know any or very few. We always need company:-) <p/> You know what saddens me the most? E.g. this: http://www.pesjanar.si/forum/index.php?topic=151.90 And right on the neighbouring forum, and elsewhere, they support so called ""controlled pedigree breeding"". What is controlled here? And this is not an isolated case, there are many, too many. Are they to be believed? They don't convince me... <p/>These defects are now being diagnosed, but that doesn't mean they weren't there before. <p/> Before, when you asked why you didn't have a dog anymore, they said, ""He was old"", and he was maybe a little over seven years old... One of the examples I have encountered in my life... And what do you say to them? (it was a village mixed breed) I am not saying that mixed breeds are more or less sick, but that you can't conclude from the number of visits to the vet how healthy they are. Because the one above must have died of old age, and yes, when you talk about the breed, there is the possibility of finding out a bit more about the history of the previous breeds, which is unfortunately not possible with mixed breeds, because nobody knows anything, unless they are all from the same village and people know them.... In that case they are usually much more closely related than some pedigree dogs. (villageinbriding) <p/> Hudma, he himself wrote that he was buying a dog as a gift, but he was actually looking for a pug...really gross illiteracy. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with this topic... Do you approve of buying a living creature for someone who has no idea what is in store for him? No one deserves that, not the giver and not the animal. If the recipient is younger, his parents are he he he <p/>salad, are you sad about the ultrasound? Aren't you in favour of the unsupervised? <p/> Yes, because it's clear to me that there are certain things you just don't want to know ....on the neighbouring forum all the ""evidence"" has been carefully deleted, that's how it's done here, I'm afraid. I will quote the following text: <p/> "" I am contacting you because I would like to warn potential buyers of my experience of [name and surname deleted at the request of the author, and the name of the kennel], which has been anything but pleasant. <p/> Around Christmas 2009 my partner and I bought a little bull terrier from her, who was just over 2 months old at the time. After much cajoling to hand over the papers, we went to her a couple of months later to get the pedigree, and then she asked, a little strangely, how much our Oscar was drinking, because one male from that litter had already died because his kidneys had failed because he was licking the salty snow by the roadside (which is, of course, a big stupid thing to do!). While nothing was clear to us at the time, we soon found out why she was asking such strange questions - we took the puppy to the vet, who diagnosed congenital chronic kidney failure and told us that his days were numbered. We informed [name removed] and asked her what she was going to do about it. She offered to buy another dog for a 'symbolic' price, but we refused and asked for a refund. She promised to send a reply by e-mail, but nothing happened for two months. In the meantime we met others who had bought dogs from the same litter and warned them about the disease. It turned out that out of the 6 dogs from the litter, 2 were already dead and 2 had severe kidney damage. I have no information on the other two. When we asked [name deleted] why she had not informed any of us that there might be something wrong with the dogs, she replied that she did not want to panic. Even after we had informed her about Oscar (so 2 puppies were already dead and one was sick), she did not warn anyone. <p/> As she had not emailed anything for two months, we called her and after many calls she did come back. In the meantime, Oskar had already been euthanised. When asked why she had not replied as promised, she said she had not had time. When my partner asked her if she was making a fool of him for not having had 10 minutes in two months to write an e-mail, she told him that if he meant to be rude, she would hang up. When he told her that Oskar was gone, she first asked ""How is he gone?"", but when he explained that we had had him euthanised, she was all amazed, as if she had not known that he was ill, and as if we had had the dog put to sleep just for a bit of a joke. And again she promised to send an e-mail. Today it is 14 days since that call, and I have not heard from her. I understand that puppies have unforeseen health problems, but for her to persistently proclaim herself a great dog lover, then hide the facts and react in this way to the fact that more than half of the litter is seriously ill or already dead, and yet tell no one and persistently avoid contact, to me clearly shows her attitude to animals. <p/> I would therefore caution anyone who may wish to buy a puppy from [name of kennel deleted, at the request of the author] to think carefully about it, because, while everything seems fine on their side, our experience and that of others who have bought puppies from this litter suggests otherwise. "" <p/> Will something be clearer now? This is how it is in the St. Florian Valley....this is what is supported here! <p/> Yes, my sorrow! You can find scum everywhere. And what doesn't convince you? Are you going to lump everything together because of some bad breeders? And purebreds without pedigree convince you, huh? The ones who haven't had a single test. Hehehe, you're the one who should believe the tests you're going to get from a breeder rather than from a home breeder! <p/>What to do with all the xy tests if such breeders are breeding? But nobody dares to comment on that? Why does such a breeder continue to breed? Why is he being advertised where they are the most vocal about supertruper honestly controlled pedigree breeding? Considering the number of ""renegades"" in slo, I doubt I can get a better (healthier) pedigree dog than a mix. And no, I don't trust our breeders. And I don't know what's funny here. <p/> Well, with all the xy tests (mandatory + desirable) that a breeder would show you, you could see that he actually cares about the health of the bitch, the puppies and the breed itself! Because if he didn't, he wouldn't even go to do them. A quasi breeder will never show you xy tests and you don't buy a dog from one! Simpl ko pasulj! <p/> I find your way of thinking funny. Let's say the bitch is having a fight with the neighbour's NO. She has a heart problem for example (when you come to see her she looks pure awesome) and he's a poor bastard who can barely walk and he's only 4 years old. You'd rather take the dog from me, because....... the puppies will be bursting with health because they are mixed-breeds? I can tell you fairy tales, but the one who has done the 5 tests has the proof <p/> Andreja, are you making fun of me???? QUOTE: Greetings, I am in the process of buying a dog, not for me, but I still need some advice. I am deciding to buy a pug, not a purebred, this one is a mix between a pug and a cavalier king charles. I would like to know if this dog is a lot of work, I have read a lot of things on the net, some people say that it is necessary to clean the fold every day, to comb it, that it is a special food, fruit... and that it is a quiet family dog, which is mainly intended for the house, I would like to have some more opinions from the owners who have this type of dog, thank you very much! <p/> I underlined his question, now you tell me where he is asking about my/your/our opinion on giving a dog away. PLEASE? The man is asking about the character traits and idiosyncrasies of a pug and a cavalier. BUT NO???? But is it so difficult to write a couple of answers to a SIMPLE question? <p/> The guy wanted to buy a dog as a gift. That's not how it's done. Regardless, he got the answers to his questions. He just didn't like them and didn't want to see them accordingly. He was told that he would not buy a pug (whose qualities he was interested in) nor a mix, but a cross between the two dogs. For which no one can predict what he will take from which parent (they are very different breeds in character and structure, the only thing they have in common is that they are not large (like crossing a Springer Spaniel with a Mastiff and wanting to know what you will get out). He was told that both breeds were medically demanding. Why? because most of the problems that afflict these two breeds are due to their physique. This problem is not due to standards, but both breeds have had this problem since God knows when - pugs are very old dogs, cavaliers a little less so, but both were around long before x-rays, ultrasounds...Be that as it may, the problems of cavaliers are such that it is difficult to weed them out of breeding, because there are no simple genetic or other tests to detect them before they occur. They do appear quite late in life. Now.... these problems are not hidden and are common knowledge. Anyone who nevertheless chooses to breed will look for parents who have their hearts checked regularly and those who have not had syringomyelia in a noticeable form in their ancestors. This is possible exclusively in pedigrees. Those who want a less risky breed will take a cockerel (which, unfortunately, is not so fancy). So the guy got the answer that a mix of these two breeds would be a risky purchase and that there was a high probability that the recipient would leave a hefty pile of money at the vets. OK? <p/> Hahaha oh how it was also conditioned by the standards (that the characteristics in the offspring are VERY similar from characteristics to looks). Quote from wiki:The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred(Means to breed within a single family or strain, so as to produce particular characteristics in the offspring) with flat-bred breeds. I created a bunch of new problems that nowadays complicate this breed but not only that mostly everything. Not to say that there weren't problems before, but in very minor ways. How many breeds have problems with joints, breathing, massive eyelids to congenital diseases like chronic kidney failure,etc. People this is sick what is happening to dogs and don't give me crap how some xy tests can solve them because they can't. <p/> If a dog is a butcher (anything in this case without a pedigree), it is not a priori immediately healthy because of that (most people don't see a vet because of bad owners, not because of their brilliant health!). <p/> Just because a dog is pedigree doesn't mean it will be healthy all its life. If the breeder is on the spot, i.e. cares about the dogs, he will do all possible tests to avoid doing the vets a disservice. So, if by means of tests (for which you only need to take blood or saliva - once in the life of the dog, because they keep these things and then you can order a new test every month and don't have to get rid of it all at once) you can breed in such a way that you don't get out affected dogs, I don't understand why not. (I partly understand all of you who have non-breeding approaches, because you don't want to admit mistakes (you turn a blind eye, you fool the ostrich...) i.e. you support stepparies and the torture of animals. (There are ""specimens"" among breeders too, but it also depends on what is a ""specimen"" for you.)) <p/> Pidog. I may have hit the antijack road with the mesan in terms of their health. It's just my opinion that they are one of the few dogs (percentage-wise) that are cared for like pedigree dogs of less common breeds (in short, tipitopi or as the law says - if there is something wrong with the dog, vet and not sus). <p/> Well, yes, the history of kcs is much more complicated, but so be it - some breed expert could give more precise information. The problem with the kcs is not so much that they have a short muzzle (nor is it extremely short like, say, a pug) but that the skull is too short in the temple. <p/>Now...the question was yes or no to the deliberate production of dogs. And it's not really a question of yes or no, but how. Because the question of breeding dogs is not so very simple that you can lump everything together. But to say that in general breeds are better/worse than mixes in any trait. Because breeds vary so much from one another, and there are often huge differences between types within a breed. You have a number of breeds whose typical representatives are distinctly vigorous, hardy and long-lived, and you have breeds that have more or less difficulty in this respect. In principle, any breed characterised by an exaggerated trait is more at risk. However, with clever planning and selection, even in these breeds you can get healthy dogs that function perfectly normally. <p/> Usually the biggest problems arise when a breed's trait is to be changed at short notice. Usually, unfortunately, because of a fad of one kind or another. A desire to ""improve"" rather than preserve the breed. What role does the standard play in this? A standard is nothing more than a description of a typical representative of the breed. The problem is that what is written can be interpreted in different ways. It says, for example, the ears are long - and then it starts to select for the longest possible ears. In the standard it says long hair, but they start selecting for dogs with hair that drags on the ground. Apart from the fact that no exaggeration is good in itself, you almost always get a surprise in the package when you go to select for one trait rather than the whole. Usually unpleasant. <p/> Having said the bull terrier - in that breed they have gone to changing the almost normal skull shape to a sheep skull. In a very short time. They have got so many problems in the package that the breed is in serious trouble and those who love the breed and would like to save it will have to think honestly about how to proceed, make a well thought out plan and probably take a big step backwards. The problem almost always arises when too much emphasis is placed on show results when selecting dogs for breeding and when selecting combinations. <p/> Mixes... whichever - but the fact is that even those ""true"" mixes that have had pedigree ancestors going back I don't know how many knees, or never at all, have all the hereditary problems that plague pedigrees. There are not even a few mixed breeds with various hereditary diseases, but until recently there have been a few who have even been diagnosed. <p/>A few years ago we had a lost blind mix, of the 'foxy' variety that has been around in villages here for ages, with no identifiable breed inside..... was diagnosed with two different hereditary eye diseases and a third that was the result of one of the two. In addition, he had chronic digestive and skin problems. But we also had a pretty healthy mix who couldn't hide the Yorkshire in his background, who lived to be just over 20 years old <p/> only he doesn't want a conformation, he wants a breed.... (or a chrysance between two problematic breeds) <p/> I also partly understand all of you who keep barking the same five half-truths endlessly, because you are just not able to comprehend those who think differently. <p/> After reading such and such threads, I realised that there are more and more people buying from breeders...I was sure that this would change over the years, but it has got worse...this forum has also become just a chatterbox, since some people have newly signed up and are just looking for a breeder to fill their free time.... <p/>If a different opinion is so unacceptable, you can ban me, of course. But in doing so you will confirm my point about not accepting dissent. <p/> Put it any way you like, no matter how badly a breed is doing, the non-breeding approximations of that breed are doing even worse.",Forum,dev

752,"27.09.2006 I find the title question interesting. Sometimes it seems to me that most people do not even ask it, because we live in a more or less school-taught and almost taken-for-granted belief that we judge things, people, their actions and events on the basis of the facts and by using our own common sense. And, accordingly, many people would probably answer the question posed by the title by saying that it is the authority of the argument that applies to them, not the other way round. But is this true? And how about in law? Are we persuaded by arguments or by the authority of the person who presents them? <p/> With the New Age and the tradition of the Enlightenment, the belief in human reason (ratio) became firmly established in Western society. This was particularly due to the development of the natural sciences, which, with their (apparent) exactitude, in many respects inspired legal thinkers. In particular, the proponents of the rationalist view of natural law, according to which the fundamental principles of law are somehow axiomatically rooted in ordinary human reason, believed that from the (highest) principles of law (e.g. neminem laedere or pacta sunt servanda) the correct solution to any legal problem or question could be found by deductive reasoning. This almost ""mathematical"" conception of law also led to the belief that legal reasoning is done by demonstration, i.e. by illustrative and formal logical demonstration or proof. However, after the more modern natural sciences have disproved the belief that science can be purely exact, and after the relativistic world-view (which is also known from many earlier historical periods, e.g. from the time of ancient Greek sophism) has regained a large measure of its right of homeland in the social sciences and law, faith or trust in the method of legal demonstration has in many respects also been dispelled. In its place, especially in the second half of the last century, the idea of legal argumentation came to dominate the field of legal logic. Although the term 'demonstration' is still used in many places in law and more widely today, it is in fact increasingly used to mean persuasion. Since, as I have written in various places, everything is relative in space and time, so is (i.e. relative) all (legal) evidence. A fact is prima facie evidence of guilt for one person, but not for another. If nothing else, a fact can be shown in a completely different light than it was previously shown in a narrower context, simply by expanding the (temporal, spatial, mental, emotional, etc.) context in which it is observed. <p/> All this is particularly familiar to lawyers. What is pure and indisputable truth to one litigant is pure and indisputable falsehood to the other litigant, the facts being the same but the human interpretations of those facts (and indeed of the legal norms) being different. Of course, sometimes a so-called material fact can be completely indisputable in itself (e.g. the identification of an object, DNA or blood traces) and as such really proves something. But one can expand the context and say that in the process of identifying such a fact (e.g. identification of the murder weapon, the perpetrator or DNA) there was a mistake, or even conscious manipulation, lying, etc. Therefore, any evidence is only valid as such to the extent that it is convincing to those who judge it. Convincingness, however, is to a large extent related to our subjective perception and evaluation of the world around us. In law and in life in general, we are therefore constantly persuading ourselves. If we come across someone with similar values, education, etc. to our own, we will quickly click with them and the need for persuasion will diminish. In the opposite case, i.e. when we encounter a person with a completely different way of thinking and value worldview, even with the most obvious facts and evidence (in our opinion, of course), we will not be able to convince (much less ""prove"") that we are right about something. If you don't believe me, just start talking to people about politics. Put forward a few of your own claims that you think are based on demonstrable facts, preferably relating to denationalisation, redress, assessment of the current or previous government, etc. I think you will quickly come across someone whom you will not be able to convince of your ""facts"" or ""evidence"". <p/> Anyone who has managed to follow my train of thought up to this point (which of course is not necessarily the case) can now easily see that (as Kant might have said) facts are not only something we perceive, but above all something we (co-)create. It is therefore important to be as convincing as possible in relation to others and to ourselves in defining or evaluating facts, that is to say, to be able to argue our views and positions as well as we can. But now let us ask ourselves what I said in the title of this paper. Is it the authority of the argument or the argument from authority that is decisive for us? Are we more persuaded by a good, skilful, illustrative, comprehensible, etc. argument, or are we more persuaded by the authority of the personality of the person who is making the argument? <p/> The answer to the above question is, of course, by no means unambiguous, because the two are intertwined. But nevertheless, if we look a little deeper into the matter, we can quickly see that in life in general we trust the argument from authority to a markedly overwhelming degree. Just think about how many things in life we know enough about to be able to make reliable judgements about statements of fact that are explained to us by someone who knows better. Can we judge for ourselves the arguments put to us by a doctor, perhaps even a surgeon, a physicist, an architect, a builder, an electrician, this or that legal specialist, a historian, etc.? Is it not the case that we simply believe most of these people, trust them? And if we don't, then we find someone who does. And if someone we trusted disappoints us, we look again for someone else we can trust - a new dentist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, lawyer, politician, etc. <p/> All this makes us realise the crucial importance of trusting people, not arguments. Since this is also extremely important for law, I will devote a future column to reflecting on the importance of trust in law, drawing on some of the thoughts presented here. For the moment, let me just say that anyone who thinks that they are guided to a greater extent by the authority of argument in judging things and people and their actions and behaviour is probably mistaken, because in reality we humans are predominantly following the authority of personality. In law, as in ethics, politics, religion and even science, we are in fact usually more persuaded by who than by what (although the two are in fact interdependent). If, for example, we are watching a controversial panel discussion on a topic on which we are more or less unfamiliar (or at least not sufficiently familiar with the relevant facts), then the persuasiveness of the persons presenting the arguments will play a decisive role in our decision as to which arguments are more persuasive. This persuasiveness is a certain emanation, a personal magnetism that people perceive according to their own (subjective) mental, energetic, emotional and other qualities. Of course, we should not overlook that this is a matter of sympathy, which means that we can only ever be represented in authority by someone who is close to us in what they do or represent, i.e. sympathetic in the true sense of the word.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

797,"Backstories <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> Personally, I am very fond of consecutive interpreting ""on the ground"". This is done on various missions, as we call them in the jargon, or visits by inspectors for various areas, such as agriculture, veterinary, EU funds and so on. Such interpretation is quite different from working in interpreting booths, for example, where seemingly trivial paragraphs of European legislation are discussed all day long. On the ground, it is primarily the implementation of this legislation that is being determined. Only then do we have the opportunity to see that the provisions of this legislation must also be observed and implemented by concrete people, and what difficulties this can cause. Such interpretation requires not only special preparation in terms of content, but also special equipment. For example, in agricultural inspections, gojzars or rubber boots, jeans and anorak are part of the compulsory equipment, as we also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. We also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. <p/> Best interpreting experience? <p/> The best experiences are those in which you become part of a team, especially when you interpret for several days or a whole week in a row in the same team. The dynamics of this kind of collaboration are interesting: from the initial ""guessing"" of who is who, to not even saying goodbye to your team at the end. At the beginning, there is often a slight sense of mistrust, like how are you going to be able to understand and even translate our professional content? Over time, participants ""relax"" as they realise that we interpreters not only understand what they are talking about, but are also able to translate complex professional content competently into another language. <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> We sometimes work with ""beneficiaries"" of agricultural payments to determine whether the ""competent authorities"" are assessing the land properly, including through the method of re-survey. This looks like a field being measured by a representative of our competent authority, followed by an EU inspector, followed by an interpreter with the obligatory notepad and pencil in hand. Then it starts to rain, and the real art is to stand in the soggy field, holding an umbrella and a notepad, writing down what you hear and then interpreting appropriately and loudly enough. Quite a field ""multi-tasking"", no less. <p/> Most unpleasant interpreting experience? <p/> On one occasion interpreting in court, back in the days when I still wore tight skirts and heels, I discreetly sneak out of the courtroom on minus two decibels and when I return, just as discreetly, I spot a jogger on the smooth parquet floor and... swish, I fold myself as long and wide as I am, the courtroom is flooded with a choral ahhhhh, and I'm already standing and disappearing into the cramped editing booth. Oops. It's embarrassing when a speaker is evasive in his speech or answer, using a thousand masks to hide the fact that he has nothing to say ... and then you have to paint over that ""big nothing"". <p/> Why did you choose to become an interpreter? Has it lived up to your expectations? <p/> The choice of profession came about as a result of a pragmatic decision to put into practice one of the talents that I had been given. I had no expectations when I chose the profession, but it has exceeded my expectations of where it could take me and what it could enable me to do. The decision was made after I read an article about the profession, which inspired me, and I immediately started researching where it was possible to study. The profession met my expectations and I have never regretted my choice. <p/> What should an interpreter be like and what should an interpreter never do in the booth? <p/> Above all, an interpreter should be professional. He or she should be aware of his or her role, prepare for the job, be discreet, impartial, polite, and take for granted the confidentiality of the information obtained. He should be collegial in the cubicle, undisturbing to colleagues. Whatever the situation, whatever the complexity of the work and whatever the content of the interpretation, he should remain calm and collected - which, to be honest, is sometimes easier said than done ... <p/> What about interpreters' quips? <p/> Protesters like to turn into protesters in the interpreter's haste. Handel mit weißer Ware quickly becomes a white-goods trade. When interpreting from English, we like to become avid fans of sexual transformation: we announce Mrs X, and a statuesque gentleman in a polka-dot suit stands up and speaks in a shamelessly beautiful baritone, or we announce Mr Y, and it's no surprise that a plump young woman with a plunging neckline squeals... yes, we interpreters are very innovative. <p/> Speakers' quips when (not) using interpreters or why are interpreters important? <p/> During her presidency, one high-ranking official insisted on speaking English herself at high-profile protocol events, despite not having the best command of the English language and the obvious presence of interpreters. She constantly referred to the European Union as the ""European Onion"". Needless to say, 'European Onion' appears in almost every other sentence during the Presidency. <p/> What do you consider to be the advantages and/or disadvantages of the interpreting profession? <p/> I see the advantages of interpreting mainly in the possibility of continuous learning, the changing working environment both in terms of space and people, which keeps one fresh, but at the same time gives one a good old philosophical thought, which, of course, did not grow on my own lawn, but which I like to use: I know that I know nothing: I know that I do not know anything. I can deduce the weaknesses from the last thought, because you can never know for sure that you have mastered the subject. Another weakness could be found in the variability of the environment, which can contribute to a lack of intensity in personal relationships. <p/> Disclaimer: The photographs illustrate different interpretive situations and are not related to the content of the specific texts.

798,"Instructions for Authors <p/> Scientific focus <p/> In the 'Long-term environmental change' series, we publish the results of research on past and present environments. In particular, we invite multidisciplinary contributions from researchers dealing with the long-term evolution of the environment in the Pleistocene and Holocene (and possibly earlier) of Slovenia (and beyond), ecological, geomorphological, sedimentological and chemical processes, nature conservation measures, biodiversity, the emergence of cultural landscapes, and the impact of humans on the environment in the past and present. Contributions are welcome in the following fields: palaeoecology and ecology (e.g. archaeozoology, archaeobotany, palynology, (palaeo)limnology, ...), biology, nature conservation, geology, geography, chemistry, archaeology, (palaeo)climatology, ... Are there any sciences we have forgotten? <p/> Manuscript submission <p/> The manuscript you submit should be an (original or review) scientific article, written for experts in other disciplines (e.g. participants in 'Long-term environmental change' conferences) and for the more sophisticated 'semi-scientific' reader: the writing style should be clear and accessible, and should include scientific argumentation and citations to the literature. If the topic relates to results that have already been published elsewhere (e.g. in journals specialising in your field of research) and you would like to write a more interdisciplinary paper this time, and to shed light on the issue from a different perspective than in the original publication, please include a copy of the previous publication(s) alongside your manuscript. <p/> We accept submissions all year round and will try to ensure that no more than one year elapses between submission and publication. Authors should submit: <p/> 1. A cover letter stating that the manuscript has not been published elsewhere and will not be submitted to any other journal or monograph while it is under review for 'Long-term Environmental Change'. In the letter you can propose two referees you would like to have evaluate your work. The Editor reserves the right to take your preference of reviewers into account or not. You can also nominate a researcher whom you do not want to review your paper - in this case the Editor will be sympathetic to your wishes and will act with discretion. If there are several authors of a paper, the editor will communicate with only one (first) author, who will represent all co-authors. <p/> Please send your manuscript (in electronic form and on paper) to the editor's address: <p/> Maja Andrič Institute of Archaeology ZRC SAZU Novi trg 2 SI-1001 Ljubljana maja.andric@zrc-sazu.si tel. (01) 4706 434 <p/> 2. Manuscript <p/> The manuscript should be no longer than 4500 words (+ references), font size 11, double spaced, and the pages should be numbered. File name Author_DSO.doc or Author_et_al_DSO.doc. The structure of the text should follow the classic structure of a scientific article: Introduction/Method/Results/Discussion/Conclusion. The text should be written in Slovene and the abstract (maximum 200 words) in Slovene and English, with 6 keywords. The title should be brief and the manuscript should include the addresses and contact details of all authors. Footnotes are not desirable: if the information is important then it belongs in the main text, if it is not important then it is redundant, but if the problem is that it is important information that would distract from the main flow of the narrative and argumentation and make the text difficult to read at this point: it can be presented in a table or with a figure. As the text will be read by researchers from other disciplines, please avoid highly technical jargon and abbreviations (or explain terminology, complex research methods or complex environmental processes separately, in a text of approx. 200-300 words, which will be printed in a box separate from the rest of the text). <p/> Submissions will be published in Slovenian with an English translation of the full text. Authors may submit the text in Slovenian (if they wish to have the paper reviewed by Slovenian reviewers) or English (if they wish to have the paper reviewed by foreign (and domestic) reviewers). As the series does not have a permanent source of funding to cover the costs of translation and proofreading, we will be seeking sponsors for this purpose. We will ask you to help our translator in translating your article, but if you take care of the translation yourself, we will be especially happy to hear from you! <p/> Literature citation <p/> In-text citation, G.

801,"Last Tuesday, 23 April 2013, Slovenian brands Marta Vodeb, Terra Urbana, Nelizabeta and Urša Zrnec and Pentlja by Goga presented their jewellery collections at the Emporium Gallery. <p/> On a beautiful spring evening, the Gallery prepared a magical event, which was opened on the ground floor by Marta Vodeb. Mannequins walked down the Gallery's imposing staircase to the sound of Slovenian evergreen melodies, dressed in the Girl from the Golden Boat collection in silk, lace and wool and adorned with short sleeves, bows and pearls. The collection is romantic, delicate and nostalgic and worthy of praise. <p/> Upstairs, Terra Urbana brings nature to life. Inspired by the world of butterflies, the Dragonfly Married Butterfly SS2013 collection is a blend of tenderness with strength, tradition with trend and fabrics that are friendly to people and nature. <p/> Upstairs, the evergreens were replaced by thumping electronic music, while the escalators served as the prefect backdrop for both the summer and part of the winter 2013/14 collection by Nelizabeta. The summer collection was inspired by the 1920s, art deco and sports fashion, while the winter collection was inspired by the national costumes of the former Yugoslavia and military uniforms. Not only the clothes, but also the shoes and bags are the work of designer Neli Štrukelj. All the products are made in the Nelizabeta team's home workshop in Sežana, where they combine the experience of the old masters with modern technology and innovation. The summer and autumn/winter collections are most impressive for the coats. <p/> On the ground floor, we also saw Urša Zrnec's glass jewellery and Pentlja by Goga in vibrant neon colours that scream summer. <p/> Petra Draškovič from Galeria Emporium told Fashionista.si that Slovenian designers are becoming more and more visible and marketable in the Gallery. Especially successful are the jewellery collections, which are also sought after by tourists and other visitors from abroad. However, she stressed that a lot also depends on the designer himself and his will to do something for the brand's recognition and promotion. ""At the Gallery we are proud to host Slovenian designers. Our doors are open to everyone, anyone can come to us, show us their collections and we assess whether they are of high enough quality and commercial enough for us to participate. We are very excited about the development of Slovenian fashion."" <p/> The second day of the fashion week was filled with presentations of their collections by Urša Drofenik, Simona Lampe, Maja Štamol, Vladimira Kralj and Miro Misljen in the first part and Matevž Faganel, Sanja Grcić, Nicola De Main, Aleksandra Brlan and Maja Ferme in the evening part. <p/> In the afternoon show, Simona Lampe and Maja Štamol pleasantly surprised with their wearable and sale collections. The evening show was opened by Faganel, who this time went a little out of his comfort zone and surprised with dresses and knitwear combined with leather. He collaborated with Anna Lazovski and Eber Furriers to design the collection. <p/> Sanja Grcić's clean tailoring is also worthy of praise, with her coats in particular catching the eye of the fashion cognoscenti. Sanja, like Urša Jerkič, wore the now famous Nataša Peršuh shirt that the designer sent to the runway at last year's Fashion Week. <p/> Maja Ferme chose to make a subtle critique of society at this year's show, backed up by rock n' roll music, punchy slogans and heavy embellishments on the evening dresses as well as on the jackets and coats. It is rumoured that she sewed every sequin, every pebble, every detail onto her own clothes.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

But only by a percent or two. But it's true that Mafia is an older game than VC. Maybe the next GTA will even catch up. But for once, Mafia is better for me. <p/> yes, in mafia it's a pain in the ass when you shoot a thomson for half an hour to kill a mafioso with a shkifarska and then shoot three times to kill him!!! cars go like tractors but it's true that mafia has the advantage that you can learn how to steal cars first!!! and when you walk by a bayti you'll see that everything is a bit strange but when it comes to GTA you can copy bayti!!!not to mention the fact that you drive a car in a skiff, and when you're not in the car, the skiff can see exactly how much you're driving when they had radar even back then!!! and you don't even have to get on a boat, but you still drive around!!! if I had more time, I'd be happy to discuss what mistakes there are in the mafia, and besides, GTA isn't without its faults!!!!!! so that you don't think that I'm defending GTA when you're at the beginning of the game and when you're on the phone, the phone is huge and when you're on the phone, you can also k**** into cars after having sex, and you can k**** it !!! so I like GTA better!!! maybe mafia 2 will be better than GTA and probably it will be!!! but when there will be a new GTA, it seems to me that mafia will be a lot of slapstick!!!!!!! we'll see!!!GTA IS THE LAW <p/> yeah you forget that sometimes the cars were really so slow and after the end you get better and very fast cars if you turn mafia 100% you get one car called crazy horse and it's impossible to drive because it's fast... besides you can put it on the back tyres... CRAZY <p/> yes angel you are right,if you turn around the game itself and the Lucas Bertone quests and Free Ride Extreme the game is even more interesting <p/> gee I can't stand to see your pointless posts comparing mafia to vice city. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. each has its own story and each takes place in a different time, which also explains the cars and their speeds. bOy; no spiel is without its faults, and mafia is also an older spiel, about 1 year old, so please. not with such meaningless comments!!!! <p/> didn't you even read it or did you lose your glasses???? i wrote that in GTA their phone is huge so before you write anything you can even read it!!!!and i didn't say that GTA is bug free but we are at the end of 2003 not 2222!!!!",Forum,dev
826,"I would like to know a couple of things about cat acne, if anyone has any more experience. mainly I know about the so called black dots under the chin, which are supposed to be cat acne or fungus? I know it can be done elsewhere on the body. <p/> I have seen the occasional spot on the chin in one of our cats, but now I have a different problem. fergie has these spots just under her nose, just on one side, and on her nose, mostly on the same side. around her nostril, if you can imagine. let me say that she eats quite stump-eating, and a lot of the time her nose helps with things, so it seems to me that this could be the cause of this outbreak around the nostril.... <p/> yesterday I cleaned that area with splivasept and water and it all went away under the snout, the skin was red there, today it's better... it's healing. there's one part on the snout that remains. instead of having a nice coat there, she has a small scab that doesn't come off with washing. of course I don't think to rub it too much, because it's extremely uncomfortable for her if I do that. <p/> I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to proceed? of course I can take her to the vet, that's not a problem... but I understandably try to avoid it if I can, because I don't want to upset the cat if I don't really have to. <p/> In my opinion it's just dirt, and when it dries it can stick so firmly to the skin that it's yikes. I just find it odd that it's so noticeable, because Fergie isn't white around the snot. I suggest just tapping the spot several times in a row with a soaked cotton wool, waiting a little each time, and then gently removing. A one-off treatment will almost certainly not get it all off, so keep repeating it, but preferably not on the same day, so that you forget the maca a little in between. <p/> yes, it's black up there, yes, I looked at it so close I could see it when you put your finger over it, but you can still feel that little spot. <p/> I think it will go slowly, yes, at least it hasn't gone back to where it was before <p/> When I still had temporaries, I used to dab their acne (even in the spot you described, it was usually) with colloidal silver on a cotton wool a couple of times a day...then the scab came off, peeled off and everything was ok underneath. <p/> u yeah, I didn't think of it right away, but it's good stuff! i'll try to get it now <p/> but otherwise it's pretty good! one little thing is still on the top of the snot, the rest looks good. i was actually thinking that there's a chance that they scratched each other and that's what caused the scab and the acne... what do i know. <p/> now I have another problem, because she scratched her ear too fergie doesn't scratch very gently, if she gets scratched she usually scratches it clean to the fullest, so she slaughters herself if she has to <p/> she gets rid of them for a couple of months. And they do it again. And then we repeat the treatment again and it's ok, until next time. They don't bother him, they don't hurt, they don't spread. They always appear on his chin. We haven't had more than 4 months of peace from them since he was caught. He is a special little guy who needs a little more ""maintenance"", he is just worth it. I don't care either, because I know what it is, but it's nothing terrible. Just acne.",Forum,dev

899,"Photovoltaics have regained momentum in Slovenia in recent years, as the construction of solar power plants for self-supply is on the rise. This means that we generate electricity solely for our own needs, and any surplus cannot be sold to distribution. The main principle of a solar power plant is to convert solar energy into electricity, and it does this using solar cells, which are the basic building blocks of photovoltaic modules. <p/> From an ecological point of view, a PV power plant is considered clean and environmentally friendly, as it does not produce any greenhouse or other gas emissions. Solar energy is the third most important source of renewable energy in terms of capacity, after hydro and wind power. More than 100 countries around the world use solar energy. Photovoltaics can be installed on the ground or mounted on the roof or walls of a building. <p/> In a solar power plant, the electromagnetic waves of the Sun are converted into direct current and voltage. The conversion process is completely inaudible, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly, and takes place in diffuse sunlight. Photovoltaics or photovoltaic systems can operate for many years and require little maintenance or intervention after their initial installation, so that after the initial investment costs, the operating costs of a PV power plant are very low compared to existing electricity generation technologies. <p/> What is PV - the PV module at the heart of the PV plant <p/> At the heart of any solar power plant or PV system (even for own use) are the photovoltaic modules, which are the generator of the solar power plant. Of course, the arrays, the mounting structure, the shielding and the metering point are also a necessary part of any solar power plant. <p/> A photovoltaic power plant consists of two sets of basic elements. The first is the photovoltaic modules, which are the heart of the solar power plant and play the role of converting the electromagnetic waves of the sun into direct current and voltage. The second set consists of the power elements, which serve to use the electricity generated for specific purposes. These include: rectifiers, supporting structure, connecting cables, DC and AC couplings, regulators, batteries, switching and protection devices and other installation materials. <p/> A PV module consists of identical solar cells connected in series. Depending on the types of solar cells installed, the PV cells (or modules) can be made of crystalline cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline modules) or amorphous silicon. A module consists of a number of solar cells in series (between 36 and 72 pieces/module), which are sandwiched between a toughened glass surface and a special EVA film. The edges of the so-called sandwich construction are then sealed with aluminium foil and a connection dock is mounted on the back of the module. The whole is then framed in an aluminium frame. <p/> Photovoltaics are virtually maintenance-free and operate extremely reliably. The regular maintenance that is required is to clean the surface of the modules once a year in case of major dust or dirt, and in the case of a stand-alone PV installation at home (for own use), we make sure that the surroundings are maintained and cleaned in case of overgrowth. <p/> Photovoltaic power plant - installation requires thoughtful planning <p/> The basic requirement for the installation of photovoltaics is a sunny, shade-free area. However, many of the challenges regarding the orientation of the building, its position and the pitch of the roof can be solved with module supports. The PV panels shall preferably be mounted on the sunny south side of the roof, or elsewhere if the south side is not possible, at an angle of 32 degrees. Deviating from the optimum angle by, for example, 20 degrees reduces the efficiency by about 5 %, while deviating from the southern direction to the east or west results in a loss of at least 15 %. Therefore, the deviation from the south direction should be as small as possible. The amount of solar radiation depends very much on the broad and narrow location of the building, and a lot on the time of year and the weather. In summer, the solar radiation is at a high angle - around 64 degrees, while in winter it is low - only below 16 degrees. Lower energy reflections, which require a larger solar cell area and a larger roof, must be taken into account, even in locations with lower solar radiation. These disadvantages, together with the intermittency and dependence on climatic conditions, must be taken into account in the design. The fact is that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the efficiency. In warmer places, solar radiation is much stronger, so the results are much more favourable. <p/> Self-use photovoltaics most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water <p/> Self-use photovoltaics, consisting of only a few (two to five) modules, most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water. The amount of electricity produced is quite low and you do not have to deal with the various paperwork that you have to do if you want to feed the energy produced into the grid. <p/> Larger or solar power plants, where the photovoltaics are made up of a larger number of modules, also produce a much larger amount of electricity. In this case, it is most worthwhile to get all the paperwork in order to obtain the right to feed the electricity into the grid. <p/> This option is sure to bring you the most profit, as the price of the green energy produced by a solar power plant is up to three times higher than that of conventional electricity. So if you were to use the energy produced in your household, the profit would be three times less than if you were to feed it into the grid. <p/>Solar energy is unlimited, clean and free. By using solar energy, we are also showing ourselves to be environmentally conscious. Welcome to Sol Navitas.",Information/Explanation,dev

I have opened the key and looked for any cold spots, but everything looks fine. I would be grateful for any advice. Kind regards. <p/> What now, did you or did you not format it? If you have formatted it successfully then use programs ala Recuva, PCInspector FileRecovery, etc. If the explorer sees it (that it has a letter assigned to it e.g. X) then do a chkdsk in the Command Prompt window with the command: chkdsk x: /f If the format didn't go through then let me know what you report! Do you see it in DiskManagement? Give me a picture. Format it with Rufus (choose fast format, of course). Then save the data. Which OS do you have? Try in the second, third usb2.0 port and not the usb3.0 port, etc. <p/> I haven't formatted it because it won't let me. If I press cancel nothing actually happens, but the cloud recommending formatting keeps flashing at 2 second intervals. If I open the ""task manager"" and look at what is going on at that time, all I see is the same application multiplying. This multiplication starts the moment I connect the USB to the computer and ends when I switch it off. Everything I have described is happening to me on Win 7 Ultimate. I have also tried it on XP. There the matter behaves slightly differently. I don't get any warning when I plug in the key. The computer detects the key, but when I try to open it, I get a warning that the key needs to be formatted. I didn't do this in XP, but I'll try it there as you advised. <p/> So, to continue from my last post in this thread. I have tried to format the key with the aforementioned Rufus program on both OSes (Windows 7 Ultimate and XP), but to no avail. I also tried running the key on all possible USB ports as you advised. The case behaves as follows. When I connect the key to my computer and open Rufus, the window from this program starts flashing at 2 second intervals. Nevertheless, it allows me to select ""quick format"". Then I start the formatting and after a good second the message ""FAILED"" appears in the bottom frame of Rufus and in an additional cloud ""Error: Error while partitioning drive"". I tried to save the data with Wondershare's File scavenger. When I started the scan, it displayed ""No relevant data found! Please click Options on the right top and unselect Only scan unused sectors when scanning. Then try to scan again"". I also heeded this warning and repeated the scan. Unfortunately still no success. I also tried CMD's ""chkdsk"" command, but it says ""The type of the file system is RAW. Chkdsk is not available for RAW drives"". <p/> I assume the USB stick size is showing wrong or 0. In this case it is not possible to format in low level format or any other format. All you need is to download the chipgenius program: http://www.usbdev.ru/files/chipgenius/ It reads the USB stick, with a bit of luck tells you which controller it is and where to get the controller reset tool. If not, you can find the tool on the net via vid and pid number. All other attempts to format will be futile and a waste of time. <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> If I try to format a key with File scavenger, it shows me the size of its memory, but next to it it says Unlocated partition. If I insert a healthy key into the computer, it usually says ""Drive F"". <p/> Since the first post, I'm still waiting for an answer as to what DiskManagement sees... But ok, now you've come up with the word RAW yourself, which would be obvious from the DiskManagement image. And usually a right click on that grey box is enough to initialize the whole partition/size of the stick then the quick format and data rescue goes better with all the programs listed. If it doesn't, the controller has actually crashed. _________________ The greatest charm - electrician <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> I used chipgenius which read me VID = 090C, PID = 1000.

Does it have any micro switches by the side? Can you see the contents on it? Some known examples: Since you have XP, work with a user who has admin rights ! 1. If you can read the usb stick, try in CommandPrompt with the command: attrib -r x:\*.* (if x: is the letter assigned to the usb stick) switch -r to the files on the stick to remove the hidden attribute (if they have it, of course) Then test. 2. Try safe boot (insert the stick and press F8 when you turn on the computer, select Safe Mode with Command Prompt), when you get to the command prompt, type: format x: (if x: is the letter assigned to the USB stick) Maybe the classic format will come in handy here. 3. Start Regedit (with admin rights) and parse the entry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies then double-click on ""WriteProtect"" and enter 0 (zero). If the ""WriteProtect"" key does not exist, hide it; highlight StorageDevicePolicies, right-click, select New Dword, type Write Protect and Enter, then type zero as before. 4. Try KillDisk, which is primarily a wipe program and overwrites it with zeros (in the program, select your usb stick, tick ""Select for Wipe/Kill"", select ""Kill"", ""One Pass Zeros"" will do, enter the password ""erase-all-data"" and it starts gnawing on it. 5.
