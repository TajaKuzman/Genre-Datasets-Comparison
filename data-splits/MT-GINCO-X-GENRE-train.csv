5,"Miscellaneous <p/> This year, for the 30th time, the Swiss compared all types of new cars on the basis of criteria set out years ago by the Heidelberg Institute for the Environment (IFEU). For the first time, hybrid cars lost first place to natural gas cars. <p/> Three eco-cars, the VW eco-up, the Skoda Citigo and the Seat Mii, took first place <p/> How the table is made The comparisons are always based on the latest scientific findings and the state of the art. Over the last ten years, new findings have continuously influenced the scoring, as the environmental impact of individual emissions has always been reconsidered. CO2 emissions, emissions of fine particulate matter, the burden on humans and the natural environment have become more important in the scoring. CO2 was found to be the main greenhouse gas, and vehicles account for one third of all emissions, which is why its share is so high. Interestingly, there are no electric cars on the list, as the assessors did not obtain reliable data on their characteristics. <p/> The table below shows all the passenger cars, from small to large, that scored the highest in the evaluation. <p/> Noise, toxins and nature In Switzerland, two thirds of people feel overwhelmed by noise, mainly from traffic. The constant noise environment causes stress and ill health, and is also bad for heart patients and cancer sufferers. Measurements have shown that the impact of the noisiest car is as disturbing to people as if ten cars with the lowest noise levels drove past at the same time. The most toxic substances are emitted by a vehicle on a cold start and depend on the type of fuel. They also point out that modern petrol injection engines emit extremely high levels of soot. They measure the impact on nature in terms of NOx emissions. Together with sulphur dioxide, they cause acidification of the soil, overfertilisation of soils and rivers, and are involved in the formation of harmful ozone peaks in summer. <p/> Impact prioritisation in the assessment <p/> Model selection Only vehicles emitting no more than 150 g of CO2 per kilometre, equivalent to 6.5 litres of fuel per 100 km, can be included in the assessment list. The exception is large cars with more than 5 seats, which can reach up to 180 g/km. Not all variants of one model have been considered in the comparison, as the list would be too long, so the more environmentally friendly variants have always been chosen. Niche models or vehicles from manufacturers with a negligible market share were also not considered. <p/> What the measurements showed Last year, the Lexus CT 200h Hybrid, a lower-mid-range vehicle, came first. This year, it was pushed into fourth place by three equivalent vehicles powered by a mix of natural gas and biogas, which is found at all gas stations in Switzerland. The first-placed VW eco up! also scores highly in terms of occupant safety, with the best result in the crash tests. The lack of occupant protection is therefore no longer an excuse to buy a car that is too big for its number. The new Toyota Yaris is out of the top ten due to excessive noise, even though it has an extremely low CO2 emission of only 79 grams per kilometre. <p/> The development of electric cars is moving very slowly. New models appear only sporadically, as customers do not show the necessary enthusiasm. Manufacturers also do not provide scientifically based data that can be used for evaluation. In addition, they find that the factory consumption data is not true and drivers should only charge their electric vehicles with green electricity to make them environmentally attractive, according to the evaluators.",Promotion,train
7,"JUDGMENT: The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed) (money or substitute items), of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence given. However, the court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather the procedural material and does not relieve the party of the obligation to plead all the facts and to adduce the evidence on which it bases its claims (judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11.5.2006). <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <The costs of the audit shall be borne by the auditee. <p/> SUMMARY: (1) The sums claimed in the application relate to the payment of the insurance premium (SIT 62,155,660.00) and to compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant as a result of the non-payment of the insurance premium (SIT 61,516,094.55 and EUR 1,081,484.50 in tolar equivalent). On 31.5.1996 the parties concluded an insurance contract (the Contract) under Policy No 814552, which was governed by the defendant's 'General Conditions for the Insurance of Animals', the 'Special Conditions for the Insurance of Fish in the Sea' and the addendum to that policy. The latter provided for the escape of fish from the applicant's cages as a result of a wind of the eighth degree of force on the Beaufort scale (gale) as an insured event. On 5 August 1997 the applicant reported the escape of 224 684 perch and sea bass. The Court of First Instance found that a storm had indeed raged between 25 and 27 December 1996, but held that the applicant had not proved that the number of fish allegedly escaped from its farm (from the cages on Platform III) as a result. <p/> (2) The Court of First Instance dismissed all the claims in their entirety. The Court of Second Instance dismissed the applicant's appeal against that judgment and, upholding all its findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirmed it. <p/> (3) The applicant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety by way of revision. In it, he relies on ""all the grounds of review"" referred to in Article 370(2)(1), (2) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A.). The Court of First Instance is asked to uphold the review and to alter the judgment of the Court of First Instance by granting the claims in the action or, in the alternative, to set aside the judgments of the Courts of First Instance and Second Instance and to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> (4) The review was served on the defendant, who did not reply, and on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> (5) The applicant was removed from the court register after all procedural steps in the review proceedings had been completed, with the exception of the issuance of the judicial decision. This act, which is a procedural act of the court, is not affected by the stay of the proceedings on the basis of the law itself (Article 205(1)(3) of the CPC), as the second sentence of Article 207(2) of the CPC is applied mutatis mutandis (thus the Supreme Court's judgment of 19.12.2006 in Case No III Ips 42/2006 as an expression of settled case-law). <p/> The revision is not justified. <p/> (6) The revision criticises the judgment of the court of second instance for a fundamental infringement of the provisions of the procedure referred to in Article 339(2)(14) of the Civil Procedure Code. It considers the infringement to be, in general terms, that the (contested) judgment of the court of second instance ""stated, contrary to the documentary evidence, some findings which contradict itself and which contradict the content of the documents or records of the depositions in the proceedings"". This is reflected, first, in the Court of First Instance's finding that, although the applicant, when reporting the damage on 30.12.1996, stated that 'a certain number of fish had also escaped', this nevertheless did not constitute a notification under policy No 8, but rather a notification of damage to the platform for a quarry on the platform. However, in order to satisfy the alleged ground of review, the judgment under appeal would have to be so defective as to preclude its review. That is not the case. The judgment under appeal is, in that respect (the last paragraph of the second page and the first paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal), capable of being reviewed: it is in agreement with the Court of First Instance, which itself gave full reasons (the last paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal).  <p/> (7) It is also possible to review the judgment under appeal (while the plea in law relied on is not raised) in so far as the auditor criticises it for contradicting the view that the plaintiff was late in declaring the escape of the fish in the light of the Contract and the provision of section 917(1) of the Law on Contractual Relations (LCCR) in force at the time, and the view that it did not forfeit its right to the benefit of the Contract as a result.  147 of the case-file) can be read without difficulty as meaning that the circumstances of the applicant's notification of the insured event - which was unusually (and unlawfully! ) late in the light of the care which the applicant, as a professional fish-farmer, should have been expected to exercise, and in the light of the applicant's established capacity to detect a significant decline in the number of fish (a 53 % escape of the insured population) - were taken into account by the court only in the context of its assessment of the evidence. The applicant did not (contrary to Article 918 of the Civil Code) lose its right to the sum insured by reason of the delay in informing the defendant, but its claims were dismissed on the ground that it had failed to prove the occurrence of the harmful event. <p/> (8) Finally, the judgment under appeal is reviewable even if the alleged illogicality between the assessment of the credibility of the farm workers who testified that the nets were blown down by the storm and the fish swam outside them and the evidentiary assessment that the plaintiff failed to prove the occurrence of the insured event were true. The assessment of the credibility of the workers in question is only part of the assessment of the evidence, which, however, was also assessed by the Court of Appeal on this point, with clear reasons (see the second paragraph of the third page of the reasoning). The substance of that evidential assessment itself, which is disputed by the auditor, on the ground that Platform I was completely destroyed in the storm, making it untenable to conclude that the fish did not escape from the nearby Platform III, is, as a question of fact, outside the scope of the review (Article 370(3) C.C.P.P.) <p/> (9) The substantive legal position of the Courts of Second Instance and First Instance, that the burden of proof of the occurrence of the insured event was on the claimant, is correct. It is not the case, as the Reviser submits, that the courts of second and first instance insisted that the claimant prove the escape of exactly 224 684 fish (see the third paragraph on page three of the judgment of the court of second instance). Their exact number could, in cases such as the present one, be determined (for the purposes of the litigation) by means of Article 216 of the CCP, but under conditions which are not met in the present case. <p/> (10) The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed in the action) (money or substitute goods) of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence adduced. That Article expressly provides that the court may do so if the amount of the sum claimed or of the replacement goods is either not ascertainable without disproportionate difficulty or not ascertainable at all. Neither of these (necessary, not sufficient) conditions is present in the present case. The court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather procedural material and does not relieve a party of the duty to plead all the facts and propose evidence on which it bases its claims (Supreme Court judgment and order, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11 May 2006). Since the procedural material gathered in the present case does not substantiate the assessment that any fish escaped as a result of the storm at all, the discretion of Article 216 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable. The courts of first and second instance were therefore correct in finding against the applicant on the basis of the burden of proof. <p/> (11) In so doing, the Supreme Court has responded to the revisionist submissions, which are of decisive importance. Since the grounds relied on did not prove to be well-founded and since it did not otherwise find that the substantive law had been erroneously applied, it dismissed the revision as unfounded on the basis of Article 378 of the CPC. <p/> (12) The decision on the costs of the review is based on Article 165(1) of the CPC in conjunction with Article 154(1) of the CPC. The applicant is to bear its own costs.",Legal,train

At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia will be presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, Legebitra Programme Manager. In the second part, we will talk to Vesna Leskošek about the national survey on violence in the private sphere. <p/> Dear feminists. Welcome to the Sector Ž show on this beautiful winter Saturday, which almost smells like the eighth of March. The strengthened and expanded editorial team of the show will present a new short film by Vesna Vravnik, A Lesbian Club in Every Village. The film premiered last December at the Café at the Trough in Metelkova. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia were presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, head of the youth programme at the Legebitra Information Centre. The report is prepared by Tea Hvala. In the second part, Ida will talk to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> On 10 December 2011, a presentation of the short film and the research, which were produced within the framework of the Legebitra Information Centre, took place at the Canteen at the Trough. Both concern the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia and represent a courageous attempt to expose their - sorry, our - invisibility. <p/> The documentary Lesbian Club in Every Village was made by Vesna Vravnik, a filmmaker and lesbian activist, who said that she struggled to find enough female interviewees who were willing to expose themselves on camera. It was particularly difficult for girls and women living in smaller Slovenian towns, where the fear of being judged and isolated is particularly well-founded - which is not to say that the situation in Ljubljana is ideal. When asked why she titled the film ""A Lesbian Club in Every Village"", Vesna replied as follows: <p/> The high school girls who agreed to participate said that the hardest thing to resist is being judged by those who have the most power over them: their parents and teachers. ""We don't expose ourselves at school,"" said a 16-year-old lesbian from Ptuj, ""because we are afraid for our grades. There are quite a few of us, but we are afraid of the older teachers. ""Another added: ""My class teacher called me into her office and told me to choose another school because I had appeared in the Pride Parade - because 'it doesn't go through with them'"". The perplexing question of why she did not sue the homophobic class teacher and the public school that acquiesced to her threat is urgent, but unfortunately also rhetorical. Why? Because we have to wonder again who even dares to seek legal remedies in a country where even the Constitutional Court is homophobic. <p/> With Team Dresch, the legendary lesbian band from the USA, we can sarcastically conclude that lesbians are again and still underground. Which does not mean, of course, that we will not circle a big YES for equality before the law in the referendum. <p/> We continue with the presentation of the extensive research conducted by the Legebitra Information Centre, which last year prepared an anonymous online questionnaire on the situation of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. Since not much is known about their lives, or ours, they wanted to find out what problems we face, what kind of environment we live in and how (if at all) we shape it. The analysis of the data is not yet complete, so here are just a few excerpts from the presentation at the Canteen at the Trough by Eva Gračanin, Head of Legebitra's Youth Programme. As the concept of ""non-heterosexual women"" is very broad, she first presented the sample of the survey, which included a whole range of gender identities. <p/> The women interviewed were older than those in the film, so it is to be expected that they would have pointed to work, not school, as the most risky environment for coming out. The fact that only 12 of the women came out at work is a testament to the fact that there is a very high chance of losing your job after coming out, or having to ""fire"" yourself because of the pressures. The data on the political participation and social life of LGBT and all other Others was also telling. Eva Gračanin said the following at the presentation: <p/> Perhaps the fear of public exposure and loneliness is easier to understand if we add one more piece of data to the above: only 20% of the women said they felt completely safe in their environment and family circle, and the same percentage of women said their families did not even know about their sexual orientation. More encouraging was the information about trustworthy friends: 60% of the women have such friends. For those women who are not so lucky, we would like to dedicate the song ""Way Out"" by German musician Ellen Allien, and we invite all listeners to listen again in May, when we will focus on a more detailed analysis of Legebitra's survey on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. <p/> In the second part of the programme, we spoke to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> To summarise: Violence against women, which according to the above-mentioned data is a very real reality in our society, is therefore the result of deep-rooted chauvinism and patriarchal structures. So please, let no one tell me anymore that feminism is a finished project, that today we can all have our own room if that is what we want! <p/> At the end of the programme, we call on all listeners to declare themselves, to declare their rights, because only then will they be able to demand a public space. The programme was produced by Tea Hvala and Ida Hiršenfelder. We will be back on the air of Radio Student on 11 March, when the Red Dawn will be rising on the horizon.",News,train

19,"Contributions <p/> More and more new and renovated housing is being built in a low-energy or even passive house concept. Low-energy buildings, and in particular passive buildings, are residential buildings whose primary purpose is to minimise energy consumption. <p/> By definition, a house should be low-energy when its heating energy demand is less than 50 kWh/(m ² a) and passive when it is less than 15 kWh/(m ² a). In practice, it may even be less than 10 kWh / (m ² a). <p/> Several factors are important for a building to reach these standards. The correct location and orientation, as well as the use of the right structures and materials, must be taken into account in the design and construction. <p/> The aim of this type of construction should be to minimise the energy used to heat and cool the building. <p/> This means that the following conditions must be met in the most efficient way possible: <p/> - use of solar energy directly through glass surfaces and indirectly through solar collectors for the production of domestic hot water, <p/> - the primary energy source for this type of building is the sun. However, in truth, we have to admit that in our region there are not many sunny days in winter. Therefore, on those days when the outside temperature is around 0°C or even lower, such facilities also need an additional source of energy. <p/> Most often, the additional source is a heat pump, which heats the building and provides the necessary amount of domestic hot water on cold days without solar radiation. <p/> As modern and technically sophisticated as heat pumps are, they also have drawbacks. As the ambient air temperature decreases, their efficiency decreases and the direct energy consumption increases. Another dilemma is what happens in the event of a power failure, which can sometimes last for a day or more. In this situation, this type of facility is completely helpless. <p/> All the above-mentioned devices - solar panels, heat pump and ventilation - are then useless. The very serious question is what to do in such a situation? <p/> One option is to use a solid fuel local heating system. But what kind? The building has a small, very meagre heat demand and all local solid fuel stoves are designed for a minimum of 6 kW and more. Such an installation would turn the building into a sauna, as the room temperatures would be significantly too high. But there is an answer, and that is a clay stove or a SMALL CLAY STOVE. <p/> 1 - Outside air inlet <p/> 2 - Fire door with glass <p/> 3 - Automatic combustion air inlet control <p/> 4 - Manual combustion air inlet control <p/> 5 - Fireclay combustion chamber - firebox <p/> 6 - Secondary combustion air inlet <p/> 7 - Afterburner zone <p/> 8 - Flue gas passage to flue ducts <p/> 9 - Fireclay flue ducts - 3m long <p/> 10 - Pottery lining <p/> 11 - Connection at top <p/> 12 - Connection at rear <p/> Most people think of a pottery stove as an artisan-built heating appliance, It is a stove heated with wood and heats one or at most two living spaces. We think of a rustic room, a mountain hut or a living room with a ceramic stove that warms the room in a cosy way. But in reality, the earthenware stove is an element that offers much more, because the possibilities of design and use of earthenware stoves in terms of design and thermal engineering are extremely wide. <p/> With the introduction of new living standards and the consequent construction of buildings with lower energy consumption, the need for individual solid fuel heating appliances of smaller size and power has become apparent. Manufacturers of earthenware stoves have identified a niche market and have adapted their products to this part of the market. We have developed so-called ""SMALL IRON STOVES"", which have the same characteristics as conventional designs, with the difference that they are smaller in terms of dimensions and heat output. <p/>Where are the advantages and why do customers choose such stoves? <p/> There is an increasing trend towards smaller living units and low-energy buildings where energy consumption is minimal and conventional solid fuel heating appliances are simply too powerful. <p/> Heat outputs of 1.2 - 3.0 KW using 3 to 5 kg of firewood per fire are ideal for this type of building. <p/> The operation of the combustion in the firebox is therefore completely independent of the room air. The combustion air can be controlled either manually or automatically. In the latter case, the microprocessor controls the air supply to the firebox via a control damper. <p/> The method of heat transfer by gentle radiation of the ceramic surfaces offers the most suitable solution in terms of health, comfort and convenience for man. As the proportion of convective heat transfer is lower due to the low surface temperatures, the movement of warm air through the room is also less intense, resulting in less dust particles being raised. This fact is particularly important for people with various allergies. <p/> The ability of fireclay materials to accumulate heat allows for a long heating cycle of up to 12 hours. This means loading firewood twice a day and thus very easy operation. <p/> Due to the modern technically sophisticated construction of the firebox and flue and thus the perfect combustion technique, the efficiency of the stove is very high, over 85, which means a low consumption of firewood and thus cheaper heating and less landfill. <p/> The perfect combustion results in high temperatures in the firebox, which means higher efficiency and more favourable emissions. <p/> The lifetime of such a stove is very long (at least one generation), which means that the investment is very rational. A long-term investment in a reliable, environmentally friendly and low-cost heating method. Maintenance and operation is simple. Wood biomass is used as the energy source, which is the most ecologically advantageous yet the cheapest. The glass fire door allows visual contact with the flame, which attracts people and offers them additional comfort.Installation is quick and clean. <p/> Design is also very important. In addition to the dimensional and design specificities, all stoves have a choice of glazing colours or colour combinations. With a choice of different glaze combinations, each customer can choose the colour idea that suits them. This gives each kiln a completely individual character tailored to the wishes and needs of the customer and makes it completely unique. <p/> And there is one more thing <p/> Every stove is an ornament and a decorative element in a room. In addition, firing and operating a tiled stove is a very special and enjoyable task. What makes it special is the pleasant radiation of heat through the walls of the stove and the many functional possibilities. The wood-burning fire is pleasantly felt through the open fireplace door, and fire has remained a source of heating from prehistoric times to the present day. Burning wood gives us a feeling of relaxation. It is a special ritual that is the same for each of the earthenware stoves. In each hearth, a large amount of energy is released when the fire is lit. This is stored in the fireclay mass of the earthenware stove and radiates into the room as a gentle, soft heat for hours afterwards. <p/> The heater operates independently of the electricity in the house or the oil in the tank. Pot stoves cover the need for heat in the way that ancestors once did.

It faces a fine of €80 million, which the country will have to pay over the next four years. Given that the inhabitants of the southern part of the municipality of Kamnik (Perovo, Bakovnik, Šmarca, Volčji Potok, Duplica) regularly have legitimate concerns about the quality of the air they breathe, which is part of their everyday lives, such indifference on the part of the State is incomprehensible to me. The fact is that we live in a densely populated area and in close proximity to industrial plants that pollute the air with emissions from their activities. Of course, these are companies that have been operating here for many years and cannot be relocated elsewhere, but everything must be done to reduce emissions into the air. It is not just about the health of the most vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, but also about reducing the value of movable and immovable property in the area. <p/> The most painful thorn in our side is the 'environmentally unfriendly' operation of the Tisa Ltd. wood biomass heating plant, which has been preventing us from enjoying a good quality of life for 13 years.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

Navigation giant Garmin has unveiled a new product they have dubbed simply HUD (head-up display). It's a portable device that lets you control the navigation app on your smartphone. <p/> With the projector mounted under the windscreen, which projects an image onto the glass, the driver can keep track of all the route information in his field of vision and does not have to take his eyes off the road. This allows him to concentrate more on driving, which is safer. <p/> A wealth of data on the windscreen in front of the driver <p/> All the driver needs is the HUD, which he connects to via bluetooth on a smartphone that supports the Garmin Street Pilot app.1 This costs around €20. <p/> Garmin assures that its device offers more information than the standard HUDs in cars. Dan Bartel, Garmin's Vice President of Worldwide Sales, explains that the driver can monitor information on the windscreen, such as current speed and limits, where to turn, how far to the next turn and when they will arrive at their destination. <p/> The HUD also shows drivers which lane they need to take before the next turn and warns them when they are speeding, while automatically adjusting the projection's illumination to the sun, shadows and darkness. <p/> The HUD will be available in the US later this year, but details for Europe are not yet available.",News,train

34,"Kurtic finally takes Allegri away <p/> Ljubljana - Massimiliano Allegri paid dearly for Milan's painful defeat against Sassuolo, for whom Slovenian international Jasmin Kurtic also plays. The former Perugia coach was left without a job the day after the defeat. <p/> Massimiliano Allegri announced some time ago that he would retire from the Milan bench at the end of the season. The 3:4 defeat against Sassuolo, after the rossoneri had already led 2:0, meant that his story on the bench of the seven-time European champions had already ended a few months earlier. Domenico Berardi, 19, was fatal for Milan and Allegri, taking Sassuolo fans to heaven even after two passes from Jasmin Kurtic, while Milan supporters wondered how low their favourites could go. <p/> After the new defeat, the red-and-blacks remain in 11th place, just six points above the places leading to the second league and a whopping 30 points behind leaders Juventus. Milan have not been this low for a long time. Who can lead it out of the abyss? For some time now, Clarence Seedorf, who is contracted to Botafogo, has been mentioned as the most serious successor to Allegri, and Filippo Inzaghi, who is gaining his first coaching experience in Milan's youth team, is also among the very serious candidates. Allegri's legacy Milan have played far below the expectations of the fans this season under Allegri's leadership. But the question is who could get more out of Milan's current squad. Valter Birsa, on whom Allegri has shown great confidence, has also scored for the two Serie A victories. Otherwise, Allegri had a mediocre squad, which would have had a hard time in the fight for the top spots. <p/> Allegri came to the world's fashion capital in 2010 and won the title right away. He finished second and third in the next two years, but after selling Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva, the chariot went sharply downhill.",News,train
36,"For brave people, bankruptcy can mean the start of something new, better, more prosperous and happier. <p/> But bankruptcy for a company or an individual does not mean failure. On the contrary. For brave people, it can mean the start of something new, better, more successful and happier. <p/> For myself, I still claim to be rich. Wealth is family, healthy children and personal health. It is contentment with what we have and it is happiness in the face of everyday joys and difficulties. It is vision, purpose and hope and fighting for all that we love. <p/> Wealth is not necessarily wealth for a company or even for an individual. <p/> A company's assets, or even an individual's, are not necessarily wealth. Wealth is a concern, it is a commitment to increase or at least maintain the value of wealth. It is an ongoing obligation towards employees, the state and others. It requires daily care to ensure that it is used economically and efficiently and that it creates added value from which employees earn their living. For this reason, and above all for this reason, asset owners and managers deserve special respect. Unfortunately, in Slovenia we are not at a spiritual stage of development in social relations and values to understand this. Too often people mistakenly think that wealth makes people happy. They mistakenly believe that people who lose their wealth also lose their happiness. <p/> But many people only find happiness or realise it when they do. It is only then that they realise that there are other things than the satisfaction of managing wealth and a business. <p/> These realisations also make my pain at the shipwreck of the company more bearable. After all, property is only a source of income for the owners and the employees for the necessities of life. If, for whatever reason, these assets no longer generate enough income to sustain life, they need to be restructured or repurposed.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

38,"On Tuesday, 18.10. , we were visited at the Department of Biology by national and foreign (European Commission) monitors of Life+ projects. The whole SloWolf team gathered and presented the activities and products carried out, and the financial part of the project was also scrutinised. <p/> Visit of the external Life+ monitors from Slovenia and the monitors from the European Commission (photo U.M.) <p/> The monitors also had a closer look at the equipment for collecting non-invasive wolf samples during winter tracking, which is distributed annually among hunters and other volunteers during field work. (photo: U.M.) <p/> In a series of five facilitated workshops held in January and February 2011, we invited representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions representing stakeholders related to wolf conservation in Slovenia to draft a proposal for the Action Plan for Wolf Management in Slovenia. More information about the workshops can be found here. <p/> The hunting season for wolves started in October, following a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. As it takes an enormous amount of work to catch a live wolf, both by researchers and by the hunters who help us (on average over 100 field days for one successful catch), every, otherwise legal, kill of a collared wolf would negate a lot of the effort put in, and would also deprive everyone of the interesting and valuable information that collars provide. <p/> In good light conditions, which allow a reliable shot, the collars are visible - the band is light green (Vojko), brown (Slavc) or light blue (Luka), and all the battery cases are white. The list of hunting families in whose hunting grounds the three wolves equipped so far this year are as follows: LD Bukovje, LD Col, LD Črna jama, LD Divača, LD Dolenja vas, LD Draga, LD Gradišče Košana, LD Hrenovice, LD Javornik Postojna, LD Kozina, LD Kras Dutovlje, LD Loški Potok, LD Materija, LD Nanos, LD Obrov, LD Pivka, LD Planina, LD Podgorje, LD Prestranek, LD Raša Štorje, LD Ribnica, LD Rižana, LD Senožeče, LD Sodražica, LD Tabor Sežana, LD Vojkovo, LD Vreme and LD Vrhe Vrabče (see also maps of wolf movements to date). In addition, members of neighbouring LDs should also pay special attention, as we expect the movement areas of both packs to increase slightly during the winter. The young wolf Luka could also have left his natal pack by this time and headed to another area. <p/> Regular wolf culling has started. Watch out for wolves with collars! <p/> On Friday, 6.5.2011, a wolf was caught near Slavnik in Primorska and fitted with a GPS-GSM telemetry collar. The male wolf weighed 39.5 kg and was about 7 years old. He was named Vojko. He tolerated the training well and retreated to the nearby forests shortly after his release. The results of the biometric measurements are available on the wolf ID card page. <p/> The wolf was caught on the edge of the territory of the ""Slavnik"" pack. A wolf named Brin was also hunted nearby and collared in April 2010, but was subsequently killed half a year later. Genetic analyses and data from the telemetry collar will be sent in the coming days to determine the social status of the wolf Vojko. <p/> TV Slovenia's Education Programme has produced a documentary on wolves in Slovenia entitled ""Wolf"" as part of the series ""Biotopes"". The film also presents the activities taking place within the SloWolf project. TV Slovenia broadcast the film on 30 April 2011 and you can watch it online at this link: <p/> We have prepared an analysis of the effectiveness of wolf culling in reducing damage to domestic animals. In addition to the analysis of the impact of wolf culling on the level of damage in Slovenia, the report also reviews the results of foreign research on the effectiveness of wolf culling in Europe and North America. The report also includes management recommendations on the implementation of wolf culling and the prevention of damage to domestic animals. <p/> Participants in the workshop included representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions (Faculty of Biotechnology (experts in agronomy, forestry, biology and zootechnics), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Nature Conservation Institute, Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, Forest Institute, Dinaricum Association, Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry, Association for Animal Liberation and Animal Rights, Federation of Small Animal Breeders' Associations, Special Purpose Hunting Grounds and the Kolpa Landscape Park), representing interest groups related to wolf conservation in Slovenia. The main purpose of the workshops is to first define, through a participatory approach involving all stakeholders, the threats and challenges to wolf management in Slovenia and coexistence with people. In the following workshops, we will try to find the most effective solutions that will allow both the long-term existence of wolves and the reduction of conflicts and improve coexistence between wolves and people. <p/> In our management planning we will also follow the Guidelines for the Transboundary Management of Large Carnivore Populations in Europe, as wolves in Slovenia are only part of the larger Dinaric-Balkan population and are constantly crossing borders with neighbouring countries, especially Croatia. The first workshop was therefore also attended by representatives of the Croatian Institute for Nature Conservation, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia and the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb. <p/> Representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the Hunting Association of Slovenia, local associations of small stock breeders and associations against animal torture are also expected at the next two workshops on Thursday and Friday (3 and 4 February 2011). <p/> In the January issue of the magazine ""Lovec"" we published an article on the life of the wolf Tina, in which we summarise the 4-year follow-up of the wolf, which was fitted with a telemetry collar in 2007 after she accidentally got caught in a lynx trap. The article is available here: <p/> In order to present the public with as objective a picture as possible and to allow for a more constructive debate, the following link presents the position of the SloWolf project team on the culling of wolves in Slovenia: <p/> Over the course of the four-year project, we will be publishing four issues of a project newsletter, which we have named Wolf Herring. The main purpose of the newsletter is to keep you regularly informed about the results and planned activities of our ""wolf"" project. The content will follow the red thread of the project, which is to ensure the long-term conservation of the wolf population, its prey and habitats, and the coexistence of humans and wolves in Slovenia, in an interesting way. We have printed 700 copies, which we will distribute to libraries and other centres in the wolf range to reach as many readers as possible from the local population in the area.The electronic version of the newsletter can be found here. <p/> Training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb <p/> Within the Life + SloWolf project, the Forest Institute (ZGS), Department of Forest Animals and Hunting, organised a training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species, this time with a focus on large carnivores. <p/> The training was held at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb (VF in ZG), both due to the unpreparedness of the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana to organise such training, and due to the experience of Croatian colleagues who regularly organise such training for their delegates. Due to the large number of delegates and the limited space in the secirnice of the Faculty in Zagreb, the training took place in two groups on 2 and 3 November 2010. The attendance was very good as practically all delegates assessing damage from large carnivores in the ZGS organisational units attended. We were also joined by the Director of ZGS Mr. Jošt Jakša, the Head of the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Marko Jonozovič, the Senior Adviser at the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Miha Marenče and the Head of the LPN Service of ZGS Mr. mag. Janko Mehle and some colleagues from the Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Ljubljana. <p/> The participants of the educational workshop were welcomed at the beginning by the Dean of the Faculty of Biology in Zagreb, and then we went through the comprehensive lectures of Mr. Tomaž Skrbinšek (Department of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Ljubljana), Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak, Dr. Andrea Gudan Kurilj and Dr. Janis Kusak. Dr. Ana Beck (all from the Faculty of Science, Zagreb), upgraded their knowledge in the field of recognition of signs of killing and consumption of prey of large carnivores, premortem and postmortem changes on carcasses, and potentially dangerous diseases that can be transmitted by carcasses of killed animals. Mr Skrbinšek briefed the delegates on the procedures of saliva collection from carcasses of killed animals for DNA identification of wolves, which will start in 2011 in the framework of the SloWolf project. The first part of the training was in the form of lectures, and after lunch we went to the Faculty's dissection room. There, we consolidated the knowledge we had acquired through concrete cases, where we together examined several carcasses of sheep killed by wolves. <p/> Practical part of the training of the ZGS Damage Assessment Officers at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb with the lecturer Assoc.

During the telemetric monitoring, his pack was moving in the area from the Glinščice Valley near the border with Italy to Čičaria and Učka above Opatija in Croatia. <p/> Juniper was stalked in a pasture when five wolves attacked sheep. The collar was not seen by the captor in low light conditions. The male weighed 40 kg and was in good condition. He was shot as part of a regular wolf cull (12 wolves are scheduled to be cull in Slovenia between the beginning of October 2010 and the end of February 2011). Genetic analyses will be carried out in the coming days to determine whether Brin had the status of the alpha male of the pack. <p/> As part of Action A.4 - Assessment of wolf damage in agriculture, we have produced maps of wolf damage between 2003-2005, between 2007-2009, a map of the potential wolf range in Slovenia in the event of a spatial expansion of the wolf population, and a map showing the areas where wolf attacks on small livestock can be expected, given the current distribution of sheep. The maps are included in the final report of the campaign, which included a review and analysis of wolf damage in Slovenia.

The meeting was chaired by the Chairman of the Council, the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje Bojan Kontič. <1. Opening hours of bars in the Municipality of Velenje 2. Accommodation of workers who will work on the TEŠ 6 project 3. Under the first agenda item (Opening hours of restaurants in the municipality of Velenje), the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, Mr Bojan Kontič, presented the dilemmas that arise in connection with extending the opening hours of restaurants, because on the one hand, citizens want peace and quiet at night, and young people want open restaurants where they can have fun. Extended opening hours are, of course, also important for catering businesses for business reasons. According to the Catering Act, the approval of opening hours for catering establishments is the responsibility of the local authority, which can also withdraw or not grant approval at all. <p/> Catering establishments serving food and drink (restaurants, pubs, cafés, patisseries, cafeterias, snack bars and bars), located in buildings with flats or in buildings in a residential area intended for living and ancillary activities, may only operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Operating outside these hours shall be considered as extended opening hours, for which the caterer must obtain the written consent of the local authority. The relevant local authority shall decide on this on the basis of the adopted criteria laid down in the Rules on the criteria for determining the extended opening hours of catering establishments and farms catering in the municipality of Velenje. The Rules lay down the procedures and conditions for obtaining approval for extended opening hours, as well as the procedures and conditions for withdrawing such approval. The Municipal Regulation also obliges caterers to carry out their activities in such a way that they do not disturb the environment. <p/> According to Alenka Rednjak, Head of the Investment and Development Office, the Municipality of Velenje is in the process of amending the municipal regulations to provide that the opinion of the district or local community in whose area the restaurant is located is to be taken into account when issuing a consent for extended opening hours. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič informed the attendees that the Velenje Police Station had submitted two proposals to the Velenje Municipality for the cancellation of the extended opening hours, namely for Bar Max Klub, s.p. (Šaleška cesta 3, Velenje), where the opening hours are Monday to Thursday from 10 pm to 1 am and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 5 am, and for Pit Stop bar (Celjska cesta 2, Velenje), where the bar is open 24 hours. According to the Velenje Police Station, the above-mentioned bars have had to intervene several times due to public order violations, including fights, and occasionally the detention of offenders. <p/> Drago Alenc, Commander of the Velenje Police Station, explained that due to the extended opening hours of the restaurants, problems and violations occur mainly in the vicinity of the Red Hall, where the restaurants are open until 3 or 5 am. Police officers note that after the closure of the Red Hall, guests go to the Pit Stop bar, which is across the road by the petrol station. For the safety of pedestrians on the road, police officers are repeatedly carrying out enhanced traffic controls on this stretch of road, as pedestrians are crossing the road in this part of the carriageway, which is not illuminated and in a place where there is no marked pedestrian crossing. Police officers note that many pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol. The Velenje Police Station considers that the frequent violations, which are mostly recorded at night on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, are a problem for public order, traffic and general safety in this part of the city. <p/> The Director of the Municipal Administration, Andreja Katič, pointed out that the request for more police officers should be re-submitted to the line ministry. <p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that on the basis of the proposal of the Velenje Police Station to cancel the extended opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar, the Velenje Municipality had cancelled the consent for the extended opening hours of the above-mentioned establishments.<p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that the Municipality of Velenje had also cancelled the opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar. The owner of the Pit stop bar appealed against the revocation of the consent and, following the new measures, provided more adequate security for the bar and was granted a new consent for extended opening hours by the municipality. However, Bar Max Klub, s.p., only has consent for extended opening hours at weekends, when concerts are held in the bar. <p/> The mayor pointed out that the municipality had not yet made a final decision on the issue of consents for extended opening hours for the bars in the Red Hall Velenje, as they wanted to find a compromise with the owners of the bars so that they could be open at night and at the same time would not violate the Act on Public Order and the Ordinance on General Order in the Municipality of Velenje. <p/> Under the second item on the agenda (Accommodation of workers to be employed in the TEŠ 6 project), the Director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Unit 6 Project, Mr. Miran Žgajner presented the project, which represents a new chapter in Slovenia's energy supply and is currently Slovenia's largest energy investment. It is a modern, highly efficient unit that will gradually replace the existing units. He stressed that Unit 6 is a replacement and not an additional generating facility, which is being built to provide more environmentally friendly electricity at a competitive price. The construction of Block 6 does not represent an additional encroachment on the site, as it will be built on the existing site. Of course, all the measures required by the Environmental Impact Report will also be implemented during construction. The construction of the 600 MW Block 6 will take until 2014. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič pointed out that the members of the Council, who act as a preventive body in this environment, would like to know in particular the number of workers who will be living in the valley during the construction of the block. In this way, the institutions could also prepare themselves for a larger number of clients. <p/> Mag. Mr Žgajner said that during the most intensive works, there would be between 1,500 and 1,800 workers on site, most of them foreigners. Those responsible for the construction of the unit have further increased security on site, as each worker will now have his or her own photo identification card. This will limit free movement on the site and ensure that workers can be properly identified off-site. In the coming days, Termoelektrarna Šoštanj will also conclude an agreement with PV Invest on mutual cooperation in organising accommodation for workers. <He added that road traffic to the construction site will be routed in such a way as to minimise disruption, and attempts will be made to bring as much material as possible by rail and at night. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič stressed the importance of the good cooperation of the Velenje Police Station and the Velenje Health Centre with those responsible for the Block 6 project. This is also due to the good and timely information provided to the police officers about the mode of transport of the cargo. The police officers ensure the safety of both our citizens and foreigners who come to work here. <p/> The Director of the Velenje Health Centre, Jože Zupančič, is negotiating with those in charge at Alstom about the provision of health services for foreigners coming to work in the valley. He said that the health centre will make sure that an emergency medical team will be available as close as possible to the construction site during the operating hours. A new doctor has also been recruited at the Šoštanj Health Station and will be available to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients. <p/> The Block 6 Project Director concluded by stressing that if the Government of the Republic of Slovenia does not adopt the Act on the State Guarantee for the Loans for Block 6 of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant by tomorrow, 15 February 2012, the Block 6 project may also come to a halt. <p/> Under Other Business, the Director of the Centre for Social Work Velenje, Zlatka Srdoč Majer, presented current information on the Centre's activities. It is encouraging to note that recently there have been fewer incidents of domestic violence and fewer applications for social assistance. However, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the new social organisation will have to wait until the end of March. By then, they expect to have issued all the decisions for 3 140 applicants.",News,train

The horrifying statistics that six million people die every year from smoking worldwide, 600 000 from passive smoking, and 3 600 lives are lost annually in Slovenia, 900 of them under the age of 60, speak for themselves. If we do not change our tobacco use patterns, as many as one billion people will die from tobacco in the world in the 21st century. <p/> Worldwide, 1.3 billion people smoke. If smoking were reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent, as many as 100 million premature deaths would be prevented by 2020. This makes it one of the most preventable deaths, but efforts are still lacking because the tobacco industry holds the reins. <p/> Stop the tobacco industry's marketing! The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day, first proclaimed by the World Health Organization in 1987, is Stop Tobacco Marketing! Helena Koprivnikar from the Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia warns that marketing is one of the most important causes of the spread of tobacco use and that urgent action is needed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of smoking among adolescents and young adults and to complement measures to reduce smoking among adults. In the European Union, 70% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. <p/> According to the Institute for Health Protection, 24% of the population aged 15-64 in Slovenia smokes, more men (27%) than women (21%). The proportion of male smokers has been increasing in recent years, mainly at the expense of the proportion of female smokers. The proportion of adolescents and young adults who smoke is largely stable, but the proportion of adolescent women who smoke has increased. Among adolescents aged 11-15, just over 29% have tried smoking, more boys than girls. <p/> New Tobacco Directive with tougher restrictions The European Union is currently negotiating a proposal for a new Tobacco Directive that would completely ban the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes the introduction of large composite warnings, which would include colour photographs in addition to text and would cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette packs and rolling tobacco. It also provides for a ban on the sale of tobacco products with distinctive flavourings and additives that give the impression that the tobacco product is less harmful to health. <p/> European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Tonio Borg, urged Members of the European Parliament and European Health Ministers to support the proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive and stressed the importance of efforts to reduce the attractiveness of smoking and tobacco products to young people. <p/> Free smoking cessation programmes in Slovenia Nataša Blažko from the Ministry of Health said that Slovenia is a strong supporter of the new directive as tobacco is a major burden in Slovenia, explaining that the proposal brings changes in a number of areas, but also adds new areas, such as the treatment of electronic and herbal cigarettes. The Ministry of Health financially supports various programmes aimed at preventing young people from starting to smoke and at smoking cessation in all population groups. Slovenia is one of the few countries where primary health care provides free smoking cessation programmes. B. T.

We're talking about the 2013 Winter Universiade! <p/> From 30 January to 9 February 2013, Maribor will host one of the world's biggest winter sport events. A promising start has been followed by a number of problems, including the recent question of whether the Universiade will even take place in Maribor! Now there is also the question of where the 2500 participants will sleep.

On the University of Maribor's side, however, the story is slightly different. They confirm that they have indeed discussed the issue, but they say that it was only a matter of arranging for volunteers to be accepted. ""We only received the proposal to accommodate the Universiade participants from the Organising Committee in November last year, after the presentation of the FISU projects, when it became clear that the security costs and logistical problems would be too high with dislocated accommodation. We promised to look into this possibility, and we did,"" said Teodor Lorenčič, Head of the Promotion Centre at UM.

51,"Racist assault <p/> Man charged with attempted murder for alleged self-defence <p/> Almonte, a Dominican, was in the wrong place at the wrong time on 26 March. Shortly before midnight, he was attacked by three shaved heads in the Domžale bar Pri Jurčku. It was allegedly a racist attack. According to the reader's testimony, the young men waited until the stranger was alone and then attacked him from behind. In order to defend himself against the kicks and punches, the attacked man crouched down and then swung a knife at the thugs. He cut two of them and ran away, but then surrendered to the police. <p/> Although this was a reaction in self-defence, the police then only charged the Dominican. Not those who allegedly ""struck first"". Since the end of March, Almonte has been in custody, which has already been extended once, as the court had to hear several witnesses and appoint a medical expert for three people, the Ljubljana District Court explained. The case file, which will be handed over to the prosecutor's office, accuses him of two counts of attempted manslaughter, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. After all the interrogations they have conducted, they believe that the Dominican man came after the Slovenians, not the other way around, and that he used the knife with the intention of killing them. But this is probably not the whole truth. The racist shaved heads allegedly threatened the witnesses of the incident: if they exposed themselves, they would retaliate, the reader wrote. The investigation therefore probably did not cover everyone who saw the incident. Only those who testified in defence of the attackers were exposed. We tried to verify this, but the court refused to grant us access to the file because the case is still pending. <p/> ""I would like to point out that racism exists in this country and is a very serious problem. Intolerance is only escalating - to oppression, hostility, hate speech, physical violence.

55,"Yesterday's news from the municipality about the dismissal of two vice-mayors is still reverberating around Ravenna. It is likely that the Mayor's decision was also the result of public pressure. One of these was published in Dnevnik 3 days ago, where Mojca gave a detailed description of the situation in the municipality and its staffing, which is very true. Mojca Marot's article is published in full. <p/> In Ravenna, more and more people are dissatisfied with the staffing of the SDS mayor Tomaž Roženo, as they have loudly and clearly pointed out at the recent protests. ""We have had enough of clientelism and nepotism, of immoral and unethical moves by our mayor,"" was one of the slogans at the only protest in Carinthia so far, which took place in Ravenna. After we wrote about the functions and remuneration that vice-mayors receive for their work across Slovenia, and highlighted the outcry from young Social Democrats in Ravne, several people from Carinthia who attended the recent protest drew our attention to this slogan, which was lost in the crowd. <p/> The two vice-mayors are brother-in-law and sister-in-law <p/> In a recent article, we mentioned that many people feel that three vice-mayors in Ravenna are too many for the municipality, given its size and the professionalism of Mayor Tomaž Roženo, and that they are also costing the municipal budget a lot. Rožžen assured us that he does not intend to give up any of them, as he believes they are crucial for consensus in the municipal council. But many consider this statement to be far-fetched. Two of them, Milan Škafar and Vera Krajnc, as Ravenč citizens have pointed out to us, are in any case members of his SDS party and, incidentally, they are also related to each other. Kranjc is said to be the sister of Škafar's wife, which means that they are brother-in-law and sister-in-law, while the third deputy mayor, Peter Oder, who runs the Eurosplet company (the Carinthian Student Service, which he and Rozen founded in 1999), is also a ""mayor's"" cadre. According to the Supervizor website, more than €3.6 million has flowed into this company from various public institutions over the last ten years, but the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption concludes that there have been no irregularities. In any case, the 22-member municipal council of Ružen is made up of 10 SDS party representatives, and if we take into account all those who belong to the so-called coalition, it is clear that Ružen does not need a consensus at all. <p/> Not political framing, but a reward for good work? <p/> ""His actions are immoral and unethical, to say the least, and the main concern of both the mayor and the councillors is that they are appointing people loyal to their political option to key positions, i.e. to management positions in public institutions. Half of their relatives have already got a job this way,"" the people of Ravenč are angry. They are particularly surprised by the reincarnation of the Vice-Mayor Škafar, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his own party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is once again a member of the SDS party's executive committee. Incidentally, shortly after the local elections, passions were already running high on this issue at one of the municipal councils in Ravenna. SD councillor Zlatko Halilovič raised his voice against the appointment of three vice-mayors. ""We don't need three vice-mayors, unless it's political spoils for the SDS party,"" he said at the time, adding that councillors are accountable to all citizens, not just to the SDS party. <p/> SDS monopoly in public institutions <p/> The debate became even more heated when it came to appointing members to the boards of public institutions and companies, where Halilovič was joined by a few other supporters in protesting that they were dominated by SDS members. ""Are you going to change the law of physics so that one being can be in several places at the same time? Nine parties have made it to the council, not just SDS, so it is right to balance things"", Halilovic said at the time, referring to the apparent clientelism. The mayor and Krajnčeva dismissed the accusations, saying that just because someone is related to someone else does not mean that they do not have the right to be elected or delegated to an institution's council, moreover, it is a reward for good work, which was apparently also recognised by the voters. Yet it is strange that 23 of the 53 seats, almost half, on the boards of public institutions and companies are held by SDS members, some of whom have even been appointed to several boards at the same time. Robert Brezovnik and Dušan Dretnik also pointed this out, but were overruled by other members of the Elections and Appointments Commission. Surprisingly, even SDS councillor Enriko Plevnik was self-critical in the debate at the time. He said that ""the list is really strange"", while the Mayor said that the seats were distributed in proportion to the election results. These days, however, many people in Ravenna are very interested in who will occupy the director's chair of the Institute for Sport. The current first man of this institution, Aleksander Kotnik, also a councillor of the SDS in Ravenna, is moving to the helm of the music school. <p/> People are also wondering about the reincarnation of Milan Škafar, the Deputy Mayor, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his SDS party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is again a member of the party's executive committee. <p/> One of the vice-mayors, Peter Oder, who is also a director of Eurosplet, d. o. o., - Koroški Student Services, refused to comment on yesterday's decision. However, he was disturbed by Saturday's article, in which we wrote that, according to the Supervizor website, €3.6 million had been transferred from various public institutions to Eurosplet - Koroški Student Services over the last ten years. In his view, this figure is misleading and casts him and the Mayor in a bad light. ""Of this amount, approximately €2.84 million represents direct earnings of students. However, the recognised costs to Eurosplet over ten years amounted to only €128,000 or €12,800,"" explains Oder. He adds that around two thirds of the income generated by public institutions is generated outside the municipality of Ravne, while the recognised costs of doing business with all public institutions in the municipality average just €4,300 per year.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
56,"17 replies to "" Even in the municipality of Ravenna "" in a domestic way "" "" <p/> What is it with this journalist that she writes things that are two years old, and populist ones at that. The SDS party got 10 councillors and a mayor. The SD party got two councillors, Zares got 3 councillors, the NSI got one, etc... Around the same time, the seats on the committees were also divided up, or the SDS got even fewer than it could have. Check the data available. The most important is the Supervisory Committee, where the opposition has the chair and the majority of members. In this way, things are 'balanced'. Of course, the glass can always be half full or half empty, depending on which eyes are looking at it. It is normal, however, that the opposition always wants to minimise the successes and inflate the weaknesses to the extreme. All credit to the mayor and his team for what they have achieved in the town, and it may not be all good, but it is far from all bad. <p/>It is only the political staffing that bothers me, but I would like to point out that many of these SDS directors have improved things and put things on the right footing, and nobody mentions that. I am not taking sides, but I think that, yes, it is not all black. Many times when I go to the flatlands, where I was born, I find that many people are negative, and they all tell the same stories, and it is quite clear to me that somebody has set them up against the mayor. But perhaps we already know of a candidate for mayor in the forthcoming local elections? ? ? It also bothers me that the freedoms are being used for the benefit of one political party, namely the SD. Its members are always at these protests, and in this case the protests, which I support, are taking on political overtones. People should say what they think, not be persuaded to do so by one political option. <p/> After all, it is the SD, or the young forum, that is behind everything, and they have their noses up in everything good that is done in Ravenna. And what the fuck is that to the demonstrator in front of the municipality from Ravne! Let the others go and demonstrate in front of their municipalities, because in the end Prevale has two vice-mayors. No, it is only Ravne that is under attack. The Young Forum of the Mežiška dolina Valley is, as far as we can understand, the young forum of the whole valley, not just Ravne, and they should do something elsewhere, not just go around Ravne on the orders of their silver uncles from behind the scenes. <p/> Who reads this red Dnevnik ... and just ask yourselves and investigate who paid some money to this Mojca to write such an article (a paid article). Kudos to Mayor Rozen, he has done a lot for the people ... but only those who want to line their pockets are slandering ... a little morgen, you will be waiting ... <p/> I have to speak up. I am an ordinary citizen just observing what is happening in Ravne. I am also interested to see the recordings of the municipal council meetings. I must say that I am VERY SATISFIED with the leadership of our municipality. However, it is obvious that Councillors Halilovič and Vrhovnik are doing everything they can to undermine the work of the mayor and his team. What is the purpose of such action is clear to all. Because they feel that there is not enough publicity at the meetings themselves, they have to take to the streets. That is why I was not surprised to see, in the video footage of the assembly in front of the municipal building, mainly supporters of the pole that has too few members on the municipal council. Therefore, people - do not be fooled into thinking that this assembly was about improving the situation. It was about letting the street allow those who failed in the elections to rise - whether that is good or bad for the citizens. <p/>I see you are all more right-wing up here, I tell you we have a trunk full of your politics and don't dream that only reds are protesting in the street. I for one am for honest politics be it left or right, I have no bad words for Rozen but I don't think he has kept the right deputy mayor. <p/> Aljaž Vrhovnik will be loud? A teenager who rushes to the trough more than a calf to a cow, pretending to be clever about things that logically he has no clue about, because he is simply being a child. I have nothing against young people, but what is too much is too much, and he is running for mayor - and half the stupid journalists quote him. I don't know who is the bigger half-ass.

61,"DOG - A CREATURE FOR THE LONELY? <p/> Living with an animal is good for the body and soul. Children who are lucky enough to grow up around animals develop more feeling (empathy) for others, the ability to accept the differences between living things, their communication is fuller (it is easier for them to perceive correctly something besides words). They also have fewer allergies and express their emotions more easily. <p/> The above is said in an uiber simple way, in a homey way, a la Nina (jest). But it is an officially recognised fact that. So I did not make it up. <p/> I can tell you from my own experience in therapy with a dog (I don't have many, but I have a few) that children really do sometimes - when they have problems with this - open up more easily to a dog than to a human. Why? Because the dog does not judge. For him you are great when you are sad and when you are happy. It doesn't take your sadness or disappointment as an attack on its personality. So it accepts who you are. And it tries to improve your mood. Even when he is the cause of your disappointment, he doesn't take it out on his own resentment or hurt, but approaches it in a constructive way, trying to make amends in any way he can. It's funny for me to think like that... Funny that a higher evolved being, i.e. a human being, has to learn this extra many times, but a dog is just given it. So, on that point, I say calmly (and I don't mind if someone jumps in the loft about it)... Well, I will say that in some cases, at this point, the dog is more advanced than the human in terms of social skills. In some cases. I just find insensitivity to another's pain an extremely frightening trait. <p/> I have often heard the statement: lonely people have dogs. I always come to two conclusions from this statement, whether it is written or spoken and in what context: <p/> it reflects a person who thinks that he is an extra good soul just because he sometimes gets involved with someone. He does not know that this is not dictated by his character, but by the fact that he is born a social being. There are many ways to be involved with anyone. Roughly in 2 ways: bad or good. If I (magari with the help of animals) had conquered the good, I would know that this statement dilutes by negativity something that does not even need a negative connotation. If you like flowers, you like flowers, if you like animals, you like animals. If you like them, they are not superfluous. Just as simple as that. There is no need for pejorative approaches and words that can only bring pain when a person is belittled and nothing else. To me, that is hypocritical. A lack of understanding of acceptance of other living beings, garnished with the cellophane of (supposedly) trying to understand. A person with feeling for others would not express it that way. He would have benefited from the example of canine companionship. But I am glad he does not. Because it's not the dog's fault. He is not a doormat, he is a living being. <p/> Of course, a dog is a wonderful companion. Among other things because, as I said above, he knows how to coexist. Calm souls show emotions and moods in a relaxed way. We humans are not always and everywhere good at that. When we grow up, we are... well, less uninhibitedly genuine. He is also a wonderful listener and as a rule does not give away secrets. Intermezzo: those who know their animals, or animals in general, well know that they also tell some secrets. Just not, as a rule, in such an extreme way as the currently still famous bullmastiffs. Such expressions are maddeningly rare, because very few animals are so totally nerved - destroyed. I, for example, years ago, denounced my landlord for charging around the flat when I was not at home because of animals. Because I know my animals. In a humiliated confession, he then asked me - how did you know, since I hadn't moved anything? But there is no substitute for human closeness. That goes both ways, of course. No human being can replace a dog's closeness either. And the fact is that the dog as a companion really helps the desperate... because it gets them out, with people! ! ! Not because it replaces them. Because it cheers them up and brings them back to sociability. All this, of course, does not mean that all dog owners are the same. Hello? Are all parents the same? All rugby players? All at the same school? The important thing to say here is that the overly desperate don't snog the dog anyway. Fact. And that like-minded people walking their dogs is no worse than like-minded people playing volleyball.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
62,"Heh, but this kind of statement baffles me... are these compartmentalising people consistent? So dogs are supposed to be lonely according to them. What about for the fish? What about cats? Or chinchillas? What about birds, turtles, horses, etc.? Gosh, I find this really funny. I'll tell you. For all the animals, there are people who know how to see the joy in any daddy. <p/> A puppy is <p/>really such a sweet companion who gets you out and about - whether you're lonely or there are too many Kittens around, you just like to go to peace for a bit. And another thing - there really is something in his eyes that you rarely find in human eyes - loyalty without selfishness, M. <p/> Well, to be fair <p/> (and not in the style of I. Gartner! ), then it has to be said that a lot of people have a dog because they ARE lonely. AND very lonely! There are too many people who are canine asocials and would rather have a dog than a human companion. There are far too many (let's say) grandmothers who don't watch their grandchildren because the children make their pet...um...nervous.....There are far too many people who prefer dogs to children.... There have been heated debates about this on some forums this year.... <p/> In short... THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE who have lost touch with reality and give a dog the love they are incapable of giving to their fellow man. <p/> But that doesn't mean that we are not normal in between.... <p/> Those of us who love dogs, but at the same time know that a dog - however we turn it - is still "" just "" an animal. .... . <p/> MM <p/> Untitled comment <p/> I knew someone who was always greeted happily by a puppy when he came home from work. he said, a little jokingly, that the puppy always made him happy, but his wife never once greeted him so happily at the door, greeting him, d <p/> auntie:) <p/> I disagree. if there's anything a single man is already missing - it's a partner. i.e. a man. but somehow I persist in believing that he's not looking for a dog, heh. because a dog can't replace a man. it can only bring him more life and depth. and that's got nothing to do with this situation. <p/> you want a dog if you like it as a creature. that's how it is when you are a child and when you grow up. the feeling of loneliness is born in the person, not in the surroundings. even married people have it sometimes. <p/> but if some unfortunate soul takes it (the dog) for that reason... the uiber has brought himself around, heh. because in that case the dog is just a means to keep himself so busy that he 'forgets' his feelings. a workaholic would then work more. gulp. self-curation and problem-solving I call it. <p/> for me, the dog has never been a means of making contact. i do just fine without it. <p/> giggles, clots:) <p/> I don't really bother about what is found in a dog and what is found in a person. both are fine with me. the dog comes to me, I like it and therefore I accept the whole package it brings. <p/> for me <p/> animals are part of life, they belong to human life, just like other people do. But it is true that it can be much more tiring to coexist with people than with animals. A human being is a bit half degenerated in our time here and now...., (puneguzitsevsegapachserjessepovsodane... ) and his psyche is fucking him up, of course, the cockroach yes... so it's really healing to socialize with animals <p/> hm, milena:) <p/> to be fair, I assume that many people have said so themselves. what I think about this, I already said in my reply to my aunt... come on, please read it, so I don't write it again. <p/> but if you feel that way about it, from your reasoning... i guess i don't need to point out that it is a labelling and / or she-said-she-said system. so far from real and fair for me. <p/> i have said many times before that i find it disingenuous to devote exclusively to animals or exclusively to humans (and not really in this post yet). and i find the not saving grandmothers with grandchildren you mention from this very title sick (and vice versa as well). it's just that you have to take the time to educate the children about the dog (some are really total antitalents) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to take the time to educate the children about the dog (one is really a total antitalent) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to educate the children about the dog. <p/>people who prefer dogs to children and people who prefer dogs to people are in the same basket. the difference is only in age, but it's the same. <p/> otherwise, this post is about the fact that being a dog guardian is not even close to being lonely after defolt. <p/> I love dogs. I love people. and any way you turn it - man is also ' just ' an animal. if mankind, in its self-importance, discarded all other living beings, it would breathe nothing and could only eat itself. the funny thing is that sometimes it does it without doing that. <p/> giggles, darja:) <p/> but I don't take them literally as a rule (somehow it makes sense to me that there was probably a period of falling in love, hihi). it is true, though, that we humans have this poison in us called self-importance. and then the dog's ability to be happy every time is quite charming. <p/> and you know, I didn't usually meet any guy at the door either, hehehehe... because I don't hear or smell as well as a dog. <p/> duck:) <p/> but the point this time is quite different. the point is that we should respect humans too. um. well, it's really intertwined, yes. if you respect both the animal and the human, then a respectful attitude towards the coexistence of animals and humans is quite automatic. <p/> just this one <p/> we have it too and I can't imagine not having it because it has brought such joy to everybody that it's hard to say. <p/> What I find interesting is a statement my child once made when we asked him how it is that he treats kittens and puppies differently from people, shows them all the love, in short, treats them differently from the way he used to treat people.His answer was ANIMALS HAVE NEVER NEEDED MAN BUT MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN. <p/> Hey Mermaid <p/> Yes, animals are part of life and being with man. Whether they live with you or with a neighbour. In my life I have had the opportunity to observe completely different cultures in relation to fish. Let's say in Greece. The dog strictly belongs out of the house. It is not allowed to sit on the sofa or armchair. Or bring hair and germs from outside to inside. They don't even let it near a small child. And if by chance a little furry thing wandered into the playground, the mums would scream and shout. And if the unfortunate creature had the misfortune to make a lot of noise (especially in the cities), it wasn't too hard for the neighbours to poison the dog (we had a kitten in Athens once, and I don't even know what it did to them). <p/> On the other hand, I observe the English. They are very nice to animals (well, there are extreme exceptions, but I'm speaking generally). In the army and police, dogs get decorations and titles (Sargeant, Lutenant, etc.), and there is not a house in the countryside that doesn't have two dogs. When I asked ""my"" family why they all have two dogs, they said: ""So that the fish don't get lonely... all the time, we are not and can't be with them all the time, so it's nice not to have just one animal but to have a family! ""So it's not that humans need company, but that the dog also needs company. I also meet people from other cultures who find fish ""unclean"". Yes, there are different views. Only those who really know how important fish are respect them. And now, in England, they are considering reintroducing the brown bear and the wolf, which are also native here, but have historically been exterminated. I am very interested to see how this debate ends. <p/> Grandma:) <p/> hmm... i wouldn't talk about how many of them and why they prefer a dog to a child... because i don't know any of them and i don't have one. when i try to empathise... the thing that jumps out at me the most is that it's easier to protect a dog. if you don't trust the world, the upbringing and the influences of others... it's easier to be responsible for a puppy. because you can separate it from the upbringing of a stranger. but anyway, i insist that it's not ok to turn away from people. <p/> I don't like this kind of labelling in general. i know couples who had a dog for a long time but not a child. now they have a child too. and i find it ugly and unnecessary to just compartmentalise. there is no rule what you have to have first. <p/> and I honestly don't see why anyone should be obliged to coach football instead of volleyball, or have 2 children instead of one, or go into parenthood if they don't want to (or as long as they don't want to). to please others? Why? let them live their own ideas and performances... <p/> and why should someone who doesn't want to have children - and a dog - be worse than someone who doesn't want either a child or a dog? but someone who doesn't want to have children and has fish is immaculate in everyone's eyes, or what? <p/> if someone wants to have children, let them have them, yes, in these cases it is the motives that matter. if they don't want to have children, they don't. let others have that freedom of choice, and let us stick to our own. it is a great disservice to the child to impose social pressure on the child. <p/> zuzi:) <p/> hi, it's true that they are part of life. but when it comes to living and being a neighbour, it's both direct and indirect. it's all part of life, but there are significant differences. <p/> let's say. i have a ricky. i chose to live with him, not with all the dogs of all the neighbours. the neighbours don't bother me (even when they are loud, no), but they are not so directly part of my life that i would want to pee their poo out of my garden. luckily the neighbours are so correct that it's clear to them, heh. <p/> and there are differences in societies, yes... for me, the english version is the closest. i find it very real this respect for all beings, to see not only through oneself, but also to them, for them.",Forum,train

79,"Repayment of the third quarter <p/> A press conference was held today, 25 February 2014, at the premises of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MESS) at 16 Masarykova cesta in Ljubljana, where State Secretary Aljuš Pertinač presented the method of securing funds for the payment of salary disproportions to public institutions that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. <p/> According to the State Secretary, the Ministry of Education and Science received many negative reactions to the letter prepared by the Ministry of Finance concerning the provision of funds for the payment of the first instalment, namely that each direct and indirect budget user must provide the necessary funds for the payment of the salary differential due to the elimination of the third quarter of the basic salary disproportionality within its financial plans, since the additional funds needed for the payment of this obligation must not have an impact on the increase in the budget deficit. The MoFRE took the disagreements and professional concerns to the competent authorities in the Ministry of Finance and asked for help in resolving the issue, but ""all they heard was that fiscal consolidation was continuing and that there was no money"". <p/> The State Secretary said that, in view of the fact that the funds for the payment of the obligations under the Supreme Court judgment were not provided for in the 2014 Budget of the Republic of Slovenia, and in view of the aforementioned position of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Finance, the MoEFA, after careful consideration and in full awareness of the gravity of the situation, had decided to transfer the missing funds to the public institutions that would need the Ministry's assistance in securing the funds for the payment of payment of the first instalment of the salary disproportionality compensation. The Ministry's position is that the payment of the liabilities following the judgment should not adversely affect the performance of the core activities of public education and research. <p/> In January this year, the Ministry sent a letter to the indirect budget users under its responsibility stating that each indirect budget user in the field of activity of our Ministry should, as a rule, provide itself with the necessary funds for the payment of the first instalment of the salary difference, within the limits of the institution's available resources from previous years and the resources available for the implementation of the activities in 2014. Exceptionally, if a public institution demonstrates that it is unable to provide the funds to make the first instalment of the salary differential due to the abolition of the third quarter of the basic salary disparities, the Ministry should provide the additional funds. <p/> The Ministry assessed the institutions' applications for funds to pay the third quarter of the salary disproportionality according to uniform criteria, taking into account the estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure or expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013, taking into account the expenditure on the third quarter of the salary disproportionality for the period from 1.10.2010 to 31.7.2011. The Ministry co-finances applications from institutions up to an amount that covers the estimated deficit of expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013. In addition, according to Aljuš Pertinač, the Ministry also took into account the liquidity criterion and examined the balance of cash, bank credits and short-term financial investments as at 31.12.2013 in relation to the amount of the first instalment liability. <p/> For a full explanation of the criteria according to which the MoEFCC assessed the institutions' applications, please watch the video of the press conference below. <p/> Your comment:",News,train

84,"Anaemia is a dangerous companion to cancer <p/> General fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, shortness of breath even with slight exertion, palpitations or a pounding sensation in the chest, retention of fluid in the body with the appearance of swelling, poor digestion and circulation all have a common denominator in cancer patients - anaemia. Anaemia, as anaemia may also be called, is not necessarily a consequence of cancer or its treatment, but can also be caused by a number of other, less serious, causes. However, it is often a poor blood count, with a reduced number of red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are responsible for ""transporting"" oxygen around the body to all cells, that can significantly worsen the life of cancer patients. <p/> The problems are particularly evident in blood and haematopoietic cancers, where anaemia ""comes with the territory"" of the disease. In some other cancers, however, anaemia occurs later, as a result of treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or ionising radiation. One form of blood cancer is disseminated plasmacytoma, in which cancerous plasmacytoma cells grow in the red bone marrow of the flat bones, which is also the main site of production of healthy blood cells. ""The cancer cells invade the bone marrow and do not allow the healthy blood cells to develop,"" explains Dr Irena Preložnik Zupan, MD, PhD, a specialist in internal medicine at the Clinical Department of Haematology. <p/> ""When we want to define anaemia more precisely, we usually use the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), we speak of anaemia when the haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L for women and below 130 g/L for men,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. Anaemia is divided into mild, moderate and severe forms. The former is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of between 100 and 120 g/L, the latter is between 80 and 100 g/L, and below 80 g/L is the severe form of anaemia, which usually causes the most problems, especially if it is rapid onset. <p/> ""In all cancer patients, we also check the basic blood count and anaemia is virtually impossible to miss. Often, however, the milder form of anaemia in cancer patients is somewhat neglected, but the patient's well-being and quality of life can be significantly impaired as a result. The patient is already experiencing fatigue, feeling unwell, unable to do everyday things, intimacy with a partner is impaired, unable to participate in family responsibilities, etc. All these symptoms can be present even in mild forms of anaemia,"" she warns. <p/> The causes of anaemia in cancer patients can be divided into three groups: <p/> (1) related to the cancer, where there is significant bone marrow involvement, <p/> (2) due to the treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as surgery, which can lead to blood loss, <p/> (3) and (4) a third group of causes can be associated diseases that the cancer patient has and, of course, also have an additional impact on the anaemia. <p/> ""If the heart is failing, we have poor blood circulation, if the lungs are diseased, there is insufficient oxygen supply, if the kidneys are not functioning well, toxic substances accumulate in the body and the organism is weakened,"" says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> ""Cancer-related fatigue is a common phenomenon - a strange, constant feeling of general, severe tiredness, listlessness and helplessness, which cancer patients themselves attach much more importance to than doctors,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova, explaining the difference between the patient's and the doctor's perception of the problem. ""Also very important are the data showing the reduced success of cancer treatment in anaemic patients and the reduced survival of these patients compared to non-anaemic patients, irrespective of the type of cancer. "" <p/> And how common is anaemia in cancer patients? <p/> ""Based on the large 2001-2002 European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS) study of around 15,000 cancer patients, which looked at the incidence, prevalence and treatment of anaemia, anaemia was present in an average of 40% of patients at the time of enrolment, and in disseminated plasmacytoma, anaemia was present in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis. With cancer treatment, anaemia occurred in a further 30%"", says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> Anaemia in cancer patients can be treated in several ways, depending on the cause. ""If a patient has severe problems due to anaemia, in terms of dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or chest pain (a sign of ischaemic heart disease), we need to intervene with transfusions of concentrated red blood cells, which have an immediate effect. Usually these are patients with a severe degree of anaemia, haemoglobin concentration below 80 g/L. However, problems may occur earlier if the patient has associated heart or lung disease. Transfusion is also needed in patients who are actively bleeding due to cancer or if a previous attempt at erythropoietin treatment has been ineffective. In patients with mild and moderate anaemia, however, we prefer to treat with recombinant erythropoietins. The disadvantage is that it takes time for the haemoglobin concentration to rise, but it certainly avoids many of the disadvantages of transfusion,"" explains Zupanova. <p/> ""Studies are still ongoing to determine at which haemoglobin level it is best to start treating the patient, with what doses of erythropoietin and how often. In our hospital, we treat with erythropoietin when the haemoglobin concentration is below 110 g/L and administer it up to a target haemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L. At higher haemoglobin concentrations, side-effects such as thrombosis and arterial hypertension may occur. This in turn may put the patient at risk. ""Erythropoietins have a number of advantages over transfusions. The latter still pose a low risk of transmitting infections, cause iron to accumulate in the body and increase fluid volume. Immune reactions after transfusion can also be dangerous. The patient should receive a transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes in hospital for observation and appropriate management if problems arise. When treated with erythropoietins, these problems are avoided. The drug is usually in syringes for subcutaneous administration. Patients should be followed up regularly every four weeks to see how well the treatment is working. We are usually successful in patients who need the drug temporarily because of chemotherapy,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. ""If we have a patient with advanced cancer, we mainly opt for transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes, as erythropoietins are ineffective in this case. """,Information/Explanation,train

93,"In a logistic sense, a ""rare disease"" - e.g. operable childhood epilepsy - is an enormous challenge for the health service of a small country, which has to provide the highest quality treatment in centres that have the experience to do the job - and these can only be developed in settings with sufficient referrals, i.e. abroad. Slovenia is too small for it to be professionally and economically rational to develop specialised teams for all complex diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of childhood epilepsy. The prerequisite of ""at least 25 operations per year"" (and, at the same time, a steady stream of intensive diagnostic treatments) is not achievable in such a small population, and we are therefore urgently dependent on collaborative action in international networks. Of course, if there is no national support for more enterprising ideas and real support for an organisation to disseminate its own knowledge and work for patients in a more grey region. Patients in the region are interested, they come to Slovenia for other opinions and advice. But it has long been the case that in Slovenia, the health policy has never supported the views of the Syrians, not even when it was about the big and world-renowned names (neurosurgery). Today, staffing is barely sufficient to prepare our patients, who are rightly sent abroad for further treatment. The profession has never had the support of management in this either. Where are we if we wanted to offer this to the wider region? <p/> It would be very wrong, in a time of 'austerity' in a time of global financial crisis, to start applying restrictions to those patients who are most vulnerable and in whom it is reasonable to expect a major improvement in health. It would be very wrong for the recently launched public debate (e.g. by Spomenka Hribar, certainly well intentioned) to be based on bad publicity. <p/> The fact that carefully selected children with epilepsy go for treatment to the best foreign centres is, in fact, also proof of the quality of our health care.

104,"Use your face instead of a joystick! <p/> Until now, online game players have been using a joystick, mouse and keyboard - what if you could use your face to control the game for a change? This cool new idea is now available for the first time in the form of Red Bull Formula Face - turn on your webcam, relax your facial and neck muscles, tilt your head, blink and take the first turn with turbo acceleration. <p/> The new online game is based on the latest technology, where you use your face to navigate around the track. It's a world premiere. The user uses a webcam to track their facial expressions. The game is free, suitable for both PC and Mac, does not need to be downloaded to your computer and can be tested at www.redbullformulaface.com. <p/> Red Bull Formula Face does away with the joystick altogether. It used to be about the player's manual dexterity to win or lose, but now all you need is a webcam and your face. A wink to turbo acceleration and a head tilt to cornering? It's easy with Red Bull Formula Face. You're just a few steps away from your first interactive race: turn on the webcam, choose your favourite character, personalise it with your own photo, choose a Formula 1, NASCAR or rally car and your personal avatar is ready to go! There are three different levels to battle against the computer. <p/> The facial control technology developed for Red Bull Formula Face is both simple and revolutionary: tilt your head left or right to manoeuvre your car on the track. The aim of the game, which has a paper-like appearance, is to score as many points as possible. Flicking your eyes triggers turbo accelerations that can leave your opponent in a puff of smoke. You can activate the add-ons you collect during the game at any time, and they give you a decisive advantage: a pair of wings to propel you far forward, monster tyres to run over your opponent, or glue and scissors to stop them. <p/> Photo bonuses give you lots of extra points and guaranteed laughs: they start as soon as you hit one of the cameras hovering over the track. They reward the player who mimics the facial expressions shown as closely as possible. You can save the photos you take to your Red Bull Formula Face profile and share them with your friends on Facebook. The result of the last race is also posted - and you can bet that your friends will race to beat you and post the craziest photos they can. For those who are good at handwork, you can download a PDF of your avatar and build an origami racer to take to the table. <Stefan Becker from BUZZIN MONKEY, the company responsible for the concept and creation of Red Bull Formula Face, had this to say about the innovative new game: ""For the first time ever, you can control the game without any special hardware such as a console or joystick - all you need is your face and facial expressions - and it's all tightly integrated with the social network. ""Red Bull Formula Face is available in multiple languages and can be played worldwide. <p/> Let's face it - joysticks are a thing of the past - facial expressions are the future! So put on your racing face and visit www.redbullformulaface.com for the very first experience of playing an online game using facial expressions. <p/> What exactly do they do? Don't worry, they're not crazy, they're playing Red Bull Formula Face - the first online game where you control your car with your facial expressions - smiling activates special effects, if you shut up,...",Promotion,train

107,"WATERWELL IN RIHTAROVCI (RADENCI) <p/> Despite light rain, we inaugurated the restored village well in the centre of Rihtarovci in the municipality of Radenci - the 55th restored well within the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters - In 1999 Helios and the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning started restoring local wells in various forms of water sources - Rihtarovci is the 49th in the series of the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters. Rihtaštavlje is the 49th place in Slovenia where a water source has been restored with the financial assistance of Helios and the professional support of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning - After the blessing by the parish priest Janko Ivančič, the oldest villager, Terezie Mauko, was poured her first glass during the opening ceremony, with which she proudly toasted the gathered. <p/> In Rihtarovci, in the municipality of Radenci, the completely renovated village well was opened yesterday at noon with a short cultural programme by pupils from the Radenci Primary School and in the presence of many locals and guests. This spring, the municipality of Radenci applied for a call for funding, which for the tenth year has been organised by Helios and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning as part of the campaign to preserve clean Slovenian waters. The village well in Rihtarovci convinced the expert selection committee and the renovation could soon start. <p/> The fountain is located in the central village area, in a small park next to a chapel with benches near the main road Radenci - Ljutomer. It is two kilometres from the centre of Radenci. It is a typical Styrian fountain, built more than a hundred years ago and equipped at that time with a large wooden wheel and a wooden shaft on which a supporting rope was wound with two wooden buckets rising up alternately. It is surrounded by a traditional wooden structure and the roof is made of brick tiles. It lies on a layer of clay up to 8 metres thick, which protects the groundwater from surface pollution and is 13 metres deep. The interior of the well was originally walled with sandstone, which was replaced by concrete channels 120 cm in diameter when it was rebuilt. Some parts have been modernised, but it remains essentially a copy of the decaying well. A submersible pump with a tap was added to facilitate the pumping of the water, and the original stone trough. The villagers used it until the construction of the village aqueduct The water in the well is in the self-purification phase and is not quite fit for drinking at the moment. <p/> The village well is also a popular walking route for guests of the nearby Radenci Spa, and will be of interest to thousands of annual hikers as part of the ""Three Hearts Marathon"". The fountain is also included in the conceptual design of the local water trail ""K stűdenci"", which was prepared by pupils of the Radenci Primary School and awarded a financial prize by the Helios Foundation. The pupils active in the project are working to make the trail a reality in the spring. It has also become a teaching point for the ECO Water System project, which is being developed by pupils from the local primary school. <p/> The restoration work on the well lasted from August to October and was carried out, also as a donation, by local companies and entrepreneurs and, of course, by the volunteer work of active villagers. The participants in the works were Viktor Zamuda, Emil Šmid, the Misja brothers, Branko Weindorfer Construction, Anton Kotnjek s.p., SGP Pomgrad, Tondach Slovenija d.o.o., Radenska d.d. and Boštjan Nedog Mizarstvo s.p. The value of the restoration work is estimated at 6,000 euros, of which the municipality of Radenci contributed 4,000 euros and the rest was provided by Helios through the Helios Fund. <p/> In the neighbouring municipality of Gornja Radgona, the Slatinski vrelec in Ivanjševci was restored in 2003 with the help of Helios, and in the municipality of St. George by the River Ščavnica, the school fountain in Stara Gora was restored in 2005 with the help of Helios.",News,train

126,"Slovenia: Public appeal by the Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia <p/> Ljubljana, 16 June 2012 (MOREL) - The Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia has addressed a public appeal to the government, the National Assembly, university rectors and faculty deans, and the National Agency for Quality in Higher Education, which we are publishing here in full: The results of the negotiations with the trade unions are very painful for public higher education. Because higher education is financed differently from secondary and primary education and because this financing has been carried out in an unconstitutional way for several years, universities have been left out of the negotiations. Not only has the state failed to adopt the law on the financing of state universities and colleges, which is required by the Constitution in its Article 58. It has crowned the unconstitutionality of the previous practice of funding by regulation by deciding the level of funding for higher education politically and arbitrarily, by rebalancing the budget. The State promises students free studies, while at the same time announcing tuition fees in the National Reform Programme. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is trying to artificially lower the quality of studies by putting financial pressure on public universities, thereby triggering the rampant privatisation of higher education. Universities have already had insufficient funds to carry out five years of study, and the new funding will be barely sufficient for the first level. In view of the financial constraints, the three public universities are already preparing to lay off fee-earners and temporary staff, to retire without replacements, and there are various ideas of radically reducing the rights deriving from titles, grades and employment contracts. These ideas culminate in unlawful proposals on unpaid additional teaching work, on supplementing full-time and additional teaching work with low-paid honorary work, and the demand that university teachers themselves provide universities with funds for the research part of their salary, which is already contractually due to them. This is roughly equivalent to requiring judges to generate part of their salary themselves on the market by securing a reasonable number of disputes in which to dispense justice. The non-recognition of research work and the expansion of self-financing part-time study could begin the uncontrolled disintegration of higher education as a public service. The work of higher education teachers and staff has always included both teaching and research. For a full-time or part-time employee, only the direct teaching commitment is defined; the remaining hours up to the full-time commitment comprise the indirect teaching commitment (preparation, examinations, tutoring, etc.), research (as demonstrated by meeting the habilitation criteria) and management work (membership of committees, etc.). The point of the legal regulation limiting the direct teaching obligation is that university teachers and staff are obliged to devote their regular working time to research, the results of which they must prove at the time of their election: every university teacher, with the exception of a minority of full professors, must be habilitated (elected to a title) every five years, and must meet demanding criteria for scientific work. Since habilitation resulting from research is a condition for maintaining employment, it is legally untenable for universities to make this same employment conditional on the independent acquisition of external research funding. The task of a university is not to reproduce existing knowledge, but to create and disseminate new knowledge. Therefore, basic research in universities must have stable sources of funding. The provision of these resources is to be laid down by law, in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution. The Public Finance Balancing Act has allowed universities to modify their programmes autonomously. At first sight, it would appear that the State has thus given universities greater autonomy. In reality, however, it has given their managements all the power to rearrange, cut, merge and abolish study programmes at will. We would like to point out that such measures threaten not only employment, but also the quality of accredited programmes, the right of students to study in the programme in which they have enrolled and to pursue appropriate studies at a second level. We therefore call on the National Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Quality in Higher Education to problematise the reaccreditation of programmes if they are altered beyond recognition due to financial pressures or if they are implemented in a way that is not of the highest quality. Universities have insufficient human resources to carry out their studies, and at the same time the state, by withholding funds, is artificially creating a situation where there are suddenly too many staff. As this is a public service carried out in the interest of all the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, we will initiate the appropriate legal procedures in relation to the undermining of the rights of public employees in universities. We would also like to point out that the rights of students are also at stake. If, under the financial conditions of the rebalancing, an agreement between the Ministry and the student organisation was possible, it is an agreement to destroy public higher education, the aim of which is rampant privatisation. The Ministry's promises that there will be no tuition fees are unconvincing hypocrisy, and the agreement with the official student organisation on free full-time study opens the door wide to the restriction of full-time study and the expansion of self-financing part-time study. The quality of studies will fall. Since the conditions for accreditation by the National Agency for Quality are low, opportunities will open up for private operators, who will be granted concessions by the state on the basis of easily obtained accreditation, according to the interests of individuals and political-economic clienteles. We propose that the National Agency for Quality tighten the conditions for institutional accreditation and demand an impact on the level of concessionary funding granted to HEIs. Above all, it is self-evident to require full funding for programmes already accredited, which are delivered as a public service and which have also been accredited on the basis of cost and staffing needs assessments. This includes professional, administrative and technical staff, who were already on low pay grades and have fallen even lower as a result of austerity measures. These categories of workers have hitherto enjoyed the basic rights that come with civil servant status, rights that may no longer be taken for granted in the forthcoming reorganisations. The State is deliberately depleting public higher education. In the words of the Minister, ""the government is forcing rectors to behave as any crisis manager would behave"". This statement is obscene and shows a complete lack of responsibility for a key area of development, as well as a lack of understanding of the social mission of universities and the constitutional role of higher education in the Republic of Slovenia. Recall that the autonomy of universities (Article 58 of the Constitution) is also to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court in the light of Article 59 of the Constitution, i.e. ""primarily as the autonomy of professors to research and teach autonomously (independently), without restrictions and pressures"" (U-I-34/94). Furthermore, as public servants, employees of higher education institutions perform a public service for the population of the Republic of Slovenia. Unfortunately, the government instead advocates a market-based approach, with an emphasis on corporate governance, consumerism and the pursuit of short-term profit. In this situation, we wonder whether universities will be able to fulfil their role? Will it be possible, in the face of financial cutbacks, to maintain the universal accessibility of education and the level of quality expected by students and employers? How is it possible that universities are playing an increasingly marginal role in the coming 'knowledge society'? The disintegration of higher education as a public service will not only affect the teaching and professional staff employed in universities. Profit-oriented higher education will inevitably widen the social divide between an elite minority who will be able to provide their children with a quality education, and thus with social status and security, and the vast majority of the rest of the population, who will either not be able to afford higher education or will be forced into long-term debt All this gives the unpleasant impression that university and college leaders have been too quick to bow their heads and accept political pressures. We know that crisis management is nothing more than the informal transformation of the university into a business that will serve neither the staff, nor the students, nor the economic and other development of the community, but the interests of local cliques. We therefore call on rectors and deans to firmly reject the destructive role assigned to them by politics and to open a broad public debate on the participation of workers and students in the governance of public universities. We remind university and faculty leaders that employees will not accept a situation in which external financial pressures become an excuse to promote political and private interests within the institutions themselves. We inform the government and the management of universities and faculties that, in a situation dictated by rebel budgets, we may be forced to suspend the study process already this calendar year. We call on students to support us in our efforts to achieve free and quality public higher education,"" said the appeal signed by Marko Marinčič. (end)",Opinion/Argumentation,train

131,"7. Fridays and Saints' Days <p/> First Friday and the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June. Renewal of our consecration. Maybe for the first time, maybe for the tenth time? For the Diocese of Ljubljana, Bishop Gregory Rozman announced the celebration of nine First Fridays in 1941. Seventy years have now passed since then. That is a long lifetime, but some ninety-year-olds can still remember this inter-war event. The Bishop was concerned about the growing unbelief among the people and he explained the devotion of First Fridays as making reparation to the Heart of Jesus for all offences against God and also against the Church. That year, the war struck with only the first sweep, and the anti-religious spirit had been obviously and secretly at work for a long time. The Bishop called for repentance and respect for God's commandments. Is this call unnecessary today? Let us take a look at two families that call themselves Christian. After all, it does not even matter how many children they have. In the first, the day begins around six o'clock in the morning for the parent, and a little later for the schoolchild. They don't even see each other in the morning. The parents have a quick morning coffee, no time to even cross themselves and they are already on the carriageway. They all have lunch together later in the afternoon, and the aces don't even say goodbye. In the evening, the TV news is on and the schoolboy has a pile of homework for the next school day. It's fast approaching, and because the boy is independent - as he has to be - he takes the time to heat something up in the microwave, have a quick wash and throw his nice, friendly, ""... good night, Mom. ' They go to Mass on Sundays several times and the boy doesn't feel bad at all at the service. But, he thinks, we don't pray much at home, even though Grandma often reminds us about it. They don't even have breakfast together in the second morning, but they pray first before lunch. They also pray together in the evening. On Sundays, they go to Mass in their own way, the parents are the readers of the readings, and the children are the singers and altar servers. The family resolution for the new calendar year is different each time, most often of a charitable nature. Neither the first nor the second family thinks particularly of the First Fridays, but neither of them allows anyone to dishonour any person or any religion. There are many families like this nowadays. If you put their religious life on a human scale, it would probably swing. Nor would a geometric measurement show the same line for the boundary of the spiritual. Let alone in families where there is hardly a whiff of faith left. What about those to whom faith is completely alien. What of those who are opposed to faith. The call to conversion is still needed. Perhaps ever more so. But it is necessary to know how to hear it. Yet, as loud and frequent as it is, it cannot touch ears that do not listen. The condition for a different way through the spiritual world is the willingness not to turn a deaf ear to Christian values and virtues. Faith is chief among them. Bl. It was very dear to Slomšek. He called it the light of faith, faith be your light. How precious light is, however, is best known in the darkness. Do we not find ourselves in darkness even when we cannot help ourselves in difficult circumstances? The smallest bit of faith can make it a little brighter. Trusting in God's mercy and help is that sliver of light. In the mystical vision of St. Faustina Kowalska, Jesus instructed her to pray much for the poor. She was a hidden pray for people she did not know. God would be caught in his own snare if he did not keep his promises. We have no influence on how and when they come true, other than our own perseverance in trust. All things work together for good to those who love God, says the Apostle Paul. Paul says in his Letter to the Romans (Rom 8:28), and adds. We must trust. On Fridays and holy days.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

136,"Nicotine addiction <p/> Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that depends primarily on the absorption and metabolism of nicotine. In addition to sociological factors, our genetic make-up has a particularly important influence, as it can explain more than 50 % of the total risk of nicotine dependence. <p/> Scientists are discovering new genes with smaller effects alongside the well-known genes with large effects, such as CHRNA3, which have contributed significantly to understanding the biological mechanism of addiction. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. Changes also occur in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> More details on nicotine dependence <p/> Add to these facts the link between smoking and heart attack, lung disease and cancers of the tongue, throat and lungs, and you have enough reasons to quit. However, this is often where a major problem arises. The World Health Organisation estimates that less than 5% of people who have tried to quit smoking unaided persist one year after their last cigarette. This is due to nicotine dependence influenced by genetic factors. <p/> Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon that depends, among other things, on nicotine absorption and metabolism. Different people react very differently to the same amount of nicotine, which is determined by genetic factors. They can explain more than 50 of the risks of nicotine dependence. Scientists are discovering new genes to further explain the causes of nicotine dependence, which could go a long way towards solving the problem of addiction. <p/> Understanding the biological mechanism of addiction has made a significant contribution to the search for genes that might influence nicotine dependence.

As these sprinklers are below the surface, it is sufficient to water the lawn a few times a week, as the soil retains more moisture than the surface. However, if you do not intend to buy such a system, it is a good idea to check the soil moisture before watering the grass. The best way to do this is to walk on the grass and if you see footprints in the grass, the grass needs watering. You also don't need to water the grass if it has rained for a long time, as the moisture has been retained in the soil. <p/> The best time to water the grass is early in the morning or in the evening, as this reduces the evaporation value.

At the ceremony, presided over by Card. Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was attended by some 18,000 faithful. The faithful from Slovenia also made the pilgrimage to the beatification in 13 buses. Among the five new martyrs are two Slovene women from Dolenjska, Sr M. Krizina Bojanc and Sr M. Antonija Fabjan. <p/> The journey of the Daughters of Divine Love from Pal via Romagna to Goražde took four days and four nights. They arrived in Goražde on the afternoon of 15 December 1941. They were placed on the second floor of the barracks. That same evening, wild and drunken Chetniks broke into their room and tried to kill them. In defence of their human dignity and their promise of chastity, the sisters broke free from the hands of their attackers and jumped out of the window one by one. Meanwhile, the Chetniks broke down in front of the barracks and executed the severely wounded sisters with knives. They were dragged to the river Drina, which carried their bodies away a few days later. S.M. Berchmana stayed in Sjetlina for ten days, where she recovered quite well. Then she was to go to Goražde, to the other sisters, who were already dead. Two Chetniks took her away on a sledge. When he returned, the coachman said that she had arrived safely at her sisters' home. The attendant, however, had a rosary around her neck. It is recorded that she was killed on 23 December 1941. Sisters Jula, Berchmana, Krizina, Antonija and Bernadeta, known as the ""Drin Martyrs"", served God generously and with selfless love, as missionaries in the ""afflicted Bosnia"", especially by helping the poor. They confirmed their fidelity to God by shedding their blood. <p/> Word of their martyrdom spread far and wide. Therefore, on 4 December 1999, Cardinal Vinko Puljić, Archbishop of Vrbas, after having obtained the necessary permission from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, issued a decree to begin the diocesan process for their beatification. The beatification of the Servants of God Sr. M. Jule Ivanišević and the four sisters is not only an official recognition of their martyrdom, but also a high recognition of the spiritual values for which the sisters lived and sacrificed their lives. Jula Ivanišević, Berchmana Leidenix, Krizina Bojanc, Antonija Fabjan and Bernadeta Banja are witnesses to an extraordinary fidelity to God and an active love for the poor. In faith, we rightly hope that their shed blood will be the seed of new Christians who are aware and responsible, and of new spiritual vocations for new times. Martyrs are strong intercessors in every need, especially in the difficult trials and dangers of life. Many have already seen this. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Krizina Bojanc, baptised Jozefa, a nun and martyr, was born on 14 May 1885 in Šmarjeta, Dolenjska. At the age of 36, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo. Full of sisterly love, she was distinguished for her constant prayer, sacrifice and penitential life. During her lifetime she was called ""Sister of Prayer"". She crowned her life in fidelity to Christ when, on 15 December 1941, she gave her life rather than renounce her vows and Christ. Her martyr's blood is clear proof that she loved God more than she loved her own life. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Antonija Fabjan, also baptised Joseph, a nun and a martyr, was born on 23 January 1907 in Mali Lipje in the parish of Žužemberk. At the age of 22, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo and made her vows on 19 March 1932. She was distinguished for her simplicity, sincerity, piety and self-control. Faithful to her religious vocation, she was tortured and killed on 15 December 1941, together with four other sisters. Out of love for Christ, she accepted martyrdom so that ""the life of Jesus might be made manifest in her mortal body"" (cf. 2 Cor 4:11). <p/> Both Slovenian sisters come from the diocese of Novomeč. <p/> The veneration of the Drin martyrs will take place on their death day, 15 December. <p/> The Martyrs are models of fidelity to God, of human and feminine dignity, of active love for their neighbours, and intercessors for new spiritual vocations, especially for women, as well as in the various trials of life.",Information/Explanation,train

We told the congress that both federations are participating in the Olympics, which means that we will also have to postpone the joint leagues (INL and EBEL) by at least 3 weeks. <p/> The proposal from Slovenia, Austria and Hungary (participating in EBEL) was a week between 26 April and 2 May, and the date was confirmed as appropriate by IIHF Sport Director Dave Fitzpatrick, as the condition that Division I is finished one week before the start of the Elite Division WC (which starts next year on 9 May) is fulfilled. The date has not been officially confirmed as the Japanese federation cannot confirm a date change without the agreement of the home league management. <p/> Therefore, the IIHF proposed a deadline for a decision - within ten days. <p/> Delegates at the IIHF Congress confirmed Germany and France as hosts of the 2017 IIHF Elite Division World Championship by 63 votes in favour.

170,"Overeating in secret <p/> Bulimia - an eating disorder in which a person is preoccupied with the appearance of his or her body and has a fear of becoming fat - which was only defined in 1980, is affecting more and more people. According to statistics, more than five per cent of the population officially suffer from this eating disorder, but in reality many more do. Like anorexia, bulimia affects more women than men, up to eight times more. Unlike anorexia, a person suffering from bulimia can conceal their distress for much longer than an anorexic person, as they tend to have a normal to moderate weight gain. The BMI of anorexics is very low, while that of bulimics ranges from 20 to 25. <p/> Huge amounts of food <p/> A characteristic of bulimia is repeated overeating, which occurs over a very short period of time. During this time, the person eats huge amounts of food, changing all the flavours from sweet, bitter, salty, sour... When he overeats, he feels guilty and induces his own vomiting, often with the help of laxatives and diuretics. Overeating and vomiting are cyclical, recurring several times a week. Most people who suffer from bulimia (75 %) belong to the so-called purgative type, which is characterised by overeating, vomiting and laxative use. The non-purgative type (25 per cent), on the other hand, indulges in fasting and excessive physical activity after binge eating. In bulimia, the person cannot control himself or herself, and therefore cannot choose the appropriate amount and type of food. However, it should be noted that most people who are overweight do not suffer from bulimia.",Information/Explanation,train

Lean into the carbon plate under your feet, but make sure you don't pinch the windscreen washer button, which is down there. We'll be bounced around a bit, but you can hold on to the roll cage with your hands,"" Nicolas explained to me as we prepared to start our adventure in the cockpit of the works car. <p/> No, it wasn't a flight in a military jet fighter, but the experience was very similar. Two adrenaline-fuelled men (well, at least one of them certainly was), both wearing flame-retardant pyjamas, helmets on their heads, strapped firmly into a clam seat, chatting in the cockpit of a hellishly expensive machine, surrounded by wires, switches, levers, monitors and carbon-fibre components. The hot, bare metal interior is permeated by the intoxicating, almost slightly intoxicating, smell of high-octane propellant. Mhm ... it really does smell like mint tea. How soothing and calming. It should also be prescribed drop by drop in pharmacies to all petrol addicted racing drivers and journalists. <p/> When the cabin door closes, a mad but sadly all too brief adventure begins, which is actually akin to driving a jet fighter. With one difference. That, of course, those of us who have had the opportunity to ride in a jet military aircraft are, after all, outnumbered by those of us who have sat behind the wheel or in the passenger seat of such a vehicle. In Russia, for many years now, it has been possible to take a ride in a MiG, and at the airport in Slovenj Grad it is also possible to buy a ticket for a ride in a south-eastern seagull. <p/> You cannot buy a ride in a Peugeot 307 WRC. For no money. Especially not a drive in a factory car, behind the wheel of which, just a few days ago, former World Rally Champion Marcus Gronholm was still sitting. Well, it's true that it is possible to buy a 307 WRC, or it will be possible next season. But it's also true that you will only be able to get your hands on this car with good connections and if you have at least a few virtuoso drives or if you can boast World Rally Championship-level results beforehand. <p/> Well, then, you are only a modest few hundred thousand euros away from buying such a hand-built racing car. The official figure, according to the men from Peugeot's motorsport department, is between 700 thousand and a million euros. But as one local racing driver said, once you've bought the car, all you need is a bucket and a cloth. At least to clean it every now and then, because you're not going to drive it anyway. Unless you've also bought, for almost the same amount, the spare parts and the big truckload of equipment needed to maintain such a race car. And you need a team of four or five mechanics (read engineers) who are skilled in maintaining, servicing and handling this sophisticated apparatus on four wheels. <p/> Jeep, the Peugeot 307 WRC is no longer just a racing car. It's a top-quality machine for achieving the highest goals. It is a machine for winning rallies in the World Rally Championship. <Let's get back in the car! Having driven a few laps of Peugeot's previous 206 world rally car on this same circuit two years ago, I kind of knew what to expect. Well, at least I had a hunch, unlike Avtomagazin's Dusan and Alyosha, who were about to be baptised by fire. Several years of active participation in the domestic rally championship, and two years as a co-driver before that, had given me the courage to sit in the passenger seat for the three demonstration laps, completely relaxed and smiling ear to ear. To see what a little Frenchman can do behind the wheel of a big Frenchman. Come on, poba, scare me if you can, I thought, because the man doesn't know anyway that I'm no stranger to racing and that I've driven a similar car on this very track. <p/> But my smile and my courage did not last long. Even though I knew that the car allowed everything that was already beyond the limits of what was possible and had nothing to do with the law of gravity and the rest of physics, after the first metres and the turns, I was breathless. No, I wasn't afraid that something would go wrong, because I trusted the driver, the car and the safety of the track. I was more amazed at what the car really could do and how docilely controllable it was in the hands of a true master. You know, when you're behind the wheel yourself, the first thing you want to do is to get the whole car back, because the Peugeot people wouldn't be too impressed if I tipped their toy on the roof. The question is whether, after such a misfortune, they would have let me get behind the wheel of, say, a 308 WRC in 2008. <p/> After half a lap I started to enjoy it again. With one eye on the track in front of us, I was watching to see if the owners had changed any of the corners in two years, and with the other eye I was watching Vouilloso twisting the steering wheel, when to change gear, when to apply the handbrake, how he was pressing on the accelerator, whether he was braking with his left foot or his right foot, and so on. Our two laps were over too quickly, but I was quite happy. It was a pure pleasure to drive, but the fact that we finished meant something completely different. That we were going to change seats. For the next three laps, the little Frenchman goes into the passenger seat, and I cram myself into a seat that is too narrow, the steering wheel too long. To give him back his dear soap. <p/> The journalist colleagues in front of me have already worn out the Michelin racing tyres for the gravel, so Nicolas motions for me to pit. <p/> ""Let's get a fresh set of tyres and refuel,"" he says, and it occurs to me that sometimes it's not a bad idea to be last in line. New tyres! Yes, when I'm racing alone, I hear that word too rarely, unfortunately. Meanwhile, I pull the Peugeot into the red service area and the engineers roll out a set of new tyres from the big service truck, which is resplendent with stars and wreaths indicating the number of World Championship wins. Mhm, just for me. And I'm enjoying every moment. <p/> The vehicle is lifted onto four special pedestals by two cranes and all four wheels are taken off at the same time. The four of them struggle to replace them and all I hear behind the wheel is the shrill beeping of the electric wheel-bolting guns. The head of engineering lifts the bonnet and plugs in a laptop computer, checking that the engine is OK. <p/> And I am still sitting behind the wheel, waiting for the team to do their job. The guys wipe down the windows, scrape the mud, soil and stones that have accumulated around the wheels off the undercarriage and, in the meantime, someone opens the tailgate and uses a pump to pump high-octane, highly flammable, fast-burning, volatile racing petrol into the car's fuel tank. <p/> Mama mia, if only moments like that lasted forever! Can you imagine how soothing such a situation is for the ego of a casual and hobby racer from the sunny side of the Alps? ! Like valerian drops. Sitting in the factory car of a former world champion, with the team around you trying to prepare the car for your drive, while you chat about the car's special features with your co-driver, the guy who stunned the world this year with a great drive and top times in the Rally de Catalunya. Yah, and what good does that do him? He can still just be my co-driver! <p/> Joke aside: Nicolas Vouilloz is a nice man. The multiple world downhill mountain bike champion has a two-year contract with Peugeot. He competes in eight World Championship rallies in last year's 206 WRC under the Peugeot factory team. The world got to know him at this year's Rally de Catalunya, where he finished 10th overall and twice finished second on stages, once just three tenths of a second behind the winner. Talent! The driver of the future? Undoubtedly, as he was also behind multiple World Champion and reigning champion Peter Solberg and this year's champion Sebastjan Loeb. <p/> Nicolas tells me to pull the metal lever on the steering wheel quickly and hard towards me. The car twitches slightly and a big orange R appears on the screen in front of the driver. I move the same lever away from the steering wheel. I pull the lever. Position 1. First gear. Let's go. Slowly to the racetrack. I look at my co-driver, who knows exactly what I'm interested in. <p/> He just nods his head. You can do it! Greeemooooooooo! Gaaaas! Jihaaaaaaa! The cake goes off like a cannon. With two carbon rings on the steering wheel, you shift up and down with just the finger of one hand. It's just like Formula 1, but instead of buttons on the steering wheel, there's a ring. Why? Because you have to turn the steering wheel rapidly as the car slides sideways through corners, and the gearshift button is always close at hand. That way, the steering wheel is always in place in any position. Where you need it. <p/> After the first lap, my co-driver opened the door to a world of heaven by moving the knob on the centre console two laps. He switched the engine electronics programme from the stage position to the post-stage position. The car breathed at the top of its lungs. The loud popping of the electronics of the turbine-powered vehicles was virtually inaudible in the car. Only the electronic hiss and shifting of the turbo gearbox, combined with the waterfalls of rocks loudly blasting the bottom of the car as the wheels spin idle under the sheer force of the power, caress the ears. <p/> The Peugeot soars over rough potholes. And every new gear is rewarded with a jolt to the shin and a new sticking of both occupants deep into the racing seat. By far the most impressive thing about the car is the insanely good chassis. It absorbs potholes you think will rip the wheels off and makes sure that even on long jumps, the car lands unfeelingly on the wheels. Crazy! The brakes are the same, stopping the car at 100 or 130 km/h before a corner as if it were cemented in place, after just a gentle touch of the racing shoe. And that's on gravel. <p/> I can say that I have never driven a more drivable, more beautiful, more docile and predictable car. The 307 WRC is a true special, a car that drives itself. Well, just the wrong way. In fact, it's the only car that really is driven by the driver, not the other way around. Once you get a taste of this machine, you realise that in a ""civilian"" car, the car is still being driven by the driver, who is trying very hard to keep it on the road. <p/> It is a testament to how tame this beast can be that, believe it or not, during our drive, my co-driver, the very saintly Nicolas Vouilloz, also grabbed the safety cage firmly with his right hand on several occasions, and unexpectedly hissed ""ssssssssss"" through his teeth into my intercom, which could only mean that the boy does not like to ride in the passenger seat very much, or that I was unexpectedly fast in certain corners, even for such a master of the steering wheel. Yes, you'll never imagine what a great compliment it is for a racing driver when such a master inadvertently utters, ""Ssssss! "" <p/> And so we're driving home in a 90-horsepower diesel, lazily making our way along the straight highways of France, Germany and Austria to Ljubljana, when my TV colleague Stropnik throws me a bone: ""Dude, what fools we are! We are driving 1300 kilometres there and 1300 kilometres back. We spend two days in the car and a lot of money on fuel and tolls. All to drive three laps there - in the car! Who can understand that? At least if you were there after driving for twelve hours, you could run around for three laps or ride a bicycle, instead of just getting in another car, doing three laps and then skating home for another twelve hours..."" <p/> Hm, actually David is quite right. We are indeed weirdos, but at the same time I know very well that he thinks exactly the same as me. For three more laps in that car, we'd turn back again in a heartbeat... <p/> ID card <p/> Title: Peugeot 307 WRC (world rally car) <p/> Year built: 2004 <p/> Owner: Peugeot Motorsport France <p/> Number of examples in existence: 2 registered, about 6 built <p/> Driver: Marcus Gronholm <p/> Price: not for sale <p/> Value: €800,000 to €1,000,000 <p/> Mission: to win individual events and the world rally championship",Opinion/Argumentation,train

191,"Television colloborations <p/> About a year and a half ago, Slovenia switched from analogue to digital TV reception. Quite a lot of people started to wonder what this would bring us and what it meant for our continued viewing of TV channels. The answer was very simple, because it was all due to the switchover to a newer technology, which, while it brings considerable improvements in terms of the picture and sound itself, before the switchover it was, in principle, more of a problem for the majority of the population. This difficulty meant either buying a converter or a new television that supports DVB-T. On this account, 2010 was quite a successful year for the sellers of this type of equipment, because monitoring programmes via an analogue signal was no longer possible afterwards, but I also think that both the Internet subs and the providers of other types of monitoring of TV channels were satisfied, because certainly not a few people opted for such a changeover. Eventually, the situation calmed down and it stopped being talked about, because things stood as they should. Well, yes, until it got complicated and a bit more serious. <p/> Earlier this year, Norkring ceased operating multiplex B (which they won the tender for), which contained TV3 and Pink Si, and the main purpose of the multiplex itself is to broadcast commercial programmes. Nevertheless, there were a number of other programmes that were licensed to be broadcast, but we did not see them during Norkring's management of multiplex B. Multiplex A, which is operated by Radio Television Slovenia, currently also broadcasts commercial programmes, even though it is intended only for national programmes. Thus, Slovenia has only one functioning multiplex, which contains both national and commercial programmes, and space for additional ones is running out. Since June, TV Slovenia's channels 1 and 2 have also been available in high definition (HD), but they can only be viewed by IPTV and cable TV users, and the switch to digital transmission has lost its significance, as HD viewing is not possible for viewers who watch the programmes via antennas. Instead, there are now four commercial channels in multiplex A, three of which - POP TV, Kanal A and Vaš kanal - have been there since the beginning, and were joined by Pink Si after the departure of Norkring. The multiplexes are now what they are, because the commercial channels will be in multiplex A until someone starts operating multiplex B again. This could be done again by Norkring or later after a public tender by someone else (source). <p/> On the other hand, there has been talk for some time of a new commercial programme, Planet TV, to be launched by Telekom, which would be quite different from the existing ones. Its content will consist of sports, films, serials and other programmes, and finally a news programme. It would be available via cable and IP television, and also via aerial reception (source). This is where the problem arises, because there are almost no more places in multiplex A, and the call for new channels was already published at the end of last October, with Golica TV, Sponka TV and TV Nakupi meeting the conditions. As the deadline (which is not legally binding) for issuing decisions is tomorrow, this could be delayed further, mainly due to pressure from Telekom, which did not apply for the tender within the October deadline (source). <p/> My view on all this is that, despite the pressure from Telekom, decisions should be issued to the programmes that applied for the tender in October and meet the conditions, and that once multiplex B has been given an administrator, the commercial programmes should go there and, if possible, TVS 1 and TVS 2 should start broadcasting in high definition in multiplex A. As for Planet TV, I hope that it will not be a copy of the current commercial programmes, whose main schedule is just commercials.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

In an era where modern technology is reducing the impact of many forms of media advertising, promotional products are becoming increasingly important for reaching new customers. <p/> Why promotional products are still effective Retailers are increasingly using promotional products to attract new customers because of their usefulness. Television, as an advertising medium, is increasingly under threat with the rise of new TV channels, and it is easy for viewers to skip adverts. In the case of a promotional product, the advertisement cannot be skipped, as it is part of the product and is visible whenever the product is used. <p/> Promotional product manufacturing on the rise Today, promotional product manufacturing is booming because it offers advertisers what many other advertising methods do not, i.e. your message is guaranteed to reach the desired population. Despite the many messages we bombard our potential customers with, advertising with promotional products is effective because many of the messages are internalised. For a message to be internalised by customers, it needs to be repeated many times. A promotional product with its own message is the ideal way to achieve this. <p/> Targeting and measurability Internet advertising makes it easy to reach your target audience and monitor the impact of your advertising campaign. We can do the same with the right promotional product. For example, we print a unique promotional code on the promotional product, which then helps us calculate how much we have recouped our investment. <p/> Promotional products as part of your promotional plan Promotional products will continue to be just one part of your marketing plan, but they play a very important role and should not be overlooked. Promotional products are a great way to make a service tangible and achieve brand awareness through constant messaging. <p/> UK - A 2011 survey by The British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA) showed that marketers much prefer to buy practical promotional products that have been proven to be good and effective in the past. These Top 3 products include pens, notepads and post-it notes, and canvas shopping bags or ECO bags. <p/> When asked how they get the promotional products they want, almost 70 respondents said that the supplier they currently work with is a key source of information. <p/> Despite the fact that more and more money is being spent on marketing, more and more companies want newer and more original ways of promotion to differentiate themselves from the rest. Products made from environmentally friendly materials have become increasingly important in recent years.

In 1965 their daughter Katja was born and a year and a half later their son Vanja was born. <p/> He attended primary and music school in Piran, social science grammar school in Koper, and studied comparative literature in Ljubljana. Between 1989 and 1996 he taught classical guitar and musicology at the Music School in Sežana and Komno, and composed incidental music for theatre productions at the Primorska Drama Theatre (The Egg, The Runaway Robot, Vida Grant, The Miraculous Stone, The Little Prince), the Ljubljana City Theatre (Audition, Pahljača), the Cankarjev dom and the Helios Theatre (Brigades of Beauty) and the Glej Theatre (Don Lorenzo). <p/> He started writing as a high school student.

202,"Boris Pahor, writer, fellow-traveller and harsh critic of all three totalitarianisms of the 20th century, visited Kamnik <p/> Kamnik (4.5.2010) - Boris Pahor, writer, academic, Prešeren laureate, Knight of the French Legion of Honour, multiple Nobel Prize nominee, and recent recipient of Austria's highest state decoration, visited Kamnik today, where in front of a packed hall of the Kamnik Parent Library he spoke about his views on Slovenian society in the present and the past, both in his native Slovenia and abroad. His sparkling critical remarks touched everyone, regardless of political or ideological affiliation. In short, despite his 97 years, Boris Pahor is still at the centre of a critical shake-up of our society. <p/> VIDEO: Writer Boris Pahor thanks for the invitation to Kamnik and critically evaluates the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia. <p/> Short biography <p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920, and later witnessed the fascist persecution of the Slovenes, which led him to join the national liberation movement during the Second World War.<p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the Fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920. In 1944, he was arrested and sent to the concentration camps of Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof and Bergen-Belsen, which he survived with resilience and returned to Trieste after receiving treatment in a French sanatorium. After graduating from the University of Padua, he took a job as a teacher at the rebuilt Slovenian school in his hometown. <p/> Outline of his literary work <p/> Boris Pahor is considered one of Europe's best-known Slovenian writers.His works deal with the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps, often touch on the subject of the Slovenian minority in Italy and the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region, and he is also known for his social and political engagement. Among his best-known works are the collection of novellas The City in the Bay and the novels Nomads without an Oasis, Clash with Spring and, above all, Necropolis, which has been translated into several European languages. Boris Pahor's literary works were re-evaluated only after Slovenia's independence, when he was awarded the Prešeren Prize and the Honorary Medal of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia. To this day, however, the writer maintains a critical stance, for example in the controversy over the Italian Day of Remembrance for the post-war killings and the departure of Italians from Istria, accusing Italy of forgetting about fascism, while also criticising Slovenian restraint. <p/> The discussion with the writer Boris Pahor took place under the title ""Witness to the past"" and was moderated by the young writer Mitja Čander. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""The minority should be united in its political speech"" <p/> As a left-wing democrat, the writer Boris Pahor, together with the Catholic writer Alojz Rebula, laid the cultural foundations of the Slovenian minority in Italy after the Second World War. The renewed Slovenian cultural and political life encouraged Pahor to become involved in it by editing magazines such as Zaliv. Throughout, the writer from Trieste maintained a critical distance and view of Slovenian reality, defending his independence of thought, which naturally led him to clashes with the then dominant left-wing component in the Slovenian minority and with the new communist government in Slovenia. Although he himself was politically left-leaning, he never agreed with the position of Slovenians within the Italian left-wing parties, but instead advocated independent political action. <p/> Boris Pahor attracted a very diverse audience. Kamnik has not seen an event in a long time that brought together citizens of such different political and ideological persuasions. <p/> ""The TIGR fighters were the first fighters against fascism"" <p/> Boris Pahor stressed that the members of the TIGR organisation were the first to resist fascism. Their activities were multifaceted, including the collection of arms for a possible anti-Italian uprising in the event of an Italian attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Unlike the Communists, however, they were concerned to ensure that their actions caused as few casualties among the Slovene population as possible. When they killed one Italian in an action and this led to the Italians killing four Slovenes in revenge, they realised that such a struggle was not worthwhile. <p/> Pahor also pointed out that the post-war oblates refused to recognise the TIGR, and only recently has the TIGR been gaining ground again. Now, young people are also joining the organisation and are committed to the cause of slovakia. On the other hand, Pahor has repeatedly warned against the sale of Slovenian land in Primorska to the Italians, which would lead to the re-Italianisation of Primorska. He was also very critical of Ljubljana, or central Slovenia, which showed no great interest in Slovenians abroad. In Pahor's opinion, Slovenian school textbooks also do not sufficiently inform young people about the suffering of the Primorje people under fascism. Pahor is also against defending the struggle against the liberation movement as merely a struggle against communism. <p/> Matej Tonin listened attentively to Boris Pahor's thoughts. <p/> ""Slovenia behaves towards its neighbours like a war loser"" <p/> On the one hand, Boris Pahor also regrets the break-up of Yugoslavia, although he has never been against an independent Slovenian state. Slovenia's problem is that it does not have the same power as the former Yugoslavia, but our country's main problem is that it is too humble in its demands on its neighbours when it comes to asserting its national interests and protecting its national community. ""Slovenia is behaving as if it had lost the war, not won it"", Pahor added. <p/> Several books by Boris Pahor were also available for purchase in the foyer of the hall. <p/> ""The post-war massacre of Home Army soldiers - a morally reprehensible act"" <p/> Pahor took the former regime in the former Yugoslavia by storm with the publication of the booklet ""Edvard Kocbek, a Witness of Our Time"", which he and Alojz Rebula wrote in 1975 on the occasion of Kocbek's 70th birthday. In the accompanying interview, Kocbek spoke for the first time about the post-war massacre of returned Slovene Home Army soldiers, which raised a lot of dust, and Pahor was banned from entering the country by the Yugoslav communist authorities. <p/> For Boris Pahor, he is a victim, a victim no matter which political-ideological pole he comes from. That is why, despite the fact that he was taken to a German camp precisely because of his betrayal of the Home Army, he condemns the post-war killings of Home Army soldiers (around 10 000), because they were killings of unarmed prisoners of war. In this context, Boris Pahor advocated that the killings in the fojba, which in recent years have been exploited by Italian nationalists and even the highest representatives of the Italian state, should be placed in the broader context of events and it should be said that there were even bigger abysses in mainland Slovenia, where the communists after the war threw Slovenians - political opponents - and that the fojba should also be seen in the broader historical context of the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region under fascist Italy since 1918 or, in other words, in the period of the Nazi occupation of the territory of the Littoral region. Italy, unlike Germany, which carried out a consistent denazification, did not carry out a de-Fascistisation. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""Communism was a religion, even though it did not recognise God Stalin, in organising this ""Communist Church"", modelled himself on the institutional structure of the Catholic Church: with a Pope, cardinals, bishops and chaplains - of course, by other names.... There are 15 beasts in every man, and if a man lives in a totalitarian system, every such system acquires certain collaborators and believers who are ready to support it with all their being. This could explain the emergence of various leaders, e.g. in our case the ""udbovtsy"", who blindly trusted the Party and, like true believers, believed in communism, without giving a second thought to not deceiving their neighbours... Josip Broz Tito could be considered a criminal by many criteria, but he also has the merit of having Primorska annexed to Yugoslavia and Slovenia."" <p/> Speaking of the Christian socialist Edvard Kocbek, whom he knew well, he said that communism should be realised in Slovenia, on the Christian-socialist foundations that Kocbek envisioned. But because the Slovenian communists had taken a different path, one that restricted freedom of thought and the individual, the communist model ended as it did in failure - and according to Pahor, communism as it was deserved it. <p/> In Pahor's view, Christians and parties that defend Christian values and the welfare state, like Krek and Kocbek, should also participate in any government. Only this, in Pahor's view, can lead to balanced development. <p/> However, the writer was also critical of Christians because, in his opinion, they put too much emphasis on wealth and appearances. In his opinion, it is difficult to become a good Christian from a Catholic ...",News,train
203,"How does Daddy come into being? <p/>Fatherhood and motherhood are two emotionally completely incomparable and irreplaceable roles, which no one can replace and which are unique. A wife can never make a husband a father unless he chooses to do so and develops fatherhood himself. <p/> Every adult man carries within him the potential to become a father. What is more, nature has equipped the child with everything he needs to communicate to his father and mother how each of them should take care of him. With its smallness, softness, smiles, shaky cries and amorous glances, it arouses in the adult woman an irresistible impulse to lift the child up in her arms and respond to it, and in the adult man a strong impulse to protect and defend this creature. And this is the very foundation of parenthood. <p/> The mother cannot replace the father and vice versa <p/> The child therefore receives a different kind of validation and a different sense of belonging and uniqueness from the father than from the mother. Which means that even a father who feels well for his children and is tender and motherly with them cannot replace the mother, just as a mother cannot replace the father, however determined, organised, physically active and proud she may be. Therefore, a father cannot learn fatherhood from his mother and vice versa. He has to find out for himself, with each child, how he can be the best father for that particular child at that particular time and in that particular family, what that particular child needs most from him, what he wants to express and what is in him but cannot get out of him. <p/> The father-child relationship <p/> The father-child relationship is established from a very early age and is important for both the child and the father. Children are strongly attached to their father from the very beginning. It is precisely because of the differences in the way the child interacts with each parent that fathers play a completely unique and crucial role in the child's socialisation. Fathers play with their children, stimulating them physically and mentally and guiding them towards new activities. Above all, they protect them! The ability to create a secure home is the cornerstone of fatherhood. <The child associates the father with new experiences, with spontaneity and with challenges. They easily become interested in such a father and a reciprocal relationship develops quickly in such circumstances. During the first three years, the father's sensitivity, cooperation and support during joint play are particularly important in the child's later perception of close relationships. His sensitivity during play gives the child a sense of respect and support, understanding the toddler's needs for exploration and contributing to a feeling of competence. Playing with a father who participates, who notices challenges and who encourages the child to challenge, solve and explore, the child develops a sense of importance, uniqueness, trust and belonging to his father. <p/> Daddy does things differently <p/> However, many times it is very difficult for dads to watch mummy looking after the child, finding herself and him feeling awkward and unable to build such a strong and warm bond with the child. He cannot imitate her, because he can never do something like a mother, because he is not a mother. But he can find his own way around her, which will be just as reassuring and just as interesting for the child. This means that he should learn to change in a way that is most pleasant for him and for the child, that he should calm down in a way that calms him, that he should play and have fun in a way that is also fun for him and that makes him feel that the child is comfortable around him and that he can be proud of his father. Fatherhood develops separately from motherhood, the only common point being the partnership relationship, which, if it is secure and confidential, eases a lot of pain, distress and insecurity because the partners can talk about it. <p/> Mothers, tell your man you need him! <p/> Men are far from immune to babies! They are just as vulnerable as they are. Men cry too, but with silence, withdrawal, ... out of a need to belong. A wife can tell her husband to hold the baby, to swaddle it. She can tell him that she needs him. What is more, she must make sure that she is always relaxed enough to be with the child, which means that she also needs his help to get dressed in peace, to eat her lunch in peace, to take a nap if she is exhausted. <p/> Every normal man and father is proud if he makes his wife happy, if he protects her and if his child loves him. Fathers are proud when they put their child to sleep, when they feel how important, beautiful, clever and interesting they are to the child. Husbands can therefore very well introduce children to their chores, to their world, because the child will be amazed by everything, the keys on the computer, the screwdriver, a piece of wood, a book, everything that Daddy does will be sacred to him. When Daddy shows the child what he is doing, what he is interested in, when the child is able to ""help"" him, it will be a great honour for the child, and the man will experience his chores in a completely different way. <p/> Contact with the child is important <p/> The basis of survival today is contact, emotional attunement. If parents cannot provide this for the child, it is a great deficit for the child. It is very difficult to live with such a deficit in the world, because he or she is not good at relationships. <p/> If the partner is afraid of contact with the child (for example, if he refuses to change the baby because he is afraid he will do something wrong), the child's mother is best helped if she can put a humorous spin on it, e.g. if she dares to confide that this father loves her child as much as she loves him. This is the only way that the baby's mother will be able to relax around the baby's father and the baby and live her motherhood to the full, not in bitterness and anger at the baby's father who ""chose not"" to take care of the baby for his own sake, not because she is so incompetent. <p/> Parenting is learned alongside the child and making mistakes is not necessarily a bad thing <p/> Do not be afraid if you do not know everything at the beginning, if you do not know your way around, if you feel helpless. The child has everything it needs to awaken the right response in the parents. A child's nature is made to ""teach"" parents. You can only become a mother and a father by your child's side from moment to moment, not in advance or with the help of a book. As the child develops, so you develop with him as a father and as a mother. That is why the first condition for this development is precisely physical presence. Even if the mother develops a strong contact with the child, the father will have to develop his contact with the child from the beginning, not from where the mother came from. <p/> It is not at all good for the child to have a mother and father who think that they have to do everything right and that they are doing as it says in the book, not as it is written in the concrete child. There is only so much contact with the child before the parents have to develop new ideas, new words, coaxing, comforting and playfulness around the child. The child likes parents who are distracted and learning on the fly, and it is best for the child if the parents acknowledge this helplessness and confusion and know for each other that they can only manage what is emerging on the fly. A child does not need ideal parents, but parents with whom he or she can observe how they invent, how they create, how they find their way. It is a very good feeling for a child to feel that his parents are developing alongside him, that they are changing alongside him, not that they were perfect to begin with, so it is up to him to adapt to them as quickly as possible. <p/> Talk and cooperate! <p/> It is important for the child that the father is happy, that he has a lot of energy, that he is glowing, that she can feel in his eyes that he is alive. This means that he needs to talk to his wife about his fears and insecurities, so that they can talk together, figure out how to move forward together. The ability to confront feelings, to find new solutions, to be flexible and creative develops most easily where a man and a woman are safe around each other and do not make excuses for each other. Then the child will call out for more and more discoveries and will continually reward both father and mother with its own development. This will make them each feel adequate, creative and content, which in turn will help them to be more connected and trusting towards each other. Then both of them will be able to be more and more sensitive, relaxed and loving around the baby, and their relationship with each other will grow ""unintentionally"". <p/> Fatherhood and motherhood develop most fully where a man and a woman are able to work together. A man can only become a father when he has developed his masculine identity to the point where he feels what the child needs from him as a man. In cases where the father does not decide to become a father and does not enter the family emotionally and actively, and consequently the mother takes over the whole parenting role and tries to emotionally take over and fill the father's role as well, it quickly happens that she also loses contact with the children. Fatherhood is the father's sole responsibility and motherhood the mother's sole responsibility. We cannot destroy each other's parenthood, but we can make each other so bitter that we do not even want to look for a parental role anymore. That is an injustice to the child. Parents deserve to feel fully each other's parenthood, but even more deserve to feel that the child loves them and that they are capable of loving the child too. <p/> So let mothers be mothers and fathers be fathers.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

But it was crazy the year I dealt with it. I was the first one to find her and dig her out of oblivion. People knew her, some individuals, but I was the first to bring all the knowledge about her together in a documentary. Then they rushed after it, ""Oja"", they rushed. Feminists, actors, sociologists, literary historians... and they discovered her, it was a joy. But this has been happening to me all my life. I find someone or something, I introduce it to the public, and then everyone else takes credit. Because I'm an unambitious shit-baker from Svečina. <p/> Alma was then presented as a heroine, a theosophist, a traveller, a Nobel Prize candidate, blah, blah, blah. She was one confused lady who travelled around the world and kept yammering about why she was travelling around the world. Apart from that, she wrote badly, or rather mediocrely. And she made things up. And she was German and at least a little homosexual... For me, Alma will remain, the memory of the day when I was wandering around the ruins of her hut, there under the stumps of the Celje castle, and it was as if I was knee-deep in some strange, chaotic fate.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

213,"After two Mondays in a row what I promised myself not to get out of my head happened, I had to load too much and too little into my phone, into the target and past it, especially for you, instead of having a good read of the 5200 characters of a meaningful and concise summary, this time, just in case, I am starting to write on Sunday, 30. January at 7:15 pm at the ICSMC Office while an all-day meeting of anarchists is going on in the hall, who have asked me not to publish their photos because violent Nazis are searching for their faces on the web. <p/> The Carnian Outlaws are still retreating from the Cultural Pool after ten years of occupying this monument to the ruined social system of socialism. Behind the latter, Šulc sheds no tears. In a decisive internal document, the municipality of Kranj, and the people with names and surnames in it, judged the Pool to be a building fit for demolition, and this made the job of Gross, the representative of the land-owners, much easier. For the last two years, the Municipality has been RENTING a building built by self-managed labour from a ""generous"" representative of the entitled descendants for a large sum of money. This temporary unhealthy state of affairs has ended, the four-day over-the-top festival ""Dost mamo"" with the subtitle ""Izbruh's Last Pogo in the Swimming Pool"" has been survived by Šulc et al, and the property of the Izbruh Association is being moved to a warehouse, which, with luck, has been borrowed by a comrade. Gregor Kosi of the Bakery and I agree to convene the first meeting of the Pohorje Battalion in Kranj near Brdo and there let ourselves be irradiated by the facts and impressions of the freshly abandoned self-contained scene. In ten years of cultural struggles, at many hundreds of events, no one was killed and no one was wounded. Gregor and I are determined to drive the wedge that the Bakery Industry drove into the bottom of the Pool at the ""Slovenian Cultural Pig"" a few years ago. <p/> Franjo Frančič visited the MKSMC on Monday, bringing three books for our library that are being discarded by public libraries for lack of interest: the first is Dr. Franjo Derganec's memoir ""The Bloody Rose"", the second is Lad Ambrožić Novljan's ""March of the Fourteenth"", and the third is ""Radio Liberation Front"" by Jože Javoršek. Franjo was happy to see a good direction by Katja Peganova for his text. He was returning from Trieste where the premiere took place. He was constantly talking and hitting the nail on the head, describing today's youth as the wormy foundation of the future. He is happy that his daughter listens to Edot Maajko and he went to buy her ""Spomen ploćo"" for her birthday. <p/> On Monday, when I was ""like a sick shit"" (claims my wife Arijana) getting ready to report for four years of soft terrorism and to complete my report to the Youth Office, the top brass of the Likej Association came by, with Tonči Kuzmanić, let's say, at the head. I was unpleasantly surprised because Tonči does not see the unravelling or complication of the current issue of the municipality of Ankara as clear proof that the right and the left are united, because it is about the interests of Capital or the Port of Koper. It seems quite obvious to me that the parliamentary parties are in no hurry to comply with the will of a few thousand citizens, never mind the millions of euros that the Port of Koper brings in. Tonči has been incomprehensibly reticent in his assessment of the matter. His first reaction was that he did not know enough about the matter. <p/> On Tuesday, I met with a lover of tidiness and efficient use of time and space, Simon Kardum, at the Kino Šiška. He was accompanied by his henchman Manček, who some time ago lectured me to be ashamed of myself for putting myself at the head of the Youth Field NGO Foundation at the age of sixty. There will be nothing of Brecljevanie in Šiška, but on 9 March this year, in the cathedral, which is by no means a public cultural trough, there will be a multimedia event ""Feu Marko Brecelj"" with a performance by a second-hand singer-songwriter, video projections and performances by DPZN. The subtitle of the event is ""For the second time, for the first time at Kino Šiška"". The first time I performed there with the Bulldozers was in 1975 at the Golden M. We did a performance called ""Day of Disease"" and we called it ""Ashes and Leukaemia"". <p/> On Wednesday, during the day, we sent out the Doganetta ""Judgement in the name of the people"", and in the evening, Franci Blašković presented an excellent CD ""Kobra je u brajdi"" at the Kabina Gallery, and one with which he is not satisfied: ""Ipak je lepiej travu pušiti nego Gori uši slušati"". On the night of Wednesday to Thursday I had no choice: I plunged myself into slow and mind-numbingly weak reporting for the aforementioned reputable institutions. I smoked French cigarettes exceptionally during this effort. The substantive report for the four-year soft terrorism programme may be of interest to some. It will be published at www.dodogovor.org. <p/> On Thursday morning the MKSMC came to do electrical measurements and came across a sleepless man from Klanec. I immediately called their boss and ""dropped"" Supervisor Vid and Supervisor Samuel on him at ten o'clock. These two young members of ours described and listed in detail the oversights and negligence of his unforgettable contractors, headed by the palm buyer Danjel. That afternoon Dr Vlasta Jalušić gave a lecture on ""History, Politics, Law / Rights: Hegel"" in the MKSMC hall but unfortunately I was unable to attend due to the unavoidable financial part of the report to the Youth Office. It was super fine, I was half out of my mind. And at the end, cinema! Vid spun us the US-Argentine 35 millimeter too crime flick ""Our Father"" (""Padre nuestro""). <p/> On Friday, when I was quite euphoric from nine hours of sleep, Arijana started to sweat and immediately gave me a dramatic ultimatum. The nine formerly thick white envelopes with slips of paper, receipts, lists and now and then even notes, which had been (briefly) waiting in the top left inside pocket of my jacket for eight months to three weeks to be counted and sorted out by me, had to go immediately on the table and into the sunlight and under the magnifying glass. Some of the receipts for the June Friendship Offensive were barely legible with a magnifying glass and a good deal of imagination, and one no longer had a speck of colour on it. At the time of writing, the contents of all the envelopes have been examined three times, the worn envelopes have been replaced with new ones, and things have been tidied up and sorted out in my pocket and in my head. The anarchists left two hours ago, the kitchen is left in order, Teja and Luka have cleaned the floor! Cha, cha, cha, cha. <p/> Vid has just embedded an audio recording of Friday's meeting with the initiative groups organising the concerts on the Dodogovor website archive (Sunday, 30 January 2011 at 23:20). It's not short and it's mostly me speaking. I had so much to say about our twenty years of fighting against the wind and the reasons for the decision to freeze the DPZN co-organisation in February and March. You are welcome to listen! It is better for you if you give it up. Only then don't bring out the insulting, yellow details of my truthful and righteous sub-pedagogical fabrications. We're already at six thousand seven hundred characters, the situation is alarming, my sturdy editor Boris Vasev is looking at his watch, and there's just this: on Saturday twenty of us watched a good Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", Vid was baking popcorn, and Tomi suggested a hip hop concert by the uncontrolled in the last days of February. Who are the Uncontrolled? They are Slovenian citizens without controlled origins: mainly Bosnians, blacks, American women under Triglav. I have long been urging them to come to MKSMC to prepare something, which of course Breclj with his negative karma could not manage! But 23 year old semi-controlled Tommy, the president of the ""KAM"" association, managed to do it. When we are allowed to vote in Koper, he will stand as an independent candidate. Vote for him!

215,"Today, the Minister of Culture, Majda Širca, opened the exhibition Drawing in Slovenia II 1940-2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Zagreb, which presents the works of around 100 Slovenian artists. It is a selection of drawings from the exhibition of the same name, which was held last year at the City Gallery of Ljubljana. <p/> Drawing is one of the most daring, challenging and exciting genres within the field of art, because it confronts us with a very demanding and responsible gesture that we must not miss, a gesture that is unique and which, on the other hand, is often a matrix, a basis or a point of departure for other artistic practices, Širčeva said about the importance of drawings. These, she believes, have been lost, especially today, in the many postmodernist artistic genres. <p/> She stressed the importance of the exhibition for Slovenian art, as well as the outstanding cooperation with Croatia in the field of culture. The Croatian Minister of Culture, Bozo Biskupic, also pointed out at the opening that the Slovenian exhibition is a celebration of community and mutual understanding. He recalled that the three giants of Slovenian and European art - Zoran Mušić, Gabriel Stupica and Marij Pregelj - are a symbol of a common cultural centre, having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. <p/> It is the drawings of this trio that open the exhibition, said its curator and art historian Aleksandar Bassin, who said that drawing has never been a trendy exclusive. The exhibition, he said, is arranged according to the artists' ages, not their works. After the three artists mentioned, the works of selected artists follow, from sculptors and printmakers to painters of the middle generation. <p/> In the last part of the exhibition, there are young people who were born in the 1970s or 1980s, and it is they who, according to Bassin, most express the future of drawing, which is consciously and unencumbered living its full artistic life. <p/> Until 21 September, drawings created in various artistic techniques will be on display, providing both a representative insight into Slovenian artistic drawing of the last 70 years and the continuity of drawing as an independent chapter of Slovenian fine art. <p/> The Zagreb exhibition is also accompanied by a comprehensive monograph with interpretative critical commentaries on each artist.",News,train

218,"Happy hillbillies at the Philharmonic! <p/> 09 Apr 2012 <p/> There is a lot to learn from all history, including folk-music history. There is only one aspect to this: whether the musician has something to gain from the experience of others, or whether he or she has simply stood still all his or her life. A shining example of how wide one should spread one's wings is the Veseli Hribovci ensemble from Ljubljana. <p/> Veseli hribovci was active for twenty years, led by the academically trained musician Stane Žnuderl, who was usually also the author of the music and lyrics, and who always ensured a high level of performance for those times.The ensemble was extremely popular both in Slovenia and abroad (in the German-speaking area, of course, it was called Die lustigen Bergsteiger), and it also performed in the most important Slovene cultural centres, and it was always in search of the new, the different, the original. Although the Merry Hillmen appeared on the then Radio Ljubljana only in 1959, they had already played two years earlier, but without radio ambitions. The very origins of the ensemble are interesting. They performed the operetta Na planincah naszych (On Our Mountains) at the KUD Vič in Ljubljana, for which the libretto was written by Miha Kunaver and the Veseli hribovci leader Stane Žnuderl wrote the music. When I met him a few times, he always got very angry at such memories, because he could not understand that some radio and television editors, who get their salaries from RTV subscriptions, cannot or will not listen to their listeners. But he also got angry at the idea that there was nothing wrong with local music, it just needed to be brought up to the right level. It was the quality of the music that made the Merry Hills people one of the first to appear on the radio programme Thursday Evening of Local Songs and Hymns, as guests on the first television programmes and on many radio programmes in the field. Back then, it was also the case that the editors of other programmes tried to bring the most popular groups, especially folk-entertainment groups, to the field. Žnuderl was fond of telling anyone who disparaged local music: ""We also performed at the Slovenian Philharmonic, where we - probably one of the few, if not the only ones - played no less than seven polkas and waltzes. And live, in front of the TV cameras. I myself began by whistling the entire first movement of one of my compositions, which created a real enthusiasm among the audience. ""The Merry Mountaineers were among the first to follow the Avseniks across national borders, which were still very closed at that time. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, they always sang in Slovene. On the other hand, they were so inventive that they performed the song dedicated to the town of Kindberg in both languages and gave the notes to the mayor of the town. Although at that time we were still seen by many as part of the underdeveloped Balkans, this approach convinced everyone and opened the way forward. It is no wonder that the Merry Hillmen recorded 78 songs for German-speaking audiences. And thanks to Žnuderl, they were always among those at home who were looking for a new expression. They were probably the first to add zithers to a quintet in one of their songs, Peter Ambrož, a member of the Slovenian Octet, sang with the Veseli hribovci, and they recorded a large vinyl album with the Stari Ljubljančani, legendary singers, including the Lumbar brothers, members of what were probably the most popular radio singers of the time, the Fantje na vasi (Boys in the Village). To put it another way: Stane Žnuderl never slept on the laurels of his first successes, but always tried to add something new and original to the new ones, and the quintet itself was set up in such a way that it was recognisable from afar. The release of each of their new albums was a great event, as was each public performance. On top of that, the Veseli hribovci from Ljubljana were also good-hearted. They donated a sum that was seven times Žnuderl's professor's salary for the construction of their home in Debele Rtič. It means that all the musicians really had a good heart and that their basic mission was not - as in many cases today - just to make sure that they performed as much as possible for the sake of earning money, everything else being of secondary importance.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

226,"A BLUE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> DADS IN THE COURT <p/> The clock was already close to 00 when I was watching a film in the kitchen. Occasionally I heard a noise in the yard. It was in the form of some sort of shuffling, of harder objects in a crate or in a sack. It was getting more and more intense, it was pulling my firbec to lift my ass off the bench. At first I was eavesdropping by the balcony door in the dark. Then I tiptoed out onto the balcony and hid behind the longest parts of the yawn that was drying. <p/>The shifting stopped periodically as if eavesdropping on me. It was clear to me that someone was in the shuppa where it was as dark as a tunnel. The night was also dark. My vivid imagination had sketched the robber to perfection, poking at the punks. What should I do? I'm not going down there. <p/> I slowly open the balcony door again and explain to the hinges that they wouldn't dare to make any treacherous noises. And towards the living room, to my son who was at the computer, I call psssss psssss psssss psssss. I hinted as quietly as I could to my son that there was a thief in the yard. I couldn't hear myself very well, because I was talking so quietly, expecting my son to hear me. When I had talked him out of it, he came out onto the balcony. <p/> Now we were both eavesdropping on the robber. I confess that the trousers of my tracksuit were shivering. I can't imagine what a scream I would have let out if something had, um... <p/> You wait here, says my son. I was so hard with fear that I didn't know whether he was going to wake up Father Key. Or was I going to face the robber who was still robbing. I kept my eyes on the yard, so I wouldn't miss anything, so I would turn on the light at the right time, so I would shout at the right time,... I thought about what I would have to do. <p/> I see something white in the open. I was shocked at first. I couldn't believe it, but it was what I was seeing. It just popped into my head. What I saw were the underpants of my father. All the other bare skin merged with the darkness. Bravely, that's what, the barefoot went towards the shupi. My son and I looked at each other. I thought I would put my fist in my mouth if I had to, because at this time I couldn't afford to let out an animal scream. <p/> Finally, the brave ata shone his torch towards the point from where the thieving rattling was coming. Out comes a cat. <p/> A PALE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> Today I guess it must have been 68 when I assess Marjetka's age and what she remembered most. I compare her with my children when they were her age. I must remember to be more lenient with her, because I know that she and her mother lived on the margins of society and that affected everyone. They were brought so far by Mariette's father, who was dominated and ruled by alcohol until it drove him to his grave. It was not difficult to clear out the fridge and the wardrobes of clothes, slippers and shoes because there was still enough empty space. Mum did her best, but it was still small and tiny. My place is different today, better, but in the flood of everything in the shops, it gets lost in the lack of space. <p/> Marjetka already knew how to walk and didn't know where she and her mother were going until they entered through the entrance into a narrow hall, with tables covered with tablecloths and children, and Santa Claus sitting at the front. She might have heard of him, but this was the first time she had seen him. White-cell lanterns hung from the ceiling, filling the room with a yellow glow. I don't know how she managed to reach for the bag, which contained a pair of one-fingered gloves in sky-blue, with a white furry border at the wrist. She doesn't remember how she found her mother when it was over. But she remembers the warm gloves on her hands when they went home. <p/> Today she would like to know which good fairy gave her the gift of seeing Father Frost for the first time, she still wears those mittens in her heart, and her heart still sits on the little stool at the coffee table, timidly drinking tea from a cup. She would like to visit that aunt or uncle and thank them for their kindness in opening the joy in her heart, which, like a faded mural on the wall in December, breathes in the colours of memory. She worries if she or he would understand how much it would mean to her to see the kindness in her or his eyes and to be told that her mother would not be able to take her and she would be left without the memory of Santa Claus. <p/> EROTIC FANTASIES <p/> The windows were wide open, cooling the cramped room. The curtains with embroidered cranes allowed the presence of the moon to be felt in the room with open mouths. She stopped under the beam. A fluttering inside her body, like the underflutter of a butterfly's wings she had caught while riding a swaying bus. It awakened stocked desire and submerged waves, unexpectedly dug up and stirred. <p/>""Oh, those wooden seats,"" Olla groaned, looking towards the moon and letting her thoughts escape back to the experience of the ride. Pressing down on the hard seat, she felt a volcano awakening from the forest and a star tunnel opening. Each press brought a firmer embrace of warmth. The wood cooled her thighs, which were massaged by the rhythmic rocking, stopping, accelerating. Occasionally she squeezed her thighs, wanting more... Her eyes caught the fading landscape and suddenly she stood up as if the chair was too hot and walked to the door. She got off the bus, which had fewer passengers at each stop. <p/> A strange new feeling seeped into her from the strangers on the other side of the road and who surrounded her in front of the pedestrian crossing. The eye-contact as they passed each other frightened her, lest she betray them. <p/> ""What would I betray? ""to long for. ""But it's not written on my forehead,"" her thoughts argue and protest. <p/> She could hardly wait to step into the hall and cross the wooden stairs. She ran the last ten and rushed for the door as if someone was chasing her. She unlocked and locked it behind her. She hung the bag from her shoulder on the coat rack in the wardrobe. <p/> She went into the room and stood under the moonbeam. They would be alone this evening and night, as the folks back home were still enjoying their vacation when she had to get to work. She blinked and lifted her head to feel the caress. She covered her face with her right hand and stroked her hair from her forehead over the temples and down to the nape of her neck. She touched her cheek and face to the soft part of the raised hand, increasing the pressure of the touch. She stood with her chin resting on her chin. Her left hand, fingers spread, stroked across her stomach to her right hip and back. She was becoming more demanding, encircling now one ample breast and returning to the other. She lifted her head up and offered her neck to the moon beam to caress it. She turned her head to the right and left to receive more moonlight. The fingers of her right hand began to undo the tiny buttons on her white shirt. The blouse landed, on the floor by her bare feet, with her bra on top of it. Her left hand slipped out, the pads sliding slowly, over the hot soft skin of her breast. The nipples tensed, calling out to play the strings of the harp. The awakened strings tensed and waited for the others to play in the sounds of love and acceptance of the naked body. The long hair used up the nakedness of her back and caressed it as she moved her head gently left and right. The pads of her fingers threw away their inhibitions and caressed her body with the lightness of a delicate feather. They freed themselves from the rest of the laundry that had landed on the parquet floor. Pulled the linen sheet from the bed, wrapped and unwrapped herself as her hands danced around her naked body, exposing it to the moon and covering it. The warm skin called out for heat, for shit... She knelt at the foot of the bed and crawled like a cat to the middle. The two breasts danced, and with her right hand she took their weight away and squeezed them to her body. She moved towards the navel and the volcano, waiting impatiently for the eruptions. The star tunnel tingled pleasantly. She lowered her warm body onto the bed, cooling it just enough to make the anticipation grow. She let go of the weight of her body to feel its lightness. Turned onto her back, then onto her stomach, letting the pads wander and explore, letting the strings strain one after the other. The heart yearned, chased and gasped for air and acceptance. The heat was smouldering and ignited the eruption of a volcano. The body was engulfed by wild waves and enveloped in majesty.",Prose/Lyrical,train

This was the first year of the new term of office of the bodies of the Association and the 22nd year since the founding of the Association. <p/> Of course, we remained true to our mission. Raising awareness among the membership and the general population about the importance of cardiovascular disease prevention has been, is and will continue to be a constant feature of our work. <p/> The reports were adopted unanimously by the branch representatives present. <p/> In short, we can report that we have achieved most of the tasks we set ourselves in our work programme. <p/> We would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovations that have marked the Slovenian prevention scene, in particular the measurement of the ankle-brachial index, the atrial fibrillation prevention programme, for which we have been awarded a global prize since the end of 2011, and the establishment of the 25 × 25 network of NGOs in the field of public health. All three of these innovations have been widely covered by the Slovenian media. We carried out all the well-known preventive measurements and added venous plethysmography, helped several thousand people with various advice, and organised many interesting lectures and workshops. <p/> The magazine For the Heart has been our hallmark for the past year. We are proud of all 7 issues and also at the AGM we thanked the editorial board headed by Prof. Dr. Ales Blinec, MD. <p/> We organised many hikes, excursions and other forms of recreation. If we were to add up all the kilometres walked by our hikers and walkers, we would come up with a big number. <p/> The World Heart Day events started with a march in Novo mesto and continued with events in various places around Slovenia, with the main event taking place at the BTC in Ljubljana. <p/> It is also worth remembering Melodies for the Heart.

248,"We women love make-up and we love to go to the chemist for a new eye shadow and spend a fraction of our salary on a new powder. But all that money can be thrown away if we don't use a proper, good quality brush that is designed for the task we are using it for. One look at the wide range of brushes on offer can be confusing for even the most skilled in the art of make-up artistry. So which brushes to choose? <p/> The quality of the brush depends on the quality of the bristles used. Although you might think that natural bristles are the best, this is often not the case. When buying natural brushes, we need to know what kind of hair they are. Often animals are even killed just for their hair. The best brushes are those made from hair that has only been shaved off, preferably the first time. The second clipping still leaves the top of the hair clipped and therefore sharp. Of course, you can also choose synthetic brushes, but these are mainly used for applying foundation and concealer. Artificial bristles harden over time, while natural bristles become softer. <p/> Foundation brush <p/> If you want velvety skin, invest in a good foundation brush. This will cover imperfections better and more accurately and, above all, when applying a liquid foundation, it will smoothly blend with sponges and fingers. <p/> Kabuki <p/> These little brushes are packed with bristles. They are perfect for applying mineral make-up. Make-up applied with these brushes is applied in thicker layers due to the large number of hairs in the brush. <p/> Concealer brush <p/> There are several types of concealer brushes, but they are usually a smaller version of the foundation brush, making it easier to apply concealer precisely to areas around the eyes, pimples and other imperfections. If you apply concealer with a brush, it will last longer than if you apply it with your fingers, as the latter way of applying the concealer mixes with the oil on your fingers. <p/> Fan brush <p/> Fan brushes are used when you want to apply a small amount of foundation - for example, on areas where your skin is oily and shiny. Because of its specific shape, we need to choose a brush that keeps its shape. <p/>Blush Brush <p/>This is a special brush that is used to precisely blend and highlight the cheekbones. It can also be used to sweep away bits of eye shadow that have fallen onto the face during application. The brush must be large enough to cover the entire part of the face to be shaded in one stroke.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

Ahead of a crucial negotiating phase in the coalition talks, she stressed that she was ready to compromise and estimated that the Social Democrats (SPD) would not sign the coalition agreement if it did not contain a deal on the introduction of a minimum wage. <p/> According to Merkel, ""a grand coalition is not a politician's heart's desire"". But the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the SPD must respect the will of the electorate, she said. <p/> ""The Social Democrats will not conclude negotiations without a legally defined universal minimum wage,"" Merkel said, according to the French news agency AFP.

Merkel insists that a deal is possible. ""We will see in the next few days if we succeed. ""According to the Chancellor, the coalition treaty should stand next Wednesday. <p/> According to the negotiators, there are still more than 100 policy areas open.

256,"Mole <p/> Mole <p/> The common or European mole (scientific name Talpa europaea) is a species of insectivore adapted to life underground. It rarely comes to the surface except during dry periods when it goes in search of water. Signs of its presence are moles. <p/> Mole shrews are active both during the day and at night, constantly searching for food. They dig tunnels at different depths. If the tunnel is just below the surface, it starts to throw soil to the surface, creating a mole. The tunnels can be 30 to 50 metres long. When looking for food, it runs through the tunnels for four hours and then rests for the same amount of time. Although the tunnels of different moles may be intertwined, they avoid each other, especially outside mating season. If they do meet, a fierce fight ensues, which can lead to death. Scientists hypothesise that moles also mark their territory by scent-marking the ground from the musk glands located on their abdomens. It is only during mating season that the male seeks out the female. After mating, the male leaves the female to care for the young. <p/> It feeds mainly on earthworms, although it will not give up insects and snails. The mole needs a lot of food and eats half its own weight daily. The greyhound does not have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, but can still detect food and water at long distances. Because it lives underground in the dark, it does not need good eyesight. However, it has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect very faint vibrations. Its muzzle is covered with hairs, which help it to find prey. The mole has more sense organs than any mammal. We know very little about its sense organs. Because they cause damage to meadows and fields, farmers often kill them. <p/> The mating season of moles is very short. The male seeks out the female underground, where they mate. The male then leaves the female and is no longer interested in the fetus. Gestation lasts for one month. Three or four young are born between May and July in a nest for which the female has built a special room. They are naked when they are born, but after 24 days they have grown fur. They can leave the nest after 35 days to find their own territory. <p/> Protection <p/> In Slovenia, moles are protected and deterrents are used to combat them. We have developed an extremely effective and natural deterrent, Celaflor Mole Repellent, in the form of beads with the active ingredient methylnonylon ketone. It is completely harmless to humans and animals. It is important to follow the instructions on the product and to allow the mole to escape from your garden (do not fence the garden on all sides with beads).",Information/Explanation,train

259,"Baselines. Psychiatric patients, and especially alcoholics, are subject to stigmatisation, negative social perceptions and prejudices. The aim of our study was to examine the stigmatization and self-stigmatization of alcoholics in our cultural setting comparatively with regard to gender, alcohol consumption, alcoholic identity, age and educational structure. <p/>Methods. We used a semi-structured questionnaire with items related to different social perceptions regarding alcoholics. Respondents (n = 337) were sampled in an Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary and two general/family medicine outpatient clinics. Data were processed using t-test and factor analysis. <p/>Results. Women had more negative perceptions and more empathy towards alcoholics, men were more lenient and lacked empathy towards addicts, people with no identity as an alcoholic had more negative perceptions, both negative and positive perceptions loaded more with age, and both negative and positive perceptions loaded less and empathic perceptions of alcoholics loaded more with higher education. <p/>Conclusions. In our cultural environment, the stigmatization of alcoholics is very high and stronger than self-stigmatization. With higher education, it fades. Therapists involved in the treatment of alcoholics have had to revise our own perceptions of the stigmatisation of our patients, which will also influence our therapeutic approach. <p/>From social psychology comes the theoretical knowledge of implicit perceptions that we are rarely aware of, but which nevertheless have a profound influence on our behaviour and attitudes towards other people. Kelly observed that if we have dual information about people, we first follow our first impression and the information we have received from others. These perceptions give rise to prejudice, which is negative ideas about other people.1 The theory of social perceptions was pioneered by Moscovici in 1961.2 They represent the social knowledge of a group of people: a system of ideas, values and behavioural patterns that facilitates communication between members of the same group.3 Social perceptions are the basis for individual thinking and knowledge and are the result of an ongoing dialogue between members of the same group.4 They are the basis of attributions about how we understand other people's behaviour.5 Research on adult populations has pointed to three different conclusions about the stigma of mental disorders.6 The first is that people with mental disorders are more stigmatised than people with physical illnesses, and that those who abuse alcoholic beverages are more stigmatised than people with mental disorders. Another finding is that stereotypes associate mental disorders with irresponsibility and danger in individuals, leading to negative emotional reactions and discriminatory behaviour. The third finding is that personal knowledge of mentally disordered individuals reduces stigma. It also identifies discrimination due to self-stigmatisation.7 The character of the drinker is inferred from the drinker's behaviour under the influence of alcohol. The more he or she drinks, the stricter our judgement. Although we often stigmatise drinkers who drink larger quantities of alcoholic beverages, we often perceive them to be more cheerful. Our own drinking habits have a big influence on our judgement. Thus, heavy drinkers do not judge other drinkers as strongly as moderate drinkers or teetotalers.8 The aim of the present study is to determine social perceptions of alcoholics both in the general population and among alcoholics, and to identify differences in perceptions according to drinking patterns, age, gender and education. Our working hypotheses were that self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than that of non-problem drinkers and that stigmatisation by relatives is milder than that by those who have no experience of living with an alcoholic. <p/> Methods <p/> Sample <p/> A questionnaire was distributed to patients in three outpatient clinics. The first group of patients was a group of alcohol-dependent patients and their relatives who are under treatment in the Dispensary for the Treatment of Alcoholism and Other Addictions at the Dr. Adolf Drolc Health Centre in Maribor. The other two groups of patients were sampled consecutively in two general medicine outpatient clinics from the same health centre. One outpatient clinic was selected in the city centre, the other in Lovrenec na Pohorju. In total, 337 completed questionnaires were obtained. 149 men and 188 women completed them. The whole sample was divided several times into several subgroups, which were then compared with each other. 146 of them had the experience of living with a person who is dependent on alcohol. 60 were alcohol dependent and 49 were alcohol abusers. In terms of educational structure, most of them had a vocational education (71 or 21.1%), a secondary education (88 or 26%) and a higher education (98 or 29.1%). The mean age of the subjects was 41.4 years + 13.9 years. The group sampled at the Alcoholism and Other Drug Treatment Dispensary included 11 alcoholics who had been in treatment for less than six months and 31 who had been in treatment for six months or more. The results of their relatives' group were added to a group of people from the general population who answered yes to the question whether anyone in their family was a frequent drinker. <p/> Instrument <p/> Description of the instrument <p/> We constructed an instrument containing independent variables (sex, age, education, family history of binge drinking, whether someone is a recovering alcoholic), 44 items relating to perceptions of alcohol dependence (a five-point scale of agreement), three open-ended statements to be completed (a test of incomplete sentences), and six questions testing attitudes towards drinking. The instrument is reproduced in full in the Annex. <p/> Validity and reliability <p/> The rational validity of the questionnaire was obtained on account of the broad coverage of views (interviewing professionals involved in the treatment of alcohol dependence, interviewing alcohol dependents and people in frequent contact with alcohol dependents [ waitresses ]), the theoretical background on stigmatisation and self-stigmatisation of addicts6-8 and the three experts who analysed the individual items. Factor analysis was used for empirical validity. We extracted five factors which explain 45.14% of the variance. Factor 1 - "" Factor of strongly negative attitudes "" explains 19.16% of the variance, Factor 2 - "" Factor of positive attitudes "" explains 9.50% of the variance, Factor 3 - "" Factor of empathy towards alcoholics "" explains 7.27% of the variance, Factor 4 - "" Factor of empathic attitude "" explains 5.24% of the variance, and Factor 5 - "" Factor of personal accountability and negative perceptions "" explains 3.99% of the variance. External validity was not established because we did not have a pre-existing instrument measuring attitudes towards alcohol dependence. Reliability analysis was carried out using Crombach's coefficient a. This was 0.859, indicating exemplary reliability.9 Item-by-item reliability analysis was also carried out. We found that the reliability of the instrument could have been improved slightly if five items had been dropped, but we decided to keep them as they were items relating to empathy, which was of interest to us in the study. On a smaller sample (n = 20), we further tested the reliability by means of a test-retest method and checked for correlation. <p/> Statistical analysis <p/> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-11.5 and SPSS-13.0 statistical packages. We were interested in statistically significant differences between the independent variables, considering significant differences at p &lt; 0.05. Comparisons were made using t-test for independent samples and analysis of variance. Factor analysis was also performed. We used the Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) method and the Oblimin oblique rotation method. <p/> Results <p/> Comparison of item differences by gender <p/> Statistically significant differences were found for as many as 20 social perceptions. In the whole sample, women gave more value to negative perceptions (destroying families, aggressive, annoying, would betray and sell everything for alcohol), more to empathic perceptions (seeking oblivion and comfort, not finding their own way out of a crisis, not being able to heal themselves), and a difference was also found for the item preferring to avoid it. Men in the whole sample gave more value to performances from which a defensive attitude could be seen (everyone has some form of addiction, everyone has a reason to get drunk, alcoholics are promiscuous as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they make me feel good about myself, they are cheerful, they put me in a good mood, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler), on the other hand, men are less empathetic (I don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance, an alcoholic is converted when he rolls in a pit), they are more likely to be labelled ""losers"", they are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease, and they are more likely to prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler than women. <p/> Differences are present for only two items in the whole sample. Alcoholics are preferred by those without experience of living with an alcoholic, and those with experience place more value on the notion that alcoholism is a genetically determined, hereditary disease. <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the rating of being harmful or dependent on alcohol <p/> Differences between these two subgroups of the total sample are present for eight items. People who drink harmfully were more likely to describe alcoholics negatively than alcoholics themselves (they use alcohol as an excuse to fail, they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative), they have no empathy for alcoholics (they don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance), even though they prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler (they do not care about them, they should pay more for health insurance). Alcohol-dependent people gave more value to the item that it makes them feel bad to see others making fun of alcoholics and that alcoholics feel guilty about their own dependence. <p/> Comparison of item differences on problem drinking <p/> Differences between the subgroups of the full sample are present for nine items. People who were harmful or dependent on alcohol gave higher scores to items that showed leniency towards the dependent and a defensive attitude (everyone has a reason to drink as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, they put me in a good mood, they make me feel good about myself, everyone has some form of dependence, alcohol is a hereditary disease). People without a problematic attitude towards drinking gave higher value to two items (they are bad guys and I prefer to avoid it). <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the presence of an alcoholic identity <p/> Differences are present for six items. People in the treatment programme with an alcoholic identity gave higher values to items with an empathic perception of alcoholics (they have feelings of guilt, it makes me feel bad when others make fun of them) and to the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, while people without this identity gave higher values to items with a negative label (they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative, they use alcohol as an excuse to fail). <p/> Comparison of item differences by age <p/> The total sample was divided into three groups: young people up to 29 years (n = 74), people between 30 and 59 years (n = 220) and people aged 60 and over (n = 39). There was a statistically significant difference for 12 items. For the six items with negative social perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they are weak, neglectful and intrusive, and they don't care), the value of the items increases with age everywhere. The three items with positive perceptions (as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are cheerful, they make me feel good about myself) have the same trend of increasing value with increasing age. Similarly with the item ""I don't care about them"". The item that alcoholism is a response to inner distress was given the highest values by middle-aged people and the lowest values by the oldest generations. For the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, the highest values were given by the oldest and the lowest by the youngest people. <p/> Comparison of item differences by education <p/> The educational structure of the total sample was divided into three groups: people with incomplete, completed primary school and vocational secondary school (n = 107), people with completed secondary school (n = 88) and people with completed higher and university education (n = 128). Statistically significant differences are present for 22 items. All negative perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are annoying and disrespectful, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they allow themselves too much, they should be treated against their will, they are neglectful, they are disruptive and pushy, alcoholics are promiscuous, they don't care, they are guilty of addiction themselves) are lower in people with higher education and highest in people with the lowest education. Similarly, positive perceptions (everyone has a reason to get drunk as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler, they give me a sense of self-satisfaction, everyone has some form of addiction). Items expressing empathy (I feel sorry for them, I feel bad when others make fun of them) have the reverse trend - higher values at higher education levels. ""I don't care about them"" has the highest weighting for the lowest educated and the lowest for the highest educated. ""Alcoholism is a hereditary disease"" has the highest value in the lowest educated group. <p/> Fig. 1. Differences on the first factor between the subgroup of alcoholics in treatment for less than 6 months (SOA &lt; 6 months), alcoholics in treatment for more than 6 months (SOA &gt; 6 months) and the group of people with no alcoholic identity (control group). <p/>Factor analysis of the sample <p/>The value of the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sample adequacy (0.828) and the result of the Bartlett test (p = 0.000) indicate that there is a significant association between the variables. Five factors were taken into account, together explaining 45.2% of the variance. The first factor explains 19.2% of the variance. It is occupied by strongly negative social perceptions (they are disruptive and intrusive, violent and arrogant, neglectful, annoying and disrespectful, calculating and exploitative, they are wrinkles, they do not care, alcoholics are promiscuous, they would sell and betray everything, they are bad people, they should be treated against their will and they should pay more for health insurance). The second factor explains 9.5% of the variance and is occupied by positive perceptions of alcoholics (they are happy as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they give me a sense of satisfaction with myself, I prefer them to teetotalers and everyone has a reason to get drunk). The third factor (7.3% of the variance) is occupied by the items of empathic attitudes towards alcoholics (alcoholism is a response to inner distress, I feel bad when others make fun of them, they are victims of childhood, they pity me, they cannot find their own way out of the crisis, they cannot cure themselves, they have feelings of guilt about their addiction). The fourth factor (5.2% of the variance) is occupied by the empathic attitude items, which have a negative loading, which can be understood as a refusal to establish an empathic relationship with them (they feel that nobody likes them, that they are looked down upon, that everybody hates them, they seek oblivion and comfort in alcohol). The fifth factor (4.0% of the variance) is occupied by two negative items that are not as negatively emotionally charged as the items in the first factor (they destroy families, they are unreliable) and two items that attribute personal responsibility for the onset of dependence. Again, there were differences between the groups. Women significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than men (p = 0.000), similarly, people who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the first factor than alcoholics (p = 0.047), and people with a problematic drinking pattern loaded more heavily on the second factor than people with a neutral attitude towards drinking. The unstructured part of the questionnaire asked for three follow-up thoughts. The first was: ' When I think of a person who is dependent on alcohol, I think of... "", the second: "" When I think of a person dependent on alcohol, I feel ..."". and the third: "" If the alcohol-dependent person were my son, I would ..."". The first question was most frequently answered with family in 15, the second with sadness (11.6), fear (9.2), anxiety (8.3), sympathy (7.1%) and anger (6.5%), and the third with motivation for treatment (37.4%) and help (24.3%). The only statistically significant difference between these responses was in the second thought, where women were more likely to respond that they felt fear in themselves when they were with an alcoholic (p = 0.048). <p/> Discussion <p/> We found many statistically significant differences between the samples, but unfortunately we cannot discuss all of them here. Therefore, we will only highlight the most pronounced and surprising ones. Our hypothesis that the self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than the stigmatisation of people who are not problem drinkers has been shown to be false. It was influenced by our own narrow social perceptions, when the authors, as therapists in constant contact with sober alcoholics in the therapeutic process, seemed to have gradually lost our own prejudices against these people and inferred from them the perceptions of the general population. Thus, people who harm alcoholics label alcoholics more negatively and lack empathy towards them, which is understood as using their own defences in terms of projection and denial. They see in addicts their own path to alcoholism, their own projection into a future that they hate because they feel powerless to change that path. When they evaluate them, they are in a sense evaluating themselves. However, they, along with the addicts, still showed more leniency towards the alcohol-dependent than people with a neutral attitude towards alcohol, and they were significantly more likely to label alcoholics as bad guys. There was an even clearer difference between people with an alcoholic identity and those without. The former showed much more empathy towards alcoholics, while those without showed significantly more negative social perceptions and prejudices. Factor analysis confirmed these results. People who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the factor with negative items than alcoholics, and the same for women, among whom there is less problematic consumption of alcoholic beverages. On the other hand, people with a problematic attitude towards alcohol loaded more heavily on the factor with positive items than people without a drinking problem. An interesting result is provided by comparing people with an alcoholic identity: those in treatment for up to six months and those in treatment for more than six months. The former significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than the latter, indicating the influence of the treatment process in terms of alleviating prejudice and abandoning defensive attitudes: by accepting the identity of a treated alcoholic, they have less need to project negative self-images onto ""other"" alcoholics. Our second hypothesis was that relatives would have fewer prejudices against alcoholics than people without this experience. This hypothesis also proved to have no real basis in the sample comparison. The only differences between the two samples were that people without this experience prefer to avoid alcoholics rather than those with it, as evidenced by the sad experience in our Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary of seeing patients who repeat over and over again the well-established, albeit highly pathological and painful, life experiences of living with alcoholics, and that relatives of alcoholics are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease compared to people without this experience. This difference is probably due to the fact that many of the relatives have been involved in our treatment programmes and that many of the alcoholics in our programmes have had an alcoholic as a relative, so that through the education of the addicts and their relatives, this perception has settled in. The gender differences were interesting. On the one hand, women were typically more likely to have negative social perceptions of alcoholics, but at the same time showed more empathic perceptions towards them. The first part can be understood as a consequence of the fact that women are less likely to be alcohol dependent than men,10 which confirms the aforementioned fact that our hypothesis of greater self-stigmatisation was not supported by the evidence. The second part can be seen as a consequence of women's greater social orientation towards empathic perception of other people.11 For men, the responses were in the opposite direction: they showed a greater defensiveness towards (their own) addiction and a lack of empathic perception of alcoholics. Here we also encounter gendered social perceptions of how alcohol consumption is perceived by men and women, what are acceptable levels and forms of drunkenness. And here we meet strict women, guardians of the family order, peace and the nest, guardians of the circumstances in which children grow up and of family traditions. It is no coincidence that, alongside priests, teachers and doctors, it is women who have helped to build the anti-alcohol movement so enthusiastically, and who have constituted the majority of the membership of these movements.12, 13 Differences according to age have shown a trend towards increasing negative perceptions and prejudices, as well as positive perceptions of alcoholics, with a pronounced defensiveness. It can be concluded that at a younger age attitudes towards alcohol consumption are still relatively neutral, but as the years go by, due to the gradual accumulation of personal experience, more extreme views on addiction grow, both condemnation on the one hand and greater tolerance due to, we assume, a more defensive attitude due to one's own problematic attitude towards alcoholic beverages. Part of these differences can probably be attributed to the fact that first contact with alcoholic beverages is associated with a number of positive effects (validation and acceptance in the society of young people, alcohol as a help and as an alibi for social inadequacies). Negative social perceptions and prejudices correlate even more strongly with educational structure: negative perceptions are highest in the lowest educated group, but so are positive perceptions, presumably due to a higher level of own problematic attitudes towards drinking (alcoholics from the same background have a lower educational level than people from the general population14). On the other hand, higher educated people have a higher level of empathic perception of addicts. <p/> Annex: Questionnaire on perceptions of alcohol dependence <p/> Gender <p/> Age <p/> years. <p/> Education: <p/> incomplete primary school, primary school, vocational secondary school, secondary school, college, university. <p/> On a scale of 1 to 5, please indicate the number that best corresponds to your feelings: <p/> 1 - do not agree at all, 5 - strongly agree. <p/> 1. <p/> Everyone has a reason for getting drunk: social worries, work, family. <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 3 <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> - <p/> Do you drink alcoholic beverages practically every day? <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> Conclusions <p/> Our research has shown an alarming stigmatisation of alcoholics in our cultural environment. Thus, the factor with the highest factor loadings was the factor with negative perceptions of alcoholics, which explained 19.2% of the variance in the factor analysis. Otherwise, the study pointed to large gender, age and educational differences, which we had not expected. Thus, the authors were forced to change our own perceptions of how the wider social environment views alcoholism and the alcoholic. We believed that the environment was much more accepting of alcoholics and often interpreted alcoholics' fear of stigmatisation as an application of their own projections. We have now found that alcoholics' fears of wider social stigma are justified. Especially in the segment of the less educated and women. At this point, we can pause to ask whether the task of therapists working on alcohol dependence is also to change social perceptions of alcoholism. Where there is a lack of knowledge and knowledge, there is room for prejudice and stigmatisation, which is a natural social process. By changing social perceptions and destigmatisation, the authors suggest, social rehabilitation of alcoholics will have greater success and the prognosis for abstinence will be better. Because at present, sober alcoholics are generally more stigmatised after treatment than drunk alcoholics without an alcoholic identity.",Information/Explanation,train
261,"By testing the more widely used and cheaper car models, you are to a large extent influencing people's perceptions of them. How do you view this? We don't want to shape people's opinions on a particular model, because they are not presented from the point of view of 'buy this model, not this one, where this one is roomier, cheaper', etc. In each article we therefore also include inserts that have no prominent role with a particular model, an example of this is when we dropped a piano on the bonnet of a Porsche to see if it could withstand the amount of pressure it was put under. The aim here is just to arouse interest or it is a humorous insert. The programme is there to entertain the viewer, not to form an opinion about a model or a brand. There are other shows for that. <p/> How many people are involved in the production of Tope Gear? Not many. There are something like 10 people in the production team. The rest, like the cameramen and the support team, are on loan from the BBC. <p/>How do you keep things fresh and viewership at the level it is? That's the job of producer Andy Wilmon, who comes in before the start of each season and explains out loud everything we need to change to be different to previous seasons. We (the presenters) are not different because we don't want to change, even though we know that people get tired of things very quickly nowadays. But they still haven't got bored of Top Gear, which is good. And this difference between all the actors on the show brings back a sufficient amount of freshness, constancy and also humour, which the audience appreciates. <p/> The Stig. (Photo: BBC) <p/> The mystery surrounding the Stig probably contributes to this. How important is it for the show that it doesn't find out who it is? The Stig's role is one of the most important in the show, because it really reflects what it means to be a petrol head, but at the same time it's the mystery around his identity that brings that ""appeal"" to the audience. But the Stig is a nameless and faceless character who simply has to remain who he is. He also has the role of test driver, which is a constant, because after Jeremy tests the car and glides through the corner, ""power"", and James scrutinises the details of the finish and soundproofing, while he drives the Bugatti Veyron down the catwalk, it is this car that drives the test circuit and gives a perspective of the power and "" perfomance "" of the car even in time. <p/> Why is it that we never see you and the other presenters driving the car around the track on time? We have deliberately left this role of driving on time to the Stig, with the supercars, and to the guests on the show, with the "" average "" Kia. And that's why it's important that the Stig always stays the same, that the times are comparable, and that the guests are only competing with each other, not with us, because that's not the purpose of this part of the show. <p/> Which one of you would be the fastest if you did a lap with a Kia? Yeah, that would be interesting, but certainly not Jeremy, because he'd be going in a straight line all the time, and James doesn't know where the accelerator is anyway (laughs). So me. If you were reincarnated as a car, which model would be Clarkson and which would be you? Jeremy definitely thinks it would be a Bugatti Veyron or, as a classic, a Lamborghini mivra, but I see it as a V8 Holden because it's a model with a big, loud engine that's fast on the straights and slow in the corners because of the tail tiling (laughs). I see myself as a ""chunky"" 205 GTI pegueot, which, while it may not look like anything special, makes a good impression on the road or on a rally track.",Other,train

267,"Washington Post: Snowden reportedly caused less harm than initial estimates <p/> National Intelligence Director James Clapper has assessed that former National Security Agency (NSA) contract analyst Edward Snowden has caused less harm to US intelligence officials than initially estimated, according to the Washington Post. <p/> ""We are still assessing the damage, but it seems that he did not take away as much material as we first thought. There were a lot of things he could only look at, but he couldn't get them off the system,"" Clapper estimated on Thursday, speaking to the newspaper. He added that the damage was still extensive. <p/> US intelligence officials initially feared that Snowden had leaked data on the armed forces' command and control communications network. This was not to be the case. <p/> Since last year, Snowden has been making public embarrassing facts about the workings of US intelligence, from mass surveillance of Americans to eavesdropping on allied leaders and even economic espionage. <p/> All these publications have so far caused little embarrassment at the top of President Barack Obama's administration, but the essential damage is that the US is exposed as no better than, for example, China, which is regularly accused of hacking and spying. <p/> The US administration is not afraid of embarrassment, because it has already gone through this with the WikiLeaks releases. Intelligence officials are more concerned about whether Snowden might have taken something that could give other countries useful information about the workings of the military and spies. <p/> Clapper's assessment is probably very premature. The world's media have so far published only about 300 documents, Snowden is believed to have another 1.5 million in his possession, and his journalist friend Glenn Greenwald, through whom the documents are going to the media, promises that the saga will not be over so soon. <p/> There are therefore more than too many documents to continue negotiating Snowden's repatriation from Russia in a way that does not immediately put him behind bars. But the intelligence community and the government will first have to swallow their anger and resentment, and they are not yet ready to do so. Some politicians have branded him a traitor - and if he is also charged with treason, the death penalty is also on the table. (sta)",News,train
269,"Proposal for a Spatial Development Strategy (SPR) for the Municipality of Radovljica <p/> J.U.: On the margins of the public debate held on Wednesday, 10 January 2007 from 6 to 8 p.m. <p/> All municipalities in Slovenia are in the middle of a planning process. By July 2007, they should have brought their respective spatial planning acts, which are extremely complex in terms of procedure, into line with the new legislation. Since only a few municipalities are further along than ours (we are in the middle of the beginning), is it to be expected that either the deadline will be extended, or the government will just manage to do as much as it can, and finally, for once, reward those who can do it by the deadline, and the rest ...? <p/> Undoubtedly, these processes are and will be the first serious planning in more than 20 years, in other words: it is an extremely challenging undertaking for the administration, the general and interested public and the planning profession. Since 1980 (self-management), we have been ""tinkering"" with the spatial and environmental planning system on the basis of the non-market economy, which - surprisingly - has been quite good in some parts. <p/> As far as our municipality is concerned: need it be pointed out that the administration's management has approached the matter left-handed in terms of substance and procedure? It simply does not have the expertise in cases of major dilemmas! <p/> Yes, that's the way it is when bureaucrats ignore the rajas! All the indications are that this planning will receive the same treatment as the dog excrement ordinance, which is of course not news in Radovljica. Last night, the Director, in a low-key rhetoric, respectfully stressed the importance of the process and the document, but only actions count. <p/> Let us stress: <p/> everything in the municipality revolves around space. Other departments are also important, but not as fatal as encroachments. The only complete department of the municipal administration, staffed by professional, educated and administratively proficient employees, looks as if they have been successfully weaned off professionalism and accustomed to subservience to politicians, like the MOL, ""when everyone is busting their ass"". This is due to a misguided governmental logic (we are in charge now, if something is not right, we will show that this is the only possible and even the only right thing to do, that is why we have PR) and a touch of servility, only the first silence and eaten professionalism will suffice... <p/> The materials under discussion do not testify to the care of a good steward for the emerging creature, in fact, it could even be argued that something (the ALCs) was explicitly not allowed to be included in it. <p/> Even the operational meetings of the administration with the spatial planning authorities (e.g. KS, sectoral, e.g. agriculture, housing, etc.) could have yielded more if they had been properly conceived and committed to. To be clear: the administration is the planning authority, and the documents are drawn up together with a specially paid team. And if something is left out or selectively drafted, we - with their superficial ""reading"" of our space - are the ones in trouble. If such a document is commissioned and its content dictated by politics, then we are far from a profession (Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth ... ), nothing changes (except for the worse). <p/> What is also missing are proposals from those responsible officials (aren't we making too many synecdoches? ! ) who, in their official capacity, are the first to be responsible for making proposals (obligations of laws, decrees, contracts: local infrastructure, culture, education, etc.). <p/> The situation does not show the slightest concern for the mayor (excused absence abroad, where are the two vice-mayors? ) or for the director of the administration, who should have a project manager, and above all, be trusted to do so. The process thus has no profiled promoter ('municipality', mayor, director, head of department, chairman of the spatial planning committee? ! ) and does not even receive the necessary publicity. If you sell, advertise! There is no campaign, logo or sign that something fatal is in the pipeline to involve as many people as possible in the processes, and consequently a greater involvement of the disciplines. The time around the New Year is, of course, not the right time for unveilings. The administration is merely covering legal formalities, not the substantive reasons for extending the festive blackout. <p/> What stands out from such superficial processes is the ""redundancy"" of planning in the light of the parallel ad hoc actions promoted (elections), and the ""pro forma"" content of the ""development coalition"", the voting machine of the only good thinker who will lead us to paradise anyway, is a little annoying in the new mandate. <p/> Not to mention the occasional carping about the adopted and approved development platforms 2007 - 2013 (we are going to the region for EU money ... ), which are not yet recognised as typical political documents for daily use. <p/> We can be quite calmly critical, because the product under discussion (the decree) speaks of the politicisation of purely professional tasks. The formal inclusion of the CFs (do we have them for that?) and the exclusion of the 11 ""development opposition"" councillors of the municipal council is living proof of paper democracy, or of the scenario of how ""Janko"" (who is the ""broomstick"" here? ) imagines a wonderland where we will all be living like in paradise.... <p/> Everything points to the fact that the understanding of the preparation of the emerging document is reduced to an administrative minimum, everything that exists today without propaganda, if it really is not indispensable, practically does not exist. <p/> (J.U.: more information on the contents will be presented periodically, the public debate is open until 15 January 2007, more information on the decree and the background is on the CoR website). <p/> The public debate, the proceedings and the controversial contents are reported by the main municipal media (website) amongst ""other things"" with only a cursory information on the hearing, the documents are attached. That this is not enough is shown by all the poorly attended hearings, but nothing by the administration! <p/> We will wait with interest to see what the Provincial News has to say about the procedures and processes. It is not worth pointing out that the administration has not taken care - apart from the filming, to which we have been warned a couple of times by the Director of the administration - of the ""public relations"" which otherwise covers the Mayor's every step (ec). Or is it? <p/> HERE'S an excerpt from last night's debate, to prove how recently ago some people took the now fatal spatial interventions lightly and politicised them, and how ""everything"" is politics (only how will they justify them tomorrow? ): <p/> ""... Radovljica's landscape will be by far the most damaged by the semi-tubed AC of all the interventions. The unnatural embankments on both sides take away from the plain what is most valuable and distinctive, or add something alien to it ..."" / Statement by a representative of the KR Institute for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, ... who also informed us that we have insufficiently illuminated pedestrian crossings ...?/. <p/> (J.U.: Madam, just where was she during the mayor's ""semi-digging"" into the AC problems? <p/> Another, this time verbal, proof: <p/> Semi-deepening is of course not ""deepening"" and more than obviously nothing good, useful can be born out of ""semi-(itic) deepening"". <p/> We have evidence, look out of the car window when you drive down the main road ...).",Opinion/Argumentation,train
270,"After a few months, the increasingly successful young Polish writer Dorota Masłowska - who will turn 30 in July - is returning to Slovenia. Last year, Masłowska, author of the novel The Polish-Russian War Under the Red and White Flag, was a guest of the 27th Vilenica International Literary Festival - she read in Sežana and Branik - and this year she will be in Ljubljana. On Friday, 1 March, she will visit the Slovene National Drama Theatre, where you can meet her at an expert talk after the performance ""Między nami dobrze jest"" (Everything is OK with us) at the Little Drama Theatre. The play, directed by Ivana Djilas and translated by Darja Dominkuš, premiered at the Drama last November. On Sunday, 3 March, Dorota Masłowska will perform at a literary evening in the CD Club of Cankarjev dom. The literary evening is one of the events of this year's Fabula Festival. <p/> Dorota Masłowska's best-known and most awarded work is, of course, her debut novel The Polish-Russian War Under the Red and White Flag, which was also the first work of hers to be translated into Slovenian - it was published in 2011 by Modrijan in a translation by Tatjana Jamnik.

The many victories of Slovenian patients are proof that Heraclitus and Hippocrates were right, and of course George Ohsawa, the founder of modern macrobiotics, was right too. <p/> The book is not just a collection of recipes, but above all an easy-to-understand explanation of why and how we should nourish our bodies so that they can resist and, of course, overcome disease.",Promotion,train
273,"Ravne is situated in the rugged landscape of the lower Mežiška Valley, squeezed into a wide basin, flanked by rich forests, with the Uršlja Mountains standing in the background to the south. This is the most populated part of Carinthia, where the town of Ravne already meets neighbouring Prevalje. Today, Ravne is the largest town in Carinthia, the administrative, economic, educational, sporting and cultural centre of the Mežica Valley, and in many respects beyond the borders of Carinthia. The area around Ravenna has been inhabited since antiquity, when a Roman road led through the town. Roman ceramics, mosaic pebbles, bricks and money have been found on the site of an ironworks. Ravne was first mentioned in 1248 as Guttenstein and as a market square in 1317. The basis for its development was the steel industry, which was only able to develop further with the collapse of the steel industry in Črna, Mežice and Prevalje. The steel industry also developed very quickly, and in 1952 it became a town and changed its name from Guštanj to Ravne na Koroškem. The wider Uršlje Gora area with the Roman Spring, Prežihovna, Ivarč Lake and the ski resorts at Ošven and the sports park at Ravne form the backbone of the tourist offer. The focus is on excursion tourism, with an emphasis on the presentation of cultural and historical heritage (the Ironworks Museum, Ravne Manor) and natural attractions (Votla peč, Uršlja gora), the offer of sports and recreational activities in nature (Ivarčko, Ošven, Ravne Sports Park), and rural tourism or the offer of tourist farms.",Information/Explanation,train
275,"The Heart Trail in Carinthia <p/> The Heart Trail is approximately 5 kilometres long and has an altitude difference of 180 metres. It is marked with a coloured signpost and almost 20 information boards. It takes about an hour and a half to walk along the trail, and even longer if you actively explore the sights indicated on the signs. <p/> The idea of the Heart Trail was born when looking for ways to offer people a health break. The study circle of Jožica Heber from Dravograd, which is part of the Slovenian Heart and Vascular Society, came up with the idea of a trail, designed and marked it, and offered it as an option for recreational hikes. The technical and organisational work was carried out by Ludvik Pušnik from Dravograd, and the idea was supported by the Dravograd Tourist Board. The trail follows a number of paths and abandoned tracks. In order to add research content to the trail, 20 information points have been erected, where most of the information about Dravograd's natural heritage can be found.Dr Branko Vreš, Rector of the Faculty of Biotechnics in Ljubljana, took care of this, while cultural and historical facts were written down by Marjan Kos, curator of the Koroška Regional Museum in Slovenj Gradec. <p/> The route is not difficult, it is suitable for everyone. It starts at the Health Centre in Dravograd, turns north on the steps and joins the local road Dravograd-Ojstrica at the direction sign at Poberžnik's house. It continues towards the Old Castle. The first stop is at the foresters' house, the Forsthaus, where foresters used to live and work. The house has been preserved in its original form and so has the tower, which catches our eye and had a special purpose. There used to be a nursery nearby, where you can read all about the cultivation of spruce, pine and larch seedlings. The trail then leads to the GradKuplen forest road. At the top, you will have a wonderful view of the town of Dravograd, its surroundings and the vast green forests. The castle shows its former grandeur with a remnant of the wall still standing. The castle was built in the first half of the 12th century, when Bernard of Spanheim became the owner of the Drava Valley. Over the centuries, the castle has changed hands, even being owned by the Counts of Celje and the Habsburgs, among others. North of the castle, a path leads to the ruins of the round court tower, where many a serf's life was extinguished. On the path below the Castle Bytown, a signpost soon directs you to the local Viltužnik-Mori road as you enter the forest. From there, you can see Libeliška gora and Strojna, as well as all three Dravograj bridges, the railway bridge and two road bridges. The view of the Dravograd Lake, created after the construction of the hydroelectric power station, is also extraordinary. The dammed area has developed into a marsh with reedbeds, which provides a rich habitat for many rare plants and animals, including some endangered ones. The lesser spotted bat and the rough bat live here, while the muskrat is common among the larger animals in the lake area. More than 150 species of birds are known to breed here, either permanently or occasionally, and swans are also regular visitors to the lake. <p/> The trail then leads on to the Dravograd-Vič national road, past the Dravograd hotel and petrol station, and winds along the path past the Sports Centre and the cemetery to the Fishermen's Home, where it approaches the River Drava. At Planšak, by the pier, there is a sign explaining the loading of sawn timber, the shayk, the ford and the harbour, and a little further on there is information about the history of the bridge and the bridge tolls. The ford used to cross the Drava only in Dravograd and Trbonyi. The St. Pauli serfs were exempted from the payment of the broadside, bridge and mitre fees, while the others had to give three sausages, cheese and ten eggs in addition to the broadside to be transported in the grain. However, since the ford was in the possession of the land lord of Dravograj, the fordsmen also had to pay her. The information board also tells you all about the smuggling of salt and more. From this westernmost point, the route follows a section of the trim track past a railway bridge that survived the bombing during the Second World War. The power station on the Fisherman's Path is not far from the bridge. It was built to meet the occupier's great demand for electricity and was one of the most modern in Europe at the time. The path then continues up the slope below the post office to the municipality and ends at the Dravograd Health Centre. <p/> Franc Heber, a general practitioner in Dravograd, recommends walking in his clinic, especially for orthopaedic and heart patients, and it has two main benefits: exercise and spiritual calming. Dr Heber told us about the path: ""The path is not too steep and not too long, it takes an hour and a half to walk it. This is the right time for the heart to reach the right frequency, 110 beats per minute. Walking is a great aerobic exercise, as oxygen is the best food for all parts of the body, from the supply of the brain to the heart. ""A walk along the Heart Path offers the freshness of nature and plenty of sunshine, and promises peace and tranquillity and an extraordinary view of Dravograd and its surroundings.

The visitors were the better and more aggressive opponents in the first part of the game, which they managed to build on with a goal by Peterka in the 27th minute and thus went into the break with a one-goal advantage. In the second half, they took a 0:2 lead in the 50th minute on a goal by Turha, but Radomlans had a ready answer. In the 57th minute, Ciriković reduced the deficit with a header, but in the last 15 minutes, Radommer completely outplayed the visitors and scored three times. Tirc equalised in the 78th minute, Cirikovic again for 3:2 in the 88th minute and Vrancic Nik for the final 4:2 in the 93rd minute. Congratulations to the boys and their coach Robert Majdic for the game and the three points. Next Saturday at 15:00 the B team is away at Kodeljev at Slovan and we believe that our boys can again manage to win three points. <p/> In the 10th round of 2. SNL the A team is away to Šampion at Arena Petrol. The Radomlans, who are very modest this year (only 5 points in nine meetings) and occupy the penultimate place in the standings, already competed in the first round and won with 3:0, but the meeting came at the right time again, because the boys would have boosted their confidence with a win after the draw with Krško and the defeat in Šenčur. <p/> And so it happened. Niko Snoj took a quick lead as early as the 4th minute, but the home team even led 2:1 through Škoflek and Čretnik, and from the 27th minute, when Avbelj equalised at 2:2, our team dominated the pitch. Just before the break, Smukavec took the lead with 3:2, Zalaznik scored in the 9th minute, a minute later Snoj scored his second goal to make it 5:2, and the final 6:2 was set in the 78th minute by Vrhunc Luka, who scored practically on the first touch, having entered less than a minute earlier, replacing the third goal scorer, Jernej Smukavec. <p/> Radomlans recorded their seventh win this season and with 22 points they are in second place, three points behind Dob, but they are also by far the most efficient team, as they shot 26 times, which is less than 4 times per game. <p/> Our second league team will face a big challenge on Sunday, 20.10. at 15:00, when last year's first league champion Aluminij comes to Radomlje, with a new coach Robert Pevnik, who was on the bench in Radomlje only four months ago.",News,train

288,"In April, a group of my colleagues and I were unemployed. We were employed in a private company - d.o.o. Because he could no longer keep up with the work and the salaries, he terminated our contracts of employment. The problem is that to date we have not received our severance pay, and he owes us three or two more recourse payments. Now, when we go to him to ask when we are going to get this money, we always upset him. He says he has no money. But he has suggested that we should file for bankruptcy. We do not think that is necessary. <p/> In my previous company, I resigned regularly. The director did not give me permission to take 5 more days of the old leave, nor to take a pro rata part of the new leave, but she gave me a decision stating that the pro rata part of the leave would be paid out, but that I still had 5 days of the old leave left??? The pro-rata part was 12 days, because I left my job in June 2009. I would like to know what is the basis for calculating the value of these 12 days of leave, or is it my gross salary. Should I also be paid for my old leave, given that she has refused to respond to my written requests? <p/> When my maternity leave ends, I will move from an 8-hour working day to a 4-hour working day with the same employer. When do I need to sign a new contract, how long before I start work? I will take one more period of annual leave before I actually start work. I would like to know whether it is normal to sign a new contract after the end of the leave, so that the leave is still counted as 8 hours of work - I mean in terms of pay - or to sign a new contract already during my maternity leave (in which case, of course, the start date of the 4-hour work period is given with the end of my maternity leave and the leave is counted - again, I mean in terms of pay - as if I had worked 4 hours at that time)? <p/> In this case, is it sufficient to sign an addendum to the employment contract with the employer? Or do I have to arrange anything else with the CZS? <p/> The annex includes how many hours per day/week the worker will work and the period during which the worker will work part-time and that the worker's working hours are from 8am to 12 noon. And during the period of part-time work, the worker is entitled to be paid for the work done according to the actual work commitment. Is this sentence on pay written correctly? There is no mention of transport to work, payment for snacks, time for snacks, recourse. Is it taken for granted that I am entitled to it as you stated in your previous answer or as defined in the employment contract, or does it need to be further defined and specified in the annex? If necessary, please help me with what it should say. <p/> Dear Sir or Madam, I would like to ask for your help or if you could give me your opinion: I am employed part-time by two employers. I have no problems with one employer, but I have a problem with the other employer: I have been working 4 days a week for 5 hours (verbal agreement, nowhere written down, the contract says flexitime and 20 hour week) and have accumulated about 120 hours of extra work by working Fridays and Saturdays (training, work meetings, etc.) and by coordinating various projects. Now his only offer is not to pay me the hours but to extend my contract and make up the hours and leave during the summer holidays, but there are some demands he is making that I cannot agree to and would prefer to have the hours paid. <p/> Leave: I have a few days left on my contract. I have repeatedly asked him verbally if he will give me written permission to take the rest of my leave. He ignored my request. On the day I was supposed to bring him the written request, I fell ill. I emailed him to ask him to approve my use anyway, but after five days I have still not received a reply. I also mentioned to him that I had already been granted leave from another employer before the end of my contract. So I am forced to take sick leave, even though I would prefer to take my own days, as sick leave is only paid for 90. Hours: I want my hours to be paid. I have seen in one of your letters that there is no such thing as overtime, which is paid from 130-150. Since he is ignoring my e-mail, any agreement with him will no longer be possible and I will probably be forced to go to court. <p/>Questions: 1. Can I sue him for unused vacation days, given that I have neither an approval nor an explanation for why he would not approve it nor an agreement to compensate me for unused days? Would he necessarily have to give me at least one of those things? Until when? At the moment, I have only two requests by e-mail and no reply. What happens if you simply take the leave without consent AND if it is less than 5 days before the end of the contract, that is to say, even an extraordinary termination is no longer possible? 2. As regards hours, I have a computerised timesheet for the last time for the month of May, which clearly shows the use of leave and the contribution of hours, so that the hours are demonstrable. I will also request a statement of hours for June. Does he have to pay me the hours at my recalculated hourly rate of pay, or can he just set the price of my hours as he sees fit? His idea once was that my overtime hours were worth €1 per hour. 3. What is the possibility of paying for these hours, given that I am his part-time employee? Is a subcontract the only option? I have the option of being paid through a private institution of which I am a co-founder and where I am employed for the other half. Is it possible to simply do a cooperation agreement? Is this legally sustainable? 4. What options do you think I have in terms of hours and leave? If I am informed correctly, do I have the possibility to file a lawsuit 30 days after the ""event"" or the end of the contract? <p/> I have 28 years of uninterrupted service, I have a level IV school education, I am a miller. I have been employed by my last employer for 5 years and I have received an annual leave decision for 22 working days, 20 days of basic leave, 1 day for professional complexity and 1 day with my last employer, compared to 26 days last year. Have I been deprived of this leave and how much am I entitled to? <p/> I have been offered a part-time job, i.e. 6 hours a day (as a result of the new calls for tenders from the Social Security Agency to subsidise shorter working hours). <p/> On an 8 hour day, my gross salary would be somewhere around €550 plus transport and snacks. Since my employer has opted for 6 hours a day, I am now wondering how I can calculate the drop in salary that comes with working two hours less a day. <p/> So the 8-hour wage is known. What is my possible salary for 6 hours? I have no dependants and I only claim the earnings allowance of less than €8300 per year. Is this calculation simply proportional or are there coefficients for this? <p/> I am also interested in all other contributions. Are there any reductions and which ones? Transport? meal allowances? Pension fund? <p/> I wonder at what age a woman is protected so that the employer cannot dismiss her (so that she is then on the SPIZ)? Can she fire older workers indefinitely to get a younger team? (working in a shop) <p/> And also, my childcare leave expires in 1 month and I am thinking of going back to work for 6 hours a day. I wonder by when I have to decide to do this and if I do, can I change back to 8 hours a day at any time after that (if I can't financially cope, for example). <p/> I am writing to you because I am on notice at work. As my last day of notice is on a Saturday, I have to go to work the following week as my last day is a non-working day and I have to work it. I wonder if this is really the case! ? <p/> Hello, I started my first job on 1.4.2008 and I would like to know whether I am entitled to a pro rata share of the recourse allowance for the first year? I should mention that I had a fixed-term contract for 6 months initially, which I extended for another 6 months from 1.9.2008 and which will expire at the end of this month. So far, my employer has not paid me any recourse. I wonder if I should receive any and how much? Thank you in advance for your reply. Matej <p/> I work in a public institution, I have a permanent job, but I was off work in 2008 - first sick, then maternity leave, so I wonder if I am, and if so, how much recourse I am entitled to for 2008?",Other,train

292,"Lithuania wins, National TV disgraces <p/> The European Junior Basketball Championships concluded yesterday after ten days of competition, with Lithuania winning. After an unfortunate loss to France in the quarter-finals, then to Germany for 5th place, our national team managed to beat Greece yesterday by a huge margin for 7th place. So, out of nine matches, our team won seven and lost two. I am quite satisfied with what the younger members have shown, because they still have a lot of basketball challenges ahead of them, but I am much less satisfied with the coverage of the matches on our national television. <p/> I have to admit that this was the first time I watched the European Junior Basketball Championships, as in previous years I didn't even follow basketball that much, but that changed with the 2010 World Championships. So now I watch our national team whenever I can and I can say that I have never been as disappointed with TV Slovenia's coverage as I was with this year's European Championships. The whole event took place in Slovenia, with matches in Kranjska Gora, Domžale and Ljubljana. The first match was played by the younger members of our national team on Thursday 12 July, when the championship kicked off, against Italy. I did not even know that the matches started on that day, even though I follow TV SLO 1 and 2 quite a lot, because I did not see a single announcement for the championship, as I did, for example, a month ago for the football championship or now for the Olympic Games. It seems that they are much more interested in commercials than in viewers, and the junior championships are obviously less important than the senior championships. But after the Italy game, the news reported: <p/> RTV SLO will broadcast the matches on TV SLO Channel 2 and on the web portal from Monday, when the second round of the competition starts. <p/> Quite interesting, as the competition took place in Slovenia and next year we will be hosting the 2013 European Basketball Championship for Members, also hosted by Slovenia. This deprived me of watching the three games on television, but with the upcoming championships, we could prepare for the best possible coverage in the future. As I mentioned, there was no trailer, and thus no major publicity for the championships, so I missed the first day of the second part of the competition. Fortunately, at least they were posting news about it on their portal, so I caught the end of the second match of the second part. From then on I thought everything would be fine, but it wasn't. I watched the very next match on TV SLO 2 HD and the coverage was so disastrous that I can only wonder what will happen next at the 2013 EP and what will the performance be like then. During the broadcast, the picture was interrupted several times so that only the commentator could be heard, and the footage of the last actions at the beginning and end was played with such a blackout that the whole thing was unwatchable. <p/> After the unfortunate defeat against France, when our national team was still in contention for 5th place, I was already looking for the next broadcast, but I could not find it on the schedule or on any of the channels the next day. There are actually four channels - TV SLO 1, 2 and 3 and the online channel, MMC TV - but none of them had the coverage that many of us who followed the championships missed. The most surprising thing is that after the end of both the 5th place match and the France race (which took place at a time when there could have been coverage on TV SLO 2), there was a clip of the European Football Championship, instead of which there could have been a clip of this match. Fortunately, for the last match for 7th place, they only arranged for a broadcast, which still (for me at least) did not justify the mistakes that they should not have made. <p/>I only hope that for the 2013 European Basketball Championship, coverage will be provided, not only for our team's matches, but also for other matches, because it is nice to see other teams playing as well.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

And he said that he needed surgery on the tibia (shortening of the bone on one leg and that they would see him another time to find out exactly what the operation would be. At the second check-up in about two months. But at the second check-up it was the old doctor again... who just laughed at the opinion of the previous doctor... and said they would wait. Well, now it's been more than 10 years since then and this person doesn't even go for check-ups anymore, and there hasn't been any surgery either. Fortunately, it was not necessary.

I will give you a trivial example: we have one pair of shoes every 9 months paid for by the National Health Insurance Fund, and that is at an extra cost of 40! We still have the first adapted pair of shoes since birth, and the child is almost two years old! How many pairs of shoes have your children already changed in such a period, slippers, boots, etc.? ? Not to mention children who have more serious problems such as cerebral palsy and so on. If someone guarantees me from the ZZZS that they will pay all the costs of the operation (180.000) + rehabilitation + stay abroad + travel expenses, I sign immediately and I donate all the money that has accumulated so far at the same moment to the association Joyful Feet (children with cerebral palsy), or to some other child who needs an operation and is not covered by the ZZZS. I have a clear conscience, and I hope that others can say the same. I have been deciding to tell my story for a long time, having considered all the possible scenarios that could befall us in the meantime - from rejection, to partial co-financing, even daring to dream that there will be someone who will pay for everything and I will finally be able to breathe easy and take the next step without this financial burden standing around my neck. This is about a child, thank you to all of you who are helping us and who will continue to help us, and if anyone needs any more papers, documents, proof, my contact details, address, telephone, e-mail are posted above, I will send them without any problems. Greetings, AMela <p/> The whole process is described daily by my mum Amela on her fb wall. She also has all the documents, not me. The health service here would only cover an amputation, which is what she was advised. But for the surgery abroad, they are squinting and saying that she will get an answer in (the legally required? ) 60 days. And even that may only be a fraction, a percentage. As for the rest.... the campaign is in full swing, the blog is just my modest contribution to the mosaic. <p/> Give a little more information. There have been quite a few cases recently where parents had the option of covering the costs through the NHIF, but still raised the money and then spent people's contributions on "" their own "". To avoid this, I advise you to calm down a bit and try to publish as many documents as possible (refusals, decisions) so that people will dare to transfer money. If the case is really as you describe it, it is necessary to involve journalists and make the matter public (Tednik, for example). I write in good faith that something will come of it, otherwise nothing will! <p/> But would at least one of those who have 10 million in assets, or 5 million in cash in foreign banks and safe-deposit boxes (eh, Milan) at least donate 10,000 euros in aid? Will it work? It will be easier to croak. I guarantee him that he will die easier!",Forum,train

The investment consists of the redevelopment of the Cash & Carry store, worth 46,498,883 tolars, and the investment in the store equipment is 19,500,000 tolars. As we have assessed that no significant structural interventions are necessary in the existing building, only the partition walls between the supporting columns have been partially demolished in order to improve the visibility of the store. The Hura! discount store measures 1,035 m2, of which the sales area is 656 m2 and the rest consists of a warehouse, two cold stores, two cloakrooms, toilets, corridors and technical rooms. <p/> 50 parking spaces will be available for customers. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> The following day, 16 December, the Hura! discount store will open its doors in Cerknica at 25 Cesta 4. maja.The investment in the Hura! discount store in Cerknica represents the redevelopment of the Mercator supermarket on the ground floor of the multi-storey building of the UE Cerknica, and its value amounts to 40,411,980 tolars, including equipment. The area of the Hura! discounter is 719 m2, of which 405 m2 is sales area, the rest consists of warehouses, separate changing rooms, toilets for employees, a cleaning room, an office and technical premises. <p/> There are 40 parking spaces in front of the shop. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> Customers will be able to choose from more than 1,100 products from all product groups in both stores, with a larger selection of products in the beverages, basic foods, washing powders and stationery ranges. There will also be products from other product groups, such as packaged fresh meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables, packaged bread and bread products, sweet and savoury products, spices, personal care products, small animals, etc. <p/> Both the Hura! discount in Murska Sobota and the Hura! discount in Cerknica will have two cash registers equipped with a POS system, and customers will be able to pay with cash, debit cards and Mercator vouchers. <p/> The two stores will employ 6 people each, bringing the total number of employees in the Hura! discount chain to 27 since 9 September, when the first Hura! discount store in Ljubljana opened its doors. <p/> With the opening of Hura! discounters, Mercator is following the trends in retail development and, above all, the expectations of customers in the design of sales formats aimed at basic supplies. Market research on attitudes towards hard discounters shows that in all markets where Mercator already operates, a high proportion of customers are in favour of discounters. Based on these findings and the trends in the offer, we have assessed that there is potential for the development of this type of store format. We expect that the expansion of the Hura! discount retail chain in Slovenia in the next few years will lead to a significant market share among discount providers. The guiding principle behind the design of Hura! discounters is to offer customers quality products from lesser-known brands, the main characteristic of which is price competitiveness, while creating as simple, yet comfortable and friendly shopping environment for the customer as possible.",Information/Explanation,train

308,"Severe consequences <p/> Phuket... a well-known island all over the world. It attracts a lot of tourists from all over.It reminds me a bit of Zakynthos except that it is bigger and of course has bigger and nicer beaches. <p/> On arrival at the airport we booked a hotel in Patong Beach. We rented motorbikes and this is where our exploration of the island began. <p/> TRAFFIC In Thailand, traffic is on the left (as in England). We had rented a car earlier when we were in the north. At first, my father had problems driving. The steering wheel is on the right hand side and then everything else gets confused. When he wanted to turn on the indicator he turned on the windscreen wipers instead. Luckily we took the automatic, otherwise he would have had problems with the gearshift, because he was repeatedly looking for the lever on the right side, where the door was. <p/> I am quite an experienced ""motorcyclist"" myself. I've been driving my scooter around for about 4 years, so I took over as driver and drove my mum around. I thought that driving on the left side would be a bit of a hassle, but I got used to it quickly. I had more trouble parking in the garage.Almost everybody here drives motorbikes and then, of course, they have special garages for motorbikes. Other road users also gave me a bit more trouble. People overtake here on the left and right, sometimes elsewhere if they can. There are no rules, so you really have to be alert and careful for your own safety. <p/> SUN After a short sightseeing tour of the island, swimming followed. Almost all the beaches here are sandy and more crowded with sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. When you want to have a nice rest, there are already vendors from the ""shanties"" selling all kinds of things on the beach (watches, food, clothes... ). After a rest and a swim, we drove to a shopping centre a little further away. It was already really hot outside so I couldn't wait to see the cold shops. Trying on clothes in the mirror, I was surprised by the bright red colour of my hands, just like tomatoes. The sun was burning me badly. I must admit that I didn't put on much sunblock. My skin is naturally darker and I have a lot of pigment. As soon as the sunny days start I get a nice tan. I don't like to sunbathe and I know it's not healthy. I have never had problems with sunburn and that is why I am much more surprised. <p/> I was burnt on my arms (mainly because of the motorbike), shoulders, knees and of course the bottom of my legs. The sun is much stronger here than here and the change, when the body is not used to such a high amount of heat and sun, is also to blame for my severe burns, in addition to the fact that I didn't put enough sunscreen on. <p/> I was in for a hard, tiring night full of pain. Aloe Vera and menthol rubs, as well as after-sun creams and compresses, helped my recovery. Today I am much better and even the red colour has changed to a nicer, more tanned brown. <p/> From now on I will not go anywhere without sun cream and I will apply it much more often, because I am risking my life. A lot of times, the effects of the sun lead to skin cancer and also to more wrinkled and aged skin, and I don't want to have wrinkled skin at 18 and risk skin cancer!",Opinion/Argumentation,train

December is proverbially considered to be the busiest month of the year, but we can say that this weekend, despite the holidays and the resulting higher traffic density on our roads, did not stand out from the average. There was only one road accident resulting in serious injuries and two road accidents, two of which resulted in minor injuries to four occupants. 15 road accidents resulted in damage to property. Over the weekend, 19 drink-drivers were detained. <p/> A traffic accident with serious injuries occurred on Friday at 19:30 on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur. A 50-year-old driver was driving a car on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur, from the direction of Leona Dobrotinška Street towards II. Bataljona. As he drove his vehicle to the intersection with Gajstova cesta into a sharp right-hand bend, at the end of the bend he drove his vehicle too close to the right-hand edge of the carriageway and collided with a 63-year-old pedestrian, who was walking from the opposite direction, along the left-hand edge of the carriageway. After the collision, the pedestrian, who was wearing dark clothing, fell on the bonnet of the car and hit his head on the windscreen, after which he fell on the road and was seriously injured. The driver, who was driving a car without a valid driving licence, did not stop at the scene of the accident but drove off to an unknown destination, but later turned himself in at Šentjur police station. <p/> Crime continues.

312,"Are systematic examinations really compulsory? <p/> At the Association for Freedom of Choice, we are receiving an increasing number of indignant letters from parents informing us of the unacceptable practice of paediatricians and school doctors in cases where a child is not brought for a systematic check-up. Some parents are even threatened with reporting to the CSD for ""neglecting"" their child, while others are told that they will no longer be their doctor of choice if they do not come for a check-up (even if the child is healthy! ). Clearly, there is increasing pressure on parents from paediatricians and some state institutions, which is not least reflected in increased dissatisfaction and resistance from parents. <p/> The health centre is threatening one family directly in writing - without any legal basis! - that if they do not bring their baby for a systematic check-up, the Social Work Centre will be sent to their door. In the accompanying document, I am sending you an official clarification from the Ministry of Health (from January 2011), which makes it clear that systematic examinations are a RIGHT in Slovenia and that they are NOT MANDATORY. <p/> What is the situation with these systematic examinations now, are they compulsory (ZZVZZ) or not (statements of the Ministry of Health)? Do you get the CSD by the scruff of the neck in this country if you don't go for such a check-up? Where and why, who gives them this right to send the CSD over parents and de facto impose systematics as compulsory? Are such threats and pressures from doctors and the state permissible? <p/> We believe that this is an intensive increase of pressure on parents beyond all permissible limits, and therefore civil society movements are considering a form of public protest against the intensification of repression against parents by paediatricians and the state. If we fail to stop this - will soon every parent who fails to turn up with their child for a systematics session receive threats or even a CSD hearing? <p/> This practice by paediatricians and other actors in the health sector is contrary to legislation and guidelines for good practice for paediatricians, as well as to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Republic of Slovenia is in flagrant breach of by failing to regulate this area by law. <p/> Article 18 emphasises that the primary responsibility and care for the growth and development of the child in all respects belongs to the parents (or in special cases, legal representatives), and the best interests of the child are the primary parental concern. In order for parents to be able to achieve this goal, States Parties must provide them with appropriate support and establish institutions and services that parents can use to achieve this goal. Article 24 highlights the right of the child to enjoy the highest standard of health and to have access to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. It is the role of the State to ensure access to these facilities and technologies and to ensure that all segments of society, especially parents and children, are informed about these options, have access to education about them and to basic knowledge about child health and nutrition, the benefits of breastfeeding, hygiene and a clean environment, and disaster prevention. Nowhere in the Convention does it say that families must submit to compulsory procedures in the area of preventive health and medical examinations and interventions. The fact is that, because of pressure from paediatricians, a good number of Slovenian parents are already going abroad for check-ups, mainly to Austria. There, many parents are even asked what they have come for, because the child is healthy and, in their opinion, would not need so many examinations. More proof that something is very wrong in Slovenia. <p/> It is also a fact that recently the CSDs have taken children away from some families for similar reasons. Will we parents have to fear our own country in future? If you find this topic interesting, we invite you to contact our association for more information, the contacts are listed below. Above all, the Ministry of Health owes the Slovenian public an immediate clarification on all this.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

316,"Responsibility, in my view, should not only mean that they can (or even should) make decisions for the child, but above all that their decisions should be responsible, sensible and beneficial for the child's development. Also in the SSKJ, responsibility is defined (among other things) as a quality, a characteristic of that which, because of its importance, its consequences, requires great knowledge, care, and as an attitude in which someone has to give an explanation, a justification for their work, their actions Responsibility is therefore given to someone because it is assumed that they have the knowledge and the ability to do the ""right"" thing with the thing, the task, entrusted to them. The power that parents are given is not supposed to be given in itself, but because they know how to make better choices. Such responsibility is undoubtedly stressful for a parent. After all, most parents want the best for their children, but it is difficult for them to know what is really best for the child. So my mother wanted more dolls when she was a child and now she is stocking her daughter with dolls so that she does not feel frustrated. What may not be realised is that her daughter does not like dolls at all. <p/> The decision-making power that comes as a package with parental responsibility often grates on the nerves of various experts. Parents can decide whether to allow the school doctor to carry out a systematic check-up with the school doctor at all. Parents can decide whether or not their child can see the school counsellor (the exception, of course, is acute situations that need to be dealt with immediately - e.g. fights between children, extreme abuse of classmates or teachers, disruption of classes). Parents decide whether or not the doctor can treat their child. Parents decide whether or not the child can see a psychologist. All this power is great, of course, as long as parents really work with it in the child's best interests. But, unfortunately, this often does not seem to be the case. <p/> At school, for example, the child is highly socially anxious, unself-conscious, unaccepted by his classmates, and often finds it difficult to come to school. Teachers notice this problem and find it most useful to have the child see a school counsellor to develop social competences, to try to develop a better self-image. But the parents say no. Our child is not like that already. But at home he is normally talkative. The school has nothing to interfere in our family. <p/> Similar situation. At the age of three, the entire population of children in Slovenia undergoes a systematic psychological examination. This screening identifies both children who show mental disorders and children who are at high risk of developing neurotic disorders or maladjustment. Of course, not all children identified as being at risk will necessarily develop disorders. But the results of this screening have fairly good predictive validity. The prediction that the developmental trajectory of children identified as at-risk will be towards a neurotic structure is therefore true with a high probability. The psychologist therefore identifies a child as being at risk and suggests a form of follow-up treatment. If the parents do not want this treatment, it will not be given. And a child whose adverse developmental course could be reversed at the age of three may be a behaviourally problematic toddler at the age of ten, getting on the nerves of his parents and even more so of the school. Perhaps, of course, it is not necessarily nothing. But it is better to work preventively on a larger number of children than to have to take curative action when it is actually too late. And if someone has to finish his personality development later as an adult with a psychotherapist, this development will take somewhere around twice as long as it would have taken if it had been carried out normally in childhood. <p/> Parents thus have almost godlike powers over their children's development, and the various experts can only oppose them when the parents are very clearly endangering the child's health or life. The latter is difficult to prove, especially when the threat is not physical but psychological. And practically impossible when it comes to matters such as potentially risky personal development, which is ultimately only potential.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
318,"In every profession there are people who are more and those who are less friendly. But when dealing with customers, you should not be unfriendly, arrogant or even rude. Nurses come top in these qualities (in my experience). From the fact that one nurse, during the driving test, tried every means to convince me that I was anaemic - she did not even ask me if I was, which is what she said: ' You are anaemic, you are so anaemic. ' And she did not give up even after several assurances that I was not anaemic. Apparently it is difficult to understand that blond and blue-eyed people also tend to have less pigment in their skin. The height of rudeness is the nurse at my gynaecologist's (a woman who the whole medical establishment knows to be a tease), who gives you a hard time whether you do anything wrong or not. The desire to get a prescription for the pill on a day when they are working with normal clients and not with students is utopian with her. If you explain to her nicely that you are studying more than 100 km away and that you cannot come on a specific day, she tells you to go and see the man on duty on Saturday. That's logic for you. Also, as a student, I can only get an appointment over the phone on Monday (that's the day they have reserved for female students), not any other day of the week. Someone please explain this to me. <p/>The waiters have been in a bad mood for the last week. First I get several accusatory no's because I want to order food that is out of stock (how was I supposed to know it was out of stock! ? ! ), then my classmate and I are told to get our own Coke from the fridge. Serving at the table is obviously a utopia. Whereupon we are given glasses full of limescale, which they refuse to change because apparently they can't be washed any nicer. But I wash the glasses by hand and they are never full of limescale. Then, suddenly, a waiter thinks that rum tea is great if you make it with black tea. Well, it's not great, and I have used an extravagant amount of sugar to make it edible at all. How a waitress who cannot make either can work in a bar where there is a big sign outside saying mulled wine and hot chocolate, and who cannot make either remains an enigma to me. Especially since at least mulled wine is very easy to make ... <p/> Certain people think that customers need to understand that they are having a bad day. Unfortunately, I have never considered that to be the customer's task. If I myself am polite and friendly and don't complicate things (except in extreme situations), I expect kindness in return. Or at least the absence of unkindness. Not unnecessary complication, nagging and insults. Because I believe that these same run-of-the-mill nurses and waiters would not find it acceptable if one day they came to see me as a client (e.g. in my capacity as a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist) and I was rude to them because I was just having a bad day. No matter how difficult it may be, worries should be left at home, or at least not shaken at clients.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
319,"Three Men in a Boat, not to mention the dog, is definitely one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Jerome Flap Jerome hooks the reader right from the start. After all, a story about three hypochondriacs cannot be boring. And so what when someone has every known disease in this world, except the knee of a snapper. Jerome concluded something like this: ' At first I was quite hurt by it, it seemed like a kind of insult. Why don't I have a knee? Why this unjust neglect? But after a while, less British feelings prevailed. I said to myself: I have all the other diseases known to pharmacology and, becoming less selfish, I decided that I would get along without a knee. Gout had apparently attacked me in the worst possible form, and without realising it gallstones had apparently plagued me from a young age. After the gallstones, there was no more illness, so I decided that there was nothing else wrong with me.'<p/> So the three friends set off on a 'boating' trip down the Thames, peppered with all the adventures that can befall a traveller.

322,"Sculpture <p/> 13.03.2014 <p/> by Gregor Šket <p/> A sensual body, full curves, a carefully calculated geometry based on the ellipse. A long nose that hides something strong and big inside. The nostril flirts with infinity without beginning or end. The rear is elegantly muscular and subtly erotic. Technique: sculpture in iron, dimensions: 4453x1657x1273 mm, by Sir William Lyons, Malcom Sayer, William M. Heynes, vintage: 1961-1974. This is what it says on the plaque marking one of their greatest exhibits, a four-wheeled sculpture, the Jaguar XKE, E-Type, in the department of MoMA, New York's Museum of Modern Art. And MoMA only has six cars: a jeep willis, a Smart, a Cistalia 202 GT, a Ferrari Formula 1 641/2, a Volkswagen Beetle and the Jaguar e-type, which was added to the collection in 1996. <p/> But it has been clear since its birth that the e-type is a speciality that is actually much more than just a car. After all, Enzo Ferrari knew it as soon as he saw it. It wasn't easy for him. He must have swallowed his saliva with great difficulty, but sportingly admitted: ""This is the most beautiful car ever made! ""It is hard to imagine how much strength and trampled pride it took for the great Il Commendatore to pay such a flattering tribute to a car that was not from the Apennine Peninsula but from the British Isles. Somehow, he was saying what has always been known anyway: with all due respect to the Germans, only the Apennine Peninsula and the British Isles can make really good supercars. From today's point of view, the irony is that series production of cars in both centres of super-sport has virtually come to a standstill, or at least is in a very difficult situation that smacks of perpetual decline. <p/> A symbol of the 1960s <p/> At the end of the 1950s, following their success at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Jaguar's engineers, developers and designers were tasked with creating an all-new sports two-seater to replace the legendary XK150. In 1957, the E1A prototype was created, but it was only available for factory testing. Three years later, the E2A prototype followed and achieved some racing success. When the carpet was unveiled at a press conference at the Parc des Eaux Vives restaurant in Geneva on 15 March 1961, the gathering was breathless. In front of them stood a piece of automotive art which, for the time, represented the very avant-garde, a glimpse of the future, something unseen, something new... The Jaguar XKE, also known as the e-type. Interestingly, they had no special plans for the newcomer, but rather than sales success, they were counting on racing victories. But it turned out the other way round. Although the XKE was initially intended only for export to the North American market, it was also unexpectedly popular and in demand at home. It also convinced with its relatively affordable price of £2,256 at the time (around £38,000 today, or around €45,000). Of course, it was soon behind the wheel of many movie and sports stars of the 1960s, such as George Best, Brigitte Bardot, Tony Curtis, Steve McQueen, etc. <p/> Designed by an aeronaut <p/> The e-type's design is by designer Malcom Sayer. As an aeronautical engineer, he was of course a master of aerodynamics. And this is probably the main reason why the e-type offered a design that was revolutionary for its time and remarkably modern. At first sight, the car was a sight to behold, with a virtually perfect shape. The side view revealed a cigar-shaped form, dominated by a long bonnet that flowed into a relatively short cabin. From any angle, the E-type reveals the designer's remarkable sense of aesthetics, proportion, right angles and proportions. Its rear end evokes feminine curves, its front end may look like a shark, but in its aggressiveness it exudes something friendly, soft, warm, almost childlike. All accentuated by thoughtful chrome detailing and typical English wheels made of interwoven spokes. Inside, it's a sort of miniature sexy English saloon - leather seats, leather steering wheel, classic switchgear and dashboard gauges. <p/> Three body styles and three series <p/> The E-type was initially available as a two-door coupe, known as FHC (Fixed Head Coupe), and as a convertible, known as OTS (Open Two Seater). A few years later, the 2+2 coupe was launched. The coupe was lengthened by about 20 centimetres and two makeshift rear seats were added to allow four adult passengers to ride in the e-type. At first glance, the 2+2 Coupe does not have the same harmonious lines and angles of the exterior. Connoisseurs say the cabin sticks out too much and, above all, the side lines are not as elegant. <p/> The e-type was initially powered by a 3.8-litre six-cylinder engine, which was replaced by a 4.2-litre unit in 1964. Both engines gave the car superb driveability. The speedometer only stopped at 240 kilometres per hour, and it accelerated to 100 km/h in seven seconds. <p/> It also underwent a few cosmetic changes during the 13 years of series production, during which 70,000 examples were built. In 1968, the Series 2 was launched, distinguished on the outside mainly by slightly different tail lights hidden under the bumpers, and on the inside by different switches on the dashboard. In 1971, the 3 Series was launched, which introduced a 12-cylinder 5.3-litre engine and was also quite different externally. Unfortunately, even at that time, the rule was that cosmetic changes were really a deterioration. The 3 Series E-type no longer had such a friendly bonnet, its front end was no longer classic Jaguar, but had a few Citroën elements. The side line was also spoilt, as the E-type had its front wings opened up too much. In fact, the third series heralded the arrival of the all-new XJ-S, which arrived just a year after the e-type's retirement, but was in no respect even close to its predecessor. <p/> Auto-erotic <p/> The E-type is one of the few cars whose physical presence evokes purely non-automotive emotions. It feels like a sculpture on four wheels. As such, it is, of course, a remarkable example of industrial design and therefore, of course, it has a special place in the history of both motoring and design. There are few examples where these two worlds intertwine, intersect and interact so effectively and, above all, so seamlessly. <p/> That's why, half a century after its birth, it is still one of the most beautiful cars in the world. The Daily Telegraph has listed it as one of the 100 most beautiful cars in the world, and Sports Car International magazine has ranked it number one in a similar list. Right, because the e-type is a cross between a car, eroticism and art...",Promotion,train

335,"IAC and the Coggins test <p/> For those of you who take your horse to competitions, shows or other events where large numbers of horses gather, you will have heard of IAC. An IAC test is usually required to enter competitions, and sometimes to transport horses to a new stable, when a horse changes ownership... <p/> But do you know what the acronym IAC stands for, and why it is so important to have a test to prove that a horse is not infected? <p/> Introduction IAC is an acronym for I nfectious a nemio k onj, a viral disease that is in many ways related to the disease known as AIDS. <p/> In both cases, it is a viral disease for which there is neither a vaccine nor a cure. Although most infected horses quickly succumb to the disease, a small percentage of affected horses make at least a semblance of a recovery, but these same horses still carry the virus and become ill again when they are subjected to greater strain or stress. It is precisely because some horses look healthy despite carrying the virus that testing is needed to show the true picture of the horse's health. This also ensures the safety of all horses in the same stable, in the same pasture ... <p/> Transmission Recently, research has revealed new findings in the field of transmission of this disease. The disease is mainly transmitted by blood-sucking insects (hookworms, flies, mosquitoes ... ). For example, if an infected horse is bitten by an adder and then by a healthy horse, the disease is transmitted from one to the other. The virus only survives in the mealworm for a short time (15-30 minutes), so the disease is usually spread between horses that are housed close to each other, e.g. in the same stable or pasture. The disease occurs wherever horses and bloodsucking insects are present. <p/> Clinical signs In equine infectious anaemia, there are three groups of symptoms: acute symptoms, chronic symptoms and latent carrier symptoms, which are barely noticeable or absent. <p/>Acute symptoms include fever, listlessness, lack of running. It is difficult to diagnose an acute horse as the symptoms are generalised and the IAC test will not be positive for a month and a half after infection. About one third of infected horses with acute signs die within a month. <p/> Chronic symptoms include recurrent short acute periods with weight loss, swollen abdomen and legs and anaemia. The horses will test positive for IAC. In this condition, the horse may last for several years before the disease finally debilitates it. <p/> Most asymptomatic infected horses will show no recognisable signs of infection but will test positive on the Coggins test. <p/> Coggins test To ensure that a horse is not carrying the IAC virus, a simple test called the Coggins test is performed. This test checks whether antibodies to IAC are present in the horse's blood. Blood samples must be examined by an authorised laboratory. This test is often needed at competitions and transport events and is the simplest way of proving that your horse is healthy and is not a threat to the health of other horses at the event. <p/> Once you have passed the Coggins test, there is no need to repeat it just to keep calm. Your horse will not be IAC positive unless it shows serious signs of illness after contact with another horse whose IAC status you do not know. Further IAC tests should only be carried out for the purposes of the situations described above (competitions, shows, transport... ). <p/> Prevention With the blood testing programme and the required tests at major events, the number of cases of infection has been drastically reduced. When the testing programme started, it was believed that this approach would even eradicate the disease completely, but there are just so many asymptomatic carriers each year that the disease still occurs. There is no vaccine for IAC. It is therefore important to ensure that your horse and the horses it comes into contact with are tested and that they test negative. More and more horse boarding providers are requiring an IAC test for all newly arrived horses, which certainly goes a long way in preventing the spread of the disease. If you have horses in your care in stables or on pasture, require an IAC test from all new horses coming into your care. <p/> One more piece of information for anyone interested in having an IAC test: the Coggins test is carried out at the Equine Veterinary Clinic in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the price of the rapid test (results in one day) is €25, while the normal test (results in six days) costs a little less. The IAK test is valid for one year in Slovenia. <p/>Shops and services",Information/Explanation,train

339,"Friday 01 August 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections to the National Assembly. Therefore, in the first half of June, we sent a questionnaire to the parliamentary parties asking about their attitude towards family policy, the work they have done so far and their plans or promises for the new mandate in this area, as well as their opinion on some concrete proposals of the Family Initiative. We asked the parties to return the questionnaires to us by the end of June. <p/> Only the NSi group sent us a fully completed questionnaire within the deadline. They expressed their support for most of our proposals and listed several solutions they had proposed and implemented during the current mandate. In addition to the more high-profile ones, which you are probably all familiar with, let me mention two less well-known ones, such as the 50 per cent reduction in the contribution for the use of public roads for families with four or more children and the abolition of the administrative fee for marriage. The fact that these are not just words is borne out by the experience of this term, when the NSi Group of Deputies has repeatedly asked us for our opinion or for consultation, and our proposals have been taken on board, at least to some extent. Of course, we would have been even happier if there had been more of this. <p/> The second and so far last questionnaire was sent to us by the LDS. The questionnaire is only partially filled in and considerably less specific. For the most part, they did not really say anything about the specific proposals of the Family Initiative, with the predominant answer being ""it is interesting, needs to be changed, and then maybe worth supporting"", with the feasibility mostly based on the constraints of public finances, and with quite a few of the proposals they also made it clear that they did not support them. Interestingly, despite the fact that they have had the scissors and the canvas for 12 years and that the situation has not deteriorated in recent years (in some areas it has improved), they are very critical of the current state of family policy. <p/> We were also promised a questionnaire by the SLS, but have not received it to date. They have repeatedly shown their support for pro-family solutions in the past and have proposed some of their own. We hope that they will also send us something more concrete as soon as possible. <p/> The SD referred us to their alternative government programme, which is quite interesting reading in some points and also promises some of the solutions that the Family Initiative has been pointing out for quite a number of years. In some areas they advocate completely opposite proposals, and in others the text is quite intangible. Caution in reading it is warranted by past experience, because when the party had significant influence in government for a number of years, there was no real will and no real listening to the same proposals. You can find the programme on the SD website. <p/> Lipa has sent us its statutes and programme, and has promised an electoral programme. The party programme received contains very little that is tangible, and not much space is given to parents and the family. Perhaps the electoral programme will be something more concrete. <p/> Sunday 22 June 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections for Members of the European Parliament. A significant part of our electorate are parents, and so their attitudes, plans and work on family policy so far are also important to us when choosing parties and candidates for the parliament. <p/> The Family Initiative, the Association for a Family Friendly Society, is a non-partisan association of parents and friends of families that has been working for the best possible position of families in Slovenian society for 10 years. During this time, several governments have changed and we have held a critical mirror up to all of them, proposing the best possible solutions, opposing the bad ones, praising the good ones... This has certainly been the best demonstration of our professionalism and party independence, which is why our membership has been growing. <p/> Before the 2008 elections, we would like to ask all parliamentary parties about their attitudes to family policy, what they have done in the past (you know, actions count for more than promises) and what they intend to do in the next parliamentary term, if the electorate entrusts you with the leadership of the country. <p/> That's why we have contacted all political parties and asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards family policy. Once we have compiled the results, we will also present them to the public. For those parties that do not respond, we will assume that they are not interested or do not consider this area worthy of attention. <p/>Family Initiative hopes that the questionnaire has been / will be accepted by the parties as an opportunity to present their programme and plans in a concrete way.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

341,"Friday 29 December 2006 <p/> In December 2006, on the margins of the European Social Platform meeting at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana, representatives of the Family Initiative met with Mr William Lay, Executive Director of COFACE - Confédération des Organisations Familiales de l'Union Européenne, or in Slovene the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union. We presented to Mr Lay the state of family policy in Slovenia and the efforts of the Family Initiative to develop family-friendly legislation in Slovenia. We presented the current proposals and initiatives for legislative change in Slovenia that we have prepared in the Family Initiative. We presented proposals to increase the competitiveness of parents in the labour market, proposals to improve the conditions for families with several children in the area of childcare, proposals to amend pension legislation and proposals for a fairer distribution of the costs of childcare between parents and individuals without children. The overall conclusion of the participants was that the Family Initiative is working on proposals that are also relevant for other members of the European Alliance. On the other hand, we can better draw on experience from abroad to identify family policy measures that have already shown results there. Family policy is implemented in each Member State separately and in a disconnected manner, and the European Union does not have a common family policy. For this reason, NGOs working to improve family policy in individual countries have joined together to form a common organisation, COFACE. So far, there has been no Slovenian representative in this organisation. That is why Mr Lay invited the Family Initiative to take an active part in this association. Those present agreed that membership in this organisation would be beneficial for both the Family Initiative and family policy in Slovenia. We believe that the benefits of membership would also justify the additional costs associated with membership. We parted with the hope of meeting next time as full members of COFACE, and thus to work together on family policy in the European Union. <p/> Thursday 12 October 2006 <p/> The coalition groups listened to the warnings of the Family Initiative that the proposed Income Tax Law, in the article providing for tax relief for dependent children, should be amended so as not to worsen the relative position of parents compared to taxpayers without children. Based on our warnings, the NSi, SDS and SLS groups of MEPs have drafted amendments to correct the draft law. In the course of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to amend the Bill by increasing the progressivity step of the tax relief from the third child onwards from EUR 748 to EUR 1500. While this solution does not meet the full requirements of the Family Initiative, it does address the main anomaly and shortcoming of the proposed law. For a number of families, the proposal will also not only maintain, but even slightly improve their relative position compared to taxpayers with the same income without children. <p/> Compared to the original proposal of the Family Initiative, the State will now make some savings and we expect that this will make it easier to implement other, perhaps even more important, family policy measures, such as incentives for parents to take up employment after the return of parental leave and part-time work. <p/> At this point, I would like to commend the cooperation of the expert colleagues of the NSi and SDS Groups of Members of the European Parliament and of some of their MEPs, who, during the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, also checked the proposals and solutions they discussed with us, thus enabling us to participate constructively in this process with our own calculations and assessments. <p/> Tuesday, 30 May 2006 <p/> On World Family Day in May, we held a well-attended round table discussion at the General Assembly entitled The fertility problem between parents and the state, which was attended by the Minister of Finance, Dr Andrej Bajuk, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Science, Dr Magdalena Šverc, the Director of the Directorate for the Family at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Development, Ms Majda Erzar, and the Acting Head of the Housing Sector at the Ministry of the Interior, Ms Anita Hočevar Frantar.

342,"Request for an interview <p/> Dear Mr President! <p/> When you presented your government programme, you listed among the most important priorities of this government the concern to increase the birth rate and to improve the situation of families, since the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem of our country. <p/> Since 1997, we parents, associated in the Family Initiative, an association for a family-friendly society, have been working towards these very goals, and we were very pleased to see this new direction in Slovenian politics. Over the years we have been working in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience, and have proven ourselves with valid and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, free from emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/>With our expertise and experience, we are ready to help make the legislative changes and reforms needed to create an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parenting role than they do today, and therefore make more and better parenting choices. <p/> We would therefore like to meet with you to discuss your plans to implement the above-mentioned priority of the Government this term and how the Family Initiative could help. This is particularly important at a time when important reforms are being adopted to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy, and we have not found much in the documents on the proposals for these reforms, at least so far, that is tangible on how to tackle the problem of low fertility and on the above-mentioned priority and task of the Government in this mandate. The question also arises as to how these orientations are reflected in the 2006 and 2007 budgets.",Other,train
343,"Wednesday 30 November 2005 <p/> Allow me to begin by briefly introducing myself. The Family Initiative is an association of parents in particular, which has been working since 1997 (and formally since 1998) for legislative solutions to improve the comparative position of parents and families. In the past, we have been more concerned with preventing changes that would worsen the situation of parents and families than with improving legislation. Over the years we have worked in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience and have proven ourselves through sound and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, without emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/> We are following with interest the debates and your documents on reforms to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. Of course, we are trying to get a picture of how the whole set of reforms will affect the situation of parents and families. To analyse the impact of the various legislative proposals on family benefits and taxes, we have developed computer simulation tools some time ago, which we are continuously upgrading and adapting to new proposals. We can say that our calculations have proven to be correct in the past. When we try to process your reform proposals in a similar way, we are faced with the problem of the lack of concrete data and figures that are necessary to carry out the calculations and, ultimately, to reproduce and verify the calculations that have already been presented so far. <p/> Moreover, the data already presented on some of the proposals show that, if they are not implemented in the right way, they could be quite harmful to families, especially families with several children. In our view, it would not be necessary to interfere with the concept of the reforms if they were to be implemented in a way that would also be acceptable or beneficial, or at least harmless, from the point of view of parents and families. <p/> With our knowledge and experience, we are ready to help in the preparation of reforms that will contribute to creating an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parental role than they do today, and therefore prefer and choose parenthood more often, because we agree with the Prime Minister who, when presenting the Government's programme, said that the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem in our country. <p/> We are therefore asking for a meeting to review together what is proposed in concrete terms (with the necessary figures) by the reforms, so that we can use simulation calculations to see what this means for parents and families and where the proposals might need to be adjusted. Given that you have said publicly that you lack simulation tools, it may be interesting for you to see what we have produced and how much it could be useful for you.",Other,train

347,"Multimodal transport is the transport of goods all the way to the place where the goods will be handed over by the multimodal transport contractor.

Here, the first means of transport together with the cargo becomes the cargo for the second means of transport from the other transport sector, on the basis of one multimodal transport contract and one document, irrespective of the type and number of means of transport used. Therefore, in multimodal transport, the role of the customer of the multimodal transport is important. This branch of transport is complex, and a good multimodal transport contractor is therefore well placed to organise and execute multimodal transport at all levels. The multimodal transport contractor has an interest in performing contractual and non-contractual obligations as a good contractor, since it is liable from the moment of receipt of the goods until the moment of handover. It is also liable for the conduct of its servants and of other persons hired by it for the performance of the multimodal transport contract.

His body is not entirely human, but bears distinct traits of anthropomorphism. He is a goat with human limbs and an upright posture. It has a goat's face with horns and a prominent hump that ends in a short, protruding tail. Some people still believe that whoever manages to touch its tail will be safe from all the scourges of life. His legs are of unequal length with large feet, which made it difficult for him to walk, and he limped and wheezed so that he could be heard from afar when he came. Because of his outward appearance, he was thought to be the devil, a demon that drinks blood. It was said that at night he would creep up on beautiful married women and sleep with them. Probably because he walked around half naked and liked to show off his possessions. Yes, they were even afraid of him because of his appearance and made up all sorts of stories about his evil deeds. But nothing was true... well, maybe if you took offence and didn't offer him good wine something could happen to you, but nothing fatal, you could get up in the morning feeling sick or with a headache. If you were so spellbound by Strygon you were treated with coals, a cup of water and prayers, and when you met him again it helped to 'hold your horns' in your pocket and spit gently sideways or roll up your trousers and turn at least one piece of underwear the wrong way round. Otherwise, he loved to help and use his magical skills to heal both humans and animals. And those whom he so helped liked to reward him with good wine, and he asked for nothing else. It seemed as if Strygon could not find his peace, and he roamed the villages of Istria, staging shrigonerias and looking for good wine. He helped some, he taught others, and he left a pleasant or unpleasant memory everywhere, depending, of course, on how he was received. Today, Strygon no longer walks around, and Istranians wonder where he ended up. Some miss him because he helped them, others are happy because they no longer have to fear him.

She began by stressing that Ljubljana needs new leadership, freshness, economy and responsibility. At the press conference, her candidacy was endorsed by representatives of New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS): Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, Dr Žiga Turk, Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, Aleš Hojs, Minister of Defence, and the Director of the Government Communications Office, Mag. Anže Logar. <p/> As she said in her opening remarks, from the very beginning of the identification process, she has been working to bring the Spring Spring Day parties together to agree on a joint candidacy. Both the initiative and the support then came from the ranks of the Slovenian Democratic Party. The candidacy is first and foremost the result of her personal decision. The candidacy is a particular challenge for her - she is familiar with the mayoralty, having followed it closely as a city councillor, and as such is well acquainted with Ljubljana's burning issues. After all, she is also a resident of old Ljubljana, which has become a beautiful city centre in recent years, but looks are not everything. Behind it are many problems that citizens face on a daily basis. . <p/> There are still a number of deliberately inflicted injuries to the Ljubljana organism that will have to be treated, which have been covered up in the past with many ""beauty operations"". Since we do not want to look for a receiver for Ljubljana in the next regular mayoral elections, we need to elect a good steward in this one - one who will spend money for the benefit of all Ljubljana citizens, who will conscientiously manage the city's land, who will carefully protect the reputation of public companies, who will carry out tenders transparently, who will select contractors responsibly and who will make sure that every subcontractor is paid fairly. The New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party are behind all of the above, as they have already demonstrated by their performance in the City Council. <p/> Mojca Kucler Dolinar concluded her announcement of her candidacy for Mayor of Ljubljana with her desire to show an alternative to what has happened in Ljubljana so far that is good, effective and puts the people of the capital at the centre. <p/> Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, endorsed Dolinar as an excellent candidate who knows Ljubljana very well and has a lot of experience, which is a guarantee that she will be a good steward of Ljubljana and that she will introduce the necessary changes to improve the lives of the citizens of Ljubljana. He stressed the cooperation of both parties in the preparation of the programme. <p/> Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, stressed that Kucler Dolinar is the best choice at this moment because she has experience, she knows how to lead, she knows how to communicate. She knows exactly what is right and what is wrong, and she stands for honesty and sincerity. <p/> City Councillor Anže Logar (SDS) pointed out that Kucler Dolinar has always been an active City Councillor - including as Vice-Chair of the Commission on Mandate Issues, Elections and Appointments, which she now chairs, she supports a lively debate from the point of view of morality and ethics for the benefit of Ljubljana, and would like to see this kind of debate in the City Council as well.

361,"Ljubljana, 28 November (STA) - The results show that a methodologically adjusted calculation would reduce the internal rate of return of Tesla 6 from 7.59% to 6.91%. Unsubstantiated assumptions allow risks to increase and, if they materialise, the rate could even fall to 5.12 percent, Geert Warringa of CE Delft said today at a presentation of the methodological flaws in the investment programme of Tesh 6. <p/> Such a rate of internal rate of return is far below the nine per cent required by the government in April as a condition for the state guarantee. ""Therefore, the project should not have received state support in the form of a state guarantee,"" pointed out Lidija Živčič of Focus. <p/> The report states that there are some methodological errors in the investment calculations for the construction of the sixth unit of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš 6). Lignite prices are underestimated, lignite consumption is underestimated from 2028 onwards, and CO2 costs are underestimated because process emissions from desulphurisation plants, which will be auctioned after 2020, are not included. <p/> The programme also assumes that the efficiency of lignite extraction will increase, but this assumption is not justified, the report points out. The result would be undervalued lignite prices. Another unjustified assumption, according to the report, is that the peak electricity produced (1000 GWh) will always be in demand on the international market, Warringa noted. <p/> Ms Živčičeva noted that the report also states that the investment programme does not follow the principles of cost-benefit analysis because no realistic alternative for the investment is given. ""The investment programme neither proves that the investment in unit 6 is the best alternative, which should be supported by a state guarantee and the risk should be borne by the state, nor that Teš 6 is the best alternative for energy supply in Slovenia,"" she said. <p/> Piotr Trzaskowski of the CEE Bankwatch Network pointed out that the involvement of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the project is not proof of a reliable economic assessment of the project. He warned that previous Slovenian governments had failed to do their homework and that if the project is granted a state guarantee for the EIB loan, Slovenian taxpayers will pay for their mistakes with their own money. <p/> ""Now that new errors are being revealed in the calculations of the economic bases for Teš 6, the two public European banks have the opportunity to recognise their initial mistake and withdraw from this bad project while they still can. If we add to the errors identified in the report the errors in the procurement of Teš 6, we see that this project has the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the EBRD and the EIB,"" Trzaskowski stressed. <p/> The report was commissioned by the environmental organisations CEE Bankwatch Network and Focus, with financial support from the European Climate Foundation, and prepared by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. <p/> The report will be sent to current and future parliamentarians and government representatives. <p/> The CE Delft report confirms that the Teš 6 project is ""an economically misguided or unjustified investment"", according to Zares Vice President Darja Radić, also a former Minister of the Economy. She recalled that, as a portfolio minister, she had proposed to the government to reject the state guarantee for Teš 6. Among other things, she had stated at the time that the project was economically too risky on key parameters - the price of coal, the price of CO2 credits, the size of the investment and the price of electricity. <p/> As Radićeva also wrote in a press release, the CE Delft report found methodological errors by the investment promoters on the first two parameters: the price of coal and the price of CO2 credits. They conclude that the coal price is underestimated and the cost of CO2 emissions is also underestimated.",News,train
363,"The opposition SDS party, headed by former Prime Minister Janez Janša, has submitted proposals to Parliament for measures and 5 laws to improve the economic and social crisis. The starting point is the claim ""Slovenia entered the crisis in good shape"", which SDS and J.J. MPs keep repeating. It is true that the period from 2004 to 2008 was a very successful one, both in this country and in the world, but on the other hand, both in the world and in this country, it has been shown that high economic growth and prosperity are based on unrealistic foundations, that a giant inflated bubble has been created which has infamously burst. Slovenia, led by the government of Janez Janša, unfortunately made some big, irreparable mistakes in this ""golden age"", which are plaguing us today in the crisis: Firstly, it did not make the necessary structural changes in any of these favourable times, it did not invest enough in knowledge, research and technological progress. For example, in 2008, the Janša Government allocated a whole million euros for technological and scientific projects in small and medium-sized enterprises; now the figure is already EUR 14 million. Second: In otherwise good times, it has run up huge debts (e.g. motorways were built entirely on credit during this period), it has not reduced the deficit, and what is more, it has even increased it during these fat cow years. Thus, in 2008, gross indebtedness increased by 161 compared with 2004, or from 57% of GDP to 112% of GDP. In order to embellish the balance sheet of your term of office with the accounts, you were prepared to create and trigger a crisis of international proportions because we were not prepared to approve a fictitious budget surplus. The new Government and the crisis that awaited it as soon as it began its work was an empty treasury, nothing, a hole. What is more, the J.J. Government left the new Government full of uncovered bills for pre-election promises that had yet to be found through budget adjustments: money for the extremely damaging public sector wage reform, and thus wage increases that will give us a massive headache, money for student meals, for free nursery schools for the second child ... The previous Government could not have left us a worse bill of goods than yours, Mr Janša. And last but not least, it was the previous Government that allowed and silently monitored the granting of tycoon credits for management takeovers in the so-called state-owned banks NLB and NKBM, which our MEP Vili Trofenik first pointed out, but the information was hidden from him, Minister Bajuk dodged and then disappeared somewhere. Much of the high economic growth was based on credit-financed accelerated construction activity, which also pushed up inflation. Many companies, which were more or less strongly influenced by the state and managed by dedicated personnel close to the government of the day, got into trouble, performed badly and are today on the verge of collapse: Interevropa, Luka Koper, Paloma, Elan, Hit. Not to mention, in particular, the controversial operations at Dravske elektrarne (21 million credit to the Maribor diocese), Eles (financing of Canadian rowers, and Pavlin's Olympics), or the unreasonable decision to build a new building for the Ministry of the Interior, the absurd and excessive purchase of Patrias and a warship, the 200 million increase in the cost of the construction of Block 6 at TEŠ due to the delay in issuing the consent, the inadequate management of the construction of oncology, paediatric and neurological clinics, the new emergency room at the KC ... sad and wasteful stories, which I list with one purpose and one question: do the successors and creators and promoters of all this really have the moral right to criticise, to smarten up, to offer themselves as great saviours? Is it not all just a disguised manoeuvre to divert attention from their own culpability and complicity? The fact is that the previous J.J. Government is unequivocally co-responsible for the difficult situation in which SLO finds itself at the moment. <p/> For a long time, the SDS and the Government of J.J. did not want to and did not acknowledge the crisis that was already prevailing in the world. It was not concerned about the high rise in inflation, which we in Zares, especially our MEP Matej Lahovnik, have been pointing to as the first sign of an unhealthy situation in the economy. Last autumn, you were still saying out loud that there was no crisis in Slovenia and that there would be no crisis, you were doing everything you could to play down the public's predictions of trouble, and you were saying all the time that Slovenia would not be affected by the financial crisis. When the crisis was already here, when experts (e.g. Umar) were already opposing Virjant's public sector wage reform, Virjant was still pushing ahead, and it is precisely this move that has led to the most criticism from the OECD, which is why we are having major problems in the budget. <p/> J.J. said at the Brdo conference on managing the economic crisis a few days ago that the anti-crisis measures of the current Government are ill-advised, those in power do not know what to do, they should rely only on others. Are things really as simple as they are explained by omniscient saviours such as former ministers Vizjak, Grims, Černač ... The whole world is in crisis, the leaders of individual countries are looking for different rescue measures, groping around in the dark, so to speak: some things are proving to be appropriate and effective, others are like a shot in the dark. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists are not unanimous, economists think differently, individual governments look for different ways. Each country has to find its own appropriate way of dealing with the crisis, and in doing so we have to be aware that Slo is not an isolated island, that our economy, which is predominantly an export economy, is influenced by other economies. It is even more true that the resources at our disposal to deal with the crisis are very limited, and we need to think hard about what measures to direct them towards. Is the deliberate and prudent action of the current Government really a harmful delay? Are the measures really unwise, or is it perhaps just a case of recognising that it is really easy for the opposition to propose measures because it does not have to think about global finance, debt, sustainability ... Is it not perhaps just too easy to propose tax cuts and relief in all sorts of areas, while at the same time offering a whole range of 'gifts' such as contributions towards the purchase of housing for young families or a new car - nice, no less. But is it not better to help Revoz and the many manufacturers of parts for the car industry in Slovenia directly than to help the entire global car industry and, in particular, car dealers and car sellers in Slovenia.The Government has prepared a comprehensive response, and we in the Zares Group of MEPs support it. We believe that it has acted appropriately, with the first two packages of measures being prepared primarily to stabilise the financial system, ensure the liquidity of banks and provide funds for the normal operation of businesses. A number of measures were also adopted to ensure better and more efficient absorption of EU funds. The second part of the measures was aimed at preserving jobs, both by encouraging shorter working hours and by encouraging and increasing funds for development investment. The OECD assessed that the measures to help banks were adequate but not yet working. Much can certainly be expected from the guarantee schemes, which have long been blocked because of a veto by the Council of State. In the meantime, 1 500 new companies and 15 000 new jobs have been created with state aid as a result of the measures. We are now facing the coordination and adoption of the measures in the third package. The vast majority of them are generally considered to be good and appropriate. Slovenia needs to find the right mix of measures, given its specificities (e.g. the fact that it generates 70% of its GDP from exports), that will work on the money supply, on the demand for goods and investment and on entrepreneurial activity, but also those that will mitigate the social consequences of the crisis. <p/> A word about the broader dimensions of the SDS and its most exposed members. It is a deliberate action in several directions:first, we are witnessing an increasingly serious and threatening behaviour in the National Assembly, aimed at giving the impression that the functioning of Parliament is anarchic, uncontrollable, full of procedural evasions, procedural gymnastics, creating the impression of an emergency, deliberately prolonged debates, blockages in the work of committees, extraordinary sessions, etc. The Government's performance is portrayed as poor, inadequate, mismanaged, delayed, insufficient, based on internal frictions and inefficiencies. Behind such inflammatory criticism, there is a tacit hope that the Government might lose its compass and stumble into inappropriate and ill-considered solutions that could lead to even greater outrage. But we in the Zares Group of Deputies believe that it is precisely times of crisis that require a lot of talks, coordination, clashing of opinions and concepts of views, social dialogue... In times of crisis, the impression is created that we need a more firm and decisive, authoritative hand, and SDS is already offering it in a certain way. But such a hand can very quickly become a leaden hand. What is happening? People today no longer believe in moderate and reasonable solutions, they are not satisfied with small steps in times of need, they demand quick and radical moves. They are demanding that the guilty be found, that convictions and punishments be handed down, that the scoundrels be dealt with, that there be more order and discipline. And it is not difficult to invite such people, in need and in trouble, into the streets, to goad them against the real and imaginary culprits of their plight, and this is a wonderful warm bed, as Boštjan M. Zupančič says, for various forms of fascism, chauvinism and psychopaths of all kinds. And times of crisis are already known in psychiatry as a paradise for psychopaths. These are already very dangerous matters, which I hope will not be played out in the SLO.In your proposal for measures, you also set out your analysis of the crisis and said that capitalism will emerge from the crisis better, also in value terms, because of its flexibility. A very outdated and ossified mentality. Indeed, many of us are pointing out that economic growth and the model of prosperity that it generates, and that has so far guided global economic growth as a neoliberal and financial model, has not produced good results. It has benefited only a narrow, privileged group, with the rich getting richer and richer, the poor getting poorer and poorer, with capital and ownership privileged and labour deeply undervalued and humiliated and excluded from decision-making. These models were close to your government for most of its mandate (after all, you substantially reduced taxes on the richest, you did not tax wealth) and it was only at the end of your mandate that you started to advocate a social model of the market economy in the light of the forthcoming elections and the poor public image. The current economic growth model is therefore, in our view, socially unjust and, given the limited natural opportunities and goods and the disregard for nature, ecologically unacceptable. Politics also bears a heavy share of the blame for this, as it has been deeply complicit in unethical and immoral behaviour, where power and money have been the only sacred things. Quick money without work. And corruption has become socially acceptable behaviour and the norm. Unfortunately, it has also become rampant in our country and, unfortunately, it has become particularly rampant in recent years, under your government. <p/> Let me conclude my presentation of the Zares Group's views on the measures with a direct assessment of the proposals: <p/> among the measures there are many good, useful and appropriate ones, which the Government will take into account <p/> a whole series of measures that you want to present as your own are merely copied, regurgitated, and are taken verbatim from those already announced and published by the Government <p/> many of the proposed measures are clearly unrealistic, populist, and prepared in order to achieve quick kiss-and-meet-you-good-effects. <p/> While the measures were rejected as inappropriate in the Committee, we would like to stress that, for two reasons in particular <p/> Firstly, as this is only a consideration of the decision that the DZ supports the package of measures, but cannot intervene in their substance, amend or supplement them, the decisions as they stand make it impossible to consider and define each one of them. So in a way: take it or leave it - all or nothing. Is this really what the proposers are saying: that they would like to cooperate and propose to the Government, to help - but their proposal is such that it is virtually untouchable. A very self-important and omniscient move, so to speak. <p/> And secondly: it is an unstoppable and inappropriate method of mixing up normal and established powers between the two branches of government - between the powers that Parliament has and those that the Government has as the executive branch of government. Measures are not merely a matter of setting out a principled direction, but rather of providing concrete guidance for binding action, which is a matter for the Government. The Government must continue to be the policy-maker of the country, which must otherwise be bound by the frameworks set by the National Assembly. What the proponents of the measures are proposing, however, would fundamentally interfere with the role of the Government, even limiting and making it impossible. This, too, suggests that there is, after all, a deliberate dismantling of the three branches of government, as is also indicated by some of the amendments to the Constitution for the Second Republic that are being proposed at the same time. This is already a very dangerous game. That is why we in the Zares Group will not support the measures.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

373,"It's like the Slovenian government without Dimitri Rupel, hehe. 1 I am writing this after watching yesterday's Trends. I stopped watching the show some time ago (mainly because of the lack of culture and unprofessional guests), but after a huge outpouring of black bile, I decided to watch it anyway to see where all the anger came from. Let me add my little finger to the debate for the time being. <p/> The point revolved around Michael Jarc, who wants to call a local referendum on the building of a mosque. I don't know the exact question (and, coyotes of journalism, they haven't published it anywhere - more proof of how much they care about the truth as long as it pops! ), but it seems to me that he doesn't want to completely block the building of a mosque, maybe just some minarets and/or accompanying sports facilities. This question has already been answered by the Constitutional Court, which ruled on a similar issue in 2004. At that time it stated: <p/> 35. From the foregoing it can be concluded that the objective pursued by the contested regulation is to restrict the right under Article 41(1) of the Constitution. However, such an objective is inadmissible in the light of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, according to which human rights may be restricted only for the sake of the rights of others (and in the cases provided for by this Constitution), because it is only for the purpose of restricting a right and not for the simultaneous protection of the rights of others. <p/> Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Decision calling the referendum is incompatible with the right to the free exercise of religion. Thus, the interference proves to be constitutionally impermissible already on the basis of an assessment under the so-called legitimacy test, and therefore the Constitutional Court did not need to engage in a further assessment of its excessiveness. <p/> So nothing will happen with the envisaged referendum. Although this did not stop Jelincic from (as always) starting a dispute 2 - although he then coldly told Becirovic to his face that he was a fool for equating him with Haider. The ever-noble Member is certainly as cunning as a pretzel, although the wiser ones are quick to overlook him. Once you have acquired some legal knowledge, he comes off as pathetic when he is clinging to the Slovenian Constitution and when he wants to lecture Mire Senica while the latter looks thoughtfully into the distance through the camera, inventing synonyms for his interlocutor in his head, without batting an eyelid. <p/> It seems to be popular lately for lawyers to engage pro bono only for cases that have the potential to be highly publicised in the media (Čeferin in Strojanovi PRESS) - lawyers are not allowed to (only) advertise. Andrej Saje also provided a newsflash bomb by saying that he wished the Islamic community all the best in the construction of their building, as he wanted everyone to have equal opportunities in terms of religion. OK, I guess we're not in the 14th century anymore and the Church has managed to civilise itself a bit and they're no longer impaling heretics on stakes or handing them over to the secular authorities to be cremated. But at least a little bit of rancour wouldn't hurt, no. At least a crude observation about the wrong God, pretty please? Well, it's not as if everyone is saying that the other side belongs to the wrong God and so, after taking all the creeds into account, we'll all be burned in Hell together. Or what? <p>Let us return to the mosque. As far as the morons have been and fallen out, everyone has one iota of a point. So, to combine them all into one (of) sentence. We definitely need a mosque. There is a good percentage of Muslims in Slovenia, and I do not see how it can benefit all of them to deny them a place to gather and a chance to practice their religion. We should not turn a blind eye - there are around 50 local places of worship in Slovenia, and the Orthodox faith also has its own church. The second issue is architectural. Very interestingly, Jelincic has pulled out a regulation from the naphthalene, which says that the building must be A metres away from the railway tracks 3. It must be appropriate to the surroundings or respect the architectural guidelines of the surroundings 4 As I am informed, the minaret is not compulsory, nor is the circular shape of the central building. I was also a bit disturbed by the picture showing a supposed mosque (although no tender/competition has yet been carried out), around which there is a hefty pile of sports and other facilities. It is true that they themselves know best what they need to carry out the precepts of their religion, and that even the Catholic Church has a house next door where ... er, well, yes ... religion takes place. However, the suggestion of tennis courts, a gym and a football pitch seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. After all, they (read the Arab Emirates) will be paying for everything themselves, so let them afford it if they can. <p/>After watching this, I'm not any more convinced that I'll start watching the Dren Dren Dren Dren Dren again, because they're on an even lower level than before. Uroš Slak really gives the impression that he only invites such guests autonomously for the sake of shouting, because when it flares up, he can't seem to extinguish it or turn the flow of the shouting conversation around. Apparently, they really cannot agree on anything or come to common conclusions, all that matters is the show, the shit and the stupidity. Anyway, I am in favour of the mosque (not exactly there and then and there, as they imagine in Trends, but let's wait for the actual tender) and I think that once it is built, there will finally be peace around this subject, which is being blown up to the proportions of a galaxy quite unnecessarily. So far, I have not seen anyone stoning a cuckolded man in an Orthodox church, or anyone burning down the home of a neighbour because he invites his friends to pray there. <p/> Or would you rather have a semi-stealing series called Brother to Brother, which costs EUR 1.5 million, and therefore we get True Reality cancelled because they cannot scratch together EUR 50 000? Although, somehow, it seems to me that this is more of an excuse to turn the national broadcaster into a brainwashing car wash, in the same way that it is now popular to lay off workers during a 'global crisis'. <p/> Anyway, every now and then I laugh at / marvel at the bizarreness of our professionals when they want to get into computing or the Internet - in today's case, it will be the legal profession. Sandra Cico, a lawyer, as a representative of the Association for the Protection of Audio-Visual Works, has sent the two sheets below to some (where is T-2, for example? ? ? ? ) Slovenian Internet access providers, demanding that they be blocked from accessing the torrent tracker PirateBay.org. It gives them 24 hours, then threatens them with legal and criminal proceedings. <p/> I understand the legal profession and the wishes of their clients, especially if one of them is about to receive a pile of money. However, this 'letter' is both legally and technically misguided. OK, they get the plaudits because they obviously know what an IP range is and what a tracker is, but for everything else I do not know whether to blame the ignorance of the law firm or the nepotism of Association 1. I would never dare to send such a request myself, even if local factors were very strong and very persistent. <p/> Banning the Internet, or parts of it, is ridiculous, impossible and slightly totalitarian. We all remember when udba.net hit - we streamed masses of scanned lists, searched there for our enemies and a few days later we were surprised by a fucking ""blackout"". Of course, the real geeks found themselves, and we grabbed some politically incorrect proxy and went back to the hilarious history of Danilo Potnik, Win Parachute and Ivan Janša. So the demand to ban a particular site is very ineffective, but it is also undemocratic - if memory serves, I pay for uninterrupted access to the entire web, if anyone has done anything illegal there, let them get on with it, leave the other users alone. <p/> The legal aspect can be problematic, especially because (as we are used to) the subject is not regulated with sufficient precision, let alone extensive case law. The requirement is interesting in its own way because it obliges Internet access providers to ban a site as if they had something to do with it (in Sweden, hello? ! ). The old Slovenian Penal Code knew a nice institution, cascading liability. It was really only for responsible editors, printers, etc., but we could follow that model. Of course, if the KZ-1 had not completely abolished cascading liability. Why? Well, the Minister's answer is as ""convincing"" as abolishing relative limitation periods. <p/> Liability on the Internet would go something like this: first, of course, the author, whose identification can become a whole project on the Internet, as there are plenty of tools for anonymisation. Second in line would be the webmaster. I'm not really talking about a webmaster per se, I'm thinking more of SiOL with its nest of blogs that anyone can open. If we couldn't get to that point, or if he was hiding in the Philippines, the domain owner would come into play, in very extreme cases of course. That is kind of where it all ends for my taste. It certainly ends with the Internet access providers, because, firstly, there is simply too much traffic for anyone to be able to monitor all their subscribers, and secondly, this requirement is absurd, because then, for example, all the providers in the world are responsible for the illegal streaming of copyright content via PirateBay, whose subscribers are, in a communist way, sharing games, music, programmes, porn amongst themselves. It is like the passengers on the trains in Madrid in 2004 suing the train company because a bomb was planted there by terrorists. The providers are just offering Internet access and there is no logic in having anything to do with something that someone creates and puts on a server at the other end of the Earth. <p/> Finally, a reflection for all the budding Slovenian pirates - THEIR responsibility in downloading illegal content from various trackers. Too many of them are brave, because so far there have been no serious / mass / high-profile police actions in Slovenia targeting anyone other than the traffickers, so they go around the forums shouting and beating their chests that nobody can do anything to them, while at the same time citing some EU directives and regulations. Let me disappoint you, oh, dear fellow-travellers. The Criminal Code (even the new one, strange that they have not abolished these things yet) knows about the infringement of copyright and other rights, which Sandra Cico already refers to - Articles 148 and 149 of the CC-1 are recommended reading. Add to that Article 38 - aiding and abetting (in the commission of a crime) and you have the perpetrator, streaming illegal content from the web. This applies to all ""ordinary"" pirates as well as to trackers (Filebits, Partis, Slobytes, etc.). This is really only a theoretical construct, and I cannot imagine Slovenian police officers and prosecutors looking at the troves of data on seized computers or 12 geeks sitting in court. After all, maybe we can look forward to live blogging, heh. <p/> As for these societies, it seems to me that we have quite a lot of them in Slovenia, although most of the time we don't hear anything intelligent from them, but it's more like air stirring. [ ] <p/> It is the title of a textbook on the Turkish invasions of Slovenian territory by Vasko Simoniti. And every time a multi-tourism kinastera comes to my mind, I start thinking about a topic related to culture. Today, I am going to get stuck into our beloved Slovenian language and spelling, or rather, into their squinting. <p/> Let's start with food. Hello. Olive oil. I have never heard a more butthurt word. Just as the oil itself became very fancy - almost art - when Jamie Oliver unhygienically poured it over arugula and parmesan. And it has also suddenly become artful to call it OIL. Let's go slowly: we know the tree that borders on the shrub, Olea europaea, that is, OLIVE. So, by induction, we find that the logical name for it is OLIVE fucking OIL. Mainly because it is the delicious olive that goes into the press, not just the tree - the olive. True, the SSKJ allows both terms, but olive is completely redundant. Especially since some SSKJ authors suggest the word crack for bun. Mhm. <p/>The other part, where there are untold problems, is the overlapping or, in the vernacular, umlauts. There are usually no peculiarities in the writing, except that the Council on Kanal A will apparently have to quickly upgrade the encoding to UTF-8 or change the font, because surnames with ü's are written as ue, although it is true that Slavoj Žižek is always left without a cross (above his head) abroad. It's the pronunciation that gets complicated. <p/> At the end of last year, we got a third President of the Republic, Danilo Türk, who won by a large margin. But even today there are some people (most of them in 24 hours on POP TV) who find it difficult to pucker their lips for the letter u and pronounce the letter i. All too often, however, they hear the disparaging Tirk; the unforgiving call him Turk (Zmago Padalec PRESS). Hans-Gert Pöttering, the current President of the European Parliament, is suffering a similar fate. He is most often rechristened Pottering or Petering. But it is the same, who would even bother! <p/> After a hard lesson, it is always good to relax / have fun, so take a look at how the new President Türk is perceived by the legends Ivan and Miro Serpentinšek, sorry, Serppentinschäck.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

At home I look at the spoke, which didn't seem to be anything special, the length is one of the standard ones I think. I needed a 1,8 mm diameter spoke, 260 mm long. <p/> I start to surf the web, but somehow without any visible results. Clearly a component that sellers don't put in the online shop, well at least most don't. Much to my disappointment, apparently such a spoke is only made by NASA or some top secret military laboratory. Without exaggeration, I called 10 shops in Ljubljana and I did not get the case I wanted. All our dear sellers have are 2,0 or 2,0-1,8-2,0 diameter spokes (the middle thinned), of course they wanted to sell me the ones they have. The 11th shop had them in stock and my problem was almost solved. Picking a colour would have been a bold challenge to fate. It is even the case that they cannot even order spokes, some of the friendly salesmen checked with the importer. <p/> Not that a colleague had a similar problem not long ago. He couldn't buy the spokes he has on his Specialized from shops that sell the same bike. Some time ago I was looking for a spoke for a Kono Stab, where the spoke is of three different thicknesses. The result was the same. <p/> Now that I've eased my mind a little, we can move on to the technical side of changing spokes, in video form of course.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

382,"Coats of arms in the Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle <p/> 17.09.10 Author: Aleksander Hribovšek <p/> The Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle is the only major architectural monument in Slovenia that is decorated with coats of arms and commemorates the former regency. Its present appearance shows the most important architectural elements of its Gothic base and Baroque superstructure. The history of the construction reveals two layers of time. The first dates back to 1489, when Emperor Frederick III established a benefice at the castle in honour of St George, St Pancras and St Helena, and the second to the additions made after 1616. The exact year of the beginning of the construction is not known, but it was certainly built before the foundation of the benefice. <p/> The castle chapel is mainly decorated with the coats of arms of the governors of Carniola who served in Ljubljana from 1261 to 1742. They were painted by Abraham Kaltschmied, a copper-engraver, draughtsman and engineering lieutenant at the time, when Count Corbinian of Saurauški was the head of the provincial Estates. The regional governors were the chiefs of the land, alongside the Emperor, the supreme ruler. They were at the head of the Land Estates and the Land Administration. They were appointed by the rulers on the proposal of the provincial Estates. The governor administered the land and was the supreme judge, taking orders from the ruler and presiding over the provincial assemblies. Initially, he was the king's deputy, but during the interregnum he was deputy to the various rulers who briefly held the land. The Habsburgs retained the office of governor, who became deputy to the Prince of the Land and commander of the Land's army, as well as president of the Land's Diet. <p/> The coats of arms in the chapel can be divided into three groups: on the north, west and south walls are painted the coats of arms of the sixty Land Governors of Carniola, followed by the coats of arms of the five Austrian rulers on the chancel ceiling, and the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscape on the ceiling to round off the whole composition; the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscapes are on the chapel ceiling. The chapel was first decorated with them between 1742 and 1747. The first year, 1742, is on the painting plan held by the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia (ARS), while the year 1747 is painted in the chapel itself, next to an inscription stating that the coats of arms were to be restored in that year, but this may be an error and the coats of arms may have been painted for the first time at that time. The chapel was probably also restored in 1849, when the west wall and its armorial decoration were demolished. In 1915 the chapel was rebuilt again, this time after the earthquake. In the late 1980s, a final and thorough restoration began, which was completed in the early 1990s, including the west wall, and the coats of arms were to be restored to their original appearance. At least roughly. <p/> Miha Preinfalk from the Scientific Research Centre of the SAZU and Prof. Barbara Žabota, Professor of History and Sociology, examined the fate of the coats of arms in St George's Chapel at the beginning of the new millennium (see bottom of the page), from the time of their creation to the present day, and pointed out the many discrepancies and mistakes that occurred during the renovations. They also give five lists of the coats of arms depicted and compare them. We will concentrate on the first two only. The first list gives the probable state of the original painting and is based on the 1742 painting plan. The basis for its creation (not only the content, form and order of the inscriptions, but also the coats of arms themselves and their heraldic style) is the list of regional governors in Valvasor's Slav of the Duchy of Carniola (the first fifty-six governors). Whether Valvasor's list is historically accurate or not is of secondary importance for our presentation of the coats of arms. The second list shows the present state after the last renovation, as visitors can see it on the walls of the chapel. <p/>There are considerable differences between the lists themselves in terms of variations in the form of the inscriptions (e.g. MAJNHARD or MAYHART), minor sloppiness (e.g. SEVFNIG instead of SEVENIG) or errors (e.g. BERG. instead of BEGR. "" begraben "" or buried), which probably occurred during the restorations. Also, the 12 coats of arms have incorrect years. Errors are also found among the regnal coats of arms. Thus, the correct date of death of Archduke Charles is in fact 10 July 1590, and not as indicated in the first and second lists, which are compared below. Duchess Mary (wife of the aforementioned Archduke Charles) was not the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bohemia, as shown in the current situation or in the second list, but in fact the daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria (BOEHMEN instead of BAYERN), as the coat-of-arms image itself testifies. <p/> In the photographs below we can compare the two lists. The captions on the photographs show the current state of the frescoes on the walls of St George's Chapel, while the captions below the photographs show the first list, or the list based on the 1742 plan for the frescoes. <p/> Discrepancies and errors also occurred during the painting or restoration of the coats of arms. In most cases, where there has been a discrepancy, it is simply a case of using the wrong colour of a field or attribute, or sometimes of using the wrong pictorial template altogether.",Information/Explanation,train

390,"An applicant for a review of a public tender does not, under the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures, per se acquire the status of a party to an administrative dispute in which the administrative decision awarding the concession is challenged, which concludes a tendering procedure in which he did not participate. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, No U 2088/2001-9 of 30 January 2002 is confirmed. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the contested order, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the defendant's decision of 22.11.2001 under point 1 of the operative part of the order and dismissed the application for interim measures of 23.11.2001 under point 2 of the operative part of the order.By that decision granting a concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services, it was decided to grant the concession to M. d.d. for a period of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal, V., L. It was also decided that the concession shall include the right to use the frequency bands, to install the relevant public telecommunications network, to interconnect the network and that the concessionaire shall be obliged to ensure the operation of its network in accordance with the Regulation on the granting of concessions, with other regulations and with the concession contract, to pay a one-off non-refundable concession fee of 22 billion Slovenian tolls and to pay an annual fee for the use of the allocated part of the radio spectrum. The defendant published a public tender for the award of up to three concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia in the frequency bands 1900 MHz-1980 MHz, 2010 MHz-2025 MHz and 2110 MHz-2170 MHz in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 19/01 of 16.3.2001. The first call for tenders was unsuccessful because only one tender was received, and a new call for tenders for the award of the concession was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 46/01 of 8.6.2001. At the time of the opening of the tenders, the expert committee noted that five potential tenderers had submitted tender documents on the basis of the call for tenders, and that two tenders had been received within the time limit for submission of the tenders within the time limit for submission of tenders. One bid did not contain all the elements required in the tender documents and was therefore not considered. On 3.9.2001, the applicant submitted a request for review of the concession award procedure to the National Audit Office. By decision of 8.11.2001, the latter rejected the request for review. The concession award procedure, which had been suspended as a result of the submitted review, was continued. The expert committee, which drew up its report of 19.11.2001, found that the tender submitted by M.d.d. met the conditions of the tender documents. In the grounds of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgment that it had taken its decision to reject the application on the basis of the preliminary examination of the application under Article 34(1)(4) of the Administrative Disputes Act (CLA). A claimant in an administrative dispute can only be a person who has the status of an active party in the administrative proceedings, a person who has the status of a passive party and a person who has participated in the administrative proceedings as an intervener in order to protect his rights or legal interests. In the procedure for the award of the concession, in addition to the successful concessionaire, parties to the procedure may be those tenderers whose bids were not accepted. The tenders for the concession were submitted by M.d.d. and D.d.o.o. within the tendering period, but the applicant did not participate in the tender. In an administrative dispute challenging a decision taken in an administrative procedure in which the applicant was neither a party nor an intervener, the applicant does not have standing, since the contested decision clearly did not infringe its rights or direct interests based on the law. The applicant has not established the right or the legal interest to assert the claim alleged in the application and its active standing, which is a procedural prerequisite for bringing an administrative action, is not established. The applicant's request for a review of the procedure for the award of the concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services was rejected by decision of the State Audit Commission of 8.11.2001. Article 23(2) of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 78/99 and No 90/99) provides that there is no ordinary or extraordinary remedy against the decisions of the State Audit Board, but that an action may be brought before a competent court to seek damages from the contracting authority. Objections relating to the award procedure which have already been decided by the National Audit Office do not constitute legally relevant objections in the review procedure of the concession award decision. In the explanatory memorandum to 2. point 2 of the operative part of the judgment, the Court of First Instance stated that the applicant had not established that the decision challenged in the action infringed its rights or its direct interests based on the law, which is a procedural prerequisite for a decision on an application for an interim injunction under Article 69 of the Civil Procedure Code. This follows from the reasons set out in recital 1 of the operative part of the judgment, since the applicant has failed to establish its standing to bring the action. The Court of First Instance therefore dismissed the application for interim measures pursuant to Article 69(2) of the Civil Code. <p/> The applicant appeals on all three grounds set out in Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appellant claims that the Court of Appeal should set aside both points of the contested order and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a fresh decision. The applicant claims that it has standing to bring the action and the application for interim measures in the present proceedings. The Court of First Instance bases its position solely on the fact that the applicant did not submit a tender in response to the invitation to tender and thus did not participate directly as an active party or as a passive party or intervener. Such reasoning effectively limits the potential claimants in an administrative dispute exclusively to direct and formal parties to the procedure prior to the adoption of the administrative act, for which there is no legal basis in Article 18 of the CPL. The circle of potential claimants in an administrative dispute is much wider under that provision. Anyone who believes that an administrative act infringes a right or a direct benefit of his or her based on the law may be a claimant. The theory also recognises the active standing of a party who has not even formally participated in the administrative procedure, provided that he can, of course, establish or prove his legal interest. In a tendering procedure, the legal status of intervener within the meaning of Article 43 of the General Administrative Procedure Act cannot exist. It was only possible to participate in the tendering procedure as a tenderer or as an applicant for review under the Act on Review of Public Procurement Procedures. In the review procedure, the applicant was granted the status of a party and active standing. It is reasonable to assume that, taking into account the specificities of the tender procedure, the applicant was indeed a party to the tender procedure as an applicant for review and was granted such status by the defendant and the National Audit Office. It therefore considers that it had already demonstrated its legal interest in participating in the tendering procedure in the procedure preceding the defendant's decision by submitting a request for review, since it did not submit a tender on the ground that the tendering procedure was unlawful. It can therefore legitimately claim that the contested decision of the defendant, as an administrative act adopted in the context of a tendering procedure, infringes its rights and directly benefits. In fact, as a result of the illegality of the invitation to tender, the applicant lost the possibility of obtaining the concession which was the subject of the invitation to tender and which was finally awarded to M. by the contested administrative decision, as an act adopted in a procedure which the applicant claims to have been unlawful. It is untenable to hold that it has active standing to bring an application for review in the same proceedings in which, following the conclusion of those proceedings and the adoption of the administrative act, it does not have active standing to bring the action. Apart from the finding that the applicant did not submit its bid in the tendering procedure and the erroneous assertion that it did not assert or protect its rights in the concession award procedure, that is to say, in the tendering procedure, the Court of First Instance does not give any other substantive reasoning in the contested order. It did not serve the application and the application for interim measures on the defendant for a response. Nor did it hold the main hearing which had been requested in order to further substantiate the allegations by examining witnesses. It did not even state reasons for its decision, since it did not state the reasons on the decisive facts, which constitutes an absolute fundamental infringement of the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. By failing to hold a main hearing, the Court of First Instance substantially infringed the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. In addition, it erred and failed to fully establish the factual situation as regards the applicant's legal status and activities in the tendering procedure itself and its rights and direct benefits, and, as a consequence, it erred in substantive law in holding that the applicant did not have active legal standing to bring the action in the present proceedings. The applicant also has standing to bring an application for interim measures and, in accordance with the provisions of the CPL, fully maintains its application for interim measures in the present case. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant submits that the applicant cannot be a party to these proceedings as it lacks standing. The applicant did not submit a bid for the concession either in the first or in the re-tender. The fact that the applicant has already provided mobile telecommunications services does not automatically confer a legal interest in bringing the present action. Since it did not participate in the concession award procedure by submitting any tender, the concession award decision did not decide on its rights. The administrative measure therefore does not affect her rights or a legitimate interest. The possibility of exercising the right to obtain the concession ended with the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a complete tender for the invitation to tender. The fact that the applicant has been granted a legal interest in the review procedure before the National Audit Office does not automatically confer a legal interest in the administrative proceedings. In the proceedings before the National Audit Commission, the status of a party is determined by Article 9 of the Law on the review of public procurement procedures, whereas in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, it is determined by Article 18 of the CPL. Each law defines the active legal capacity of the parties in a different way. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures provides for a wider range of beneficiaries who may initiate a review procedure on the ground that an independent body is reviewing the legality of the public tender itself. Given that the party has been granted the status of party to the proceedings there, the competent authority has already assessed the legality of the call for tenders and rejected the request for review. The defendant submits, first of all, that the whole tendering procedure is unlawful and that it was therefore not possible for it to participate in the procedure. In the proceedings before the Administrative Court, however, the circle of persons with standing is narrower. It is for the competent court to determine whether the appellant's request to intervene is justified. Such a procedure prevents the chicanery of intervention by those who cannot show any prejudice and who would only make the proceedings more difficult for an active or passive party. The appellant therefore requests the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal as unfounded. <p/> The appeal is not well founded. <p/> In the Court of Appeal's view, the Court of First Instance was correct to dismiss the applicant's action on the basis of paragraph 34(1)(4) of Article 34(1) of the EC Treaty. <p/> of Article 34 of the CPL. The applicant's plea that it has active standing to bring an action in an administrative dispute is unfounded, since it relies on its indirect participation in the tendering procedure by virtue of the fact that it was the applicant in an application for review of a procurement procedure to which it was granted the status of a party. According to Article 18(1) of the CPL, a claimant may be an individual, a legal person, an organisation, a locality, a group of persons and others who consider that a right or a direct benefit of theirs based on a law has been infringed by an administrative act. However, according to the provision of Article 9 of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the RS, No 78/99), a request for review may be lodged by any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority, which is alleged in the request for review as a misconduct of the contracting authority in the procedure for awarding the public contract. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures is a specific regulation governing the legal protection of tenderers in public procurement procedures, which is implemented by reviewing the public procurement procedures defined in the Public Procurement Law, the bodies competent for the protection of the rights of tenderers and the procedure governing the work of the bodies under this Law. However, there is no ordinary or extraordinary legal remedy against a decision of the State Audit Board, only an action before a competent court of law to seek damages from the contracting authority. Given the purpose and object of this law, the active standing in a review procedure is substantively different from that in an administrative dispute. Any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and any person who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority may bring an action for review. For this reason, a party to a review of public procurement procedures does not per se acquire the status of a party to administrative litigation proceedings when the decision to award a concession is challenged. The decision to award a concession puts an end to the tendering procedure, and an action against such a decision may only be brought by persons fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18(1) of the CPL. In the present case, the request for review of the concession award procedure was examined by the National Audit Commission and the specific request of the defendant was rejected. The subject-matter of the administrative dispute cannot therefore be a repetition of the identical claim, which is in fact the applicant's claim. In an administrative procedure, the applicant could only assert a right or a direct benefit based on a right which would be infringed by the decision to grant the concession. The grant of the concession is not a right of the defendant. The defendant's only right in a tendering procedure for the award of a concession is to submit its tender to the contracting authority within the time-limit, on the same terms as the other participants. Neither the Telecommunications Act nor the Regulation on the granting of concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services gives rise to a direct benefit to the applicant based on the Act. It is apparent from the appellant's submissions that the defendant is only claiming an interest in fact in obtaining the concession, and is not demonstrating a legal interest by challenging the concession decision. In the present case, since there is neither a right nor a direct interest of the defendant based on the law which is infringed by the contested administrative measure, the Court of Appeal considers that the Court of First Instance was correct in its decision that the applicant had not established its active standing in the present administrative proceedings. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the action at the preliminary examination stage on the basis of Article 34(1)(4) of the CPL. At that stage of the proceedings, the Court of First Instance ruled exclusively on the applicant's standing, and therefore did not infringe the provision on the main hearing procedure (Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code), since it did not rule on the substance or examine the substance of the contested measure. Nor did it serve copies of the application for interim measures and the application for interim measures with annexes on the defendant at that stage of the proceedings. It does so only after it has not dismissed the action under Article 34 of the Civil Procedure Code or annulled the contested measure under Article 35(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or declared it void under Article 35(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court of First Instance also did not infringe the provision on the procedure in an administrative dispute (Article 72(3) of the CPL), since it based and explained its decision on the distinction between tendering, review and public procurement procedures and an administrative dispute (pages 3 and 4 of the judgment). <p/> The pleas in law alleging erroneous and incomplete findings of fact and incorrect application of the substantive law, however, relate only to the applicant's active standing. <The appellant's plea in law alleging that the application for interim measures was dismissed is also unfounded. The applicant does not have standing to bring an application for interim measures if it does not have standing to bring an action in administrative proceedings and, moreover, does not state on what grounds that that part of the order is unlawful. <p/> The Court of Appeal held that the grounds on which the applicant challenges the order of the Court of First Instance are not established. Nor are the grounds on which the Court of First Instance is required to act of its own motion. It therefore dismissed the appeal as unfounded on the basis of Article 73 in conjunction with Article 68 of the CLA and upheld the order of the Court of First Instance.",Legal,train

399,"The seventh solo book by Metka Klevišar, a physician and journalist, Goreči grm (Burning Bush), was published by the Celjska Mohorjeva družba.

That human life is not perfect, that it contains not only achievements but also failures. <p/> Klevišarjeva found the inspiration for her book The Burning Bush among her notes on spirituality in the dying, but it made more sense to her to talk about spirituality in everyday life - and that is the subtitle of the book. She believes that spirituality is everyone's business, whether they are religious or not, and whatever their faith. She wanted to convey in a simple way that spirituality is ""the mystery of life, which we cannot explain, but each person interprets in his own way"". <p/> The book Letters of St Vincent to St Ludovica was published on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St Vincent de Paul and St Ludovica de Marillac. In collaboration with the Daughters of Christian Charity - the Daughters of Charity, of which St Ludovica was the founder, a Sister of that Order, Cveta Jost, has collected and edited the 421 surviving letters written by St Vincent to St Ludovica. The correspondence, she says, is a valuable document of the times, revealing the misery of 17th-century France and the efforts of both saints to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. <p/> Robert Cvetek's painful past resonated with readers, and the Celje Mohorjeva družba has published a reprint or slightly revised edition.

400,"Fairy tales and stories <p/> ABOUT Fairy tales and songs <p/> Children, do you like fairy tales and songs? I love them so much! It's cold outside and I'm writing these animal stories for you. My thoughts rush back to my childhood in the Slovenian Highlands. I see our family - the Ježe family, we were told - gathered in a vineyard around a kerosene lamp. Mica is reading stories, my father is mending shoes, the rest of us are shelling pumpkins for oil, sifting buckwheat for kasha sausages, shredding corn off the cob for corn fritters or sifting beans. Some women spin. <p/> No, I can't say that the somewhat pale light of the kerosene lamp made my childhood any sadder, on the contrary, it was quite joyful, full of curiosity, longing and duty.... <p/> In the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows in the corners and haylofts were full of fears, especially when our neighbour Ferdinand - the eternal young man - told us about the enchanted queens in the enchanted castle, about the dragon who had come for the castle's daughter, about the serpent in the spring, about the witches, the devil, the goblins, and about death. Fairy tales about the nuns and the judges must have been told to each other by the ancient Slavs. And Ferdinand had to tell us the happy one about the ""ass-gold"" several times. <p/> It was cold outside. Snow covered the hill and down the hill, and smoke from the chimneys of the dwarf wood-houses was drawn straight up into the sky, across which the mysterious moon passed from time to time. But it was warm behind the frosted shutters. A fire crackled in the stove or in the cooker. Somewhere in the distance, on another hill, dogs barked and howled at the pale moon... <p/> At that time, when I was young, nature was still clean. There was laughter and weeping, songs and quarrels, and then again visits, feasts, baptisms, funerals and carols. <p/> Today, all that is very different. After the first, a second war, four years of suffering and misery each time. Between the wars, life changes. The Partisans liberated our homeland, we erected memorials to our dead heroes. We began to live a new life, as our greatest hero, Tito, had envisioned in his early youth. <p/> Today, instead of a kerosene lamp in the middle of a pile of beans on the table, a light bulb from the ceiling glows. Electricity lights, heats, drives machines and cooks. Today, it is not Ferdinand telling the neighbour's fairy tales. We sit in front of the television and see and hear what is happening in our homeland and far beyond. We talk long distances and call acquaintances by pressing the electric bell... <p/> We could hardly have dreamt of all this in our youth. But nature was cleaner, wider and quieter. Perhaps at carnivals or at feasts, village musicians would swish. And on occasions, the song came straight from the throat, not from the radio or from gramophone records. It came from the heart, our beautiful Slovenian song. <p/> The past turned into memories. I can still see my mother looking after me when I go out into the world, to art, to Golden Prague. After many years, I have returned to my Slovenian hills, among you, to tell you some animal tales, sing a song, make a clay sculpture and paint a picture.

He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads... <p/> To a random chimp like myself, it is easy to believe that the human imagination knows no bounds. Imagine, then, whose skin you would jump into, where you would fly to, if your thoughts did not keep crashing into the walls of reality. It would be nice to be a chicken in a world without a poultry industry, or a mediocre chair, immune to the jaws of a leech and the embrace of neurotically sweaty buttocks... maybe a piece of still-warm, newly born faeces... Imagine how popular they would be with the flies. What we would all be if our minds could defy change and not reflect shadows. The shadows of the moratorium of a postadolescence that persistently doubts. <p/> No doubt, this is the submission of a bookishly moody moth who will fancy that this is what it is today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads. The motif of the ascetic who ventures across a vast, mostly inhospitable landscape to find himself in the isolation of isolation is a frequent one in Australian literature. This motif has, in fact, developed into a national mythology, and has thus helped to shape Australian cultural identity, certainly among the white, immigrant population. Aborigines have an ascetic for lunch, just as Australians have kangaroos. <p/> Anyway, in The Imaginary Life we are placed in ancient times, in the shoes of the witty Roman poet Ovid, who is no ordinary, voluntary ascetic. We know from glimpses of his real life that he was the celebrated author of the Metamorphoses, a poet who knew how to articulate most beautifully the lazy decadence of his time, a man who not only moved in the heartland but was the very heart of Roman high society. And the heart is that missing part of the human toolbox which the then Emperor Augustus forgot when, for reasons unknown to us, he had Ovid exiled to the very edge of the Roman Empire, to an emergency civilised barbarian settlement. The unfortunate poet was left without bread, without games. And for him, the fiction is just beginning. <p/> In the emptiness of the desert landscape, Ovid of Maloof finds himself in profound silence, for Latin is not the barbarians' personal hygiene. The saddened poet is left with no choice but to put on his hair, roll in shit and surrender to the unbearability of silence. At this point, we find ourselves in the framework of a colonial discourse, which is expressed through the absence of a familiar environment, language and, consequently, an unresolved identity. <p/> The author thus focuses on the mental aporias and inner conflicts of the protagonist rather than on a narrative description of his surroundings. Here, however, the novel's multilayered nature gradually comes to the fore, leaving its central motif open to a multitude of interpretations. Is An Imaginary Life a novel about the search for identity and the importance of language in shaping it, a poetic reflection on the nature of life and death, on transcending boundaries in the landscape and in ourselves, on maturing through relationships with others? It leaves the layers of meaning to the horizon of imagination and thinking beyond the anxieties of civilisation. <p/> The cynicism of the cultivated poet Ovid, however, begins to diminish when he encounters the Child, a wild boy from the nearby forest. The little unsocialised hairy creature, who croaks, howls and generally disregards the behavioural patterns of the proudly standing specimens of modern homo sapiens, gradually reveals to him that civilisation is not an incurable disease. The story ends in an embrace of existentialist kitsch and pantheistic idealisations about nature. Flower children will thus be thrilled to read Imaginary Life. Lonely cowboys will be enlightened.

So-called ""social"" SMOKING and passive SMOKING, i.e. SMOKING where you inhale cigarette smoke from other smokers, can also be harmful to your health. These are as dangerous to the blood vessels, heart and lungs as regularly SMOKING several cigarettes a day. <p/> People tend to fear lung cancer when they smoke, which usually takes years to develop, but cigarette smoke starts poisoning our bodies with its 7,000+ chemicals as soon as we take our first ""smoke"". Damage is caused to the cells of almost every organ. ""That one smoke can be the cause of a heart attack,"" explains Regina M. Benjamin, a well-known American surgeon who advises people to avoid smoking, as well as second-hand smoke. <p/>A recent report on the impact of cigarettes and cigarette smoke says that any inhalation of cigarette smoke is harmful to health. Dr Terry Pechacek from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warns of the dangers of passive smoking. Inhaled cigarette smoke immediately enters the bloodstream and changes its chemistry, making the blood more sticky and putting it at immediate risk of clots, especially if the person has a pre-existing blood vessel problem. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals, 43 of which are known carcinogens. There are also several toxins in the smoke, such as nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, etc. Within six seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine reaches the brain. In small amounts it acts as a stimulant, but in larger amounts it already interferes with brain function and affects the heart, blood vessels and hormones. <p/> L&M makers reveal cigarette ingredients <p/> An American tobacco company has revealed a long-kept secret about the ingredients in L&M cigarettes, which are also available on Slovenian shelves. The move by the Liggett Group follows efforts by the state of Massachusetts to require all manufacturers to disclose all cigarette ingredients on cigarette packs, which most tobacco factories have so far resisted. Liggett believes that every consumer has a right to know what they are buying. In addition to tobacco and water, L&M cigarettes contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, natural and artificial liquorice flavour, menthol, artificial milk chocolate, valerian root extract, molasses and vanilla extract and cedarwood oil. There is also glycerol, propylene glycol, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid and 3-methyl-pentanoic acid.

The other participants acted as observers of the conversation. <p/> During the period 21 April to 24 May 2011, peer visits took place in six educational organisations. The subject of the audit during the peer visits was the internal quality system used by the educational organisations. Each organisation was audited by a team of three peer auditors who, prior to the visit, reviewed the self-evaluation report, prepared an audit against pre-defined criteria and prepared audit questions to shed further light on certain aspects or to clarify certain information contained in the report. <p/> Hosts of the Peer Visits discussing their impressions of the preparation and implementation of the Peer Review <p/> At the third meeting, held on 7 June 2011, the participants first discussed their impressions of the Peer Review method and then received some guidance on how to prepare the final Peer Review report. In the second part of the meeting, participants learned about the preparation of the Quality Charter document, discussed how to establish the role of the Quality Adviser in the collectives and how to set up a quality subpage on the website. <p/> At the fourth meeting, on 4 October 2011, which was also the final meeting of 2011, we evaluated the peer review process together with the participants and discussed the planned quality improvements in educational organisations. We also agreed on further work on the Quality Charter and reviewed what information related to quality and adult learning is published on the website. <p/> In the second part of the meeting, we evaluated the role of the Quality Adviser in the participating educational organisations and discussed the activities until the end of the project Education and Training of Professionals in Adult Education 2009-2011 and the activities for the continuation of the project Education and Training of Professionals in Adult Education 2011-2014. <p/> During the group work on the evaluation of the role of the quality advisor in the participating educational organisations <p/> In this way, the participants evaluated and demonstrated their work in the role of the quality advisor.",News,train

415,"Origins <p/> Despite claims by the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan has always been part of China, its historical records do not record this. The earliest official records of Taiwan date back to the Three Kingdoms Period (222-280), when the first exploratory expedition of several thousand people was sent to the island from the Kingdom of Wu. However, in these records, Taiwan is identified as an area outside the boundaries of Chinese civilisation. When the island began to be colonised by foreign powers in the 16th century, the majority of the island's inhabitants were of Malayo-Polynesian origin, not of Han ethnicity. <p/>European trading bases (1624-1662) <p/>The first European conquerors to take an interest in Taiwan were the Portuguese, but they did not colonise the island. They called it Ihla Formosa, or Beautiful Island, and took the name with them to the world in the mid-16th century. The Dutch, who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines in 1622, initially settled the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), where they established military rule. From there, they controlled maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and made passage difficult for Portuguese traders. In 1624, they were driven out by Ming troops and relocated to the main island of Taiwan. From Tainan, they dominated the south-western part of the island. The northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the Spanish conquistadors in 1626, but the Dutch drove them out in 1642. The Dutch government encouraged Chinese immigration to Taiwan because it needed a large labour force on the rice and sugar cane plantations. <p/>The Zheng family government (1662-1683) <p/> In China, Ming subjects fought against the Manchus, who gradually occupied China. In 1644, the Manchu Qing dynasty ruled China and the loyal Ming military forces fled to Taiwan. Commander Zheng Cheng-gong 鄭成功 (Koxinga), who had settled in northern Taiwan, continued to fight the Manchus for almost two decades, with the aim of re-establishing the Ming dynasty in China. After several unsuccessful battles in China, in 1661 he rebelled against the Dutch government in Taiwan and negotiated an agreement to take power. 1662 saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Dongning 東寧, which, after Koxinga's death, was ruled by a son and a grandson until 1683, when the Qing dynasty took power. At that time, Taiwan became administratively part of Fujian Province (臺灣府) and thus part of the multi-ethnic Manchu Empire of the Qing Dynasty. <p/> Qing Dynasty (1683-1895) <p/> During this period, thousands of poor Chinese immigrants came to Taiwan in search of a new start and a better life. Most of them were employed on cane and rice plantations, which were the main export commodities. As a result of the Opium Wars (between 1839-42 and 1856-60), 4 Taiwanese ports were opened to foreign traders, making Taiwan increasingly attractive in international trade. Taiwanese sugar, camphor, indigo and tea were highly sought-after export commodities. During the Sino-French War of Vietnam (1884-5), the northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the French and it was only then that the Chinese court slowly became aware of the vulnerability of the Chinese coastline to attack by foreign forces and the strategic role Taiwan played in this. The signing of the armistice between France and the Qing dynasty was followed by a reorganisation of the political administration, making Taiwan an independent province of the Qing Empire in 1885. The provincial capital is moved from Tainan to Taipei, and gradually Taiwan becomes much stronger. <p/>Japanese rule (1895-1945) in Taiwan and developments on the mainland<p/> In 1894, the Japanese invasion of Korea, which the Qing dynasty regarded as its tributary state, sparked the first Sino-Japanese War. Under the harsh terms of the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty of 1895, which formally ended the war, Taiwan, together with the Penghu Islands, was handed over to Japan. The people of Taiwan were disappointed by the dynasty's decision and tried to fight the Japanese invaders on their own. They established the Republic of Taiwan 臺灣民主國, which survived 5 months of fierce battles, from May to October 1895. <p/> During the 1950s, Japan carried out a systematic assimilation of the Taiwanese and rapidly developed the island's economy. Taiwan had by then developed the most modern industrial and transport infrastructure in Asia (except for Japan itself), which set the stage for Taiwan's further development. <p/> In China, however, disillusionment with Manchurian rule grew in the late 19th century. The political programme of the revolutionary Dr Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙 Sun Yixian / 孫中山 Sun Zhongshan), who fought for the overthrow of the Manchurian monarchy of the Qing dynasty, gradually gained increasing popular support. His political ideals were summed up in a doctrine called the ""Three People's Principles"" 三民主義 (nationalism, democracy and national welfare), which aspired to an independent and democratic China. On 10 October 1911 (Xinhai Revolution 辛亥革命), Sun's military forces successfully captured the capital of Hubei province, Wuchang, and proclaimed secession from the Manchurian Qing dynasty. The revolution gradually engulfed the whole of central and southern China. These rebellious, south-central provinces declared independence and established an independent republic with Nanjing as its capital. The provisional government of the newly established Republic of China, headed by Sun Yatsen (his official enthronement as President on 1 January 1912 is considered as the founding day of the Republic of China and is still celebrated in Taiwan today), was very weak as the northern provinces were still loyal to the Manchurian Empire. In order to preserve national unity and avoid civil war, Sun renounced the presidency and offered it to the Northern Army General Yuan Shikai 袁世凱, who on 12 February 1912 obtained the abdication of the last Manchurian Emperor, Xuantong 宣統皇帝 (Puyi), ending the reign of the last dynasty in China. The Republic of China thus became the legitimate heir to the Qing territory, which at that time included Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Taiwan was then still under Japan). Yuan Shikai soon disappointed the revolutionaries greatly. Instead of democracy and social reform, he sought to establish a new dynasty and the imperial throne, and to destroy the Party, thus completely flouting the Constitution of the Republic. Sun Yatsen therefore reorganised his alliance (the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance 中國同盟會) into the Chinese Nationalist Party 國 民 黨 (KMT). After a failed attempt at revolution again, he relocated to Japan, where he continued the revolution until Yuan's death in 1916. In 1917, he returned to Guangzhou and worked to reunite a completely fragmented China ruled by military strongmen. He founded the famous Huangpu 黃埔 (Whampoa) military academy, which became a centre for raising a revolutionary army to reunify China. After Sun's death (1925), General Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正 Jiang Zhongzheng / 蔣介石 Jiang Jieshi) took supreme command of the army. In his famous three-year military expedition to northern China, Chiang defeated many feudal lords and annexed the military provinces to the rule of the Republic of China. In March 1927, Nanjing was restored as the capital of the Republic of China, and with the capture of Beijing in 1928, Chiang triumphantly completed the Northern Expedition. Power over China thus passed to the Nationalists, but unification did not bring lasting peace. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921 and initially working with Chiang, was gaining more and more strength, and the ideological tensions between the two parties were becoming increasingly insurmountable. China was increasingly threatened by the danger of a Japanese invasion. <p/> Japan launched an attack on Manchuria in 1931, establishing a puppet state known as Manzhuguo 滿洲國. The last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Puyi, was chosen as the formal leader. For reasons of national interest, the Communists and Nationalists then reunited to fight the Japanese forces, but the cooperation was merely symbolic and there was no genuine truce between the two factions. The incident between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing in 1937 led to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for eight years, until the end of the Second World War. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which ignited the Second World War, the Republic of China, which was on the side of the Allies, played the role of an important war front, receiving massive American aid. At the end of 1943, a declaration (the Cairo Declaration) was signed in Cairo by US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Chiang Kaishek, in which the return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands was assigned to the Republic of China. The Japanese surrender and the Postdam Declaration adopted in August 1945 gave legitimacy to the Cairo Declaration. The departure of the Japanese forces, however, refocused all the energies of the communists and nationalists on the battle for their own power. This gave the Chinese civil war full momentum. <p/>Republic of China power <p/> After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Nationalist ROK army, on behalf of the Allied Powers, invaded Taiwan and accepted the Japanese surrender. On 25 October 1945, Taiwan officially became part of the Republic of China. <p/> White Terror 白色恐怖 1945-1972 <p/> The Taiwanese people were very happy to see the restoration of ties with the mainland, the departure of the Japanese army and the arrival of representatives of the Nationalist ROK government. However, relations between the Taiwanese people and the new immigrants from the Chinese mainland soon became strained. The priority of the ROC government was the conquest of the whole of China, while Taiwan and the local population were not of paramount importance to the government of the time. The early period of the ROC government in Taiwan was marked by corruption, illegal land grabbing, inflation, outbreaks of infectious diseases and shortages of basic goods. All of this consequently led to one of Taiwan's greatest tragedies: the 228 二二八事件 Incident. The incident took place on 27 February 1947, when a woman illegally selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Taipei was attempted to be punished by a group of police officers and agents of the Monopoly Bureau. The scuffle ended in a shoot-out in which a Taiwanese bystander was killed. Immediately, tensions arose between the discriminated civilian population on the one hand and the KMT civil servants on the other. <p/> The conflicts escalated into mass demonstrations, all of which were suppressed in blood. Thousands of Taiwanese, mainly educated people, were killed by government forces at the time. Although repression in the later period did not reach the level of 1947, political arrests and detentions were commonplace in Taiwan until the early 1970s. This period has therefore earned the name ""beil terror"". The incident planted the seeds of hatred between the locals and the newcomers, with far-reaching consequences for Taiwanese society. The newcomers made up only 15 % of the island's population, but for many years they maintained their superiority over the 85-strong native population. It was not until 1995 that the ROC-Nationalist Party government, headed by President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝 Li Denghui), formally apologised for the repression and passed a law to compensate all victims of the terror, declaring 28 February a public holiday two years later. <p/>ROC government relocation to Taiwan <p/> In 1949, the Nationalist troops in China were finally defeated. To escape the Communists, Chiang Kai-shek and his government took refuge in Taiwan with some 1.5 million supporters, where he established a new base for the R.C. On 1 October, Mao Zedong, the commander of the Communist troops, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tiananmen Square. Thus was born the ""two Chinas"". Both governments, the PRC and the ROC, asserted their legitimacy over the territory of the whole of China. With the support of the USA, the ROC, as the legitimate representative of the whole of China, established close diplomatic relations with most of the democratic countries of the world and retained its seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the international situation turned in favour of the PRC. During this period, however, the political and economic development of the island, independent of the PRC, gradually transformed the Taiwanese people's self-conception of their identity and belonging.",Information/Explanation,train

435,"For your consideration... <p/> I belong to that school of modern observers who believe that the world is at a turning point. In the course of history we have repeatedly lost confidence in eternal truths. Among them, in religion, in the State and in the world being flat. Today, we are giving up this trust to the market as we knew it until recently. The most radical language of new values and demands for a reorganisation of the system is spoken today by civil society initiatives. They do not see the existing model of market capitalism as the solution for a sustainable and just society. A new language is also being spoken by a growing part of the economy, which is adapting its business models, attitudes and value creation processes to values and co-creating them in dialogue with the needs of the people. Social and economic value creation processes are being reinvented, based on self-organisation, commodity exchange, participatory and democratic forms of ownership. The present is beginning to speak a language that holds the promise of radical change for the better. <p/> Not many people speak this language, but they are increasingly being heard. Because we all want to believe that something better is possible. Because we need to believe that better can always be (more) possible. <p/> We all understand part of this language. Some say it is useless, that it is outdated. Others believe that it can only partially explain and justify the needs of modern society. Still others add new slogans to enrich it and throw out concepts that do not belong. We seem to be reassembling the alphabet of the world. And, given the current indicators of the overall balance sheet, this is more than necessary. What this alphabet will bring will be determined by the concrete actions and changes that this new language will trigger. We can still hope that we are living in times of change. <p/> As we write this first blog entry, it is also our first text entry dedicated to the online community that has started to coalesce in recent months around the people who co-create the Vive mission [ 1 ].

While we are aware that we could not have set ourselves a broader goal than a better life, we are slowly realising that this goal has very clear trajectories. <p/> In the process of defining our values, fleshing out our goals and strategising our work plan, we have continually stumbled over the breadth of the notion of a better life. What values bind us together as a community of colleagues? Which values are those that represent our minimum common denominator?

The work was carried out from 19 June to 15 July 2006 as part of the compulsory field course for archaeology students. <p/> The house, known as Vodiškar's House, stands on the edge of the terrace of the Nevljica stream. The oldest part of the building, the house, is built of wooden logs and is dendrochronologically dated to between 1580 and 1600. The wooden structure is set on a stone cellar, which is dug into the bank. In the 18th or 19th century, a stone vestibule with a black kitchen and a room or stiblc was added to the east of the house. The whole, now three-part building was then plastered. The building was covered with a thatched roof, which was removed in the 1970s. Due to the poor load-bearing capacity of the walls, the new roof was supported on free-standing concrete piers on the north and west sides. <p/> In 2004, as part of the planned renovation of the outside of the building, the owners machine-excavated drainage ditches along the walls and removed the plaster on the wooden part of the building. A larger, irregularly shaped construction pit was dug along the west façade of the building, which extended below the level of the basement foundations. One or more cultural layers were removed, which contained a large number of pottery fragments dating from the High Middle Ages, animal bones and charcoal. However, large quantities of modern pottery, glass shards and metal objects were found throughout. <p/> Archaeological excavations were then carried out prior to the resumption of construction works, but were limited to a few selected small areas due to the previous destruction of the stratification and for static reasons. <p/> The southern part of the stile was partially excavated, where the owners had already removed the weathered wooden floorboards before the excavations began. Under two layers of fill with finds from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we found a light brown screed of sand, soil and lime up to 6 cm thick. It showed clear signs of wear and was smeared with mud and soot from the Black Kitchen. It was laid directly on the sterile subsoil of the site, which consists of thick gravel and sand deposits. The foundations of the stone walls of the shingle were shallowly dug into it, only about 10 cm deep. Small finds suggest that the hill was built over in the 18th or early 19th century. A test excavation in the courtyard along the eastern wall of the fortress showed that the courtyard had been flattened when the fortress was built, thus completely destroying the older stratification. <p/> The area in front of the wooden door along the north wall of the house, the presumed original entrance to the building, was also investigated. The strip between the wall of the house and the roof struts was filled in and partially levelled with thick stones, sand, building materials and household waste when the new roof structure was built in the 1970s. Below were some earth layers associated with the construction of the extension with the black kitchen and the tiled stove. The foundation of the stone wall behind the pottery oven was dug 50 cm deep through the thick rubble of an 80 cm wide dry wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall of the cellar or house at a distance of 1.40 m. The wall may have formed the foundation of an enclosed extension next to the house or may have merely served as a truss to consolidate and level the walking surface in front of the former entrance to the building. To the north of the wall, we documented two wooden uprights, possibly supporting the pitched roof, the existence of which is evidenced by three cut-outs for the supporting beams in the north wall of the house. The excavated wall and the stone wall of the cellar were dug into the sterile base of the site. To the north of the drystone wall, several successive earth deposits with numerous modern finds were excavated. In the westernmost part of the excavation site we documented several layers overlying the bank here, containing fragments of High Medieval pottery. <p/> The large machine excavation in front of the cellar entrance on the west side of the building was only cleaned and levelled due to the static threat to the west wall of the cellar. In the western profile, we documented, among other things, three layers with High Medieval finds. The pottery is virtually identical to the finds from the older phase of the castle at Malé grad in nearby Kamnik and can be tentatively dated to the 11th or 12th century, the time when the village of Nevlje, next to the old parish church, began to develop.",Information/Explanation,train
452,"While enjoying a stroll through the colourful streets of Burano at the end of April, I was interrupted by a telephone call from Stojan asking 'Hi, Momak. Would you like to go to Mont Blanc? "" Although it was already warm in summer, I froze for a moment. My answer was yes. An old holiday must be made the most of. If it is an active one, so much the better. <p/> After all the coordination, Polona, Stojan and I are finally part of a mini-team that monitors the weather forecast over Shamonix and gathers information on a daily basis. On Monday, we make a quick decision to leave on the morning of Tuesday 13 May... from rainy Ljubljana. We set off for Italy, past Venice, Milan, towards Aosta and through the tunnel under Mont Blanc to Chamonix. On the way, we have a coffee on the Italian autostrada with Klemen, who is going to the same places on business as a mountain guide. <p/> In the evening we arrive in a still cloudy town under snow-capped peaks. You can't see the peaks, but you can feel the cold of the glaciers. <p/> In the evening we are in the same hostel as Klemen Gričar and Tomaž Jakofčič, ""gasterbajters"" with a lot of experience up there. They give us selfless advice and answer all our questions. <p/> Our original plan was to take the gondola on Wednesday to the Aiguille di midi, 3842 metres high, from where we would ski down the Vallee Blanche and do a tour to the Torino hut, where we would spend the night. On Thursday, the plan was to ski down the Valee Blanche to Montevers and then take the cog railway back to Chamonix. <p/> On Friday we planned to ride again to the Aiguille di midi mid station, and from there climb up to the Gran Mulets hut, and on Saturday night start for the summit. The weather forecast for Saturday was also promising. <p/> Polona, at the suggestion of Klemena, checked the reservation at the Gran Mulets hut and was informed that we had a reservation from Thursday to Friday. Apparently the dec up there had written the date wrong when the first booking was made. <p/> The combination of days, times, reservations starts. In the end, we come to the conclusion that we will climb up to the Torino hut on Wednesday, descend into the valley on Thursday and immediately climb back up and to the Gran Mulet hut. Well, the plan is one thing, the reality is another. <p/> When we arrive at the Aiguille di Midi lookout, we do not even get a panoramic view, let alone the conditions for skiing on glaciers covered with 30 cm of fresh snow. Fog and clouds obscure the peaks and descend to the valley. This time the weathermen have kicked the darkness. <p/> This is this from the acclimatisation tour. Unfortunately, we descended to the valley by gondola. <p/> On Thursday we finally wake up to a clear morning. <p/> We take the gondola up to 2,310 m, to the Plan de l'Aiguille, and from there ski under the north face of the Aiguille de midi towards the Gran Mulets hut. <p/> Soon, the full majesty of the mountains and glaciers is revealed. <p/> The sun is already warming up strongly, but the ice sculptures are still mighty. <p/> Before crossing the Bosson at the Jonction section, we take narrow bridges over glacial crevasses to reach the flank below the Gran Mulets hut, which stands on top of a rocky ridge. <p/> From here, the Aiguille di midi is visible from the other side, with Chamonix below. <p/> On the other side of the flank, icebergs glisten in the sun. <p/> At the bottom of the hut, we take off our skis and follow the carved path up to the hut, chain and rope in tow. <p/> In the hut, we settle into our shared beds and wait for dinner. While we wait, I do a few laps around the house... <p/> Next to the hut is a building which, if it had water in it, could be called a toilet. So it can only be called a ""shithole"" with a capital R, as the ""septic tank"" is down there on a glacier somewhere. <p/> Prayer flags colour the day. <p/> The sun slowly goes to rest, and up here the real show of light and colour begins. First, the snow expanses take on a whole new hue with soft shadows... <p/> The wind doesn't let up up there. <p/> A ball of fire will slowly hide under the clouds. <p/> The permafrost under the hut ensures a constant climate. <p/> And it's... day. My 44th , ... birthday. It was beautiful. <p/> When the sun hadn't even set, we were all in bed ... by 3am. Then up, breakfast, a night descent along the chain and rope to the snow below the hut and a start in the glare of headlamps to the summit. <p/> We walk in the dark on the groomed spur for a good while before the day begins to wake up. The lights are still burning in the town ... <p/> It starts with blue light up here ... <p/> Slowly the outlines of the hills turn into colourful pictures. <p/> The glaciers remain cold despite the first warm rays of the sun ... <p/> ... and the crevasses beneath the Dôme du Goûter are menacing. <p/> And when you look around, everything is still so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful. <p/> The valley is slowly waking up while it's coldest up here. <p/> You talk to the clouds and the nettles and ask them to let the sun go ... <p/> And the top is so close ... and far away at the same time. <p/> The last metres below the Vallot bivouac are pretty blown. The skis go on the ruzak, and instead of skis, I mount the crampons on my feet. The breath was getting deeper here, but there was no real strength in my legs. After a good five hours of walking we reach the bivouac. <Polona and Stojan are already at the bivouac when I get there. Looking down ... <p/> ... towards Mont Maudit ... <p/> ... and towards the one we came for. <p/> Ahead of us, there are already a few convoys going at a slow pace towards the summit. <p/> There is some hesitation about whether to go with or without skis towards the summit. In the end, we decide to go without. Meanwhile, Klemen continues past the bivouac with his team. <p/> We follow a little way behind him. After a few hundred metres, I realise that my lungs are straining almost to empty and my muscles simply don't have enough energy anymore. The pace is getting slower and slower, and at this rate we would have blown our timetable for the descent. There is no alternative but to turn around. I give Stojan and Polona a clear path to the top, but they decide to descend. <p/> Meanwhile, the wind picks up a bit up there. <p/> We continue to enjoy the views as we prepare for the descent. <p/> The summit will wait ... until next time. Meanwhile, one team is already skiing down the north side of the mountain. <p/> Another hello to the summit, and then the descent. <p/> For the first few pitches the snow is hard, blown, icy in places, and so are the muscles. I stop several times, trying to enjoy at least the views <p/> Below the bivouac, the skiing is better. The only distraction from carefree powder is the thought that we are near and on a glacier, and that there are glacial crevasses hiding under the snow. The fact that the previous day a mountaineer fell into a crevasse fifteen metres deep also gives us food for thought. He was lucky in the accident, as he was pulled to safety unharmed by helicopter rescuers. <p/> During our stops, we admire the snow and ice masses, so innocently white, yet menacing and dangerous. <p/> We ski towards the approach. The snow becomes a little crusty in places, a little heavier lower down, but still skiable. <p/> Soon we are above the Grand Mulets hut. <p/> We cross the Bossons over the Jonction, strung up. We are not the only ones. Somehow we are skiing at the same time with two Spaniards and a group of Austrians. <p/> The sun is already quite strong down here and it is not very pleasant to wait in line to cross the glacier. We are quickly across, then under the northern walls of the Aguilla di Midi we continue our way to the middle station of the gondola. <p/> The crossing is rather protracted, more so than the other way round, as we have some work to do. Finally, the greenery of the valley and the gondola come into view. <p/> We arrive in Chamonix in the afternoon, beautifully tired, hungry and thirsty. Maybe even a little disappointed. But, all the same, we have reached an altitude of 4362 m, skied down from there and arrived in the valley alive and well. For one of this year's final tours, that will be a big enough success <p/> P.S. Apparently, the summit is still where it was before we wanted to climb it ourselves. And I think it will be there for a while... waiting... maybe for us too <p/> One more thing about the costs: after the tour, we took a free afternoon in Chamonix, spent the night, and then headed home the next morning. <p/> For the trip from Tuesday to Saturday, for tolls, tunnel fees, fuel, accommodation and gondola tickets, we each spent just over 300.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

465,"The Core <p/> If at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance the conveyancer was aware of the legal consequences of entering into the contract of conveyance and had the will to enter into the contract of conveyance, the conveyancer will be deemed to have had the capacity at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance to enter into such a contract. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is modified so that the defendants are obliged to issue to the plaintiff, within 15 days, a land registration deed on the basis of which the plaintiff will be entitled to register the land in respect of the immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. on their co-ownership interests, in order to register the title in his own name, since such a deed would otherwise be superseded by the present judgment, and to reimburse him, within 15 days, the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, amounting to EUR 5 930,52, with interest at the statutory rate of late payment, with effect from the 16th day following the date of receipt of the present decision, in the event of delay. <p/> The defendants are ordered to reimburse to the applicant, within 15 days, EUR 1 572,03 of the costs of the appeal, with interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision until payment. <By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action for the issue of a land registry deed in respect of immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register of D. and No 756 of the Land Register of D. in the applicant's name, finding that the contract of conveyance of 19 September 1994 between the conveyancer, Mrs I.F., and the applicant was null and void. It is void because, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment (she lacked capacity to act). <p/> 2. Against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the applicant appeals on all the grounds set out in Article 388(1) of the Civil Procedure Act, seeking an amendment of the judgment so as to uphold the claim, and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. The appeal challenges the finding of the Court of First Instance that, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs I.F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment. Ms F's capacity to act is presumed and the defendants have not challenged that presumption. The mere existence of the disease of senile dementia is not proof that she did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. Expert B. was of the opinion that there was an 80 % probability that Mrs F.I. did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. On the basis of that expert's opinion, the presumption of the existence of Ms I. F.'s capacity to act is not rebutted. In the light of the circumstances, Mrs I.F.'s capacity was more or less preserved and she is able to express what she wants to do with her assets. <p/> 3. In their reply to the application, the defendants submit that a piecemeal, piecemeal assessment of the evidence cannot lead to the desired result that Ms I.F. had the capacity to act at the time of the signing of the contract of assignment. The Court of First Instance is autonomous in its assessment of the evidence. The emphasis on the bright moments of the handing-over of Mrs I.F. cannot be placed in the timeframe of the conclusion of the handing-over contract, since, apart from the date of conclusion of the handing-over contract, we do not know what state of mind Mrs F.I. was in when she concluded the handing-over contract. Expert B.B. did not conclude that Mrs F. I. was in a lucid phase at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Mrs F.'s will was not entirely free, as it was quite suggestible, but the proceedings have not proceeded in that direction so far because the parties have not claimed that it was. The expert, Mr B.B., did not speculate. He confirmed that his findings were correct, which means that I.F. was incompetent at the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery. The plaintiff did not attend the hearings, which suggests that there was something wrong with the contract from the outset. <p/> 4. The Court of Appeal questioned the correctness of the Court of First Instance's assessment of the evidence and therefore held a main hearing, at which it repeated the evidence of the expert Dr Z. Č. At the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery on 19 September 1994, Mrs F. was of legal age and therefore presumed to have had the capacity to act. It is for the defendant to prove that at the time of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment she lacked capacity, that she did not understand the meaning of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment and that she lacked the capacity to form the will to conclude the contract of entrustment. <p/> On the basis of the expert opinions of Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B.B., the testimony of the witness J.B. and the actions of I.F. after the conclusion of the contract of assignment (her statement at the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994, the conclusion of the lease agreement on 14.12.1994 and the consequences of the dementia from which I.F. suffered), the Court of First Instance concluded that I.F. did not understand the nature of the contract which she had concluded with the claimant on 19.09.1994 and its legal consequences. The Court of Appeal takes a different view of that evidence, in particular because the experts fundamentally misinterpreted the statement made by Mrs F. before the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994 and incorrectly linked that statement to the lease agreement concluded between Mrs F. and the applicant on 14.12.1994. <p/> It is clear from Ms F.'s statement of 12.10.1994 that she was aware that she had already handed over the property to the applicant (I myself wanted D.J. to have everything I had). I want him to have all my property after my death, or rather to have it already now. I.F. was also aware of why she was giving her property to the claimant, because he takes care of her and will continue to take care of her in the future (because he takes care of me, he is very good and I think he will continue to do so in the future). <p/> She also testified that her relatives are not interested in her or that they come to help her when they can and that they cannot come often. It follows from this statement that she wanted the continued assistance which the applicant had provided and had undertaken to provide in the future. <p/> It follows from Mrs F.'s statement that she understood the meaning of the contract of delivery of 19.09.1994, that she was handing over all her property to the applicant, and that she wished to enter into such a contract of delivery, that is to say, to form a business will to enter into such a contract, on the ground that the applicant would take care of her in the future. <p/> The experts' view that it is not logical that, after the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, I.F. and the applicant also concluded a lease contract on 14.12.1994 for an apartment on the first floor of the house is not justified, since at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract the contract of conveyance had not yet been registered in the land register and therefore the applicant had not become the land registry owner of the property conveyed. The conclusion of the lease contract is therefore a logical act, since by concluding it the applicant acquired the legal title to live in the house. When it was suggested to the experts that the conclusion of the lease agreement was logical, they replied that this was a legal view, not a psychiatric one. The court is not persuaded by such an answer of the experts. The logic of the transactions entered into is interpreted in terms of the need to enter into those transactions. Since the plaintiff had not yet acquired the legal title to live in the I.F. house by the mere conclusion of the contract of delivery, and the procedure for obtaining the status of farmer for the plaintiff had been delayed, it is logical and understandable that the plaintiff secured the right to live in the I.F. house by concluding the lease. <p/>Expert Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B. B. thus erred in considering that the subsequent conclusion of the lease contract implies that Mrs I.F. was not aware of the meaning of the contract of handover and that she was not capable of forming the will to enter into the contract of handover. The experts' request that Mrs F. should have stated in her statement of 12 October 1994 that she had already concluded the contract of usufruct is too strict, but in her statement Mrs F. testified to the essential elements of the contract of usufruct, namely that the property was already in the possession of the applicant and that the latter would take care of it in the future. <p/> Since it is clear from Mrs F.'s deposition of 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the importance of the contract of conveyance and that she wished to enter into it, it can be safely concluded that she also had such a wish on 19.09.1994, when she concluded the contract of conveyance. That will or capacity was not affected by her illness, dementia of old age, particularly in the light of the report on her state of health by Dr J.K. of 15.11.1994, in which he responded to enquiries made by the Centre for Social Work concerning the state of I.F.'s health. in which he stated that she was oriented in terms of personality, location and time, and the letter of 22.11.1994 from the nurse responsible for her care, Ms J.B., in which she stated that she had visited Ms I.F. four times since March 1994 and that she considered her to be of sound mind and health for her age. However, at the hearing on 19.11.2007, J.B. testified that she remembered I.F. as a confused, demented person who could no longer look after herself and needed help. When J.B.'s letter of 22.11.1994 was read to her, she stated that she remembered the case well at the time, but today she remembers I.F. as she described her at the hearing. It should be borne in mind that she had visited her 10 times, i.e. that she had continued to visit her even after she had made her statement of 22.11.1994. Her statement at the hearing is therefore not contradicted by the letter of 22.11.1994, it is only the timeframe to which the statement refers that is relevant. It follows from the statement of 22.11.1994 that this statement refers to the time up to the date of the statement, whereas the statement at the hearing on 09.11.2007 refers to the entire memory of her. <p/> Expert B.B. explained that confusion in dementia occurs in intervals of varying length, which means that a person with dementia is not mentally confused between the intervals. He was of the opinion that I.F. did not understand the meaning of the contract of conveyance at the time of the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, which he gave with a probability of 80 %. Such an opinion by Dr B.B. does not, therefore, rebut the presumption that Mrs F. had capacity at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract of 19 September 1994. For that reason, it is also not possible to follow the opinion of the expert Z. Č. T., that at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract I.F. was incapable of understanding the meaning of the handover contract, since both opinions are based on the same assessment of the facts, only that they ultimately assess them differently. <p/> As regards the testimony of the other parties and witnesses, it should be made clear that they gave their testimony as they saw and perceived it when they were in contact with Ms I.F.. However, in view of her illness, age-related dementia, which occurs at intervals, this may have been in a phase of confusion or in a phase of lucidity and therefore cannot affect the assessment of the evidence itself, given that it can be concluded with certainty from her statement before the Social Work Centre on 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the significance of the handover contract and that she had the will to form the basis of such a handover contract of 19.09.1994. <p/> 7.

466,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are usually transmitted through sexual contact. <p/> Formerly known as venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma), STDs are now commonly divided according to the agents that cause them. <p/> General protection against STDs is abstinence, fidelity to two uninfected partners, or the use of barrier contraceptives, the best known of which is the condom. There is also a female version of the condom called femidon, but it is practically impossible to buy in Slovenia. <p/> The condom is the only contraceptive that both protects against the transmission of sexually transmitted pathogens and prevents unwanted pregnancy. <p/> The most common sexual infections are fungal and bacterial infections, which most often present in women as vaginal discharge, genital itching, burning pain when urinating. However, many sexually transmitted infections occur without any signs of infection or disease problems (asymptomatic infections). <p/> The possibility of infection should always be kept in mind when having sex. If sex is based on a good knowledge of the partner and mutual trust and fidelity, there is no risk of fresh infection. Of course, the risk is much higher with frequent changes of sexual partners and fleeting sexual contacts (promiscuous sexual behaviour). <p/> Some STIs are briefly described below, while HIV/AIDS, chlamydial infections and hepatitis are covered separately. <p/> Gonorrhoea (also gonorrhoea, thrips) Gonorrhoea is a widespread STD caused by gonococcus. It has seemingly, but unjustifiably, lost its importance due to the success and short duration of treatment. There is no data on the actual prevalence of gonorrhoea for Slovenia because the notification, which is compulsory, is incomplete. <p/> Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted and mainly affects the genital organs. However, there is also gonorrhoea of the conjunctiva of newborn infants, which is contracted during childbirth if the parturient has gonorrhoea. Therefore, to prevent this type of infection, it is obligatory to protect every newborn with so-called Crede's drops at birth. It is also possible for gonococci to infect other sites outside the genitals and genital tract (buttocks, throat). In the male, after a short incubation period of a few days (i.e. the time between infection and the outbreak of the disease), a discharge from the urethra occurs, accompanied by itching and burning pain when urinating. After about 2 weeks, the acute inflammation becomes chronic. Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in a man include inflammation of the prostate, perimenopause and infertility. <p/> In women, there is virtually no disease in the initial period. There are no early signs of possible infection. <p/> Infection progresses to the internal reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes), which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. <p/> Syphilis Syphilis is a contagious STD that can affect all organs of the human body. The causative agent of syphilis is a bacterium, Treponema pallidum. More than 95 infections are caused by having sex with an infected person. Non-sexual infections are caused by kissing, biting and other contact with a patient who has skin sores. <p/> Data on the prevalence of syphilis are fairly accurate, as the disease was considered the most severe STD due to its consequences until the emergence of HIV infection. In Slovenia, a dramatic increase in syphilis was recorded in 1994 and 1995 (36-38 per year), with a slight decline in the number of new cases in the following years. <p/> Syphilis is divided into early and late (duration up to 1 year or more than 1 year), and acquired and congenital, depending on how the infection occurred. <p/> The incubation period for syphilis is about 3 weeks. <p/> Early syphilis At the site of penetration of the bacterium into the skin or mucous membranes, a hard, hard-edged, round or oval ulcer forms after three days. The ulcer is most often on the genitals, but can also be on the lips or in the oral cavity. After a few days, the lymph nodes in the area swell, and after 2 months, most of the lymph nodes swell. Later, an itchy rash spreading from the trunk to the extremities appears, which spontaneously disappears after 1 to 2 months, leaving whitish patches. Several months after infection, hair loss may occur with coin-sized bald patches that grow back on their own. <p/> Late syphilis In this form, there are not necessarily changes in the skin, but there are changes in the blood vessels and central nervous system. The disease is proven and later controlled by detecting antibodies in the patient's blood or cerebrospinal fluid. <p/> Congenital syphilis A syphilitic infection in the mother can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or a child may be born with signs of syphilis. The last case of congenital syphilis in Slovenia was reported in 1986. <p/> It is important to detect syphilis as early as possible to prevent the spread of infection and to increase the success of treatment. The drug of choice is still penicillin. <p/> INFECTIONS WITH PAPILLOMA VIRUSES-GENITAL WARTS Some of the viruses belonging to the papillomavirus group cause genital warts (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The incubation period can be several months. The lesions themselves are harmless (benign), but they are very disturbing, uncomfortable, the treatment is long and painful, and recurrences are frequent. <p/> GENITAL HERPES Infection with herpes simplex type 2 is classified as an STD. The infection causes the formation of tiny vesicles on and around the genital area, which later become purulent. The vesicles appear in the presence of various triggering factors (immunosuppression, stress, illness, menstruation). <p/> Initially, there are only bubbles, but later small sores appear. <p/> Infection with the virus is permanent. If a pregnant woman who has a fresh infection gives birth to a child, she may be at high risk. If symptoms are present at the time of delivery, a caesarean section is performed to prevent infection of the newborn. <p/> Treatment of skin lesions is symptomatic. However, there are antiviral drugs that prevent the appearance of vesicles in people with a high incidence of genital herpes. These medicines are prescribed by a doctor. <p/> FUNGAL INFECTIONS Fungal infections of the genital tract are most commonly caused by fungi of the genus Candida, which are present in small numbers on mucous membranes. They often multiply on the mucous membranes of the female genital mucosa and are passed on during sexual intercourse. Men usually do not have problems, but may develop burning, reddish, partly whitish, penile rashes. <p/> In women, the genital area usually itches, the mucous membrane is red and there is a white, cheesy vaginal discharge. <p/> Creams and vaginal tablets are used for treatment. <p/> Pubic lice Pubic lice live on the hair of the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact. Lice and nits are found on the hairs. Severe itching occurs. All infected persons must be treated and bed linen must be properly hygienised (wash at 95 degrees C). <p/> CHLAMIDIA INFECTIONS Data on the prevalence of chlamydia infections in Slovenia are unreliable. Despite the fact that it is compulsory to report the infection and that chlamydial infections are among the most common STDs, reporting is not practiced. Chlamydia are very small bacteria, sexually transmitted by Chlamydia trachomatis. <p/> In men, urethral and later perineal inflammation occurs after about 14 days after infection. However, an infected male may be without problems. <p/> Newborn babies become infected at birth if their mother has chlamydia cervicitis. Chlamydia eye inflammation and/or chlamydial pneumonia develop. <p/> The infection is treated with antibiotics. <p/> TRYHOMONIAZA Infection is caused by a protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. <p/> In men there is usually no problem, rarely there is inflammation of the urethral orifice and burning pain on urination. In women, after incubation for a few days, a foul-smelling, foamy vaginal discharge appears, accompanied by itching of the external genitalia and pain on urination.",Information/Explanation,train

469,"Tenancy agreement with a person in social need <p/> QUESTION: <p/> We are going to rent out a room in a block of flats with shared use of the bathroom and kitchen to a father of two children (14 and 12 years old). As they are a social problem (no income, in divorce proceedings, etc.), I would like to know how to draw up the "" correct "" rental contract with the father for a period of 12 months or so to solve his problems. Can I throw them out of the house after 12 months, even though they are a social problem? What if something happens to the father, what happens to the children? What if something happens to me and my husband (our children are still of age)? Is the tenant obliged to pay my housing costs? <p/> (D.K.F.) <p/> ANSWER: <p/> We understand from the question that you are renting out the accommodation yourself, not as a social institution. However, vacating the premises by the tenant always involves risks, so we advise you to rent the premises for a fixed period of time, e.g. 12 months, as you say. Before the end of the lease, you should re-let the premises for a longer period. Of course, there is still some risk, especially in your case. Find out whether he will be able to pay you rent at all if he has no income. Consider whether you can approach him to get a rent guarantee from social services if you are really solving social problems. If he has no income and no guarantee, you are of course knowingly increasing your risk. If something happens to the father (the tenant), then the children who have been living with him will continue to rent and the welfare authority will take care of their rights. The costs of the tenancy are paid by someone other than the tenant, and it is advisable to obtain insurance - preferably a guarantee from the social welfare authority - to cover the tenant's obligations.If something happens to you, this has no effect on the tenancy, which is continued by your heirs.",Other,train

472,"Polona Požgan Štorman, a graduate in political science and a graduate in history, is known to most people as the presenter of the morning programme on Radio Centre. She has been working at the radio for 16 years. She fell in love with it at the beginning of her student years, when she started working at Radio Student in Maribor. ""Everything related to speech and communication inspired me so much that I decided to make radio a part of my life. And it did,"" explains Polona, continuing, ""In all these years, I never thought about driving to work at 5am. Working in radio is a pleasure. Good company, good music, laughter, raving around the studio at the crack of dawn, morning coffees, sunrises, sometimes even a bit of a grumble, and I'm always pampered by my two radio men - Sašo Papp and Štefko Bratkovič. "" <p/> A committed radio personality, she is also a homemaker and enjoys cooking. Her favourite hobbies are cooking and baking. She has two very grateful eaters - her son and her husband. She loves cooking so much that she might be a professional chef if she were born again. ""Maybe I imagine myself in this role a little too much like Catherine Zeta Jones in No Reservations, but... why not? ! "" she remarks wryly. <p/> POLONA POŽGAN ŠTORMAN on her MAKS Of all her roles, Polona's favourite is that of a mother. ""If you were to ask Maks what he calls his mother, I would tell you that I call him 'love'. And that's the best word to describe our relationship. Max is my love and I adore him. He is three and a half years old and he is a boy like most others. He is mainly interested in toy cars, saws, lawnmowers, diggers and other motorised vehicles. I am not very good around them, so I involve him in other games, ones that are closer to me. We cook together almost every day. When he wakes up at the end of the week and sees that I am home, his first words are: ' Mum, let's go bake cakes now! ' What impresses me most is that Maks is a very happy child. He laughs and sings all day - of course he loves Taboo and knows all their songs by heart. When he gets serious and annoying, it's clear to me that something is wrong with him. He is a Leo, which means he is very stubborn. Sometimes it gives me grey hairs during this period, but I console myself with the fact that he will need this trait at some point in his life,"" Polona enthusiastically recounted. <p/> Polona's days are, in principle, meticulously planned. By Sunday evening at the latest, she knows what her schedule will be for the whole week. She gets up very early, her watch chimes at five minutes past four o'clock. ""If it rang exactly at four, I would think it was horrible, five past four is more normal,"" she explained with a laugh. She then works on the radio from five to eleven, then goes to the office or to lectures. Together with her friend Mojca Lubanjšek Pehant, she runs the school of rhetoric Retorik, d.o.o. No matter what she does or how much she works, she always has a maternal feeling inside her, which pushes her to work so intensively and so organised that she has enough time for her child. You would think that at this pace you would go to bed quickly, but that is not true for her at all, and it is true that she is in bed by 11 p.m. at the latest. <p/> Since she has had Max, her life has changed a lot, and for the better. Today, she wonders how she could ever say that she has no time or that she is sleepy. She wonders what she did before she had Max. Today, she feels that she has time for everything and does not need much sleep. Maks gives her energy in the afternoon or evening. The child never weighs her down, never tires her out, quite the opposite. <p/> She herself has never wondered what it is like to be a mother. She feels that she is a good mother. She and Primož were both very excited about Maks and when he came into the world they were mentally prepared for him. There were never any concerns, only some questions, and her mother, who used to be a midwife, solved them professionally. <p/> Every day when she comes home, Maks first plays and sings to her. ""Every day, really. He usually plays that it's Maco or Izi, they're the guitarists in the band Tabu, which his dad Primož is also part of,"" Polona told us. ""Now Maks is in the Good Fairy phase. He has a well-developed sense of humour and knows exactly how and with what to make people laugh. ""Sometimes he comes up to me with big eyes and asks me very seriously: 'Listen... are you my mummy?' He asks this because he knows that I will chase him around the flat. ""But she is happiest that he is healthy, and she tries to remind herself of that as often as possible. <p/> Primož likes Maks to be stubborn and to stick to his guns. ""I think it shows he has character,"" Polona laughs. So far, Maks has shown his true stubbornness two or three times by throwing himself on the floor and shouting, but otherwise he is very persistent. Polona is more strict, but she has often found that Primož is more of a logician when it comes to parenting. During her pregnancy, she ""devoured"" all the parenting books she could get her hands on, but she herself found that this was not the best. <p/> In the future, she wants Max to be healthy first, responsible second and independent third. If she can deduce by herself, these qualities bring happiness. But more importantly, she wants to instil in Max responsibility - for himself, for others, for work and for life. <p/> Maks has been playing with saws for two years now, and excavators and rollers and the like, and he is also moving into the Lego era. Towers are popular. But since the first year, the most used toy in his room is drums. His father, who is a drummer, bought them for his first birthday. For his third birthday he got new, more useful ones, but they are too loud for (Mum's) ears. That's why Maks now has headphones. ""He says they are green, which means they are red,"" Polona said laughing. <p/> Otherwise, the rules in their family are clear and every night Maks has a choice - either a cartoon or a game to play with Primož. During the day, cartoons and TV are not allowed. The exception is a Taboo video, which he sometimes wishes he could play drums or a children's guitar alongside. <p/> About early learning in kindergarten, Polona thinks: ""Everything in its own time. We don't have any extra-curricular activities for now. Maks still sometimes 'poops' his pants and it would be a bit funny if he was to learn English while doing that. "" <p/> Maks has been attending kindergarten since September. Polona was quite scared of going to kindergarten because he had been at home with a nanny for two years before that. But he has settled in beautifully. She is convinced that this is also thanks to the wonderful teachers, Petra and Martina. He loves them very much, he still talks about them at home. He now has friends at nursery and Primož, who drives him to nursery in the morning, says that he gets impatient if they take too long. Polona is grateful that in the first week of kindergarten they dispelled her doubts and showed her that her child is safe and happy with them.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

But the RCC wanted it all, so the first government of Janez Janša came to its rescue, donating the island and its real estate to the church. The legal proceedings were restarted and came to a tragicomic conclusion. There were two proceedings in which the court should have annulled the gift contract.

Where did the name Evil Eve come from, are you really Evil Eve? Evil Eve: The guys and I have known each other for a long time and our musical paths have intertwined in the past on various projects from Retrotaether to The Machine. It was kind of just a matter of time before we started our own band. The name Evil Eve came out of nowhere, but it's my nickname from high school. When we had almost all the songs for the album, we suddenly realised we didn't even have a name yet! That was the hardest choice for us. <p/> Rocker.si: The music is mostly written by Jure Golobič, but you're the one who takes care of the lyrics in the band? Your song ' No, I wouldn't, thank you ' has quite humorous lyrics, which at the same time contain just the right amount of provocation, will the rest of the lyrics go in that direction as well? Where do you draw inspiration for your lyrics? Evil Eve: I've worked with Jureto on several projects and I have a lot of respect for him as a writer. I think it's important that the songwriter and the composer are involved in the songwriting process itself and I'm not a fan of 'bespoke' or 'turnkey' songs. So Jure first creates the basis, then the lyrics are created simultaneously, for which I draw inspiration from the vibrations that the music itself gives me, combined with my own life experiences. Finally, we package it all together in rehearsals and each of us contributes a piece to the mosaic. The lyrics on the upcoming album, which is currently about halfway done, will reflect various themes in life - from relationships between men and women to relationships between people in general. <p/> Rocker.si: You recently appeared as a guest at a Requiem concert, losing your stage innocence, if I may say so myself.

When I saw the nice full house, I was shocked and happy at the same time. We didn't expect anything, we just wanted to play well, so the overwhelmingly positive reviews and reviews were a pleasant surprise and gave us even more motivation to keep going. <p/> Rocker.si: At the concert it was obvious that you put on a real show on stage. Among other things, you dressed up quite a few times, you performed as a 'seductive devil' or rather a real rock cat, and you even included a sexy dance by Teja Britovšek, which undoubtedly 'turns on' the male part of the audience... Do you think that the visual performance of the band is an important factor for the concert-goers? Evil Eve: Muses express themselves through all channels, not only through music - so also through photos, videos, stage presence, clothes, and last but not least through answers in interviews... I think it's important that it's consistent with who you are in private as well. I like artists who can offer concert-goers the whole package, not just the exact notes played - and it's not a case of 'bare affnaria': Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Pink - and not least Laibach - for example, do a great job of performing their music through all channels. The fact that Teja Britovšek performed alongside actor Bojan Bešter at the Kino Šiška concert was part of the promotion of our new video - they acted out one of the scenes and threw dollar bills off the stage, which of course has its own symbolism. We had a bit more of a show than usual at Kino Šiška, because it's a big stage. And a big stage allows, if not demands it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, does Evil Eve have an absolute advantage with you now over the other bands you also work with? Evil Eve: That's right, because it's my own project and the only band that I actually started - the others I joined later and helped as much as I could - and in Evil Eve I'm going to combine all the experience and knowledge I've gained over the last 10 years. This band was formed out of our common desire to gig and create, and we have accumulated enough original songs for at least two albums. So we will put all the songs through a sieve first and prepare a set of songs that will eventually find their place on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: You have already recorded songs for your debut album, when can we expect it? What will the title be? Can you tell us maybe some interesting details about your upcoming debut album? Evil Eve: The promotion of the single and the Ne bi hvala video put a bit of a crimp in our plans and took away the time that we would have otherwise spent on the further creation and mixing of the album, but since the track was accepted for the compilation album ' We Want Good Music ', we of course took advantage of it to introduce ourselves to a wider audience. We are planning to release the album in the spring, but we don't have a specific date, because we are doing everything mostly by feel and according to our time and financial possibilities - we all have jobs and we are giving all our free time to the band. <p/> Rocker.si: You also made a video for the song 'No, I Wouldn't, Thank You', which was censored by TV channels for being too sexual and some controversial footage. Did you expect that to happen? How did the idea for such a scenario come about? Evil Eve: The script and the direction were written and directed by Miha Knific, who we hold in high esteem as an artist, and we gave him full control. We are happy that he didn't just shoot the spot, but added his own artistic touch. I am surprised that the spot is being censored, because there are a lot of things in the media today that are really morally controversial. From boys pooing half-naked on the toilet in prime time to cartoons that are dominated by violence. The new cartoon by Micha Knific, 'The Little Chickadee Wants to Grow Up', for example, is a fine example of how I imagine a good, educational, child-friendly and appropriate cartoon to be. I do not understand what is so controversial about our spot. <p/> Rocker.si: Do you want to break down the taboos in Slovenia, which, to be honest, are obviously still there, through Evil Eve and music? Will you continue to look towards provocation and towards forbidden things? Evil Eve: I don't know if our video is too much of a provocation - I see it more as a product that forces the viewer to think about today's society and culture. Otherwise, the point of view from which the viewer sees the spot is actually revealing him/herself, and nakedly so! On the other hand, I wonder, from the point of view of the average viewer, what else is provocation for Eva Breznikar after 6 years with Laibach? The fact that a nun appears in the spot is certainly not, haha. As a band, we are mostly leaving ourselves to our musical imagination in the future and wherever the road takes us, it will take us. It's important to be creative, not calculating. We're staying in the pop-rock vein, although there will be some harder or more alternative stuff on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: What are your goals in the near future? How will you approach the Slovenian audience? Evil Eve: We are aware that no matter what point a band is at, there will be positive and negative reactions. Some people still look at me with a certain prejudice, but on the other hand it's also nice when someone comes to a gig for the first time and then apologises to me backstage, saying they 'made a little mistake'. Most of the prejudice comes from people who have never been to one of my concerts, but on various forums they can conveniently hide behind pseudonyms and make insulting comments without any valid arguments. On the other hand, many people also encourage us. Our goal at the moment is to release an album and we are devoting all our energy to that. We are happy that we have more and more supporters and the gigs are dripping nicely, although we didn't expect them until the album was released, especially in this recession. So it's all the more welcome that we already have a concert repertoire ready, although we are still adding to it, adding to it, taking away from it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, I've heard from you, among other things, that you also work as a designer of unique products under the name Evil Eve. Can you tell us more about that? What do you do, how do you do it, where do you sell your products? So you are the one who takes care of the visual image of the Evil Eve members? Evil Eve: I started designing because I was always on the hunt for good pieces to put on stage, and they're hard to come by here or they're too expensive. So I finally started to do it myself. I was encouraged by a friend of mine who has been making my clothes for the stage for many years and goes by the name Dictator Fashion Lab. Over the years of working together, she noticed that I always had enough ideas for new and different accessories and kept asking me why I didn't make a piece myself. I was very active in the arts since I was a little girl, so it was no surprise to those close to me that I finally started to create bouncy pieces in all sorts of materials - from gears to leather. My work can be seen on facebook.com/EvilEveDesign and it's my hobby alongside music. <p/> The visual image of the members is not my responsibility, but everyone's. My outfits are created by the Dictator Fashion Lab according to the ideas we have in advance together. Every now and then I make a piece for one of the guys. I made a hat for the guitarist and a leather tie for the keyboard player. The boys already have a style that they wear and live by themselves and in their private lives, and it fits nicely with our stage performance. But as a woman, I think it's nice not to have some scruffy, neglected hippies in the band who justify their lack of taste by saying that 'clothes don't matter'. A person's character is reflected in everything, including clothes and style and, last but not least, if you like, in what comes out of someone's mouth. To me, the guys in the band are more than just a band. I know that I can call any of them at midnight and ask for help if I need it. <p/> Rocker.si: You were known as a great swimmer, do you ever find the time to go to the pool, given how many things are going on in your life. Where do you get all this energy from to keep from burning out? Evil Eve: Everything I do comes from sport. Sport has given me more than just medals. I don't have time to go to the pool at the moment. And yes, sometimes I burn out. <p/> Rocker.si: And finally, what would you like to say to the readers of Rocker.si? Evil Eve: Don't judge people (and bands) until you've seen them with your own eyes and ears at a concert!",Other,train

491,"News <p/> At a discussion evening in Novo mesto, Roma assistants said that the scope of their work exceeds the stipulated 4 hours a day and that they no longer believe in the systematisation of this profession in schools with Roma pupils. <p/> On Friday, in the atrium of the Goga bookstore in Novo mesto, a discussion evening with Roma assistants took place on the education of Roma and the importance of Roma assistants. The event was organised by the Roma Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today and took place as part of the European Youth in Action project. Bogdan Miklič, President of the Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today, said about the project, entitled ""Centre for Media Research and Roma Coexistence"", that it comprises a collage of events that will take place all over Slovenia, in addition to Novo mesto, in Ribnica, the Kočevje region and another municipality. ""The project will include various workshops. Romani children will try out the role of journalists in Romani settlements, write short articles, and prepare short radio diary entries. The participants are young Roma, aged between 15 and 30, who come mainly from the Novometi region,"" Miklič explained. He added that they will appear in institutions that deal with Roma issues in one way or another. ""We will also meet with high school students, we want to appear in police buildings, various schools, to create a bridge between Roma and non-Roma, to breathe together, to find a common language and perhaps to break through prejudices,"" he stressed. <p/> Miljana Mikica Gligič, a Roma helper with many years of experience, said that a Roma helper has a very wide range of possibilities and does not have to be limited to primary school. <p/> ""If we were invited, we could also work in a social work centre, a municipality, a kindergarten, the state administration or the police,"" Gligič said. <p/> Lili Majer from Kočevje says she enjoys her work, but in the beginning she overcame her fear. ""I didn't know how I would be received by the pupils, their parents and the staff at the primary school, but I have no regrets about taking this job,"" she says. <p/> Mitja Novak works as a Roma assistant at the Frana Metelka Škocjan Primary School. He has many years of experience. ""At the beginning you feel responsibility and you have no feeling how you will be received. It took me three months to get used to it. I already knew the Roma parents and the children, but what worried me most was the reaction of the parents of the other children,"" he recalls. <p/> On Friday, we talked to Roma helpers about their work and Roma education. The discussion evening took place as part of the youth initiative of the Roma Media and Coexistence Research Centre, within the framework of the European Youth in Action project. Let's listen to a part of the discussion with the participation of Roma assistants Miljana Mikica Gligič, Lilica Majer and Mitja Novak. <p/> Ms Gligičeva explained that when she started this job, the condition for a Roma assistant was that he or she had a high school education and was familiar with Roma history and the Romani language, otherwise he or she could jump into the role of a non-Roma with the relevant knowledge. Subsequent applicants had to complete a 4-year course in Roma history and culture, mathematics, Slovenian and English. ""They have been awarded National Vocational Qualification Certificates, but apparently this counts for nothing, as there is a younger generation of Roma assistants who are being posted to schools directly from the Employment Service, even though they have not received the relevant training. Their contract does not say that they will work on teaching assistance, but on socialisation and integration of Roma,"" Gligic does not see how to mobilise Roma assistants in a different way. <p/> Novak adds that a condition for becoming a Roma assistant should be a certificate of national vocational qualification. ""The Ministry of Education has made this a condition for us to be able to continue to do this work, but things remain unresolved, even though it is the sixth year since we completed the training for Roma assistants,"" Novak notes. <p/> Mitja Novak believes that the Ministry of Education can provide answers in this regard, while Lilica Majer believes that the management of the People's University of Kočevje, which is the managing partner of the project ""Successful Integration of Roma into Education II"", which is developing and implementing the activities of the Roma assistant, would know more about this. Ms Miljana Mikica Gligič suggested that additional information be provided by Dr Vera Klopčič from the Institute for Ethnic Issues, who was present at the discussion evening. She stressed the great importance of the trust created by the work of the Roma assistants and the need to strengthen the links between the various stakeholders in society involved in the education of Roma. The participants agreed that it would be a good idea to organise an extended discussion evening with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education and other organisations.",News,train

496,"For a person in pain, we think first about what caused the pain, and then about how to alleviate it. Pain is indicative of origin and cause, but rarely is it so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. <p/> 1. <p/> When something hurts, something is wrong <p/> Pain is often indicative of its origin and cause by its site of occurrence, its characteristics and the accompanying changes in the affected body part. Thus, a sore throat may be accompanied by redness of the pharynx, a sore elbow by a painful movement in a certain direction, a painful pressure on a certain spot near the joint. Painful spasms under the right rib arch after a fatty meal... So, when we think of the above-mentioned pains, we will think of sore throat, of prolonged overstrain of the muscles of the forearm, of gallstones... For most pain patients, these are unpleasant sensations caused by the activation of pain receptors in the tissues. These receptors are found in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissue, muscles, the popliteum and in the walls of internal organs (and in many places they are absent - for example, in the brain! Injury or damage to tissue releases so-called ""pain-inducing substances"" that act on pain receptors. This results in so-called nociceptive pain. This can be further divided into visceral (when the internal organs are affected - the pain will typically be in the form of painful 'spasms' - colic) and somatic (this is typically tearing and/or throbbing). When something hurts, something is wrong. Our everyday experience therefore equates pain with tissue damage or failure. When we miss a nail with a hammer and hit our thumb nail, the pain can be very severe, but we know the cause and are not frightened because we know that it is not serious and will pass quickly. When it hurts and the cause is not clear, fears arise. These can disturb our peace of mind much more than, for example, a ""chest prick"" for its own sake. That's why we want to explore pain. People choose to see a doctor more often and sooner because of pain (or other unpleasant body sensations) than because of a (painless) disturbance in a bodily function. Somehow they feel that if it doesn't hurt, it can't be worse. But if it hurts ... didn't the neighbour who was complaining of pain in his fingers have a heart attack? Didn't a colleague in the company have a sudden severe headache and bleeding in her head, but hasn't been back to work since? <p/> EXAMINE THE PAIN <p/> So, when there is pain, there is a need to see a doctor and there is a need to examine the pain. And how will the doctor proceed? In the case of a patient with pain, he or she first thinks about what caused the pain, and then about how to relieve it. Pain may give clues to its origin and cause - but it is rarely so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. It then treats the cause of the pain, and if the pain is relieved while the treatment of the cause takes longer, it treats the pain itself. (As we say, it treats ""symptomatically"" - symptomatic treatment is that which relieves the symptom, in this case the pain - but it does not treat the cause). Since pain is a subjective experience, it is from the patient that the doctor will learn most about pain (as well as other sensory abnormalities). When the patient does not provide all the information himself, he will make further targeted enquiries, especially if he has already formed a ""working diagnosis"" (hypothesis) of what the patient's pain is ""supposed"" to mean. In order to be able to direct the examination and investigations on the basis of the pain and to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, the doctor will collect information on the site of the pain, the nature of the pain (including its duration), the circumstances of the pain, the factors that amplify the pain and the factors that mitigate it. Of course, he or she will also be interested in any other information that is usually collected when talking to the patient (so-called ""history taking""). When the pain is sufficiently characteristic or accompanied by data to guide examination and investigations, the method described above will suffice. The examination process will be fairly straightforward and will not take much time. However, even in such a patient, it is often useful to measure the pain further. In a very simple way, we can assess it in the patient's own words: even with a basic record, we will define the pain in terms of intensity as mild, moderate, severe, very severe. It is also useful to note how much inconvenience it causes the subject (how it interferes with daily activities, how it disturbs sleep). Additionally - and still simply - we measure it using the so-called visual analogue scale: the subject marks the spot corresponding to the intensity of his pain on a 10 cm long straight line, bordered on the left by 0 and on the right by 10 (meaning either a state of no pain at all - 0, or a state of the worst possible pain - 10). By then measuring the marked spot (for example on a 10 cm line), a numerical indication of pain is obtained (for example 5, 5). This information is recorded in the report and will later be used to measure more precise pain intensity than just ""moderate pain"". If the patient scores the pain as 3 at the follow-up examination, we will get the impression that the pain is milder, although the patient will still self-report it as 'moderate'. Of course, a similar analogue scale can also be used to measure other inconveniences that accompany pain (e.g. how much the pain interferes with his/her social activities). In cases of chronic pain, it is useful to spend more time analysing it and to give the patient a questionnaire to fill in (this can also be completed in the waiting room). For example, such a questionnaire has been developed by colleagues at the Slovenian Association for the Treatment of Pain (Slovenian version of the Brief Pain Inventory, developed by Cleeland). Although psychological and social aspects may be present to some extent in any pain, these are explored in greater depth in chronic pain, or when the cause of the pain is not clear or seems disproportionate to the cause. All pain is perceived by the nervous system or the brain. Nerve connections carry pain information from the affected area to the brain. However, pain can also be caused by a defect in the sensory nervous system, in which case we speak of neuropathic pain. (In this context, the term 'neuropathic' is used in the broadest sense and means a nervous system defect. This should be explained because the term neuropathy is used in medicine to refer specifically to an affection of the so-called peripheral nerves. Neuropathic pain', on the other hand, refers to all pain arising from nerve damage or dysfunction, whether peripheral or central nervous system. ) When neuropathic pain is suspected, we ask targeted, detailed questions about the various accompanying neurological symptoms (such as tingling, burning, hot, cold and other unusual sensations at or near the painful site), as well as about possible additional disturbances of various other nerve functions. In short, a patient with suspected neuropathic pain will be questioned and examined differently from a patient with ""normal"", i.e. nociceptive pain. <p/> CLINICAL EXAMINATION <p/> In the case of suspected nociceptive pain, we orientate ourselves to the affected part of the body and examine it closely (otherwise we perform a general and local physical examination, which - depending on the pain - is oriented ""internal"", ""surgical"", ""orthopaedic"", etc.). In the case of suspected neuropathic pain, we focus on the ""neurological"" examination. While this includes the examination of many neurological functions, the most important part of the examination in pain is the examination of skin and mucous membrane tenderness. This examination is seemingly simple, but it is actually one of the most challenging elements of the neurological examination, both for the examiner and for the subject. In the sensitivity examination, we first look for areas of the body that are insensitive to particular qualities of sensation (to fine touch, to pain, to cold, to warm, to vibration, to joint position). We then compare whether, in different anatomically defined areas of the body, the subject feels these qualities normally or in the same way as in the area he/she describes as normally sensitive. In short, in this second part of the investigation, we try to determine the extent of the decrease in sensitivity in a particular anatomical arrangement. The anatomical distribution of the sensitivity disturbance indicates the nervous structure affected, with a particular nerve animating a different area of skin and mucous membranes than a single nerve root; in spinal cord involvement, again, the distribution is different; and in brain involvement, it is also characteristically distributed. It is, in short, the ""failure pattern"" that tells us a lot about which nerve structure is affected. Since there are many different ""dropout patterns"", practically all of them cannot be tested without completely ""tiring"" the subject, so an experienced investigator needs to create a working diagnosis (or a short ""list"" of the most likely diagnoses) on the basis of the information he or she gets from talking to the patient, in order to be able to investigate in a targeted way. In addition to the anatomical distribution of the sensitivity loss, we are also interested in the severity of the lesion. The quantitative extent of the sensitivity change can, of course, only be roughly defined by clinical examination (mild, moderate or extensive loss). When we investigate sensitivity in a patient with neuropathic pain, we will often be alerted to the fact that a mild stimulus is already felt as distinctly unpleasant, painful (this is allodynia). This patient will often go on to say that he or she feels a mild pain stimulus (for example, a light prick with a pinprick) as distinctly painful, and the pain may persist when the stimulus is no longer there (this phenomenon is called hyperalgesia and hyperpathia). In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we therefore specifically investigate whether allodynia and hyperalgesia are also present and, in addition to sensitivity to a static stimulus (pressure), we also investigate sensitivity to a moving stimulus (swiping with a cotton wool pad or brush). This sensitivity is not exclusively found in patients with neuropathic pain, but is less common in other pain conditions. The clinical examination of a patient with suspected neuropathic pain is quite extensive and demanding. This is why experts are trying to be more successful with a more targeted approach, which would be more manageable by a larger number of experts. French researchers have published a very promising short questionnaire (DN4) that can be used to discriminate well certain neuropathic pain syndromes. <p/> TECHNICAL TOOLS <p/> The sense of fine touch is orientation tested by a light touch with the finger, for a lighter touch a piece of cotton wool should be used. Good quantification of fine touch is possible with von Frey hair sticks (calibrated nylon filaments on a handle - ""monofilaments""). This method is particularly useful for studies where we want to have a completely standardised procedure. In Slovenia, hairpin testing has become established especially in the standardised screening of diabetics at risk of peripheral nerve involvement (diabetic polyneuropathy). For pain testing, we use a pumice stone (which is discarded after use! ) or a sharp broken wooden stick. The sensation of cold can be tested roughly by touching areas of skin with solid metal objects, or traditionally with a test tube filled with cold water. The sense of warmth is tested with a test tube filled with warm water. The sense of vibration is tested with a tuning fork. This sensation can be partially quantified with a special musical fork that has a scale to monitor the intensity of the vibration. When testing joint position sensation, we do not use any aids to assess the subject's sense of the position of a stationary joint and the subject's recognition of the direction of movement of the joint (as a rule, we mainly test the movement of the joints in the toes). Quantitative sensory testing has established itself as an important adjunct to the clinical examination, as it can provide quantitative and modality-specific information about the sensory impairment. Techniques are known to quantify mechanical sensation, thermal sensation and electrical stimulus detection. All of these methods are also used, at least in some places, for routine diagnostic purposes, but are, for the time being, of particular relevance to research work. The principle of these methods is to determine the threshold of sensitivity for a particular quality of sensation and, of course, the threshold of pain for a particular modality of sensation (pressure, hot, cold, etc.). Quantitative sensory testing is a ""psychophysical"" examination The tests require an alert, attentive and well-cooperative subject who understands the instructions well. We have already mentioned that touch sensitivity can be quantified by von Frey hair. These nylon filaments can also be used to determine the area of hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) to point stimuli in a patient with neuropathic pain. Thicker filaments also irritate pain receptors in the skin and can be used to determine the threshold for mechanical pain. Quantified testing of hot and cold sensation is done with special thermodes that are placed on a specific part of the body and adjusted to develop a specific temperature. In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we mainly use the method of determining the threshold of sensation. Patients with neuropathic pain often report paradoxical sensations (for example, feeling a very cold object as 'hot'). The sensation of vibration can be quantitatively assessed using vibrameters, i.e. an electromechanical device with a handpiece that has an adjustable amplitude of displacement, while applying standardised pressure to the skin. The vibrometer is used to determine the vibration detection threshold and the vibration decay threshold. In a subject with pain and suspected peripheral nerve impairment, electrophysiological methods can be used to define the impairment more precisely. The methods used are electromyography (measuring the electrical activity of muscles) and electroneurography (measuring the electrical responsiveness of nerves). A significant limitation of these methods is that they are only sensitive to abnormalities of the thicker and myelinated nerve fibres. Neuropathic pain arises particularly in the case of thin nerve fibre defects, which are not investigated by routine electrophysiological methods. In central nervous system disorders, other electrophysiological methods (measurement of sensory and motor evoked potentials) will only exceptionally contribute to a more accurate anatomical diagnosis. Therefore, in the diagnosis of central nervous system disorders, we prefer to use imaging methods, which are also useful in the diagnosis of peripheral nervous system disorders, depending on the suspected location of the lesions or lesions. At the level of pain experience, there are interactions between several nervous subsystems, as shown by studies using functional brain imaging methods. These can track changes in brain activity during the experience of pain. (PET and functional MRI methods are currently used in the investigation of pain for research purposes only. ) Especially in chronic pain syndromes, the investigation and evaluation of the psychological and social dimensions of chronic pain are necessary, but a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper. As nociceptive pain is treated differently from neuropathic pain, pain needs to be diagnosed accordingly. In neuropathic pain, we can expect better treatment success if we can differentiate between the different pain syndromes, not only in terms of the cause, but also in terms of the nature of the disorder. It seems important to distinguish between disorders with provoked pain and those with spontaneous pain. Stimulus-evoked pain can be more accurately defined by more in-depth sensory testing (especially quantitative sensory testing). While such a more precise definition of pain does not yet have a very clear impact on treatment decisions, it is hoped that a more precise definition of patients into those with dynamic hyperalgesia, static hyperalgesia and allodynia, respectively, will adequately identify specific subgroups for which we will soon be able to select appropriately targeted drugs. For the time being, a comprehensive patient interview and physical examination are an adequate basis for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain syndromes and for the follow-up of the patient during treatment. However, the management of more complex chronic pain conditions in patients usually requires a team approach to both diagnosis and treatment.",Information/Explanation,train

Since the OLC is also - or mainly - a competition that is judged, and for which awards are even given at the end of the season in some categories, one would expect the participants to respect the basic principles of fair play. The IGC track is a blatant fraud; it cannot be understood or managed in any other way. In the next few days a valid G-record will become mandatory in all competition categories. This solution is not ideal, because some instruments do not make a G-record, and someone will probably be deprived because of this, but I do not see any other possibility.

515,"Turkey, an economically highly developed country of more than 71 million people, has a remarkable history and culture and many well-preserved historical sites that are carefully maintained and cared for. Two of the most popular tourist destinations are the historic and picturesque seaside towns, which quickly captivate people with their oriental imagery. <p/> Antalya, with its riviera of long beaches, is sun-drenched for ten months of the year and is Turkey's main tourist asset. In the background, the mighty Taurus (Taurus Bull) mountains shield it from the northerly winds and hide a wealth of underground caves. It was founded by the ancient Greeks and still has its own walled quarter, as do the Jews, Christians and, of course, Muslims. Affluent Antalya is the largest city in the Mediterranean, and its population has exploded in recent decades. As recently as 1985, there were 261 000 inhabitants; now there are more than 1 200 000, and with the metropolitan area there are a million more. In addition, it hosts over ten million tourists every year. <p/> I started my walk through the old town of Kaleiçi from a vast platform with water towers and a monument to Atatürk, the reformist statesman who wanted to bring Turkey closer to Europe. Among other things, he introduced the Latin alphabet and rejected religious extremes, including the headscarf. Today, children climb his monument freely, and the country has gone off the rails. <p/> The platform overlooks the city centre, with its three mosques and a lone medieval brick-red minaret - the Yivli. I joined the strollers on the city promenade, where ice-cream makers keep the mood up - doing mischief with dondurma ice-cream on long sticks. And there I was, standing in the square in front of the Saat Kulesi clock tower, a good city landmark, turning off to the bustling bazaar among oriental smells and colourful stalls. I then continued to Hadrian's Gate, where I entered the Ottoman world from the modern part of the city. The gate in the city walls is a triumphal arch of three entrances, built in 130 AD when the then Roman Emperor visited the city. <p/> In Antalya's Old Town you can admire the sophisticated Ottoman architecture of the houses, which are home to lovely souvenir shops, galleries, small hotels and restaurants with romantic gardens. Older locals like to sit on the benches and walls, snoozing or playing their board games. <p/> Antalya has no town beach, as it is built on high cliffs. It does, however, have a charming little harbour, which is dangerous for boats in the winter months. Resting on a bench in Karaalioglu Park, near the 1st century red tower of Hidirlik, which still clings to the remains of the thick city walls, I noticed that old and young, Turkish and foreign, gather around here. I had a beautiful view of the harbour and Antalya on the cliffs. This park also ends at the sea with a steep cliff into which steps have been cut leading to small rocky platforms. <p/> The surroundings of Antalya offer plenty of opportunities for excursions as well as challenging sporting adventures. In the resort of Belek, there is a golf course stretching along the sea, along which we drove for more than half an hour, and there are areas for divers too. Not far away are historic towns such as Side, Myra, Alanya and others, where you can take public transport for a pittance. A visit to the park where the Manavgat River flows into the sea is unforgettable. Its refreshing waterfalls roar and spray droplets of water far out to sea, where they magically end in an arc of colourful rainbows. <p/> It's a story unto itself, the long Turkish Riviera, where one beach is as long as the Slovenian coast, with megalomaniacal hotel resorts, buildings like Harry Potter movies or replicas of Venice's St Mark's Square... <p/> Attractive Alanya <p/> Alanya is the oldest tourist town on the Turkish Riviera. It lies on the southern coast of Anatolia (Asia Minor) and is said to have been discovered by Cleopatra VII, the last Egyptian Pharaoh. She loved to visit here with her husband Marc Antony and their three children. One of the town's three beaches is still named after her - Cleopatra's Beach. Here, fine sand fills the turquoise sea. The pebbly beach flows east into the peninsula that divides Alanya in two. The peninsula rises steeply to a rocky hill, green at the top and hiding the remains of a once mighty fortress. You can also take a gondola almost to the top. Within the castle walls, you will find the Byzantine church, the Suleiman Mosque and the caravanserai built by Suleiman the Magnificent. The castle, which was beautifully restored just over a decade ago, was built in 1226 by the Seljuk Sultans as their winter residence, but the hill was already inhabited during the Hittite Empire more than three thousand years ago. <p/> In the Middle Ages, under Sultan Aladdin Kejkubad I, the city enjoyed a golden age. In addition to the castle, several important buildings remain from those times, such as the Kizil Kule - the Red Watchtower, which stands in the harbour below the castle and is an outstanding example of medieval military architecture, and the Tersane shipyard. <p/> On the other side of the peninsula is the town's harbour, once a favourite haunt of the notorious Mediterranean pirates. In the town, you can see the former Atatürk Villa, a fine example of Ottoman architecture. We also visited the fascinating Müze Museum, which illustrates the many civilisations of Anatolia. In the museum park, peacocks roam and strut among the remains of Roman statues and Islamic tombstones. The city thrives on tourism, and not far away is the famous Damlatas underground cave, which is said to be beneficial for asthmatics. <p/> Rich country, poor people <p/> Turkey has lush vegetation and fertile soil so that they can grow all their own food, much of it exported to the wider world. In Antalya, the masses of white-tiled greenhouses that stretch beyond the city to the foot of Taurus are visible from the plane, and there are no shortage of them among the hotel resorts. <p/> It is well known that the east of the country is poorer than the west, where there are a good number of millionaires and even 37 billionaires. However, the general impression is that, although the country is rich, they have quite a few poor people. But they have a great joie de vivre, because there are many children and young people, and everybody respects the elderly and likes to socialise with each other in large numbers. <p/> In the parks, you don't see walkers, cyclists, passionate joggers like in our country, not even people with dogs. Man's best friends live there in freedom. They are all chipped, probably neutered, and a little bit shorthaired, and they roam around happily. Incidentally, the Turks breed the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, a brave herding dog used in some African countries to guard livestock against wild beasts. <p/> The Turkish language is difficult, but thanks to the many TV series, some of the words are familiar. The first records of Old Turkic were found on Sumerian tablets, and analyses of these cuneiform tablets have shown that the language is one of the oldest recorded languages. What's more, Turks understand and still use 1200 of these ancient words. Some Slovenian words originate from Turkish, such as pavilion, kiosk, hut, yurt, tent, divan, sofa, sofa, canteen, bag, cap, pocket, top, fool, kayak, etc., and words referring to gastronomy (cevapčičič, baklava, kebab, ajvar, yoghurt, coffee, sour cherries, corn) or to horse equipment (bridle, hamat). Last but not least, we have some Turkish surnames such as Tur(e)k, Intihar, Hodalič, Jančar, Kordiž, Mankoč, Oman, Šalamun and others. There are also a few place names that remind us of Turkish times, such as Tabor, Grmada, Hudo, and even Ljubljana's Bežigrad was named after a Turkish refugee who camped there before the siege of Ljubljana.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

519,"WE CELEBRATE THE FULL SPEECH OF BISHOP JURJI BIZJAK <p/> We celebrate the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius, Apostles of the Slavs and co-founders of Europe, and we also remember Bishop Methodius, who is being beatified today, and on the occasion of the anniversary of his ordination, his successor today extends to him his heartfelt thanks for the grace of ordination, and we all thank them for their example as a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd, and as a faithful witness to all. The Holy Brothers are, of course, an example not only for the presbyters of the Church, but also for every member of the Mystical Body of Christ, since all of us share in all three missions of the Church, each in his own order and in his own vocation. The sign of the witness is the palm branch, the sign of the shepherd is the shepherd's staff, the sign of the teacher is the lamp. <p/> The sign of the teacher is the lamp: to the prophet Isaiah the Lord said: 'It is too little for you to be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the redeemed of Israel. Therefore I will make you a light to the Gentile nations, that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth' (Isa 49:6). And the prophet Malachi writes: 'The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and instruction shall be expected from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts' (Mal 2:7). The prophet Daniel says: 'The holy teachers shall shine as the brightness of the heavens, and they that have instructed many in righteousness shall be as the stars for all eternity' (Dan. 12:3). In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord said to the disciples: 'You are the light of the world ... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven' (Mt 5:16). <Shepherds are migratory, moving with their flocks from pasture to pasture, and so their staff is also a travelling staff. When Jacob's father Jacob was preparing to meet Esau after twenty years, he was in great fear. He turned to the Lord with all his heart and prayed, 'I am not worthy of all your grace and all your faithfulness, which you have shown to your servant. For (with) my staff alone I have crossed this Jordan, and now I have grown into two camps (after 20 years!). Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau! Why I fear him, that he may come and kill me, mother and children!' (Deuteronomy 32:11-12). The shepherd's staff is also similar to the royal scepter, which is also a sign of administration and provision, so the staff is also a sign of the shepherd's care for food and drink, including care for spiritual food and drink. The prophet Isaiah threatens the capital city of Jerusalem and says: 'Behold, the Almighty, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and Judah the staff and the support, all the support of bread and all the support of water' (Isaiah 3:1). 'Your rod and your staff are a comfort to me' (Ps. 23:4). <The evergreen palm tree is first of all a sign of life and growth, but palm branches in particular are also a sign of martyrdom and eternal life. The Evangelist John describes the triumph of the elect in heaven and says: 'After these things I saw a great multitude, which no one could number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and holding palms in their hands' (Rev 7:9). To be a witness is, of course, first of all a great honour and thanksgiving, but it can also be a great effort and a miserable sacrifice. As the Lord foretold us: 'In the world you will have tribulation; but believe me, I have overcome the world' (Jn 16:33). The Apostle Paul comforts us: 'For I think that the sufferings of this present time cannot be compared with the glory that is to be revealed in us' (Rom 8:18). And the Apostle James: 'Count it all joy, my brethren, if you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness' (Jas 1:2). <p/> The holy brothers Cyril and Methodius faithfully and courageously carried out the entire threefold mission, leaving us a shining example of a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd and faithful witness. The Lord also gave them an eloquence and wisdom that all their adversaries could not oppose or contradict (Mt 21:15). May their example encourage all of us to hold ever higher the three signs of our mission: the palm branch of witness, the shepherd's staff of stewardship and the lamp of teaching. <p/> I express my gratitude to Bishop Methodius for his episcopal consecration and paternal introduction to a demanding ministry, which I have accepted with great hopes and expectations. And to you, dear brother priests and faithful, I thank you for your prayers and your closeness, your understanding and your affection. When I look at the years as a whole, I think how quickly they have passed, and when I think of all that has turned and happened in the meantime, I think when did it all happen! May the Lord look upon our work and bless it, to Him be thanks for ever and ever. Amen.",Other,train

The variable part depends on the number of municipalities in the area of the development region and the development deprivation index of the region. The number of municipalities is weighted at 25 % and the development vulnerability index of the region at 75 %. <p/> (2) Co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest shall be carried out on the basis of a decision of the Minister responsible for regional development (hereinafter referred to as the Minister). The department shall send the ministerial decision on the allocation of the regional quota to the regional development agency which, at the time the decision is issued, is registered with the department and shall set it a deadline for submitting the documentation necessary for the conclusion of the grant agreement. The funds shall be allocated on the basis of a signed contract between the service and the regional development agency. Where, by decision of the Regional Council, regional development agencies also carry out development tasks for the development region, they shall be co-signatories to the contract. The contract shall specify and quantify the tasks of public interest to be carried out by the regional development agencies for the development region. <p/> (3) Notwithstanding the criteria set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, in the event of a rapid and significant deterioration of the economic situation in the area of one or more administrative units in a development region, additional resources may be allocated to finance development tasks in the region which are in the public interest. The economic situation shall be deemed to have deteriorated significantly if the registered unemployment rate in the area of the administrative unit has been 17,0 % or higher for at least two consecutive months. The regional development agency must identify the area in need of special assistance and submit a time- and cost-estimated programme of additional development tasks in that area, specifying the objectives, the task promoters, the expected results and the indicators. Funds may be granted for a maximum period of two years. If, at the end of the programme of additional development tasks, the conditions for funding additional development tasks in the region are still met, a new programme may be drawn up. The eligible costs are staff costs and the costs of preparing the programme and projects related to addressing the identified development problems in the area in need of development assistance. Eligible costs are financed at 100 %. The previous paragraph applies mutatis mutandis to the procedure for allocating funds to finance additional development tasks in the region which are in the public interest. A development region receiving development aid under a special law shall not be eligible for additional funding under this paragraph. <p/> (4) The funds granted may be disbursed on the basis of reports submitted on the activities carried out. <p/> (1) In accordance with Article 35 of the Act on the Promotion of Coherent Regional Development, assistance to municipalities for the municipal improvement of Roma settlements shall be granted as special regional incentives in priority areas facing major structural problems. <p/> (2) The following municipalities shall be eligible for the assistance referred to in the preceding paragraph: <p/> - in which a representative of the Roma community is elected to the municipal council in accordance with the law governing local self-government, or <p/> - in which a special working body of the municipal council for monitoring the situation of the Roma community is set up in accordance with the provisions of the law governing the situation of the Roma community, the members of which are also representatives of the Roma community. <p/> (3) The Service shall carry out a public call for tenders or invite eligible municipalities to submit projects within the indicative quota referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. In the call for tenders or invitation to tender, the Service shall specify the documentation to be submitted for the grant of assistance and the time limit for submission. If the call for proposals procedure is used, the Service may set the municipality a deadline for completing the project proposal. The Service shall prepare a programme proposal which shall be adopted by the Government. <p/> (4) The indicative quotas for the eligible municipalities shall be calculated on the basis of the available amount of funds in the budget item of the Service, the total number of eligible municipalities, an assessment of the equipment of Roma settlements with water supply, electricity, sewerage and transport infrastructure, the number of registered voters of the Roma community in the municipality and the funds allocated to the municipality on the basis of Articles 21 to 23 of the Act on the Financing of Municipalities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 123/09, 101/07 - Decree of the European Parliament No. 101/07, and Article 57/08). <p/> (5) Aid may be granted to co-finance the following projects in Roma settlements: <p/> - water supply systems, including intakes and pipelines to the user's connection, <p/> - sewerage networks, where these are necessary to protect water resources or for other ecological requirements, <p/> - electrification of agglomerations, <p/> - new or reconstructed local roads and paths, <p/> - purchase of land for the improvement and completion of settlements. <p/> (6) In the case of land purchase, a ceiling for co-financing per square metre of land purchased shall be set in the invitation to tender or call for tenders, irrespective of the contract price. <p/> (7) Contracts for the allocation of funds may be multiannual, taking into account the contractual commitments already entered into in previous years when determining the annual quota available. <p/> (8) Projects shall be co-financed up to 100 %. <p/> Article 12 <p/> (Financing of programme implementation costs under special laws) <p/> Notwithstanding the co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest in accordance with Article 10 of this Regulation, the total costs of the preparation and implementation of a special programme by a regional development agency shall be financed under a special contract, but these costs may represent no more than three per cent of the value of the special programme. <p/> Article 13 <p/> (Emergency regional policy measures) <p/> (1) A regional incentive may be granted to self-governing local authorities and individuals as an emergency regional policy measure in specific unforeseeable circumstances arising from a natural, ecological or other disaster. <p/> (2) Urgent regional policy measures referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be implemented in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the Regulation on the granting of regional State aid (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06, 70/07, 99/08 and 17/09). <p/> III.

534,"041 376 316 <p/> Presentation of the company EnR Manica Bohar s.p. <p/> In 2005, under the name EnR Manica Jenko s.p., the company started to implement its own developed revitalisation programmes, called Energy Revitalisation, on the Brdo pri Kranju estate, aimed at inner relaxation and calming, as well as renewal of the body, mind and energy. In two years I have gained many regular clients, mostly younger entrepreneurs and companies who wanted to invest in their key staff. In 2007, at the request of our clients, I added training to my services and began to pass on to my clients many of the skills I had acquired at the School for Quality Living. I started with group trainings - lectures, motivational and team spirit workshops. In 2011, I added intensive motivational workshops in small groups of 3-5 people, which are very suitable for key personnel and highly motivated individuals. I started to expand my knowledge with the topics of restoring inner strength and increasing performance. Later I expanded the training topics to: developing potential, managing stressful situations, managing emotions in working with people, rational energy and time management, improving interpersonal relations at work, modern communication skills, increasing productivity, creativity and performance at work, leading from the inside out, developing intrinsic motivation and others. As I am continuously learning and improving myself, in line with the new knowledge I am acquiring, as well as the identified needs of my largely regular clients, I am constantly expanding my areas of training. In 2011, I also actively focused on Human Resources Development and individual training. I am moving the personalised approach to training, which for many years was reserved only for senior managers, to all levels, with the aim of maintaining and developing healthy, happy, effective and successful individuals who can bring the most of their strengths and potentials to the business environment. I combine individual training programmes with Inner Strength - Energy Revitalisation programmes in a very innovative and effective way.

It combines elements of several disciplines; from yoga, animal mimicry, martial arts, gymnastics, functional exercises using your own body weight and so on. This type of exercise helps to build flexibility, agility, stability, endurance, strength, coordination and neuromuscular connections. <p/> BENEFITS: <p/> Improved sports performance: <p/> MaxxFIT Primal Flow was initially developed as a complement to the other exercise classes that take place in our centre. We noticed that we couldn't spend enough time during our workouts on stretching, core strength, agility, coordination and stretching exercises. Primal Flow focuses on just that. No matter what your primary sport discipline is, the MaxxFIT Primal Flow workout will improve your performance. <p/> One Legged Squat <p/> Alligator <p/> Beast <p/> Movement Coordination. You are teaching your body to move in coordination, as a whole. <p/> Bridge <p/> Cow <p/> Cardio training: <p/> Some of the explosive elements of MaxxFIT Primal Flow are extremely demanding and challenge the anaerobic system, while less demanding movements are performed at a lower intensity for a longer period of time to strengthen the aerobic system. <p/> Sideape - start <p/> Sideape - end <p/> Sidekick <p/> Stability: <p/> MaxxFIT Primal Flow strengthens all joints; from wrists and shoulders to hips, knees and ankles. A lot of movement takes place on all fours (feet and hands in contact with the ground), allowing the joints to coordinate with each other. <p/> Cocorinha <p/> Frog <p/> Flexibility: <p/> Flexibility is often a neglected element in conventional exercise programmes. MaxxFIT Primal Flow takes us through a movement that naturally increases flexibility and mobility. We stretch as we move, not with isolation exercises. <p/> Scorpion <p/> Wild Thing <p/> Relaxation. At the end of the workout, stretching yoga is used to calm and relax the body and mind. <p/> Quadstrech <p/> MaxxFIT Primal Flow is a collaboration between two instructors. <p/> Dubravko Mikač is a fan of all forms of sport, especially martial arts such as Brazilian jiu jitsu, wrestling, boxing, kickboxing, and some traditional disciplines originating from China and Russia.

547,"That the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, decided to deny our publication on Saturday morning via the twitter profile of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the information circulating about his (possible) resignation due to the fiasco of the water referendum ... <p/> ... but not himself, personally, as Minister Vizjak, since his possible departure from the ministerial office is not a matter of a decision of the ministry, but of the Prime Minister and the SDS party, suggests at least two things: <p/> - The minister's (admittedly justified) nervousness ... <p/> - ... and the fact that the quiet behind-the-scenes battle (for) Minister Vizjak is far from over. <p/> Meanwhile, it is worth noting the following: within the SDS party, it is increasingly being realised that Vizjak is no longer the minister from the second Janša government and that Vizjak is now even being meaningfully defended by individual members of Odlazko's political media on the grounds that Vizjak is ""Too Big to Fail"", which is not unexpected either. It is a logical consequence of the fact that Odlazek's media was taken into ownership some time ago <p/> When the political scene smelled a bit of Tanja Fajon - as a possible prime minister (here), Sebastjan Selan, former director of the SOVA during Pahor's government, has already appeared, then director of Petan's flagship companies, the now-sold Marina Portorož and the not-yet-sold Terme Čatež, also allegedly involved in the secret filming of Minister Zdravko Počivalšek during the mask affair (source), when Selan himself made a quick buck selling protective medical equipment during the first wave of the epidemic of Covida-19. Selan has long been considered a silent and publicly unacknowledged advisor to Fajon and, according to our sources within the SD, has already started recruiting (read: promising posts and positions ""when we come to power""), and in doing so, of course - quite expectedly for those who are more familiar with the situation in the party - he has bumped into the SD Secretary General Dejan Levanič and another behind-the-scenes SD recruiter, former SD Director General Uroš Jauševec. <p/> Today and tomorrow, including the days after Sunday's water referendum, are indeed thunder days for the Janez Janša government. After the referendum fiasco and the opposition's threats of a new constructive no-confidence motion, three extremely important votes of the National Assembly are scheduled today and tomorrow, when the government will need at least 45 and even 46 votes: <p/> - Today's vote on the demographic fund <p/> - And (tomorrow's) re-vote on the amendment to the law on infectious diseases, and the vote on the election of a new Minister for Digitalisation - Marko Boris Andrijanič (NSi). <p/> Because if all these votes fall, the Janša government will be seriously shaken, maybe even fall (well, the government representatives assure internally that they have the votes of the MPs guaranteed), which would most probably be followed by early elections.

556,"Turnkey prefabricated houses are available for anyone who wants to live in a cosy warm home. In addition to prefabricated houses, wooden houses are also an excellent choice. All information, benefits, contacts, opinions in one place. <p/> Category Archives. In Slovenia, wooden houses, wooden prefabricated houses are still quite unknown, not widespread. Most of the prefabricated wooden houses are made of logs. In terms of speed of construction, prefabricated wooden houses are built about as quickly as conventional prefabricated concrete houses. So there is no fear of construction taking too long. The main advantage of prefabricated wooden houses, at first sight, for us non-experts in this field, is that the material is wood. And it is high-quality solid wood, which is a completely natural, ecological material. So a prefabricated wooden house is homely, cosy, natural to look at. In addition, prefabricated wooden houses have good insulation, they are extremely safe in terms of seismic safety and, believe it or not, what is not apparent at first sight is that they are very safe from fire. So prefabricated wooden houses are no less fire-safe than a traditional prefabricated house. <p/> In any case, it makes sense to at least consider the possibility of a prefabricated wooden house, because it is a quality, natural, homely construction. Most people who decide to build a house do not even know that they have the possibility of living in a wooden house. And many experts in this field say that prefabricated wooden houses are the future in Slovenia, where we are known for the large percentage of forests. <p/> Building a house is the biggest material project in life for most people (Slovenians even more so). And it is usually a once-in-a-lifetime project, so the decision on what kind of house to build really has to be the right one. Or are we going to say, three years from now, when the neighbour has a special house, ""Ah, let's do it that way...""? No, it is not. So it is a very important decision. <p/>But there are many questions here. More and more people are asking whether prefabricated houses are the right decision. We have already talked about the facts that support prefabricated houses. But the decision is by no means over. When we decide to build a prefabricated house, some say a turnkey house, we have to ask ourselves - do we want a prefabricated house or a conventional house. The layman tends to lump the two together. But the differences are, in the eyes of the experts, extremely significant. Classic turnkey prefabricated houses have the walls made in the factory, then they are just erected on the building site. Skeleton prefabricated houses, on the other hand, require more effort and work on site, where the so-called skeleton is first assembled, then the walls are filled in. <p/> Many people are convinced by the quality of prefabricated houses, despite their perhaps slightly higher price. An essential feature of turn-key skeleton construction is the increased load-bearing capacity of the walls, which in turn means greater seismic safety, greater storm safety and greater fire safety. Turnkey prefabricated houses generally have extremely good characteristics, exceptional quality, and the proportion of these is increasing. Skeleton construction of prefabricated houses is considered by some to be the best quality choice at the moment. In the end, of course, the decision is yours. <p/> quickly built - a few months after the building permit is obtained <p/> extremely easy to build - no guesswork, no searching for craftsmen, no fixing complications, no searching for materials - all taken care of by the company you choose <p/> seismically safe <p/> very economical <p/> made from environmentally friendly materials. <p/> Contact us by filling in the form on the first page - we provide you with several manufacturers or prefabricated houses or wooden houses, and then you choose which one you like best - easy and fastest for you.",Promotion,train

Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland managed to do in ""just"" nine years what Messner took a total of 17 years to do: climb all fourteen of the world's eight-thousanders. <p/> Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland is a true high-altitude mountaineer. He is a man who has left the beaten track, taken his own path, almost played with the eight-thousanders, and in the process opened up some new perspectives for mountaineering at such altitudes. ""On 18 September 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka was on the summit of the 8046-metre-high Shisha Pangma and confirmed Messner's ambition of ""one man on all eight thousand metres"" as the second man. Like Messner, Kukuczka, a trained electrical engineer, was trying to blaze new trails: not the usual expedition routes, but much more challenging routes, some of them even in winter! Do the two super-climbers - Messner completed his round of fourteen eight-thousanders just one year before his rival - see each other as rivals? ""I can understand the race for the most climbs, but not the race for the most eight-thousanders"", the South Tyrolean commented. Was that really an honest word? In any case, the Pole also stresses that he had no rival in sight in pursuit of his great mountaineering goal. He even seems to have unlimited respect for Messner's success: ""This man deserves all our respect; he was the first to climb all the eight-thousanders - some of them more than once"". Sympathetic words. Kukuczek started with Lotse (8516 metres) in 1979, followed by Mount Everest (8848 metres). In October 1981, he himself climbed Makalu (8463 metres). A year later, he climbed Broad Peak, and in the summer of 1983 he climbed Gasherbrum II and I. In 1985, he succeeded in Daulagiri (8167 metres) and Cho Oyu (8201 metres). Kukuczka's ninth eight-thousander was Nanga Parbat (8125 metres). ""Stations"" 10,11, and 12 were - all in 1986 - Kangchendzenga (8586 metres), K 2 (8611 metres) and Manaslu (8163 metres). Anapurna (8091 metres) was the next in February 1987. Lastly, as already mentioned, Shisha Pangma in September 1987. On the summit of this mountain, a Pole bivouacked, brought his skis and descended to base camp the next morning! Jerzy Kukuczka lives with his family - his wife and two young sons - in Katowice. He is considered to be rather shy, he does not want to be in the limelight, he does not like television cameras. He has made a reputation not only for his own climbs, but also as a leader of mountaineering expeditions. He has always tried to get as many climbers as possible to the highest peak. On Shisha Pangama, he was accompanied by Wanda Rutkiewicz, his compatriot, who is considered the most successful climber of the highest mountains.",News,train

569,"Today, thinking or the free public use of the mind is once again becoming a matter of survival. Delirium is at the core of the political mainstream. This is also reflected in the sentence uttered by the Finance Minister-designate at Monday's hearing: ""We find ourselves in an extremely challenging situation where, logically, we should be doing something, but we are forced to do the opposite."" Mramor's sentence thus suggests that the incoming government will take decisions that will go against logic, i.e. common sense, and therefore against what would be best for the majority of people. <p/> So the government will continue to follow the delirious path that is deepening the crisis, imposing policies as solutions that have long since been proven to be counterproductive and harmful. Therefore, as long as we allow those who have received their mandate from the people, in their self-confidence and harmful optimism, to continue to take decisions unhindered, not by following the logic of things, but by following its opposite (where the guiding principle becomes the service of this or that private interest to the detriment of the community), a way out of the crisis is neither probable nor possible. <p/> Today's problem is not at all a lack of optimism or even pessimism, as one might think if one were to accept uncritically the statements that people in the highest positions make in the public arena. What is much more problematic at this time is a particular kind of optimism, which is most often expressed by the very representatives of the political and economic elites. <p/> We could get an impression of such optimism listening to the outgoing Prime Minister in an interview on the national television channel. In particular, she praised the past achievements of her government, and then went on to talk, with a kind of barbecue, about how she is convinced that, in the end, we will find a solution to the problem that will arise when the route of the pipeline is decided again, where the interests of Russia and the EU are in conflict (and she herself will have to do a somersault in her future role as Commissioner, representing exactly the opposite position on this issue to the one she held as Prime Minister when she met the Russian gas tycoon), which will definitely make the future bright. <p/> Her completely uncritical rant, which was also without a hint of feeling for the difficult situation in which many families and individuals in this country find themselves, having to deal with questions about how to get through the month on a daily basis, is not an isolated case, though. Optimism has become quite commonplace in the speeches of politicians, although it is difficult to show that it actually accompanies action to improve the quality of life of citizens - it often appears precisely in the absence of any substance, or when someone in a position of responsibility is rightly expected to make a constructive proposal or take a very concrete step (because that is what they are elected to do), and yet, by waxing lyrical, they are hiding the fact that they have no idea of how to tackle the most acute problems. <p/> One of the most optimistic politicians here is certainly the President of the country himself. In a recent speech, he said this: ""If we are smart, brave and composed enough, we can now finally turn things around. Over time, people's living standards will rise again, our confidence in the country's legal and political institutions will be strengthened and an encouraging, optimistic mood will return."" What exactly is the basis for such optimism? What - apart from fine words - is there here to inspire credibility? What political solutions to one of the most serious problems, such as the growing poverty among the population and the immense enrichment of a minority, are promised in the actions of the incoming government? What reason for optimism should we have in view of the fact that the unemployment rate has not changed significantly and that there is no prospect of any beneficial changes any time soon (and with the statements of the future Finance Minister, there are perhaps even fewer reasons for such optimism)? <p/> On the side of those in power today, the trend is one of optimism and overconfidence, which could more accurately be described as pathological narcissism, where the rest of us are reduced in their eyes to a passive audience that is merely there to validate their inflated egos (the various fights for the post of Commissioner and the self-aggrandisement of who is better suited for it are a sign of this very phenomenon). <p/> It may seem to some that, since we still do not have a prescription for how to build a democratic society, it is best to leave things to those who have already ""screwed up"" many things in the past (just think how many members of parliament and even of the incoming government have formed past ""fallen"" governments, and have now been given a mandate again for the next few years), since they are at least old acquaintances on the political scene (and should therefore know how to go about the management of common affairs). <p/> Some change of mind is needed. Derrida's idea of democracy implies that democracy is a process that is also a learning process: democracy is the happening, the practising or learning of democracy. So the (democratic) communion has yet to be invented or inventing. An honest attitude is therefore not the flimsy optimism of a Pahor or Bratušek, but anything but. It requires a lot of thinking, intellectual work and experimentation, trying out the ways in which people organise their daily lives in community. And that means that it will only be possible when people try to live it, to put it into practice, to practise it, and therefore when they come to the debate without asking the authorities for permission. Democracy cannot be taught to the people, nor is it necessary. But a certain amount of self-reliance is certainly in order. It is probably true that any political engagement requires a great deal of thought, study and insight into many complex issues, but that does not mean that one should remain silent until someone gives the floor and allows one to speak up. Democracy cannot be some once-and-for-all status quo brought to the people by a good man like Santa Claus. This is why Derrida stressed that democracy is always its own promise, something that is always yet to come (if people work for it, of course). <p/>The biggest obstacle to democratisation and engagement is not ignorance at all, because Socrates already knew that it is in fact the privileged place of the production of all possible knowledge. The greatest obstacle to both the spiritual or mental progress of the individual and the progress of the community towards the common good is the arrogance that is everywhere today in the words of the most influential politicians and other members of the elite. Listening to politicians of the highest rank, from the President of the European Commission to prime ministers and economists of the international financial institutions, one gets the impression that they all know the solutions, we just have to let them implement them. (And then, when these people are actually given a free hand, more often than not, the opposite happens: problems are potentiated, because their ""solutions"" become the real problems - just remember t. (This is because such arrogance is akin to stupidity, which invariably has very concrete (and most often disastrous) effects on the people who are forced to live under its rule. This is also why it is necessary to shake off the prejudice that the ruling class always knows what it is doing. (All we can do, then, is to leave it alone in its self-delusion and join in the optimism it calls us to). This prejudice is also supported by the view that, in the circumstances, it is best to keep to oneself and mind one's own business, which then leaves the people on the political periphery as a more or less helpless bystander. <p/> The process of democracy therefore necessarily coincides with resistance to whatever makes it impossible (today, this is especially capitalism and its sadistic imperative to increase and centralise profits). Resistance is therefore logical, rational, in the name of logic. But without a critical attitude and a systematic use of doubt (especially when we are confronted with the statements and actions of agents of power), we cannot speak of democracy at all. <p/> Much more than simulated optimism, what we need is resistance in the name of logic, i.e. of mental action: this coincides here with an unshakable trust in the power of intelligence, i.e. in man's creative capacity and power to produce new ideas (such a trust has been contemplated by Enlightenment philosophers from Socrates and Plato to Spinoza and Descartes and Kant and Derrida...), which will, as an important part of the process of democracy, determine the shape of the world to come.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
570,"Description. We presented the public goods game, its rules, strategies and possible payoffs. We have presented the three main elementary strategies for playing the public goods game. These are co-operation, co-operation with reward and co-operation with punishment. In order to make the results comparable throughout the paper, we have tried to choose parameters where we can compare the results directly or at least within some reasonable similarity. The presentations of the elementary strategies showed that they contribute to fostering the development of cooperation and that punishment is the most successful of the presented ones, because it fosters cooperation even at lower synergy factors. The presentation of the elementary strategies is followed by a test of whether there are any evolutionary advantages in combining correlated positive and negative reciprocity into a single strategy. Similarly to the presentation of the elementary strategies, we have also looked at the strategy of simultaneous reward and punishment and obtained results showing that, independently of the synergy factor at which the simulations were run, the combined strategy of punishment and reward did not show evolutionary advantages over the elementary strategies of reward and, in particular, punishment. While narrow bands have been shown for very unrealistic parameters where the combined strategy can show its strength, it also appears that punishment alone would be superior for the same parameters.

I don't know the exact reason for that, it just seemed to me that everything was organised and carried out with less passion and enthusiasm. <p/> The weigh-in started at around 15:00. When the competitors arrived, it was immediately noticeable that the women's part of the competition in particular was going to be very modest in participation this year. Only three female competitors in the body-fitness category and two in the bikini category showed up. This is almost disappointing for a competition of this reputation. Apart from the competitors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were not very competitive this year, most of the competitors came from Croatia. I missed the representatives from Slovenia and Hungary, whose participation greatly increased the quality and competitiveness of the competition. <p/> The number of visitors to the competition was also disappointing. The visiting hall has been considerably fuller in recent years, and the fans have been in a better mood. <p/> The competition started at 18:30. It went much faster than in previous years, which is commendable, but this is most likely due to the low turnout. <p/> Bikini fitness <p/> Bodybuilding over 95kg <p/> Absolute bodybuilding <p/> Adoni Costo <p/> The whole event ended with the traditional snack around 11 pm. <p/> The bikini category recorded the lowest turnout. I think that the latter is not yet widespread enough in Bosnia and Herzegovina for people to understand it or to want such a category. I hope that it will become more established in the coming years. <p/> The competition itself has also been cast in a bad light by some questionable and controversial refereeing decisions. I hope that this will not happen again in the future, as such behaviour by judges may lead to an even greater decline in the number of competitors and thus in the quality of the competition. <p/> Personally, I came back from the competition with good impressions. My competitor Marko Barić won the first place and thus the gold medal in his category. My competitor Meri Anronić, whom I helped in the last week of preparation before the competition, was also successful. I am only sad that she did not win first place, as she showed much better fitness than the first place winner.

While reading the FB posts of mums, I thought it was possible that I had diastasis, which I checked with a quick test. <p/> Irena Godec: I was told about the term after my second birth. After the first birth, they only mentioned abdominal muscle spacing and I didn't pay much attention to it.

As I knew about the term diastasis, I looked it up on the internet and found Alja Malis' website. That is how I decided to follow her postnatal programme. After two months I no longer have diastasis. <p/> Mateja Platovšek: Exercise for postnatal mothers (Postpartum Revival), stopping the previous exercise and being careful with everyday tasks such as getting up from the side, lifting the baby properly, loads. <p/> Alja Malis: Is there anything else you would like to add? <p/> Irena Godec: This is what my belly looked like (picture below) before and after inadequate exercise after my second childbirth.

It made part of the performance-related salary tax-free. But it did so in such a veiled and disguised way that we sometimes wonder whether it was sincere in its intention, because the tax gift announced with fanfare has two flaws that the uninitiated tend to overlook. This is because the payment is not exempt from all taxes, since only income tax is reduced and social contributions are not. And such contributions are not exactly a negligible burden in our country.

614,"international protection - restriction of movement of an applicant for international protection - removal procedure - abuse of procedure - objective criteria - implementation of the Directive <p/> Core <p/> The presumption that an applicant has made an application solely to delay his/her return can be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that Article 8 of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Directive is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 is amended accordingly. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> I. The action is allowed and the contested decision No 2142-906/2020-6 (1312-02) of 4 June 2020 is annulled. <p/> II. The application for interim measures is dismissed. <By the contested order, the defendant detained the applicant on the ground that his movements were already restricted as a result of the return procedure under the Law on the entry, stay and departure of aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the removal procedure, and that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant had lodged the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. It decided that the applicant would be detained at the premises of the Aliens Centre in Postojna from 4 June 2020 from 15.20 until the end of the reason, but no longer than until 4 September 2020 at 15.20, with the possibility of an extension of one month. <p/> 2. In the grounds for the decision, the defendant states that the applicant lodged an application for international protection in the Republic of Slovenia on 4 June 2020. On 2 June 2020, the applicant was released from prison. .... The District Court ... imposed on him, inter alia, the ancillary sanction of expulsion of the alien from the country. As it was not possible to remove the applicant immediately from Slovenia, he was placed by decision of 2 June 2020 in the Aliens Centre, where he expressed his wish to apply for international protection on 3 June 2020, and his application was formally accepted on 4 June 2020. At the time of his application, the applicant stated that he had left his country of origin 4 years previously. He has not yet applied for international protection in Slovenia, but he has applied in Italy, where he holds a passport. He has been in Slovenia since October 2019. The applicant said that he was applying now because he had been in prison, and in prison he did not know that he could apply for international protection. Immediately after his entry into Slovenia, he was caught and put in prison. He was in Italy waiting for a decision on his application for international protection, but in the meantime he made a mistake and went to Slovenia, where he went to prison. He is seeking international protection in Slovenia because he is at risk in Pakistan. <p/> 3. According to the defendant, the condition for restriction of movement laid down in Article 84(3)(1) of the International Protection Act ('the IPA-1') is fulfilled. Given that the applicant had previously applied for international protection also in France and Italy, and then went to his country of origin and married there, and came back to Italy and then to Slovenia, the Court finds that by such actions he prevents any State from taking a substantive decision on his alleged problems in his country of origin. The applicant was also the subject of removal proceedings from the Republic of Slovenia, which he formally discontinued by lodging an application for international protection. For the above reason, the defendant rightly concludes that he made the application only with a view to delaying or obstructing the implementation of the removal. Since his arrest by the police on 11 October 2019, he has had the opportunity to apply for international protection, but has not done so. He could have made an application earlier and not only at the time of his detention in the Detention Centre, as he was certainly aware of this possibility in the light of his previous applications. <p/> 4. In the further reasoning of the decision, the defendant explains in detail why it is necessary to restrict the applicant's movements to the premises of the Aliens Centre and not to the asylum centre, where such a restriction of movement could not be sufficiently effective. The purpose of the restriction of movement could not be achieved by a less severe measure, since there are no appropriate mechanisms in the asylum centre to prevent the departure of the asylum seeker from the asylum centre. <p/> 5. The applicant brings the present action on all the grounds laid down in Article 27 of the Administrative Disputes Act (hereinafter 'the ADL-1'). In his application, he submits that he has been consistent in his statements throughout. He had already lodged an application for international protection in Italy on 2 August 2018 and before that in France (4 July 2017). In Pakistan, his entire family is in dispute with his uncle over land left by his grandfather. The uncle has taken this land and is now threatening the complainant and his brother. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to go back as he is afraid of his uncle. At the same time, he wishes he could sell the land and move to Italy or Slovenia with his family. That's why he applied for international protection here as soon as he got out of prison .... He did not lodge his application in Slovenia with the intention of delaying or obstructing his removal from Slovenia. His application is substantive and genuine and is not made to obstruct the proceedings. Furthermore, a measure of restriction of movement to the Aliens Centre may only be ordered where, in a particular case, a measure of restriction of movement to the asylum centre cannot be effectively implemented. The defendant could have ordered a mandatory detention order in the asylum centre, which would have been a proportionate measure. The applicant claims that the Court should allow the action and set aside the contested order and, in the alternative, that the Court should allow the action, set aside the contested order and refer the case back to the defendant for further proceedings. <p/> 6. The applicant also applied for an interim injunction together with the application, requesting the court to suspend the operation of the contested order pending a final decision on that order. The contested order infringes the applicant's right to personal liberty. <7. In its reply to the application, the defendant submits that the contested order is lawful and correct and therefore maintains it and requests that the action be dismissed as unfounded. <p/> Concerning point I of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 8. <In reaching its decision, the defendant relied on Article 84(1)(3) of the MZM-1.  It follows from Article 84, paragraph 3, of the Law on the Protection of the Persons with Disabilities, that the competent authority may order an applicant to be subject to a measure of compulsory detention in the territory of an asylum home where the applicant's movement is restricted as a result of the return procedure pursuant to the Law on the Entry, Stay and Departure of Aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the return procedure or the removal procedure, and where there are grounds to believe that the applicant has made the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, where he/she has had the opportunity to apply for international protection. It follows from the above provision that several conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled in order for this ground for restriction of movement to be established. One of the conditions is that it may be reasonably assumed that the applicant made the application only to delay or impede the execution of the removal, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. The defendant based its presumption that the applicant had made the application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal on the fact that he had not made the application earlier, even though he could have done so. <p/> 11. The provision of Article 84(3)(1) ZMZ-1 implements Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection ('Reception Directive II') in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia. The above-mentioned provision of the ZMZ-1 implements Article 8(3)(d) of the Reception Directive II. It provides that an applicant may be detained where the applicant is detained for the purpose of return proceedings in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2008 on the application of the European Return Procedure (Directive 2008/115/EC). The Member State concerned may, on the basis of objective criteria, including the fact that the applicant has already had the opportunity to initiate the asylum procedure, conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is making the application solely to delay or impede the execution of the return decision. Furthermore, Article 8(3) of the Reception Directive II further provides that the grounds for detention are to be defined in national law. <p/> 12. That provision therefore expressly provides that the presumption that an applicant has made an application solely for the purpose of delaying his or her return may be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that the above-mentioned provision of the Reception Directive II has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Reception Directive II is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 has been amended accordingly (Article 84(1)(3), first indent, ZMZ-1). The ZMZ-1 should lay down criteria by which it could be reasonably concluded whether an applicant has lodged an asylum application for the sole purpose of withholding his/her removal. Such objective criteria should also be laid down in the law in order to respect the basic principles underlying Reception Directive II. Thus, the introductory part of the cited Directive states in point 15 that the detention of applicants should be applied in accordance with the basic principle that a person should not be detained solely because he or she is seeking international protection, in particular in accordance with the international legal obligations of the Member States and Article 31 of the Geneva Convention. An applicant should only be detained in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, as provided for in this Directive, and taking into account the principle of necessity and proportionality as regards both the manner and the purpose of such detention. <p/> 13. Therefore, since Reception Directive II explicitly provides in its introductory part that detention may only be carried out in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, the criteria for presuming that someone has made an application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal must be sufficiently defined in law, and, as already explained, the current MHC-1 does not contain such objective criteria. The mere fact that an applicant lodges an asylum application at the time when removal from the country is being carried out does not in itself mean that he has lodged it solely for the purpose of obstructing removal, having regard to the fact that it is apparent from the data in the Eurodac database, which form part of the administrative file, that the applicant had previously lodged an application for international protection in Italy and France. <p/> 14. The Court further observes that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia has already examined the correctness and lawfulness of the decision in cases X Ips 1/2019 and X Ips 11/2019 concerning Article 84(1)(5), first indent, of the ZMZ-1, which refers to Article 28 of Regulation 604/2013/EU ('the Dublin III Regulation'), and thus to the risk of absconding referred to in Article 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation, which provides that the risk of absconding must be established on the basis of the objective criteria laid down by the law. The Supreme Court, in its judgments in the cases cited above, found that these criteria (despite Article 31(2) of the MZZ-1, which deals with the risk of absconding in a blanket manner) are not present in the MZZ-1, and that there is therefore no legal basis for the imposition of such a measure of restriction of movement. In the present case, the objective criteria for the defendant to be entitled to reasonably assume that the applicant is applying for international protection only to delay or impede the implementation of the return decision are not laid down in the law. The Court therefore concludes that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a movement restriction measure under Article 84 § 84 (3), first indent, of the MLM-1 in the present case either. <15. Since the Court of First Instance considers that, in the present case, there is therefore no ground for restriction of movement under the third indent of Article 84(1) of the ZMZ-1, the Court of First Instance annuls the contested decision on the basis of Article 64(1)(4) of the Causes of Action Act. Since the Court annulled the order on the ground that it had erred in the application of substantive law, it did not rule on all the other pleas relied on by the applicant in the application. <p/> 16. Article 84(6) of the CTMO-1 provides that the court shall, after hearing the applicant orally beforehand, decide on the applicant's application within three working days. It is clear from the draft ZMZ-11 that the hearing is to be held on the grounds of a substantial interference with the applicant's liberty, i.e. in his favour. However, in the present case, where there is no adequate basis for the measure of restriction of movement under Article 84(3), first paragraph, first indent, of the ZMZ-1, a hearing of the applicant would even achieve the opposite purpose. The holding of a main hearing would therefore be an end in itself; at the same time, the principle of the economy of proceedings would be infringed, since the court would have to ensure the applicant's presence, provide him with an interpreter and represent him by proxy in order to hear him, thereby incurring unnecessary procedural costs. Nor was the defendant's right to be heard thereby infringed, since he was served with the application, to which he replied. <p/> On point II of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 17. The Court dismissed the application for interim measures, applying mutatis mutandis Article 36(1)(6) Causa-1, on the ground that, in the light of the decision on the application for interim measures, the applicant had no legal interest in the interim proceedings. In accordance with Article 73(1) of the Causes of Civil Procedure Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment and, since no appeal is possible, the court's judgment (point I of the operative part of the operative part of the judgment) means that the court has given a final decision on the matter, and the applicant therefore no longer has a legal interest in the interim injunction, which is time-bound until the final decision. The final judgment of that judgment in itself terminates the restriction of movement, since the order for restriction of movement has been lifted.",Legal,train

648,"Dear Sir or Madam ! Please post this reflection of mine ! The public sector is financed from the budget, which in turn is ""filled"" by the economy. This same economy has gone through so many crises over the last DECADES and more, but has survived them all. If we remember the last crises, when the same ""now striking administration"" was telling us that the wage bill of the companies is what it is, that it cannot be increased, and that we should find our INTERNAL reserves and share this wage bill.... Where and what is now the face of this same administration, which at that time ""taught us to manage"" , now that the FIRST CRISIS has come for THEM and there is no money to take from the state coffers because they are empty, and it cannot or will not tell itself this. This time there is no solidarity !???!!! Apart from the fact that all DU employees have guaranteed jobs, which is far from being the case in the economy, they have, on average, a higher education than the economy, but not more responsibility because they do what is prescribed for them, mostly leisurely work, and they have good working conditions.... and on and on and on, incomparable to the economy. If any of the civil service workers do not like this and that job, they should resign and come to the economy. Here the working conditions will be different, the salaries the same, no promotions according to seniority.... and there are benefits that do not exist in the economy as in DU. Besides, this government should ""audit"" the entire administration, identify MORE employees and send them to the employment service as in the economy and money is saved immediately in the budget as the benefits from the employment service are much smaller. The introduction of computerisation has simplified procedures compared to the previous manual work and the number of employees in DU is increasing. Where is the logic here ? Isn't this already a blatant mockery of the economy ? We would all do well to ""shut up"" and wait for better times for better wages. I don't mean that DU should not be used, it should just be rationalised, because in some sectors there are even 30-40% too many employees in the JU. There is a MASS for JU salaries and finding internal reserves. If someone is a top it can be both in DU and in the economy and why privilege; a worker from the economy to ""work the stock exchange"", but not a JU employee because the JU does not share its money for salaries, but the contributions of the economy. If the civil service is not satisfied with a salary of between 1 000 and 2 000 Euros and would find it impossible to survive if it were reduced by perhaps 100 Euros, they should think of their neighbours, acquaintances, relatives, pensioners, the unemployed.... who have to survive a month on 250 Euros of social assistance or a salary of 450 Euros for a job that these same gentlemen dislike and are ashamed of. We in the economy are not ashamed of doing any work, but they can be SHAMED of being so 'greedy and uncharitable' towards those who earn money on their, not very small, salaries for the work they do. The cheques have to be paid by us 'little ones' too, but with much much smaller incomes. 'Where there is no money, even the army cannot take it'. This should be the guiding principle of the striking civil service !!! And hello strikers, I would say Bogdan Pleša --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.11.2010 Dear ! I cannot imagine that the state is so DIVIDED with various aids and supports to categories of people who are ineligible or no longer in need. Every 20th of the month I watch how this is played out in M.Sobota. Roma people drive their Mercedes, BMWs, Audis ..... to the NLB car park to get help, raise support, and then occupy the pubs and get drunk. I have already pointed this out to the CSD and suggested that they should find out again who is actually entitled to support, but the ladies won't get off their arses and would go to the field to check the reality of the situation. A family that has a car is not a social problem and, in my opinion, is not entitled to support. How 'difficult' it is to find out who owns a vehicle, if we 'pull' from the vehicle registration database all the vehicles registered in a settlement such as Pušča, it is no easier, you just have to have the courage to do your job honestly - a well-paid and surely 'public job' for which civil servants struggle to get paid. But where is the accountability for their work. Do they realise that in doing so they are cutting off the bread of those who actually need help ? The t.z. should also be checked. ""The 'divorced couples' who are separated only because the lady is a single mother, but in reality they continue to live together. Again, someone has not done their job. Is it the municipality, the KS or another centre that knows the real situation, the CSD that gives help and support and who else? If all the 'salary strikers' would rather do their job as they should and at least be a little bit aware of the responsibility for their work, it would be much much better. It is not really possible to identify all the irregularities, because it is mainly the Roma who are 'cunning', but it is a fact that a great deal of money would be left in the state coffers for other, urgent needs. Mr Svetlik, in particular, needs to reflect on this and put things right in THIS area of his own. If he cannot or will not do this, HE SHOULD RESIGN, because incompetent ministers were disliked by Maria Theresa and are unwanted even now. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, but a cut has finally got to be made in this area too. If you analyse the matter well, you will see that I am right, we just have to do our job as well as we can and for which we are paid, even if it is unpleasant. I am writing all this for the sake of all those who actually need help to survive, not for luxury and drunkenness ! LP !!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.12.2010 PUBLIC SECTOR STAFF - what is this, is it true ? I'M THINKING BUT I'M NOT CLEAR ?! The public sector is financed from the budget, which in turn is ""filled"" by the economy. This same economy has gone through so many crises over the last DECADES and more, but has survived them all. If we remember the last crises, when the same ""now striking administration"" was telling us that the wage bill of the companies is what it is, that it can't be increased, and that we should find our INTERNAL reserves and share this wage bill.... Where and what is now the face of this same administration, which at that time ""taught us to manage"" , now that the FIRST CRISIS has come for THEM and there is no money to take from the state coffers because they are empty, and it cannot or will not tell itself this. Where to take ? This time there is no solidarity !???!!! Apart from the fact that all the employees of the SOEs have guaranteed jobs, which is far from being the case in the economy, and that they have, on average, a higher education than the economy, but not a greater responsibility because they do what they are supposed to do, mostly leisurely work, and they have good working conditions.... and on and on and on, incomparable to the economy. If any of the civil service workers do not like this and that job, they should resign and come to the economy. Here the working conditions will be different, the salaries the same, no promotions according to seniority.... and there are benefits that do not exist in the economy as in the SOEs. Besides, this government should ""audit"" the entire administration, identify MORE employees and send them to the employment service, as in the economy, and money is saved immediately in the budget, as the benefits from the service are much smaller. The introduction of computerisation has simplified procedures compared to the previous manual work, and the number of employees in the UI is even increasing. Where is the logic here ? Isn't this already a blatant mockery of the economy ? We would all do well to ""shut up"" and wait for better times for better wages. I do not mean that DU does not need to, it should just be rationalised, because in some sectors there are even 30-40% too many employees in the JU. There is a MASS for JU salaries and finding internal reserves. If someone is a top earner it can be both in the JU and in the economy and why the privilege; a worker from the economy to the ""labour exchange"", but not a JU employee, because the JU does not share its money for salaries, but from the contributions of an already severely undernourished economy. If the civil service is not satisfied with a salary of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 2 000, and would find it impossible to survive if it were reduced by perhaps EUR 100, they should think of their neighbours, acquaintances, relatives, pensioners, the unemployed and the unemployed.... who have to survive on EUR 250 a month in social assistance or EUR 450 in salary for a job that these same gentlemen dislike and are ashamed of. We in the economy are not ashamed of doing any work, but they can be SHAMED of being so 'greedy and uncharitable' towards those who earn money on their, not very small, salaries for the work they do. The cheques have to be paid by us 'little ones' too, but with much much smaller incomes. Where is the end of the greed of the public administration or just of Posedi. We used to ""feed"" Belgrade and when it was no longer possible to give more, we were attacked. Will the public sector do the same, destroying the economy and wiping out the country ??? ""Where there is no money, even the army cannot take it"". This should be the guiding principle of the striking public administration now !!!

651,"WHICH MALE OF THE ZODIAC IS THE HARDEST TO GET OVER? <p/> Which zodiac sign is the man born in who is the hardest to get over, depending on the astro sign you were born in? <p/> Even though they're over and you want to treat him like all exes, somehow you can't forget about him. Just one thought of his smile, his joking remarks, the way he pronounced your name is enough to keep you from getting over him completely. Wondering what sign the man you may never get over is born in, depending on the zodiac sign you were born in? <p/> LIBRA GETS OVER LIBRA THE HARDEST <p/> A romantic man born in Libra is your opposite, so strong that you're incredibly attracted to him even if you've ended the relationship. You can relive your great chemistry for years to come and no other man is as attentive as a Libra when it comes to intimate relationships. His graceful Venusian energy will long remain in the memory of the sheep, triggering the warmth that the sheep, although acting all-powerful and stable, constantly craves. <p/> Taurus is the hardest Sagittarius to forget <p/> Astrologically speaking, when Taurus and Sagittarius come together they create an element of tension, but this is precisely the reason why Taurus will not forget the spontaneous, resourceful and kind Sagittarius for a long time to come. Although they are not fundamentally compatible, a Taurus is never bored around a Sagittarius. She can relinquish control around him, which is not easy for her. When she tries to get over him, there's a problem, because she finds that she misses his messiness. <p/> Gemini is the hardest to beat in Capricorn <p/> At first glance, Gemini and Capricorn have nothing in common, but when you look a little deeper, you realise that for the distracted and irresponsible Gemini, the persistent and consistent Capricorn is the perfect match, especially if she wants to put certain areas of her life in order. When they break up, the twin perceives it all as a deep hurt, knowing that no other man will motivate her so self-sacrificingly and persistently to be consistent in her struggles and thus more successful and content. <p/> CANCER HURTS FASTEST OF FISH <p/> Cancer is one of the most sentimental zodiac signs, and after it we rank Pisces. Both signs focus on relationships and together they move into deep emotional perceptions that others may not be able to perceive. When a relationship with a Pisces man ends, it can leave a big hole in her life, as she can't connect with any other man as deeply as she can with a Pisces. <p/> LEVINS HAVE THE HARDEST TIME GETTING OVER AQUARIUS <p/> Leo has the hardest time getting over the free-spirited and resourceful Aquarius. He is her cosmic doppelganger who teaches her how to act independently and how to appreciate all values, especially friendship. Aquarius energy has a strong influence on Leo, complementing and encouraging her in everyday things. When she thinks of him, she misses his wit most of all, which must have made her laugh and smile many times. <p/> VIRGO HARDEST TO WAKE UP TWIN <p/> Virgo and Gemini tend to get on well at first because of their mutual love of intellectual pursuits. Because they stimulate each other mentally and can talk for hours about anything, it is the twin who the Virgo misses the most when she ends the relationship with him, or finds it hard to get over. When he is no longer with her, she starts to miss his sarcastic teasing and incredible curiosity. <p/> LIBRA HARDEST TO GET OVER Taurus <p/> Libra is strongly linked to Taurus because of their shared ruling planet Venus. When the relationship ends, Libra misses Taurus, who has always been stable and determined, and she also misses his stubbornness. Libra will find it hard to get over Taurus, especially those beautiful romantic moments together that were like the most beautiful fairy tale. When Libra is completely free, she often misses the bull's control. <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over, both are ruled by Mars, which means they are incredibly passionate. Scorpio will miss Aries, even though there have been various clashes between them all along. Without Aries, she may be bored. Scorpio will find it hard to find the kind of intense dynamic that she has with Aries with other signs. She misses Aries most when she goes to bed at night. <p/> Sagittarius is the hardest to impress for a Leo <p/> Sagittarius and Leo are enthusiastic, spontaneous and have a desire to live life to the full. Both are independent and always understand the other's need for space. When a Sagittarius ends a relationship with a Leo, what she misses most is his ease and incredible understanding of her way of life. Although Sagittarians find themselves quickly in a new relationship, it will take them longer to get over the Leo, if they ever do get over him completely. <p/> CAPRICORN GETS OVER CANCER THE HARDEST <p/> Capricorn is very serious and needs someone to get her riled up. Cancer is the one who constantly gives her a youthful, innocent and gentle energy that definitely brings out the feminine part of Capricorn. Capricorn misses Cancer the most because it has taught her many things, including how to give herself completely in a love relationship. Cancer is hard to get over because without it, she finds it difficult to find the right emotional balance. <p/> Aquarius finds it hardest to get over Scorpio <p/> Aquarius and Scorpio have almost nothing in common, which is why Scorpio is a great mystical enigma for Aquarius, even when the relationship ends. She misses him mainly because he is able to look at things and life in an impersonal and logical way, because he is uncomplicated and honest. Aquarius makes Scorpio feel the most beautiful and the best, and she misses his sexy compliments and passion, which is so important to her in a relationship. <p/> FISH HURTS A GIRL the hardest <p/> Pisces brings emotional depth to a relationship, so a man born in Virgo offers them stability. Pisces, although a hopeless romantic, misses Virgo for her meticulous, consistent and honest actions. When a relationship ends, the Pisces is very sad that she will no longer enjoy a loving relationship with a Virgo man who is sincere and filled with affection. Pisces also misses the working zeal and sense of the material that Virgo has.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

664,"Smoking poses one of the biggest risks to our bodies <p/> 3 June 2019 <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems. <p/> ""Smoking damages the skin and mucous membranes. Smokers age their skin more quickly, their skin sags more quickly, and they lose collagen elasticity. This also causes more people to snore and suffer from other serious health problems,"" said Aleksandra Križaj Dumić, Director of the Križaj Dental and Aesthetic Clinic, which has a tradition of more than 20 years, at a press meeting ahead of World No Smoking Day. <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems - high blood pressure, insufficient oxygen intake, poor blood circulation and brain activity. Airway obstructions can be so severe that people can stop breathing several times a night for a few minutes at a time. For this reason, snoring should be treated seriously and resolved immediately. ""Snoring can also be eliminated with laser therapy. The advantages of this treatment are numerous, but what patients like most is that they have no problems after the laser treatment, they can eat, drink and speak normally, and they can return to work immediately without any problems, as the treatment does not require post-operative recovery,"" outlined Aleksandra Križaj Dumić. Laser surgery is an effective and quick solution if the cause of snoring is a sagging or loose mucous membrane in the soft palate. The NightLase laser therapy includes three visits at the beginning and one annual refresher treatment for non-smokers and two for smokers. Patients breathe easier and snore less at night after the treatment. Laser treatment helps about 80 per cent of carefully selected patients and about 70 per cent of all patients examined. In most patients, snoring time is almost halved. Sleep quality improves as patients take less time to fall asleep and no longer wake up tired. <p/> Before and after laser snoring therapy <p/> A similar procedure is also performed to treat incontinence in gynaecological patients, to increase the tension of the vaginal muscles, to increase the tension of sagging skin on the face and neck, and of the skin in the area of the under-eye area. <p/> Demonstration of laser goat rejuvenation <p/> Smoking therefore also affects the skin.

668,"Strong outburst in the sun ! <p/> The activity of the Sun is of growing importance to humanity as we are increasingly dependent on global connections, the vast majority of which are via satellites. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by a magnetic field. <p/> However, in the event of a major flare, some particles will slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere, which can affect surface infrastructure during so-called geomagnetic storms. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by its magnetic field. However, in stronger eruptions, some particles slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere. What is the risk of this happening ? <p/> (Dr Primož Kajdič -)These outbursts, and if the conditions are right, then some of these particles may indeed enter the Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere, especially near the north and south magnetic poles. Then these particles, because they have very high energy, cause radiation and we then see this as the aurora borealis. The second thing that happens is that the Earth's magnetic field changes dramatically and this is then called a geomagnetic storm. But in general, changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to external solar winds and other phenomena, what we call space weather, are also felt on Earth. They can cause damage to our electrical wiring, our satellites can also burn up, stop working, astronauts' lives could be in danger, and so on. Such phenomena have occurred in the past. Then, with every solar cycle, we move more and more into space, more and more dependent on the technology that is in space. In the future, it will be very important to study these phenomena on the Sun and in the solar wind, because we will be more and more sensitive to them. We will need to find out how we can protect ourselves against them in order to minimise the damage. <p/> One more thing about the Sun itself. <p/> The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. The rest of the mass is mostly found in Jupiter, with only a small fraction shared by all the other celestial bodies in the Solar System. The Sun is a perfectly average G2 star. In size, it is one of the 10% largest stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is made up of around 100 billion stars. The average size of stars in the Milky Way is less than 50% of the size of the Sun. <p/> The present Sun is made up of 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and the rest is all other chemical elements. The Sun is slowly converting hydrogen into helium. This releases various waves which are detected on Earth as heat, light and various radiations. The Sun rotates on its axis. But because it is a big gaseous ball, its parts rotate at different speeds. It makes one revolution every 25.4 days at the equator and one every 36 days at the poles. It has a core in the centre that is 25% of its total diameter. The core rotates uniformly and behaves like a solid body. The surface of the core is under hellish conditions. The core has a surface temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin and a pressure of 250 billion atmospheres. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei produces a huge energy of 386 billion billion kilowatts every second. Thus, every second, 700 million tonnes of hydrogen are transformed into 695 million tonnes of helium. 5 million tonnes per second are gamma rays penetrating through the solar mantle to the photosphere. The photosphere is the surface of the Sun that we can see. As it travels through the sun's mantle, the strength of the radiation is reduced as it returns to the core. Some of the radiation just reaches the edge of the photosphere and flies off the Sun as visible light and thermal radiation. The temperature of the photosphere is 5800 degrees Kelvin. Sometimes we see darker sunspots on the surface, these have a temperature of 3800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots are formed by the influence of the Sun's magnetic field. However, the way they are formed has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Above the photosphere, there is a thin chromosphere. Above this is the extremely thin corona. This extends millions of kilometres into space. It is visible at solar eclipse as a brilliant ring. The temperatures of the gases in it can reach up to a million degrees Kelvin. <p/> The Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and extends far beyond Pluto. At the edge of this field is thought to lie the Oort Cloud of icy celestial bodies, the outermost edge of our Solar System. As well as heat and light, the Sun also emits a faint stream of electrified particles. These are mainly electrons and protons. These are called the solar wind. The Sun radiates them at a steady 450 km/second. Only when there are large outbursts, visible as giant flares or protuberances, does the intensity of the solar wind increase. Sunspots and prominences occur on a fairly regular 11-year cycle. But the solar wind affects the paths of artificial satellites, pushing them further and further off course. It pushes lighter particles out of icy celestial bodies, comets, and forms their tails. In larger outbursts, solar wind particles also hit the Earth's magnetic field. This brings it closer to the surface and the solar wind particles hit particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This creates the coloured aurora borealis, or northern lights. The particles are also dangerous to humans and astronauts must wear protective clothing. In the event of a major outbreak, they must take refuge in specially protected areas of the space station. It would be possible to build a spaceship with a sail that uses the steady pressure of the solar wind for propulsion. <p/> The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, the same age as our Solar System. Since its formation, it has consumed about 50% of the hydrogen. So they predict it will shine as brightly as ever for another 5 billion years. At the end of its lifetime, it will have expanded by half its present size. When it has used up all its hydrogen, it will radically change and swallow all its planets into itself.",Information/Explanation,train

681,"MIHA ŠALEHAR: 'We live in a brainwashed age' <p/> Miha Šalehar is definitely one of those people with whom you can easily get into an hour-long debate over a beer. But as it was a bit early on a Tuesday morning for such a thing, coffee was more than a suitable substance. Especially for a discussion about books, music, mass dehumanisation and more. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Given the nature of your shows and articles, the first question seems more than appropriate: who is Miha Šalehar anyway? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Yes, Miha Šalehar. Really, thank you for asking me the hardest question right from the start (laughs). Let me think. I am definitely not the same person for my home and for my listeners or readers. As far as sentiments are concerned, I think sometimes I get on everybody's nerves, and other times I am amusing to them. Sometimes they don't understand me very well. Let's just say that is my red thread. <p/> ROCKER.SI: With the arrival of autumn, new seasons of all kinds of reality shows will start or have started on TV. Along with them, there will be scandals and things like that, which you often deal with in your articles. I assume you have already accumulated some material over the summer? <p/> Miha Šalehar: If you mean the show Latrina, it's still on hiatus for once, but that may change soon. Personally, I don't watch reality shows very often, make no mistake. But my friends have been sending me all sorts of stuff from the domestic scene, and I've accumulated a lot of material in the meantime (laughs). <p/> But it slowly dawns on me that everything, our lives in general, have become one big reality show. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's stop a little bit with Babewatch, which you and your brother Matevž formed in the late 1990s. How do you look back on those days, almost twenty years later? <p/> Miha Šalehar: It was definitely a wonderful time. Because the best thing is to be a mule, to have a garage with an old beer fridge and to play rock 'n' roll with your own band. But I'm also glad that I left those waters and that those times have become just a pleasant memory of my youth. <p/> Miha Šalehar: No, to be revived, someone has to miss you first. Guns [Guns N' Roses] were missed. They miss Floyd [Pink Floyd] and R.E.M, but not Babewatch, please. Apart from two obscure fans from Primorska, nobody misses us. We were kids, we had a good time, the rest is history. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's touch on your recently published collection of columns called The Spirit of Something. Where did the idea for such a venture come from? <p/> Miha Šalehar: The idea didn't come from me at all, but from the editor Nina Žitko Pucer. To be quite honest, I thought it was a very lame idea at first. Who is going to read this? The columns are a thing that is published for the sake of weekly reading. And I have never read a collection of columns myself. <p/> We were very surprised by the sales results. I think we are now on our third reprint, which is really incredible. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Would you say that Slovenians are good readers? <p/> Miha Šalehar: I would rather say that we Slovenians read the wrong things. It's not the fact that I'm a good writer that has contributed to the sales results, but the fact that I appear on the radio every week. <p/> I wouldn't say that Slovenians are good readers if they read me (laughs). <p/> I'm afraid of the fact that it's easier to sell 3000 copies of books nowadays than 500 copies of studio records. On the other hand, it makes me happy that people are still willing to read one author, even me, in such large numbers. So that I don't just spit on myself and my readers (laughs). <p/> ROCKER.SI: Was there any negative reaction to the book's publication? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Of course, there's never a shortage of that. Although I'm quite lucky around that myself. I think most people understand that I try to be honest and fair in my work, which is why there hasn't been much criticism. It is also true that I am sometimes abusive in that, but that has nothing to do with honesty itself. <p/> However, some criticism was published before the actual publication of the book. These seem to me to be the most relevant. If you are a public figure, which by the definition of my profession I am, criticism is to be expected. It's perfectly normal to swallow a good truckload (or more) of shit on your own account over the years. Especially because of the seemingly democratic society we live in, where any c*ck* can write whatever they want under a pseudonym. The content of online comments has become juicier than signed copyright stuff. It is the sort of thing that I would take the greatest pleasure in shutting down. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Something along the lines of Oscar Wilde, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the ""truth""? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Sort of, but I'm afraid that people in masks are not acting in the service of actual truth. If you want to see who is creating our reality, read the online comments. It's really, really scary stuff. <p/>What has caused us to become such hateful primitives, I have no idea. But I console myself that it is very likely just a handful of individuals who are roleplaying the topics mentioned. How is it possible that we are falling for them? <p/>I find it hard to imagine that 90% of people are idiots. Of course they are not, at least I hope not. It is a very small minority, less than 1%. How do they manage to have so much influence? <p/> ROCKER.SI: Does that sound like an idea for a book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Not at all. This book concludes my oeuvre where I have explored the existence of a non-existent middle class. Starting with education and religion, where we are told who we are and what our world should be like. <p/> The book is not a stand-alone publication, but goes hand in hand with my work on the radio. <p/> The opus is coming to an end, because I am beginning to be interested in other things. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Where can our readers buy your book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: In all Mladinska knjiga bookshops. The network is very wide. They can meet me in person at the upcoming Slovenian Book Fair, where I will be present on Wednesday. I will be happy to chat with you and sign some books for you. <p/> Miha Šalehar: I always have a problem with that, because I don't want to appear patronising (laughs). <p/> Don't be fooled by everything you hear or read, it's one big scam. Be totally sceptical. It seems to me that we live in a dictatorship of media fear and marketing solutions that are offered to us by the advertising apparatus five minutes after the media have published the next series of horrors. <p/> We live in a brainwashed age, because we are all brainwashed.

The first distribution of vegetable and cereal baskets will start on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at 17:00 in the courtyard of the Biotikva farm in Limbuš near Maribor (Lackova cesta 267, 2341 Limbuš). At the end of May, the participating farmers will further expand their offer of vegetable baskets and will also offer fruit baskets to consumers. <p/> The ECHo association, which initiated and organises this project in Styria and Prekmurje, is pleased with the current response. 7 organic farms have joined the partnership and will provide consumers with weekly vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets, as well as other products from organic production and processing: spreads, juices, jams, bread, eggs, meat and dairy products. 34 consumers have chosen to buy organic food in the context of partner farming. This is the first attempt of this kind of sales between organic farmers and consumers without intermediaries in this part of Slovenia. With this project, the association wants to promote the development of organic farming among farmers and to support organic farmers. <p/> What is partnership farming? <p/> Partnership farming is a new way of linking farmers and consumers in Slovenia. Different models (CSA - Community Supported Agriculture) have proliferated around the world, but they have a common denominator: they promote local, sustainable and ethical consumerism, with a special emphasis on solidarity among small farmers who farm without synthetic fertilisers and sprays. Typically, it is one farmer or a group of farmers who sell their produce to 20 to 30 customers. Before the sowing season, the farmer talks to the consumers about their wishes, clear rules are agreed, then the farmer sows the area and supplies the crops according to organic production technology and regulations. The produce grown on the agreed area is distributed weekly to the consumers. <p/> Once consumers have opted in, they meet the farmer and other consumers each week at an agreed date, time and location to collect their basket. They can also exchange produce and products with each other. In this way, the farmer supplies his consumers every week throughout the year with organic food that is truly fresh and has a very short transport route from the field to the plate. This way, the consumer knows exactly who grows their food, where and how. Consumers receive high quality organic food and the farmer is able to live with dignity as a result of this cooperation.",News,train

694,"Black tea and preparation: <p/> Black tea is the ""mainstream"" tea in terms of world consumption, although it is still a newcomer in the history of time, so to speak. <p/> Picked Camellia sinensis tea leaves are left to wither for a while. This is followed by a rolling process, either by machine or by hand, which extracts the juice with enzymes. The following fermentation phase is the most delicate part of the black tea production process. It is carried out at a temperature of 27 degrees, with the addition of moisture, and the essential oils are extracted. During this process, the leaves are coloured black, and finally the tea leaves are dried with hot air and separated by size through sieves. <p/> In general, black tea has a stronger flavour and contains more caffeine than less oxidised tea (green, oolong or white). Unlike other teas, it retains its flavour for several years and, despite oxidation during processing, acts as an antioxidant. <p/> Flavouring tea became popular in the 19th century.The most famous flavoured black tea is undoubtedly Earl Grey with bergamot oil, but other flavourings are also used (vanilla, coconut, almond, mint, etc.).",Information/Explanation,train

705,"Publishing <p/> DI Kranjska Gora: Visiting elderly and sick members <p/> Chatting. <p/> In addition to these two names, the month of December, or December, has a championship in popular naming. To name but a few: Happy December, the craziest month, the month with the most lonely people, the month with the most holidays, the month with the millions of cards said, the month with the most goodies on the plates, the month with the craziest spending, the month of taking out loans for a few hours of crazy eating, the month of merchants, the month of children's joys, the month of mass temporary resettlement, the month of crazy behaviour, and I could go on and on. <p/> The purpose of my writing, however, is to shed some light on the designation, 'the month with the loneliest'. Why shine a light on something that is always more hidden than revealed? All our disabled people's associations are experiencing more and more members from the third age group. I am not saying that there is no loneliness in the younger groups of people, but it is clear that it is in the group of people in the third stage of life that there is the greatest loneliness. This is the generation that has already finished its working and creative task in life, has gone into the solitude of its retirement. <p/> The fallacy that everyone can hardly wait to retire is only true until you are about to leave your job for good and realise it. You have to leave the comrades who have kept you company for days and years, for better or for worse. The daily commute to work turns into looking out of the window and thinking how my comrades at work are doing. I count myself among the group that it took me two years to accept that I was no longer needed, that I was a tool that had outlived its usefulness. Even though I still had many social tasks and a lot of movement between people, it did not fill me up, so that I did not feel lonely and marginalised. Although I moved among the crowds, I always felt alone. I am not saying that this pattern applies to all of us who have retired, but I know that some of us felt marginalised, exploited in the workplace, and I know that they found it difficult to wait for the arrival of the last day at work. <p/> But this retirement has pushed the vast majority of people into isolation, at least temporarily, until they have found a job in some other area of society, and what if they have not? Usually these are the years when grandchildren come into the world, who somehow fill in society from work, but only temporarily. <p/> Filling time, which is too much at one time, can also lead to an incredible new burden of overwork and lack of time for oneself. This feeling leads to a new isolation, which makes one think that everyone has forgotten one's self and that one is just a tool of one's family or surroundings for as long as one is needed, and then one should get out from under one's feet for once. When, for many, there is the worm that sees that we are only waiting for our miserable end, loneliness reaches a peak that usually leads to a state of illness of mind and body, which is devastating for the individual. <p/> I myself am fortunate in that I am somehow still active in several areas, but it is also true that I always give myself just the right amount of time to myself so that I do not feel marginalised and lonely. But many times the thought creeps into my mind, yes, one day you will have to admit enough is enough, yes it is true, but I am pushing that thought into the future, when it will be, so why bother with it today. <p/> I am also fortunate to run a disabled people's association which employs me. Sometimes the work goes beyond what is reasonable, but that is only sometimes and when the state bureaucracy overreaches itself with tasks that benefit no one and we, through the associations, have to fulfil them. Running a society gives me the opportunity to chat with the membership more and more, which is like the salt of life. Chatting is usually a part or a courtesy of life when meeting people. If the main aim of chatting is to have a positive effect on the relationship and well-being of two or more people together, then I can say that chatting has an impact on the quality of the relationships between the membership. Chatting is typically a game of words. The basic rule of chatting is to strengthen mutual relations with elements of joking, fun, courtesy and to spend time together to avoid excruciating silence and to exchange different opinions on certain problems or events. Chatting has the aim of being friendly to other people and to the surroundings trapped in the same space. <p/> While chatting with the membership, I discover the phenomenon of loneliness of each member. Loneliness can be equated with talent, both components need to be discovered, neither is visible on its own. During December, this phenomenon is even more pronounced and killing. December is a month of anticipation, a month of planning a new path, a month of reckoning with the past tense, but also with the thought, everyone is going to have fun and rejoice, and it will be just me or myself for the holidays and the rejoicing. <p/> This thought leads many into a negative black mentality and even leads the slightly more unstable personalities into the thought of ending a sad life. In the Association we are aware of this situation of some of our members and we are working to raise awareness among the membership that loneliness and exclusion are most often caused by personal reflections and certainly not by social exclusion. <p/> In this month, which has only just begun, the Association of People with Disabilities of the municipality of Kranjska Gora has for years had a campaign to visit individual members who have been passive and more or less inactive over the year. The reason for the visit is usually justified by a small token of appreciation with a few sweets and a souvenir suitable for the December time. All this is cause for a short chat and a chat. <p/> Believe me, such a visit and a gift is the key that not only opens the front door of the home, it is also the key to the heart of the person being visited. A chat usually gives many answers which we had only suspected before. Whatever time our volunteers spend on such a visit, it always turns out in the end to have been too short and too measured. Usually, such a visit turns into indescribable happiness and joy, with the visitor realising that ""I am not forgotten by everyone yet"". I also take part in such visits as much as time permits and it fills me with a certain missing energy that I miss before such a visit, even though I am not even aware that I am missing it. <p/> The people who are visited are also aware of a certain helplessness and loneliness, but they do not know how to help themselves and get out of this cycle of loneliness. This is where our task as the leadership of the association comes in, to find the lonely members and help them to pierce the veil that keeps them in a certain vacuum of loneliness. This is what the mandatory seventh social programme, Preventing and alleviating the social and psychological consequences of disability, requires us to do. <p/> I dare say that we are an association with a good diversification of social work, but all the same we are left with a passive membership that cannot be animated into active membership. How to reach such a member and how to stimulate them is a Gordian knot whose shell we have not even raised, let alone broken. I am also aware that it will never be possible to raise everyone to the level of a working member. I am convinced, however, that we need to do more on this problem of inactivity and the results will come. Let me end my reflections with a greeting that is appropriate in these times, and I wish everyone good luck.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

Or you can type in a place like Ljubljana and get Ljubljana treasures, etc... If you want to do more, like see what's going on with individual treasures or even enter your own adventures related to the treasure you're looking for, you have to register for free. If you do this, you will get the geographical coordinates of where the treasure is located and a hint of where exactly it should be. You can stand on it, but if the owner of the treasure doesn't give you a hint that it's buried under your feet, you'll be looking for it in vain. You can, however, pay approx. 20?per year, which gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates in the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. If you find the treasure, you enter the date of its discovery in the treasure's notebook. You can take some things out and put in some of your new things, or at least as much as there was before. Each treasure contains a plastic waterproof box, a label with the location and address, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a notebook or notepad. You can also put anything in the box that is not food, not an animal or non-perishable. Crates can be ""micro"" e.g. a 2 or 3 cm plastic box, medium or very large. The crate can also contain a ""tracer"" or a plastic coin. You need to buy both official ones because the tracking numbers are stamped on the tracker and the coins are destructible and only made by certified producers. The tracker is inscribed separately and its job is to travel from treasure to treasure. You must not take it home for permanent safekeeping, but must put it in another treasure or leave it where it is. If you have moved it, you must be sure to write on the portal in which treasure you have placed it. Some people call this a ""stopwatch"". Vendors also offer official boxes, notebooks, pencils, stickers, etc. You don't need these if you don't want them. You can provide all this yourself. You can get free stickers here: http://www.techblazer.com/geocaching-log-sheets/ for micro for others: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=w ... mApU8vtHzw Make sure the sticker is dry! That's all.

738,"VARSTOR, JERNEJ ŠTORGELJ, s.p.from Rečice ob Savinji specialises in robotic welding. They also perform welding by other processes such as MIG welding and TIG welding. <p/> WELDING <p/> Welding is the process of joining two materials to form a single unit by means of heat or mechanical kneading. <p/> In welding, the heat source is an electric arc generated by the welding machine. The joining of materials is based on the temperature generated by the electric arc. This welding process is called arc welding. <p/> WELDING PROCEDURES <p/> MIG/MAG welding <p/> MIG/MAG welding involves the generation of an electric arc by means of a welding source. The arc is formed between the welding wire and the weldment. The arc joins the weldment and the filler material to form a weld joint or weld. <p/> During the actual welding process, the feeding device feeds the wire continuously through the torch to the welding site. Shielding gas is also added via the torch. <p/> MIG welding differs from MAG welding in the use of shielding gas. MIG welding uses an inert gas which does not react chemically with the welding consumable. MAG welding, on the other hand, uses an active gas which reacts chemically with the weld metal. <p/> Typically, the shielding gas contains active carbon dioxide or oxygen, which is why MAG welding is more common than MIG welding. <p/> TIG welding <p/> In TIG welding (Tugsten Inert Gas), an electric arc is created between the non-fusible tungsten electrode and the weld metal. An inert gas is used as a shielding gas which does not react with the weld. The most commonly used shielding gas in TIG welding is argon. <p/> In TIG welding, the addition of material is not always necessary. The joint between two weldments can also be made by welding their edges. If material is added, it must be added manually. For this reason, TIG welding sources are built differently from MIG/MAG sources. <p/> The different TIG methods include DC, AC and pulsed TIG welding. <p/> MANUAL WELDING <p/> Welding processes <p/> Welding processes are divided into several phases according to the degree of automation, namely. <p/> Semi-automatic welding - a specific working step is carried out automatically. One such welding method is MIG/MAG welding, where the welding wire is fed through the torch by a feeding device. <p/> In mechanised welding, some manipulative work is also done by machine, with the welder controlling the welding process. <p/> In automatic welding, the welding hardware performs the entire process independently of the preset programme. <p/> Robotic welding represents a very advanced welding mechanisation and automation. In robotic welding, a control system controls the movement of the torch and the manipulation of the welder. The robot can be programmed for different welding applications, so we are talking about the highest possible level of automation of the welding process. <p/> Robotic welding is most commonly used for products where the surfaces to be joined are curved and where several small welds in different directions are required. The reason for the purchase is not necessarily for mass production of products. Modern technologies allow for the increasing production of smaller batches of products. Individual parts have also been successfully produced in robotic workshops.",Information/Explanation,train

Later, we can print it on pos via Invoice Viewer, but it is already copy 1. <p/> This would come into play when we give someone an offer and later they pay in cash and we give them a pos printout.

Cash payment is already possible if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card), just a pos printout would be welcome. <p/> As already stated ""if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card)"", the invoice is entered as cash and is confirmed by FURS. For A4 printout, the invoice prints ok.

752,"27.09.2006 I find the title question interesting. Sometimes it seems to me that most people do not even ask it, because we live in a more or less school-taught and almost taken-for-granted belief that we judge things, people, their actions and events on the basis of the facts and by using our own common sense. And, accordingly, many people would probably answer the question posed by the title by saying that it is the authority of the argument that applies to them, not the other way round. But is this true? And how about in law? Are we persuaded by arguments or by the authority of the person who presents them? <p/> With the New Age and the tradition of the Enlightenment, the belief in human reason (ratio) became firmly established in Western society. This was particularly due to the development of the natural sciences, which, with their (apparent) exactitude, in many respects inspired legal thinkers. In particular, the proponents of the rationalist view of natural law, according to which the fundamental principles of law are somehow axiomatically rooted in ordinary human reason, believed that from the (highest) principles of law (e.g. neminem laedere or pacta sunt servanda) the correct solution to any legal problem or question could be found by deductive reasoning. This almost ""mathematical"" conception of law also led to the belief that legal reasoning is done by demonstration, i.e. by illustrative and formal logical demonstration or proof. However, after the more modern natural sciences have disproved the belief that science can be purely exact, and after the relativistic world-view (which is also known from many earlier historical periods, e.g. from the time of ancient Greek sophism) has regained a large measure of its right of homeland in the social sciences and law, faith or trust in the method of legal demonstration has in many respects also been dispelled. In its place, especially in the second half of the last century, the idea of legal argumentation came to dominate the field of legal logic. Although the term 'demonstration' is still used in many places in law and more widely today, it is in fact increasingly used to mean persuasion. Since, as I have written in various places, everything is relative in space and time, so is (i.e. relative) all (legal) evidence. A fact is prima facie evidence of guilt for one person, but not for another. If nothing else, a fact can be shown in a completely different light than it was previously shown in a narrower context, simply by expanding the (temporal, spatial, mental, emotional, etc.) context in which it is observed. <p/> All this is particularly familiar to lawyers. What is pure and indisputable truth to one litigant is pure and indisputable falsehood to the other litigant, the facts being the same but the human interpretations of those facts (and indeed of the legal norms) being different. Of course, sometimes a so-called material fact can be completely indisputable in itself (e.g. the identification of an object, DNA or blood traces) and as such really proves something. But one can expand the context and say that in the process of identifying such a fact (e.g. identification of the murder weapon, the perpetrator or DNA) there was a mistake, or even conscious manipulation, lying, etc. Therefore, any evidence is only valid as such to the extent that it is convincing to those who judge it. Convincingness, however, is to a large extent related to our subjective perception and evaluation of the world around us. In law and in life in general, we are therefore constantly persuading ourselves. If we come across someone with similar values, education, etc. to our own, we will quickly click with them and the need for persuasion will diminish. In the opposite case, i.e. when we encounter a person with a completely different way of thinking and value worldview, even with the most obvious facts and evidence (in our opinion, of course), we will not be able to convince (much less ""prove"") that we are right about something. If you don't believe me, just start talking to people about politics. Put forward a few of your own claims that you think are based on demonstrable facts, preferably relating to denationalisation, redress, assessment of the current or previous government, etc. I think you will quickly come across someone whom you will not be able to convince of your ""facts"" or ""evidence"". <p/> Anyone who has managed to follow my train of thought up to this point (which of course is not necessarily the case) can now easily see that (as Kant might have said) facts are not only something we perceive, but above all something we (co-)create. It is therefore important to be as convincing as possible in relation to others and to ourselves in defining or evaluating facts, that is to say, to be able to argue our views and positions as well as we can. But now let us ask ourselves what I said in the title of this paper. Is it the authority of the argument or the argument from authority that is decisive for us? Are we more persuaded by a good, skilful, illustrative, comprehensible, etc. argument, or are we more persuaded by the authority of the personality of the person who is making the argument? <p/> The answer to the above question is, of course, by no means unambiguous, because the two are intertwined. But nevertheless, if we look a little deeper into the matter, we can quickly see that in life in general we trust the argument from authority to a markedly overwhelming degree. Just think about how many things in life we know enough about to be able to make reliable judgements about statements of fact that are explained to us by someone who knows better. Can we judge for ourselves the arguments put to us by a doctor, perhaps even a surgeon, a physicist, an architect, a builder, an electrician, this or that legal specialist, a historian, etc.? Is it not the case that we simply believe most of these people, trust them? And if we don't, then we find someone who does. And if someone we trusted disappoints us, we look again for someone else we can trust - a new dentist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, lawyer, politician, etc. <p/> All this makes us realise the crucial importance of trusting people, not arguments. Since this is also extremely important for law, I will devote a future column to reflecting on the importance of trust in law, drawing on some of the thoughts presented here. For the moment, let me just say that anyone who thinks that they are guided to a greater extent by the authority of argument in judging things and people and their actions and behaviour is probably mistaken, because in reality we humans are predominantly following the authority of personality. In law, as in ethics, politics, religion and even science, we are in fact usually more persuaded by who than by what (although the two are in fact interdependent). If, for example, we are watching a controversial panel discussion on a topic on which we are more or less unfamiliar (or at least not sufficiently familiar with the relevant facts), then the persuasiveness of the persons presenting the arguments will play a decisive role in our decision as to which arguments are more persuasive. This persuasiveness is a certain emanation, a personal magnetism that people perceive according to their own (subjective) mental, energetic, emotional and other qualities. Of course, we should not overlook that this is a matter of sympathy, which means that we can only ever be represented in authority by someone who is close to us in what they do or represent, i.e. sympathetic in the true sense of the word.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
753,"Description: Intensive industrial agriculture, as the second largest polluter of the environment, is increasingly subject to public pressure for sustainable agricultural production. There are no indicators to assess the sustainability of the production system (PS) as a whole. The aim of this thesis was to design and evaluate a tool for sustainability assessment of arable (wheat, spelt and oil pumpkin) and vegetable (cabbage and beetroot) production in four CS (conventional - CON, integrated - INT, organic - ECO and biodynamic - BD), using data from a field experiment at FKBV in the 2008 season. The Sustainable Process Index ® (SPI) for agriculture calculates the environmental footprint in m2 of all direct and indirect inputs used during production. The analysis shows that the differences between the PS are large, and the partial results of the environmental footprint indicate where improvements are needed during the production process. The environmental footprint was highest in the KON (total 3,005,108.9 m2) and lowest in the control (642,906.2 m2), the reference PS, for all the crops observed. Wheat had the largest environmental footprint in the KON (792,646.8 m2) and oil pumpkin the smallest in the control (113,334.7 m2) PS. The calculated environmental performance index (environmental footprint per unit of yield - kg) confirmed the SPI trend in most cases. The SPI is a good and accessible tool to show the sustainability and shortcomings of the PAs for growers, the public and policy actors.

Measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus will make shopping in large centres a little different from what shoppers were used to before the crisis. Among other things, the NIJZ advises separate entrances and exits and floor signage. <p/> In addition to the standard and general recommendations that apply across the board, such as frequent hand washing and disinfection, cough hygiene, appropriate distances and the like, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) has made additional detailed recommendations ahead of Monday's resumption of activity in shopping centres. These apply not only to shops but also to the many other service providers and activities (repairs, repair services, book and paper shops, watchmakers, jewellers, key-making, etc.) located in these centres. The NIJH recommends that the maximum number of customers in a room should be adapted to the size of the room, taking into account a sufficient personal distance of at least 1.5 metres. In the common corridors of the shopping centre, it is necessary to prevent large numbers of people from loitering, and it is therefore advisable to use floor markings and guide posts with tapes to indicate the direction of movement, so that people do not move in the opposite direction at the same time. Care will also need to be taken to ensure that the stalls and other services available in the common corridors are properly positioned. Where possible, shopping centres should also provide for entry and exit through separate entrances and exits. The implementation of these measures should be supervised by security guards or authorised employees of the shopping centres. Retailers should also ensure that employees and customers are able to wash and disinfect their hands in the business premises, including by means of appropriate disinfectant dispensers. In addition to posters and infographics, warnings should also be given in shopping centres through regular audio messages or digital displays. Common seating and rest areas such as benches, massage chairs and seating in corridors will not be used, nor will common children's play areas. The NIJH also reminded people to ensure effective ventilation, especially with windows wide open, and to avoid air circulation with mechanical ventilation. Shoppers will also need to follow the recommendations before entering and staying in shopping centres: only healthy individuals without signs of respiratory infection should enter, while the elderly and patients with chronic non-communicable diseases at higher risk are advised to take extra protection or consider visiting the shopping centre as a matter of urgency. Hand disinfection before entering and repeatedly while in the building will be mandatory, especially when shopping in different stores, using escalators or lifts (stairs are preferable).

797,"Backstories <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> Personally, I am very fond of consecutive interpreting ""on the ground"". This is done on various missions, as we call them in the jargon, or visits by inspectors for various areas, such as agriculture, veterinary, EU funds and so on. Such interpretation is quite different from working in interpreting booths, for example, where seemingly trivial paragraphs of European legislation are discussed all day long. On the ground, it is primarily the implementation of this legislation that is being determined. Only then do we have the opportunity to see that the provisions of this legislation must also be observed and implemented by concrete people, and what difficulties this can cause. Such interpretation requires not only special preparation in terms of content, but also special equipment. For example, in agricultural inspections, gojzars or rubber boots, jeans and anorak are part of the compulsory equipment, as we also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. We also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. <p/> Best interpreting experience? <p/> The best experiences are those in which you become part of a team, especially when you interpret for several days or a whole week in a row in the same team. The dynamics of this kind of collaboration are interesting: from the initial ""guessing"" of who is who, to not even saying goodbye to your team at the end. At the beginning, there is often a slight sense of mistrust, like how are you going to be able to understand and even translate our professional content? Over time, participants ""relax"" as they realise that we interpreters not only understand what they are talking about, but are also able to translate complex professional content competently into another language. <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> We sometimes work with ""beneficiaries"" of agricultural payments to determine whether the ""competent authorities"" are assessing the land properly, including through the method of re-survey. This looks like a field being measured by a representative of our competent authority, followed by an EU inspector, followed by an interpreter with the obligatory notepad and pencil in hand. Then it starts to rain, and the real art is to stand in the soggy field, holding an umbrella and a notepad, writing down what you hear and then interpreting appropriately and loudly enough. Quite a field ""multi-tasking"", no less. <p/> Most unpleasant interpreting experience? <p/> On one occasion interpreting in court, back in the days when I still wore tight skirts and heels, I discreetly sneak out of the courtroom on minus two decibels and when I return, just as discreetly, I spot a jogger on the smooth parquet floor and... swish, I fold myself as long and wide as I am, the courtroom is flooded with a choral ahhhhh, and I'm already standing and disappearing into the cramped editing booth. Oops. It's embarrassing when a speaker is evasive in his speech or answer, using a thousand masks to hide the fact that he has nothing to say ... and then you have to paint over that ""big nothing"". <p/> Why did you choose to become an interpreter? Has it lived up to your expectations? <p/> The choice of profession came about as a result of a pragmatic decision to put into practice one of the talents that I had been given. I had no expectations when I chose the profession, but it has exceeded my expectations of where it could take me and what it could enable me to do. The decision was made after I read an article about the profession, which inspired me, and I immediately started researching where it was possible to study. The profession met my expectations and I have never regretted my choice. <p/> What should an interpreter be like and what should an interpreter never do in the booth? <p/> Above all, an interpreter should be professional. He or she should be aware of his or her role, prepare for the job, be discreet, impartial, polite, and take for granted the confidentiality of the information obtained. He should be collegial in the cubicle, undisturbing to colleagues. Whatever the situation, whatever the complexity of the work and whatever the content of the interpretation, he should remain calm and collected - which, to be honest, is sometimes easier said than done ... <p/> What about interpreters' quips? <p/> Protesters like to turn into protesters in the interpreter's haste. Handel mit weißer Ware quickly becomes a white-goods trade. When interpreting from English, we like to become avid fans of sexual transformation: we announce Mrs X, and a statuesque gentleman in a polka-dot suit stands up and speaks in a shamelessly beautiful baritone, or we announce Mr Y, and it's no surprise that a plump young woman with a plunging neckline squeals... yes, we interpreters are very innovative. <p/> Speakers' quips when (not) using interpreters or why are interpreters important? <p/> During her presidency, one high-ranking official insisted on speaking English herself at high-profile protocol events, despite not having the best command of the English language and the obvious presence of interpreters. She constantly referred to the European Union as the ""European Onion"". Needless to say, 'European Onion' appears in almost every other sentence during the Presidency. <p/> What do you consider to be the advantages and/or disadvantages of the interpreting profession? <p/> I see the advantages of interpreting mainly in the possibility of continuous learning, the changing working environment both in terms of space and people, which keeps one fresh, but at the same time gives one a good old philosophical thought, which, of course, did not grow on my own lawn, but which I like to use: I know that I know nothing: I know that I do not know anything. I can deduce the weaknesses from the last thought, because you can never know for sure that you have mastered the subject. Another weakness could be found in the variability of the environment, which can contribute to a lack of intensity in personal relationships. <p/> Disclaimer: The photographs illustrate different interpretive situations and are not related to the content of the specific texts.

801,"Last Tuesday, 23 April 2013, Slovenian brands Marta Vodeb, Terra Urbana, Nelizabeta and Urša Zrnec and Pentlja by Goga presented their jewellery collections at the Emporium Gallery. <p/> On a beautiful spring evening, the Gallery prepared a magical event, which was opened on the ground floor by Marta Vodeb. Mannequins walked down the Gallery's imposing staircase to the sound of Slovenian evergreen melodies, dressed in the Girl from the Golden Boat collection in silk, lace and wool and adorned with short sleeves, bows and pearls. The collection is romantic, delicate and nostalgic and worthy of praise. <p/> Upstairs, Terra Urbana brings nature to life. Inspired by the world of butterflies, the Dragonfly Married Butterfly SS2013 collection is a blend of tenderness with strength, tradition with trend and fabrics that are friendly to people and nature. <p/> Upstairs, the evergreens were replaced by thumping electronic music, while the escalators served as the prefect backdrop for both the summer and part of the winter 2013/14 collection by Nelizabeta. The summer collection was inspired by the 1920s, art deco and sports fashion, while the winter collection was inspired by the national costumes of the former Yugoslavia and military uniforms. Not only the clothes, but also the shoes and bags are the work of designer Neli Štrukelj. All the products are made in the Nelizabeta team's home workshop in Sežana, where they combine the experience of the old masters with modern technology and innovation. The summer and autumn/winter collections are most impressive for the coats. <p/> On the ground floor, we also saw Urša Zrnec's glass jewellery and Pentlja by Goga in vibrant neon colours that scream summer. <p/> Petra Draškovič from Galeria Emporium told Fashionista.si that Slovenian designers are becoming more and more visible and marketable in the Gallery. Especially successful are the jewellery collections, which are also sought after by tourists and other visitors from abroad. However, she stressed that a lot also depends on the designer himself and his will to do something for the brand's recognition and promotion. ""At the Gallery we are proud to host Slovenian designers. Our doors are open to everyone, anyone can come to us, show us their collections and we assess whether they are of high enough quality and commercial enough for us to participate. We are very excited about the development of Slovenian fashion."" <p/> The second day of the fashion week was filled with presentations of their collections by Urša Drofenik, Simona Lampe, Maja Štamol, Vladimira Kralj and Miro Misljen in the first part and Matevž Faganel, Sanja Grcić, Nicola De Main, Aleksandra Brlan and Maja Ferme in the evening part. <p/> In the afternoon show, Simona Lampe and Maja Štamol pleasantly surprised with their wearable and sale collections. The evening show was opened by Faganel, who this time went a little out of his comfort zone and surprised with dresses and knitwear combined with leather. He collaborated with Anna Lazovski and Eber Furriers to design the collection. <p/> Sanja Grcić's clean tailoring is also worthy of praise, with her coats in particular catching the eye of the fashion cognoscenti. Sanja, like Urša Jerkič, wore the now famous Nataša Peršuh shirt that the designer sent to the runway at last year's Fashion Week. <p/> Maja Ferme chose to make a subtle critique of society at this year's show, backed up by rock n' roll music, punchy slogans and heavy embellishments on the evening dresses as well as on the jackets and coats. It is rumoured that she sewed every sequin, every pebble, every detail onto her own clothes.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

830,"Ordinary Woman (Written by Danaja Lorenčič) <p/> In the eyes of ten year old, twenty year old and even thirty year old Danaja, I was burned at the stake in my quest to become something special. <p/> Danaja Lorenčič <p/> A few weeks ago, I was invited for coffee by a friend I rarely see. But while talking to her, I immediately got that familiar feeling that reminds me again and again why I love some people so much. Because they don't hide behind a mask of perfection, they don't feel ashamed of their vulnerability, they don't get defensive when they are in need, and they don't resort to cynicism when you touch their wounds during a conversation. <p/> Before we had each had our cup of coffee, she told me that she had been searching for her own identity lately, as she had lost herself in the last few years due to her many roles. She was starting to wonder who she was if she wasn't a mother and a wife who went to work and in her spare time was a musician. It touched me when she confessed that one of her greatest fears was to become an ordinary woman, so she kept up her hobbies, even when she no longer enjoyed them, because she was afraid that without them she would slip into a boring routine and turn into an uninteresting person. How I recognised myself in her words! I don't have any hobbies, because I have turned what I enjoy most into my work (i.e. writing), but I identified with her fear of the ordinary. Suddenly, hundreds of scenes swirled in my head, reminding me of all I had done to escape the image of the ordinary woman I feared almost as much as my own death. <p/> To avoid becoming ordinary, I kept my weight low and for a short time even believed that anorexia made me special. To avoid becoming ordinary, I rejected the idea of a serious relationship for years because I thought that being single was something that only independent, strong women could do. To avoid becoming ordinary, I dreamt for a very, very long time of a singing career that would save me from an ordinary life, paying bills and annoying bosses. To avoid becoming ordinary, I hung out with damaged people who, like me, refused to grow up for a long time. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up my first and only regular job. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up any thought of motherhood by the age of thirty-five. <p/> Of all the things I did to escape from ordinariness, there is only one thing I do not regret - that I gave up a job that did not make me the least bit happy. Which is not to say that I was entirely happy about it afterwards, as I swallowed the bitter experience of precarious work. But I took responsibility for that decision and faced it. Because by giving up a secure job, I was not running away from discomfort, I was throwing myself out of my comfort zone and starting to develop my potential within my discomfort zone. <p/> This made me feel special, and I tried to escape the fate of the ordinary woman in other areas of my life. I decided that I wanted to write for a living and convinced myself that this was only possible if I didn't have a partner to start a family with, as this would certainly hinder me from achieving my goals. I was operating under the mindset: If I want to be special, I have to give up what is typical of most people. <p/> In reality, I was scared of love after the love wrecks that had caused me emotional wounds. I was scared to let go of control of my weight because I thought I would lose control of my life. I was afraid to end destructive relationships with people who hated themselves because I was afraid they would hate me too. And I was terrified of becoming a mother - especially if I gave birth to a baby girl, because I knew that I would be a bad role model for her because of my unprocessed pain, my denial of pleasure, my tendency to abuse myself and to repress my emotions. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which is something of a ritual for me this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. <p/> For me, being special meant creating a life that did not involve complicated emotions, arguments, sharing household responsibilities with a partner and parenthood. <p/> Hearing my friend say that she was afraid of being ordinary made me think about how I had misinterpreted specialness and at the same time had an unjustified fear of being ordinary. Because back then, when I was striving for specialness, I was nowhere near as content and at peace as I am now. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which for me is a kind of obligatory ritual this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. I am no longer obsessed with controlling my weight. I have not become a famous singer or a successful writer. I have not stayed single so that I can create uninterrupted. I do not have many friends, because I have distanced myself from those who used to burden me with their darkness. And I did not give up motherhood so that I did not have to change anything about myself that I was not proud of. <p/> In the eyes of ten-year-old, twenty-year-old and even thirty-year-old Danaja, I was burnt out in my efforts to become something special. But in the eyes of Danaja, who is slowly approaching forty, I see peace. <p/> And that is what I have longed for for years. For an inner peace that I have wrongly called an ordinary life.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
831,"Events -> 2013 -> Parish Pilgrimage to Sladka Gora <p/> This year's pilgrimage route took us to Sladka Gora. <p/> A pilgrimage is a journey to the Lord, a walk on the stairs, increasing with each step the longing to touch the Heart and to rest in the Embrace. The soul is freed from the countless layers that bind and suffocate it, which is why the preparation for the Sacrament of Reconciliation is always so good for it. Ready to meet the Lord, we celebrated Holy Mass in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Mother of God in Sladka Gora, Styria, with a men's choir made up of pilgrims singing. <p/> We were not only moved by the beautiful interior of the church, but also by the address of Pastor Andrew, who invited us to open our hearts to the point where we could ""be here"" with our whole being, soul and body, experiencing and fully accepting all that was placed before us; to forge bonds and friendships with people and with God. After the Holy Mass, the local parish priest gave us a historical outline of the Shrine and the life connected with it. <p/> The garden in front of the church was quite lively as the Oratory was taking place. <p/> We gathered again on the bus that took us to Šmarje pri Jelšah, where a good lunch was waiting for us. <p/> After lunch we went up to Calvary. The Way of Suffering, which leads to the pilgrimage church of St. Roko, is considered to be the most extensive Passion complex in Slovenia. It was built between 1743 and 1753. It leads the pilgrim between the chapels, so that he can always see only his next destination. Looking down into the valley, one sees the town and the unique image of the varied wine-growing landscape, from the border mountains of Styria and Carinthia to Pohorje, Boč and Donat, Macel and Zagorje in Croatia, to Bohorje, Hume and the Savinja Valley. <p/> Entering the Church of St. Roko, we had a new surprise. The massive exterior of the church, built in 1646, is in stark contrast to its richly decorated interior, where shell and net shapes, angel heads and flower branches intertwine. The pilgrimage tradition is still alive at St. Roch. On 15 August, the feast of the patron saint of the parish, Our Lady of the Assumption, and on 16 August, the feast of St. Rocco, several thousand people gather here. St. Rok is part of the pilgrimage triad, Sladka Gora - Tin Tin - St. Rok. The church is very acoustic, which is why concerts are held there. <p/> The first raindrops fell, and the bus took us to the most beautifully landscaped village in Europe, Olimje. <p/> Here we visited the Minorite monastery and learned about its history. <p/> In the Old Pharmacy we admired the frescoes by Anton Lerchinger, which speak of the path to health and happiness. We wandered into a shop with herbal preparations, teas, tinctures and ointments that help maintain health. We were overwhelmed by the image of the Pilgrimage House of St. Joseph and the park for rest and relaxation. We walked through the garden of medicinal plants where ""for every disease there is a flower"". The walking path leads between beds with around 200 specimens of medicinal plants named with Slovenian and Latin names, which grow in our gardens, meadows, marshes and forests, and are used for teas, salves and tinctures. Each plant is also labelled with its medicinal properties. <p/> In Olimje, we couldn't pass by the Chocolate Factory and its delicacies. We were drawn in, our eyes were big and our sweet tooth was irrepressible! <p/> At the end of our pilgrimage, in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Assumption with its black and gold altars, we prayed the fifth Litany of the Mother of God and celebrated the National Day with a cultural programme in the courtyard of the monastery. <p/> On our way home, we passed through Trojany. Here we had a delicious doughnut or ice cream. We were happy and satisfied on our way back home, grateful to Pastor Andrew for leading and organising a wonderful pilgrimage that filled our hearts and souls. <p/> JP <p/> Photos.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

851,"I had this operation this week. I wonder if anyone has any experience. How about cycling, after how long did you go back on the bike, I mean on a single, in the woods, not on the asphalt. Thank you lp hema <p/> Obey the doctor's advice. A lot also depends on each individual, some people heal faster, some slower with various complications. Definitely consult a doctor, but it is true that sometimes they exaggerate the time limit until when you should avoid exertion etc...but all this for your prevention... <p/> Thank you. I have a very good doctor and I will listen to him. But I am more of the get back on my feet quickly sort. We'll see. lp, hema <p/> I had this operation too. First I gritted my teeth in pain for two years, went round and round the docs, waited months for check-ups, was prescribed therapy in the acute phase, lost my job because of sick leave, waited for the disability committee to give me an opinion because of my paralysed leg, was hit by trampolines, rolled around the hospitals and received blockades, when finally they took pity on me and operated. Unfortunately, it was too late - the result is the destruction of the sciatic nerve from the spine to the end of the feet.I can't feel my left leg because of paresis, or I have the feeling of a ""deaf"" leg. The muscles have slowly atrophied and there is clearly no strength in the leg. I cannot wear a minica. My fendered foot bothers me a lot on the bike, I have no power, I can't get off on the left side because I fall, on the special I have a spd in the middle of the shoe because there is no power in the foot, and I can push the pedal with my whole foot (thank you Stan for redoing my shoe).Clearly, my kneecaps and leggings are constantly creeping down, because my foot is 5 digits smaller than the right one (the right one). It also bothers me a lot in cross-country skiing and dry running because with this wedge foot I have no push-off and it makes me kneel. I also have a limp, but it is not noticeable when dancing. The doctors immediately warned me that this tends to happen again. Well, it hasn't happened to me yet. Nevertheless, I ride a bicycle. I already had a bike with me in the spa after the operation and it was even recommended. Nevertheless, I ride on rough terrain, and sometimes I fall because I get sucked onto the wrong side and cannot catch my foot. I also find it difficult to carry a 15-kilogram bike, but it goes with a yoke. I also go to marathons (not yet disabled) cycling and running and I do have worse results, but I can do it. Even the sledging punctures haven't knocked me out yet. Even the stitched rags I wear at -12 degrees C can't get to me yet. I have spent a lot of money and time on various chiropractic and electrotherapy treatments to restore the nerve, but the neurologists have put me on solid ground - it's a lifetime. My therapy, my pleasure, is the bicycle. I advise you to do the same. But I hope you don't have any consequences-a destroyed nerve, because then there is no problem at all-get on the bike as soon as possible. <p/> Andreja, thank you, really thank you for these words. No, fortunately I went to a specialist (self-pay) after two months of pain and injections, and he immediately put me on a CT scan in Jesenice, and after 20 days it was my turn for the operation. So, I don't have the same consequences as you. But I know that my leg hasn't worked for a while and it will need to be woken up a bit, but exercises and walks and spa will do. Today is exactly 14 days after the operation and I am more and more hopeful that Franja will not escape me this year. If I may ask you this: Which spa have you been to and how is the bike- where did you put it? Thank you again, you really gave me the mood. LP, hema <p/> I was in Dobrna twice for 14 days each, staying in an old villa opposite the Health Resort. They had a ""rumpr kamra"", where I had my bike, a trekking bike at that time. It was not a treatment but a real relaxing holiday - therapies in the morning, walks in the afternoon, cycling around Paško Kozjak, around Šmartinsko Lake, swimming in the evening, playing cards with my friends.... <p/> Greetings! It's been three months since the operation and I don't have any major problems on the bike, in fact I'm still cycling the easiest, avoiding some hard downhills a bit. I don't have any problems with climbing due to hernia problems (I have them due to the kg gained during 4 months of total inactivity ) hema <p/> With back problems you need to spend a lot of time strengthening the abdominal muscles. And it's also good to keep them as tight as possible while driving. This is where endurance comes into play... <p/> Thank you, Little Mother! I'm working on it, my friend said that if I don't rest (I have to lie down for at least a couple of days, and sit as little as possible), he'll take me back to Jesenice. <p/> Why a second operation? I join Matičko's wishes. <p/> Depression thank you! The first time everything was ok. The second operation is on the other vertebra, or disc-my other leg was hurting, which looked a bit ""strange"" the first time, and has now developed to the point that I had to have ""sub-urgent"" surgery (from MRI to surgery in three days). Lp <p/> hmm; difficulty getting up after sitting; feeling ""electric shakes"" in one leg (along a nerve across the arse); walking, cycling etc. no problems; is that it? - will my aunt's hernia visit me? <p/>Miscolin, it could be something like that. I recommend you see an orthopaedic surgeon, because if it is not too bad you can cure it with exercises and massage. It's good to be examined by a specialist... Just don't wait too long because the operation is not pleasant. I went to an orthopaedic surgeon (in Kranj, he's really a master) because it's too long to wait. If you are interested in more, you can PM me <p/> To join the ""hernia club"" After a day's hiking, I got a low back pain. It wasn't entirely without foreshadowing, I felt a slight draft in my lumbar area right at the start of the tour. After the first long stop I found it a bit hard to get up but decided to continue. After 5 h of cycling I felt neither stiffness nor pain. I thought it was a happy ending. Unfortunately it was not. When I cooled down I was stiff in the lower back and the pain was spreading from the lower back all over my right leg. I was in pain for two weeks. A CT scan showed a herniated L5 disc. I decided to get it sorted as soon as possible so I am now in therapy. There is probably someone else with similar problems. I would be interested to know if anyone has resolved the pain without surgery. Of course, I am most interested in how it works on the bike. Does anyone use cosmodisk active on the bike to prevent back problems ? <p/> Just a layman's thought: maybe a good chiropractor could help you?If the injury is not too serious, of course, they don't do miracles anyway. Marko <p/> My mother was helped a lot by ""stretching"" her spine, if that's what you call it. She bought a special stand with a table on it. You lie down on the table, pin your legs together and turn the table ""upside down"" so that you are lying upside down.... 5-10 min 2x a day. She bought this table from an Austrian company... it's a medical device, so it's tried and tested. The result of using it is that the vertebrae gradually ""stretch"" by about a millimetre, thus relieving the pressure on the nerves. LP <p/> Well, after 4h months of regular exercise, the problems are gone; and the weight is off <p/> I hope for a similar result with both pain and weight <p/> The stretching table as Yogo wrote certainly helps. Otherwise, a beginner's Yoga class (1-2) does wonders. But it depends on your condition. Also, a chiropractor can do more harm if the condition is very bad. Start carefully. I don't doubt it, though, because you've already tasted the pain. <p/> that's it... the price is admittedly reasonable for a ""medical device"" but it's forever... the spine isn't <p/> ...a few days ago on a climbing trip I heard the story of an elderly gentleman who was put in a wheelchair by the doctors a short time later - he was already walking with great difficulty, his trunk movement was very limited, etc. The gentleman was an occasional climber, which he was advised against, like any other harder or extreme sport. His soul would not rest and he went climbing a few times. The catch was that the day after climbing, the movement was much better and the pain was less. He also noticed that the pills/hypnotics and other things ""helped"" him much less than climbing - now he tries to climb as much as possible, so in his old age he also enrolled in a mountaineering course and combines the enjoyable with the very useful for himself! There is something, or a lot, in stretching the spine. I had a lot of problems myself, the doctors couldn't find a solution, I was too young to be advised to have surgery, I was saved by a chiropractor (for a short time). Now I do more sports, I look a little more at my diet and it is much better. For the last two months I have done very little sport because of colds, flu and poisoning, I haven't swum at all, I haven't cycled, I've only climbed a few times... the problems are coming back!!! Stretching, yoga, sports that relax the spine help in my opinion... and it's even more ""fun"" than an operation! (all written here is my experience or the experience of my interlocutors) <p/> In my opinion, besides the stretching of the spine, the fact that playing sports moves the muscles that support the spine is also a big factor here. Marko <p/> I agree! That's my opinion too, but somehow I forgot to mention... <p/> Thanks for all the tips. The stretching table was suggested to me by a yogi a week or so ago and the stuff should be able to help. The problem is that I live in a block of flats and have limited space. Ever since yogo suggested it I have been thinking about what to throw out of the flat to make room for a table. Today I am on my fourth day of therapy and I have to admit that I have gained flexibility and I don't feel pain anymore. <p/> problematiks wrote:I really don't know what the problem is here.Bos did go to visit his mother, didn't he? Marko <p/> He had problems. 2x. The first time I got dirty with one of the exercises from aktivni.si, and when it was over, and the exercises were over, I got cut again. This time worse. I found some other exercises on the net that are a bit of a stretch, a bit for strength, ..., but from the beginning the dogs hurt, but it got better quickly. Now I do them occasionally, and sometimes (not during the exercises) I feel my back, but no problems. I can cycle, walk, ski, but it hurts when I swim or run (I get more discomfort, but I'd better stop) or carry heavier things (say, a bundle of raden in one hand). Lifting is not a problem. The injury occurs between the ages of 25 and 40 in about 90% of the population. The sheath is already hard, but the inside is still soft. Because of weak small spinal muscles, the spine collapses, and a ""bulge"" forms on the disc, which presses on the nerve. These muscles can only be trained with specific exercises, Kegels are very effective, and there are many on the net. I've put these in a pdf, if anyone wants it I'll mail it to them. Maybe it helps someone else, it helped me. http://www.aktivni.si/zdravje/sedite-na ... ani-bombi/",Forum,train
852,"About the book and the author(s) <p/> The novel interweaves (through the lens of a fictional writer) three stories derived from three autobiographical accounts: the story of a great archaeologist (Heinrich Schliemann), the story of an adventure novelist (Karl May), and the story of a counter-intelligence chief in an ""unnamed country"", set in the second half of the 20th century. The basic link between the narratives is the writer's reflection on the falsity or truthfulness of autobiographies. <p/> The narrative of the counter-intelligence officer is in prose, the individual parts of the archaeologist's story are in verse (hexameter, elegiac distich), and the story of Karl Mayo is accompanied as a theatrical performance. This mixing of genres is inspired, at least in formal terms, by the novels of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Sterne). The work is thus situated in the tradition of the modern novel in the context of world literature, the beginning of which most literary historians place at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. <p/> The experimentalism of the Enlightenment novel, rediscovered by postmodernism, is realised in In Their Own Words above all as a play with the expressive possibilities of autobiographical writing. (Autobiographicalism is currently, both in Slovenia and worldwide, one of the most topical themes for both creators and researchers of fiction.) In terms of content, the work is open to the outside, but at the same time - through the figure of the writer, as well as through the presence of the implicit reader - it is closely embedded in the Slovenian space. <p/> Katarina Marinčič <p/> Slovenian writer, 1968 <p/> Katarina Marinčič is well known to Slovenian readers, having published three novels, Tereza (1989), Rožni vrt (1992) and Prikrita harmonija (2001), as well as a collection of novellas, O treh (2005). She received the Kresnik Prize (2002) for her novel Prikrita harmonija / Hidden Harmony and the Dnevnik Fable Prize (2007) for her collection O treh / About Three. In 2015, her novel After Their Words earned her a nomination for the K kresnik and the Critics' Sieve Award. <p/> The writer's second - or parallel - profession is also related to literature. She teaches 18th and 19th century French literature at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, where she completed her PhD with a dissertation on the work of Honoré de Balzac.",Information/Explanation,train

At the beginning of the parade, we watched the bearer of the national flag, Alojz Žnofl, a junior firefighter of the 2nd level, followed by the firefighter's emblem carried by the juniors of PGD Sveti Jurij, Maja Kukovec and Nuša Najdenik. The parade was then led by. The parade commander was Robert Kukovec, firefighter newspaperman II, vice-commander of the Lenart Firefighters' Association and commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, and his assistants were Uroš Črnčec, junior firefighter newspaperman I and Tilen Kristl, senior firefighter I. <p/> This was followed by the Lenart Fire Brigades Association's Platoon of Honour, which is made up of members from all ten Lenart Fire Brigades Association companies. It was led by Jernej Sinič, Senior Firefighter, and Ivan Divjak was the flag bearer of the Honor Platoon. <p/> The flag echelon followed. The standard bearers' echelon was led by Robert Črnčec, Firefighter's Timekeeper 1st Class, Deputy Commander of the home association. The flag bearer of the home association, Jožek Zaletinger, was at the head, with the youth flag of PGD Sveti Jurij, carried by Karin Najdenik, at his side. This was followed by banner bearers from all ten Lenart Fire Brigade associations and banner bearers from the neighbouring associations of Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. This was followed by the firefighter youth echelon, commanded by Alen Breznik, senior firefighter. Next came the members' echelon, led by Dejan Najdenik, a junior firefighter, 1st level. <p/> This was followed by the echelon of fire engines. At the head was a 1982 FAP vehicle driven by Jože Sinič. This was followed by the AC16/40 special vehicle, driven by Branko Črnčec. Next was the newer Mercedes Atego GVC 16/25, driven by Žan Krajnc. Other vehicles of the Lenart Fire Brigades Association and neighbouring volunteer associations followed. <p/> After the parade, all firefighters and guests gathered for the main ceremony in the tent in front of the entrance to Jura Square. <Before the start of the ceremony, the commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, Robert Kukovec, asked the Mayor of the municipality, Peter Škrlec, for permission to start the event. <p/> In the introduction of the ceremony, the President of the Sveti Jurij Volunteer Fire Brigade in Slovenske gorice, Gregor Nudl, spoke about the activities that led to the new fire truck being among us, about the wishes for a new vehicle. As the acquisition of a new fire truck is a great financial burden, but also a joy and pride for the firefighters and all citizens, the Mayor of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah, Peter Škrlec, also spoke on the occasion of such an important acquisition for our town and praised the efforts of the Jurij firefighters for the modernisation of the fleet and the dedicated performance of volunteer firefighting activities. Of course, all the assembled firefighters and guests were also welcomed by the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association, Robert Mesarec. <p/> This was followed by the official handover of the vehicle, during which the President and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij PGD handed over the keys to the driver and the vehicle's custodian, Andrej Sinič. The new firefighting vehicle was blessed by the local parish priest and dean, Janko Gögner, who wished the users of the vehicle a happy and safe journey and to use it mainly for social purposes and as little as possible for interventions. <p/> The ceremony of taking over the new vehicle was enriched with a short cultural programme by the Jurova Octet and the young accordionist Marko Igrec. <p/> As the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle is unimaginable without financial support, the representatives of the Voluntary Firefighters' Association Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah presented a token of appreciation to all donors and godparents who financially supported the Association in the purchase of the new firefighting vehicle. <p/> We concluded the ceremony with a sincere wish for the Jurij firefighters that despite the new equipment, volunteerism, courage and helping their fellow man remain their values. <p/> After the ceremony, there was a social gathering of all the firemen and firewomen, followed by the entertainment part of the celebration, as our firefighters also provided the appropriate catering, and we were able to warm up our hands and heels to the music of the ensemble Hearty Musicians.",News,train

""He is certainly a good candidate,"" Marjan Šarec said when asked whether the Dutchman was acceptable to Slovenia. <p/> ""We have now seen a proposal. For me it is not a bad proposal. Even if that were the case, it is a pretty good proposal,"" the prime minister said. But when asked more specific questions, he replied only that it was difficult to describe the details when arriving at the summit. <p/> The proposal was agreed in Osaka, on the sidelines of the G20 summit <p/> An unofficial scenario is circulating that the post of President of the European Commission would go to the Socialists, the post of President of the European Parliament and the high-level foreign policy post to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), and the post of President of the European Council to the Liberals. <p/> ""They say they have agreed something in Japan. Now, when we sit down, we will see how it goes, and then we will move on. It is difficult for me to say much right now, I can only express the hope that there will be an agreement today or overnight so that the process can move forward and there will not be too long a deadlock,"" Šarec said of the proposal in play. <p/> The Liberals getting the post of President of the European Council seems good to the Slovenian Prime Minister. He did not want to talk about the names, saying that they must first sit down at the table. He also refused to comment on who his favourite or favourite candidate was and whether the Danish Liberal Margrethe Vestager, whom he has so far supported for the Commission presidency, was still in the running. <p/> ""Now we need to hear proposals. I cannot say anything until I am inside and until I see if anything new has happened in the meantime. It's been an hour and a half, something may have changed in that time,"" he said. <p/> Šarec hopes that there will be no blockages, recalling that decision-making does not require pure consensus and that even five years ago not everyone supported the then candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. He feels that it would be good to reach a compromise to some extent, but if this is not possible, then it must be decided by a majority. <On the wisdom of isolating the Visegrad Quartet, which is opposed to Timmermans, he said: ""There is a need for compromise. If there is a majority for an option, the majority will not accommodate some. You know, sometimes on a trip, the bus has to close the door and move on if you are waiting for someone. But I do not want to prejudge. That is speculation. I hope that we will reach a compromise and unanimously choose someone, because that is a better way forward."" <p/> Asked how long they would sit at the table, he replied that he did not know that either and that if he had his way, they would not sit for long. <p/> Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, arriving at the EU summit, predicted difficult negotiations on leadership positions, in particular on the new President of the European Commission, and warned of an institutional conflict between the European Council and the European Parliament. She said European Council President Donald Tusk would not have an easy task tonight.",News,train
857,"Sports hall completed <p/> After twenty-five years of work, a new multi-purpose sports hall has been completed in Mengeš, which will be used by schoolchildren in the morning and by associations and other citizens in the afternoon and evening. It will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall cost €4.5 million and Mengeš also obtained a grant for the investment. <p/> Mengeš - The multi-purpose sports hall, located next to the Mengeš Primary School, is almost complete after a year since the foundation stone was laid last June. These days, workers are sanding and varnishing the parquet flooring, while minor landscaping work is being carried out on the external areas. <p/> According to the Director of the Mengeš Municipal Administration, Urban Kolar, a technical inspection will be carried out on Thursday and the hall will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall, together with the outdoor playgrounds and the athletics track with tartan and climbing wall inside, will primarily be used for sports lessons and other leisure activities of the Mengeš Primary School, but other local associations and citizens will also be able to use the hall in the afternoons and evenings. ""I don't think it is a question of whether it will be occupied or not. There is also a lot of interest from associations and individuals from the surrounding municipalities. I think we could easily fill the dates, even if we had another hall,"" says Kolar, who is particularly pleased that the municipal administration has managed to carry out such a large investment without taking out a loan, thanks to the grants they have received. The EcoFund contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility, five hundred thousand were obtained from the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, and a further 65 thousand from the Foundation for Sport.The EcoFund has also contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility. The contract value of the hall is €4.5 million, it was built by Graditelj from Kamnik, with whom Mengeš was very satisfied, and the interior fittings, worth €660 thousand, are being installed by Elan Inventa. <p/> The construction of the new sports hall will free up the current gym of the primary school, which is to be converted into a kitchen and dining room, as well as four additional classrooms. ""With almost nine hundred pupils, Mengeška Primary School is one of the largest in Slovenia. The municipality has already solved the space problem in the past by building extensions, first to the west, then to the east, and now the third phase, the reconstruction of the school gym, is on the cards,"" says Kolar, who adds that the procedures have already started, but it is too early to talk about the amount of the investment, as they need to get the designers' estimates first. The municipality will certainly have to take out a loan for the investment. <p/> The redevelopment of the gymnasium is therefore the final stage in solving the school's space problem, which will ensure that Mengeš has enough classroom capacity for the next few years. However, given that the immigration trend in the municipality is quite high and the population could easily grow from the current 8200 to tens of thousands or more in the next few years, any future space needs of the school will have to be solved by setting up a new primary school or a branch, Kolar believes.",News,train
858,"In the media <p/> Book Heroes, Spiritually Responsible vs Spiritually Comfortable <p/> The anthropological-philosophical reflection Heroes begins with a chapter on the development of spiritual thought in the light of dualisms, such as the parallel or intertwined path of material and spiritual science, by the author Dr Lucija Mulej Mlakar. In doing so, she touches on the area of spiritual growth, which should not become a field of contradictions, as is often the case when self-proclaimed ""gurus"" take on the task of the personal growth of their followers, who in turn uncritically imitate them. The spiritual quest has its own psychopathology, which it points out even with fictitious examples such as preoccupation with appearances, calculating, easy and comfortable, or wrong attitudes towards possessions, education, etc. These seemingly clichéd truths for ""spiritual seekers"" are presented in a new and original way in the book. Through chapters on the dimension of time, the history of the heart and the integration of intelligences, the author introduces interesting ideas: time holes and time pockets, concavity and convexity of memory, generational codes or a new look at the traditional philosophy of personal time and personal karma. The ""dark night of the soul"", as she calls the inconsolable suffering, could be illuminated with the help of her guidance and her book Heroes.

859,"How many billions of euros are sticking out of our banking hole? <p/> Have we filled Slovenia's banking hole with too many billions? A billion too much is said to have been spent on the biggest bank alone <p/> If some economists, bankers and even forensic experts are to be believed, Slovenia's banking hole was actually too shallow for all the billions of taxpayers' money that have leaked into it. According to some estimates, a billion euros too much was spent on the rehabilitation of the largest bank alone. And all the mistakes in the bank bail-out are estimated to have cost at least a meagre three billion euros. Despite the European warnings, the banking hole will be open for domestic auditors to dig into. But only on a limited basis, as some documents will not be accessible to the domestic umbrella banks. The average citizen, who could have spent his or her investment in bank recovery on, say, a nice luxury exotic trip, will have to be content with these (limited) findings. <p/> The banking hole has been the subject of years of work by bankers, politicians, criminals and, last but not least, ordinary citizens. How could it not, since the last bailout of the banks in 2013 was so ""fat"" that it simply cannot be ""swallowed"". A good €3 billion cost taxpayers the last bank bailout four years ago. And it is precisely because of concerns and allegations that the whole bail-out was oversized by billions of euros that people want an epilogue to this story. Probably no one in Slovenia is counting on the kind of conclusion that the Icelanders have written in their banking story. This country of just over 300 000 inhabitants has become a model for the Western world in terms of how to prosecute criminal practices in the banking sector, with the imprisonment of 30 bankers and financiers who were responsible for the collapse of three banks in 2008. Time will have to tell how we will conclude the story at home. <p/> Where did the billions go? <p/> In 2013, many people believed that a big taxpayer bailout of the banks was really needed. Every last cent. This is what bankers, not just domestic bankers, but also European bankers, those from the European Central Bank, the central financial institution in the euro area, were convincing citizens. And if Boštjan Jazbec, Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, said at the time that ""Slovenian banks will be among the better capitalised in the euro area after the recapitalisation"", the laity could not doubt it. <p/> What actually happened? At the end of 2012, when speculations started to emerge that Slovenia would have to ask for international help because of the bad debts Slovenian banks had accumulated, the Parliament opened the door wider for the Bank of Slovenia to intervene in ailing banks with an amended Banking Act. Less than a year later, the Bank of Slovenia, together with the Ministry of Finance, ordered asset quality reviews and stress tests for NLB, NKBM and Abanka and, under special conditions, for Banka Celje, Gorenjska banka, Probanka, Factor banka, Unicredit banka ' Slovenija, Hypo Alpe Adria Bank and Raiffeisen banka. The quality review was carried out by Deloitte and EY and the stress tests by Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger. <p/> The estimates showed that the capital shortfall in the banks reviewed in the worst case scenario would be almost €5 billion and that €3 billion would be needed to recapitalise NLB, NKBM and Abanka. We taxpayers have ""paid for"" these, not only with taxpayers' money, but also by expropriating the holders of subordinated bonds and shares in the nationalised banks. Small shareholders - according to the Association of Small Shareholders, some 100,000 shareholders and 2,000 subordinated bondholders with €600 million in assets, some half a million savers in pension, management and insurance companies, as well as many companies and municipalities - protested and sought legal solutions. The Constitutional Court, even after responses from Europe, ruled that parts of the banking legislation that allowed for the forced deletion of qualifying liabilities did not contravene the Constitution and did not interfere with the right to private property. However, it is unconstitutional that the legislation failed to provide effective judicial protection to those affected. The Court therefore ordered the National Assembly to remedy the unconstitutionality within six months and ordered the suspension of the limitation period for claims for damages. <p/> Too much money in the banks <p/> Soon there were rumours that we had put too much money in the banks after all. Already two years ago, an unnamed Bank of Slovenia official told Finance that the data underlying the Bank of Slovenia's actions in the then nationalised banks were allegedly manipulated and the banks overcapitalised. Last year, a criminal investigation was launched in connection with the bank bail-outs, where the Bank of Slovenia, NLB and the auditing firms Ernst & Young and Deloitte came under scrutiny. The proposal for an investigation order published earlier this year, however, brought familiar accusations and arguments that have been coming from expropriated small shareholders and holders of subordinated liabilities since the banks were nationalised and rehabilitated at the end of 2013. The basic dilemma is, insofar as it is possible to understand the complex facts, that the picture of the banking portfolio was still positive in mid-2013, but that, after reassessments after only a few months, a deep banking hole had opened up, which is why, four years ago, we offered the banks a three-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion bail-out. That is to say, that the whole bank bail-out was tailor-made so that the holders of subordinated bonds lost everything in it. And that the capital shortfall in Slovenian banks could perhaps have been estimated much lower at the time. <p/> As reported in the Slovenian media, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Boštjan Jazbec, the former Vice-Governors Stanislava Caprirola and Janez Fabijan, and Tomaž Čemažar of the Central Bank have been accused of abuse of official position. The prosecution's thesis was that they were aware that the reports on the state of the NLB were not made in accordance with the rules and on an acceptable basis, and therefore there was no legal basis for the extraordinary measures at the NLB.<p/> The fact that the size of the banking hole was oversized was confirmed to the DZ Commission of Inquiry by Andrej Hazabent, a former member of the Management Board of the NLB, who estimated that a billion too much money had been invested in the NLB alone.<p/> The Commission of Inquiry was also told that the size of the hole had been oversized. Among other things, he told the commission that NLB's operating profit was falling, ""so it comes from the unwinding of over-provisioning. If the transfer resulted in a loss of €500 million, the rehabilitation of NLB is estimated at €1.6 billion, a billion too much, when €1.1 billion is paid in"", he outlined. <p/> In the middle of last month, however, the newspaper Delo revealed a study by economist Veljko Bolet, who calculated that the banking hole was oversized by several billion euros. <p/>Obstacles from Europe <p/> The answers and facts about the banking hole will therefore have to wait. It remains to be seen whether the real numbers will ever crystallise. The public prosecutors immediately came under pressure for illegal activities in the collection of information in the banks. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), protested last year about what he considered to be the illegal confiscation of information by the ECB. The ECB has also taken the matter to the Constitutional Court over the confiscation of its files in the context of the criminal investigation. The Bank of Slovenia has already lodged a constitutional complaint against the order itself. <p/> A few weeks ago, the European Commission decided to send Slovenia a first warning letter under the infringement procedure in relation to the seizure of ECB information in the context of a criminal investigation into the Bank of Slovenia in July last year. <p/> Meanwhile, the Slovenian government has decided to amend the Banking Act to allow the Court of Auditors to assess the efficiency and regularity of the Bank of Slovenia's operations and the decisions that led to the use of public funds. But to a limited extent. In particular, the State Auditors will not be allowed to audit the implementation of monetary policy, the application and interpretation of law and supervisory practices, and will not be allowed to interfere with the powers exercised by the Bank of Slovenia as an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Nor will the Court of Auditors be able to impose corrective measures on the Bank of Slovenia or to call for the dismissal of the Governor. <p/> The Court of Auditors has already pointed out that in order to give an opinion on the Bank's operations, it needs to see all the documentation, and the Court of Auditors' first president, Tomaž Vesel, has even said that ""it is not appropriate for the Bank of Slovenia or the ECB, of which Sanka Slovenije is a part, to be able to decide which documentation should be reviewed and which should not be reviewed in a directional manner. However, strict restrictions on the timing of the public disclosure of the findings on these documents are understandable"". <p/> Since the amended law granting the Court of Auditors these powers is not due to enter into force until next year, the epilogue on the banking hole will probably have to wait for some time.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

863,"We have several different materials available for solid or masonry construction. You can choose brickwork with improved thermal insulation properties (thermosheet), lightweight blocks made of aerated concrete or expanded polystyrene formwork, the core of which has to be filled with concrete. Their properties, thermal insulation and method of construction are described below. <p/> All of these materials can be used to achieve a thermal transmittance of the whole external wall composition that meets the criteria of low-energy or passive construction. A wall constructed with a higher thermal conductivity material will need to be faced with a thicker layer of thermal insulation to achieve the same or at least a similar effect as a wall constructed with a lower thermal conductivity material. The materials also differ in the way they are constructed and the time taken for the walls to dry, as well as in how or with which additional elements they can be used to facilitate detailing and prevent thermal bridging. <p/> Thermal bricks in different sizes <p/> Bricks with improved thermal insulation properties are available in different shapes and sizes, and are also chosen by builders because they are a natural material. Goriška Brickworks offers thermal bricks 39, 29 and 25 cm thick. The thermal conductivity of the former is 0.22 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of them is 0.51 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of the second and third bricks is 0.24 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 29 cm thick bricks is 0.72 W/m2K and the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 25 cm thick bricks is 0.83 W/m2K. All of them have in common a linearly offset honeycomb and an increased mass of clay per unit volume of brick compared to conventional bricks, says Gregor Malik of Goriška brickworks. The offset honeycomb helps to allow both cold and heat to travel longer into the building, while the mass of the bricks significantly increases heat accumulation and thus helps to better regulate the temperature in the room. <p/> The brickwork does not differ significantly from conventional brickwork, the only difference is the design of the vertical ties, which is made much easier by the pero-utor system. In this case, the mortar is just shaken into the pocketed core that is formed when one brick is brought closer to the other, explains Malik, adding that it does not matter what weather conditions the building is built in. Every bricklayer knows that a period of cold and frost or a strong summer shower is not the best time for quality construction. In winter, the water in mortar can freeze, causing inappropriate reactions in its bonding with the bricks, so that the bonds are weaker than they would be at the right temperatures. In the summer heat, the mortar dries out too quickly due to the heat and the unmoistened bricks. <p/> For thermal insulation of thermo-brick walls, Goriška Brickworks recommends vapour-permeable insulating materials. 12 cm of stone wool on the thickest brickwork achieves a low-energy standard, while 18 cm of the same insulation achieves a passive standard. A 25 cm wall should be lined with 14 cm of stone wool for a low-energy house or 20 cm of stone wool for a passive house. <p/> For a square metre of wall, we will use 20 39 cm thick bricks, 15 29 cm thick bricks and 12.5 25 cm thick bricks. All earthquake-resistant corner and wall elements and the corresponding halves are also available to the builders. <p/> Special adhesive instead of mortar <p/> Wienerberger Opekarna Ormož offers builders of low-energy and passive houses, among other things, thermal masonry in various thicknesses made of ground bricks, using special adhesive instead of mortar, and system solutions for thermal bridges in the vertical and horizontal bond area and lintels with integrated external blinds boxes to facilitate and improve the quality of the detailing. <p/> The passive standard is already achieved with 30 cm thick thermo-walls, which have a thermal conductivity of 0.14 W/mK and must be lined with 20 cm of insulation material with a thermal conductivity of 0.032 W/mK. The thermal transmittance of such a wall is 0.12 W/m2K, says Boštjan Kosec of the Ormož brickworks, adding that the low-energy standard is achieved by lining 30-centimetre-thick bricks with 15 centimetres of polystyrene insulation. <p/> For external walls, vertical earthquake-resistant ties are also used at about four to six metres and at all corners. Additional elements such as corner blocks for the vertical ties and corner blocks to solve the thermal bridge problem in the area of the vertical tie, a system lintel with a box for external blinds, a ceiling system and semi-prefabricated pre-stressed lintels, and insulation elements to insulate the horizontal ties (wreath bricks, wreath formwork) facilitate the masonry work. <p/> The average weight of a cubic metre of external wall is approximately 1 000 kilograms. The time required for brickwork depends on the size of the bricks. For a cubic metre of wall, 85 conventional bricks, 3.7 hours and 220 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a cubic metre of 30 cm thermo-brick wall, 53 bricks, 3,2 hours and 180 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a wall of the same size made of brushed thermal bricks, the same number of bricks is needed, but only 1.6 hours and the corresponding amount of polyurethane glue. <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks with improved thermal conductivity can be chosen for the basic structure. The thermal conductivity of 350 kg/m3 blocks is 0.100 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of an external wall made of 40 cm thick blocks (50 cm thick blocks are also available on request) is 0.24 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of 300 kg/m3 thermoblocks is 0.086 W/mK and the thermal transmittance of a 40 cm wall is 0.21 W/m2K. Both types of thermoblock already meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency in Buildings Regulations (Pures) without additional thermal insulation, says Nataša Tavčar of Xella porobeton. She says that mortar losses are also important for the thermal insulation performance of a wall, and that they are negligible (less than 4%) in block masonry due to the thin-layer adhesive mortar, which is two to three millimetres thick. <p/> Thin-layer mortar requires precision, which is not difficult if the builder uses the right tools and follows the manufacturer's instructions. It is important that the first course is placed in a mortar that allows the unevenness of the substrate to be eliminated. Thin-set adhesive mortar should be applied with trowels to allow even application. In the following courses, any unevenness that occurs at the joints of the bricks shall be eliminated by the use of a levelling board. Additional elements are available to the builder to facilitate construction and solve thermal bridging problems: type lintels, anti-seismic blocks (for vertical ties) and U- and L-elements (for horizontal and diagonal ties). No additional formwork is needed, which makes construction even faster and ultimately cheaper, Tavčar adds. <p/> The amount of additional insulation depends on how energy-efficient the house is. A single-layer wall meets the Pures requirements for a 35-50 kWh/m2a energy-efficient house. For very good low-energy houses with a consumption below 20 kWh/m2a, an additional 10-14 cm of thermal insulation must be added to the 40 cm brickwork to ensure a thermal transmittance of the wall of 0.16-0.14 W/m2K. The builder can choose mineral thermal insulation boards which, like the blocks, are non-combustible (class A1), vapour permeable, strong, dimensionally stable and easy to shape. For a passive house, the thermal transmittance of the wall must be less than 0.15 W/m2K or, in the case of single-family houses, closer to 0.10 W/m2K. This value is achieved with 40 cm thick blocks and 22 cm of mineral panel insulation. <p/> Despite their large dimensions, porous concrete blocks are relatively easy to work with as they are very light. It takes only 1.71 hours to build a cubic metre of load-bearing wall with 40 cm thick blocks, or 1.92 hours with 30 cm thick blocks. A square metre of wall will take only eight blocks. <p/> Expanded polystyrene cladding <p/> The thermal performance of external walls for low-energy and passive houses can be achieved quite easily with a system consisting of expanded polystyrene elements, the core of which is filled with a concrete core. The certification of the German Passive House Institute confirms the suitability of the system for passive houses, as it allows construction without thermal bridges. The walls are 25 to 40 centimetres thick, the concrete core is 15 to 20 centimetres thick, and the bricks can be bought ready-assembled or assembled themselves using plastic spacers, which also serve as anchors for the reinforcement, says Nataša Jančar of Varčna gradnja. <p/> The thermal conductivity of the brickwork material is 0.029 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of the wall depends on the thickness of the brickwork - from 0.26 to 0.11 W/m2K, and the acoustic insulation is 44 to 54 dB. Each square metre of wall can hold 0.14 to 0.15 cubic metres of concrete, which means that a square metre of wall weighs between 350 and 400 kilograms, depending on the composition of the concrete and the thickness of the concrete core. <p/> Masonry will be faster if the design takes into account that all the dimensions of the building are divisible by 5 (cm), which means less cutting of the masonry, advises Jančarjeva. Otherwise, all that is needed is precision, care and following the instructions. The walls are concreted at half height, which corresponds to a larger or smaller pear of concrete for a normal-sized storey. The advice on concrete granulation is followed, and the walls are supported before concreting and the concrete is poured slowly, in layers. If the instructions are followed, we will pour flat monolithic walls without air pockets and, above all, we will achieve airtight joints with the reinforced concrete slab and the concrete roof, if we have chosen to do so. <p/> The point of the formwork, says Jančar, is that no additional thermal insulation is needed, as the energy efficiency of the house is already influenced by the choice of brickwork. If we buy the thinnest ones, i.e. 25 cm, we will catch Pures by a hair, but if we choose the thickest ones (40 cm), the house will be very energy-efficient, even passive, with the right siting and good external joinery. <p/> For an average sized house, even one storey per day can be built and watered with good organisation. For one square metre, you need four bricks (25 centimetres high and 100 centimetres long). The use of system elements such as lintels, wreath elements and ceiling and roof elements speeds up the construction process. <p/> Easy as rolling a dice <p/> A system similar to the one described above, which is also certified by the German Passive House Institute, also makes construction quick and easy. It consists of foamed polystyrene formwork elements that are simply placed together and the core is filled with concrete. The system allows for the construction of a building without thermal bridges in four different thicknesses, which are fully compatible with each other and can be combined on the same building, says Alen Mladinov from Arhem - PasivnaGradnja.si. The thermal transmittance of a 31 cm thick external wall is 0.17 W/m2K, the thermal transmittance of a 37 cm thick wall is 0.13 W/m2K and a 43 cm thick wall is 0.10 W/m2K. The last two thicknesses are suitable for passive houses, where no additional thermal insulation is required. <p/>All thicknesses are available with elements that have dried clay on the inside, and construction is facilitated by additional elements with metal connectors, elements without thermal bridges for lintels, ceiling connectors, roller shutter housings, balcony housings, circular corners, vault, external overhanging cantilever, etc. The programme for stairs, ceilings and roof insulation is also suitable for this purpose. <p/> The concrete core can be 15, 20 or 26 cm thick, depending on the structural requirements. One of the advantages of the system is that the entire floor can be constructed and concreted as such. The speed of production per cubic metre depends on the thickness of the elements. For normal buildings, it can take as little as ten minutes. In other words: a storey of a residential house can be built in one day, with all the window openings, spandrels and shutter elements, Mladinov says. For one square metre, we will use five elements.",Information/Explanation,train

869,"What do you need to know about sunglasses? <p/> Choose sunglasses that look great and protect your eyes at the same time... <p/> The wide range of sunglasses in all styles, prices and characteristics can make it difficult to decide which pair of sunglasses is best for you. Finding a pair of sunglasses you like may be easier if you read now about what to look out for and what types of sunglasses are out there. What should you look for in a pair of sunglasses? Three important things: quality eye protection, comfort and fantastic style. <p/> Put UV protection on the list of characteristics you look for in sunglasses <p/> Your sunglasses should offer protection against ultraviolet radiation, a component of the sun that increases the chance of sun damage. The FDA, the government agency that oversees the manufacture and sale of sunglasses in the US, recommends that you look for sunglasses with lenses that block 99-100% of UVA and UVB radiation. The label should say either UV 400 or 100% UV protection. <p/> Lens materials in sunglasses The difference between the lens materials on sunglasses is quite small. Some surfaces are harder than others, some types are more durable. Three materials are most commonly used for sunglass lenses: - polycarbonate; long-lasting lightweight plastic. - CR-39; a plastic usually used in lenses of a prescribed quality. - Glass; durable or much heavier to wear. <p/> Sunglass lens colour and other layers <p/> UV filter is one of the layers that make up the lenses of sunglasses, but there are many others besides. <p/> Sunglass lens colour The colour of the lenses serves to absorb the light that passes through them. The colour you choose is a matter of personal taste, but you should take into account a few important features related to the colour of the lenses. - The grey colour of the lenses reduces the amount of light and at the same time does not distort the colours. - Brown and amber reduce glare, including the glare created by the blue frequency in the Sun, which can make objects look hazy. Brown and amber lenses distort colours more than grey. - Yellow lenses reduce the blur caused by blue light better than brown, sharpening vision but causing colour distortion. <p/> - Green tints in lenses reduce glare and help filter out some blue light. They offer good contrast between objects. - Pink lenses might be a good choice if you participate in water sports or other outdoor activities, as they offer good contrast between objects on a blue or green background. <p/> Sunglasses with polarised lenses The polarised layer on the lenses reduces the glare that occurs when light is reflected off certain objects such as water, asphalt and other similar surfaces. Polarised lenses are recommended, but the choice is still yours. <p/> Make sure your glasses have scratch protection A thin layer can be applied to the lenses to make them more scratch resistant. Plastic lenses scratch more easily than glass lenses. <p/> Sunglasses with mirrored lenses <p/> Some sunglasses have a mirrored surface on the outside of the lens. Although they are very popular, scratches can appear on them very quickly. <p/> Sunglasses with photochromic lenses Photochromic (or photosensitive) lenses become darker when exposed to UV radiation. The change happens quickly when you swap the darker surroundings for a lighter one. <p/> Sunglasses with an anti-reflective layer An anti-reflective layer reduces the reflection of light hitting the back of the lens, thereby protecting the rays from reflecting into the eyes. <p/> Sunglasses frame shapes <p/> Sunglasses frames are made from plastic, base metals, titanium, aluminium and many other materials. You should try different types of frames to get a feel for their weight and decide which ones suit you best. <p/> Children also need sunglasses When buying sunglasses for children, be aware that children also need protection against UV rays and glare. Forget those little toy sunglasses; buy something that will really protect your child's eyes. <p/> Sunglasses with extra eye protection - The lenses of custom-made sunglasses keep out more light and UV radiation than ordinary lenses. - Wear a hat for more protection against the sun. This will help keep your skin looking young and healthy. Experts say that the less we squint, the fewer wrinkles we have. <p/> Choose sunglasses that suit your style Sunglasses styles change every year, just like any other fashion, but there's such a wide range that no pair of glasses can go out of style. And sunglasses don't have to be expensive to be effective, so you don't need to buy a whole new collection. Designer and specialised sunglasses have a higher price tag than most other glasses, apart from those used for sports, but you can find all kinds of modern eyewear at affordable and accessible prices. It is just important to look out for the UV label. If you already know what frame shape suits you best, go to the store and try on different styles of glasses. If you get permission, you can also take them for a walk outside to see how the glasses actually perform in practice. <p/> News",Instruction,train

In simple terms, this law stopped all time limits in judicial and administrative matters, including the time limits for the exercise of substantive rights, during the epidemic. <p/> This means that the validity of driver certificates has been extended until the end of this crisis, but no later than 01.07.2020. However, this is sufficient for the control authorities in Slovenia, but not abroad. <p/> In the meantime, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia will issue certificates with limited validity to hauliers for their drivers who urgently need them, upon application. However, as the declaration of the end of the state of emergency is uncertain (it could be in two weeks or in two months), such certificates will be issued to them until the end of the validity of this law, i.e. until 01.07.2020.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) <p/>His comments were published on Friday on a new online platform he has set up to communicate with his followers. He also branded the 2020 presidential election ""fake"" while passing by both countries. <p/> Writing ""From Donald J. Trump's desk"", he said: ""At 6:31 a.m. on 4 November, 149,772 votes came in in the state of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the state miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate already begun its review of the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, or will they begin soon? If not, they would be out of office. Also, at 3.42 a.m., the state of Wisconsin received a dump of 143 379 votes, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these 'votes' come from? They were both going to national elections, and that is on top of other corruption, without even including the fact that neither state has received the legislative approval required by the US Constitution. ""<p/>Trump's comments came as the Justice Department expressed concerns about ballot security and potential voter intimidation stemming from a private Republican Senate recount in Arizona if the 2020 presidential election comes to Maricopa County. <p/>The Associated Press reported that in a letter to GOP Senate President Karen Fann, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division said the Senate, which is from 2.1 million ballots from the state's most populous district to the contractor, could violate a federal law that requires ballots. to remain under the supervision of election officials for 22 months. <p/>And Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela Karlan said the Senate contractor's plans to contact voters directly could constitute illegal voter intimidation. <p/>The Justice Department's letter came six days after voting rights groups urged federal officials to intervene or send observers to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix at the State Fairgrounds, where ballots are counted. <p/> Trump used his new online platform after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other social networks following the attack on the Capitol building on 6 January. <p/> Twitter said Trump was permanently banned from tweeting after the platform said his tweets after the action appeared to support those who engaged in violence that day. <p/> Trump's new page does not currently allow people to comment on his posts.",News,train

They work in a targeted way with a specific purpose, such as to strengthen the immune and nervous systems, balance the functioning of the glands and internal organs, increase circulation, maintain psycho-physical vitality, ease depressive states, etc. In addition, they enhance the functioning of the neutral or meditative mind, the faculties of intelligence, perseverance and perfection. A clear, neutral and intuitive mind gives us the ability to become aware of and change our own patterns, fears and habits that prevent us from moving forward in life. <p/> This is why Kundalini Yoga is so appropriate for today, empowering us, uplifting us and building a foundation to cope with the stresses and turbulence of today, a time of moving into the Aquarian Age, an age of higher consciousness and peace. <p/> ""Kundalini Yoga is a technology of knowing and awakening consciousness that leads us to the original Self. Usually this consciousness, which we call kundalini, is dormant within us and therefore awareness and experience of the Self is more or less limited. Awareness can be awakened and expanded up to Infinity and only then can I experience my true Self. Infinity is my original Self. In this expanded state nothing is lacking. The process of growth through Kundalini Yoga is the natural unfoldment of one's own nature. The obstacles on the path of growth are only the attachments to the habits of the past and the fears of the Infinite or the expanded Self.""",Promotion,train

Following the path of wisdom, Gyanadeva turned into a bird, flew inside the well, drank and returned to the surface. Namadeva disagreed with his approach, believing that man should rise to the level of the Divine and not slip down. Therefore he sat and chanted the name of God. The more intensely he chanted it, the more the water level in the well rose, and finally it even overflowed its rim. Without much effort, Namadeva took a drink and felt blissful. Thus he proved that although wisdom is useful, it is not stronger and greater than divinity.

Strengthening the importance and role of science as a key element of society is therefore one of Slovenia's most important development challenges. In order to promote and popularise science in the Republic of Slovenia and with the objectives of stimulating interest in science and increasing the role of knowledge in the social and economic environment, the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (hereinafter: the Ministry) wishes to establish an appropriate scientific and educational infrastructure, whose working name is the ""Science Centre"". <p/> The aim of the 'Science Centre' project is to acquire new infrastructure that will enable the establishment and implementation of the envisaged programme and content.

922,"Ombudsman <p/> ČP <p/> Consistency in responding and length of inspection procedures also at local level remains a problem <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia found that the Inter-municipal Inspectorate of the Joint Municipal Administration - 5G violated the principle of good administration by failing to respond to the petitioner, who had submitted several reports to it, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation on Administrative Operations, and by inexplicably failing to follow up on the petitioner's request for a tailored method of communication. The inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the reply of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which the Ombudsman considers to be an unacceptable length of time. Both the inspection procedure concerning the petitioner's first and second complaint are still pending. <p/> * * * * <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (the Ombudsman) dealt with the petitioner's petition concerning the alleged pollution of her property with various sewage and waste. The petitioner informed the Ombudsman that she addressed her letters and complaints to, inter alia, the Municipality of Škofljica (the Municipality) and the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate and Redarstvo of the Municipalities of Grosuplje, Ig and Škofljica (the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate).The tasks of the Inter-Munial Inspectorate were in the meantime taken over by the Joint Municipal Administration 5G, within which the current Inter-Munial Inspectorate operates. <p/> The Ombudsman has not found any irregularities in the conduct of the Municipality, which received the petitioner's communication for information only and therefore did not respond to it. <p/> According to the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate, it received the petitioner's complaint on 24 June 2019 regarding the pollution of her property with waste water allegedly caused by the owners of neighbouring properties, and an inspection was to be carried out on 22 June 2020, but it has not yet informed the petitioner of its findings pursuant to Article 24 of the Inspection Control Act (ICA). He is expected to do so at the end of the procedure, which leads the Ombudsman to conclude that the inspection procedure has not yet been completed. <p/> In the past year, the petitioner submitted two reports to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate. The first report, concerning construction waste dumped on her property, was received by the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate from the Ljubljana-Vič Police Station on 19 May 2020. The Inter-Municipal Inspectorate referred this report to the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for the Environment and Spatial Planning (IRSOP), which informed the petitioner and the Ombudsman. A second complaint by the petitioner concerning the alteration of nature trails was received by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate on 27 May 2020 and referred to the IRSOP. An inspection has not yet been carried out in this respect. <p/> Taking into account all available documentation, the Ombudsman found that the inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the Inter-municipal Inspectorate's reply to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which we considered to be unacceptably late. We pointed out to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate that, while it is true that, in accordance with Article 4 of the CPC, inspectors are independent in carrying out inspection tasks within the scope of their powers and that inspection procedures are (primarily) procedures in the public interest, this does not in itself justify significant delays such as those experienced in the specific case. We have also clarified that Article 24 of the CPC does not constitute an obstacle to the inspector informing the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage in the light of the principle of good administration, nor does it relieve the inspector of his obligation based on the provision of the first proviso to Article 17(1) of the CPC to inform the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage. The Inspector is not under any obligation under Article 17 of the Administrative Procedure Regulation (APR), according to which the authority is obliged to reply to all correspondence from which it can be inferred that the authority expects a reply and the identity of the sender, unless the content of the correspondence relates to a procedure pending before the authority, the correspondence is vexatious, or the authority has already replied to the sender on a substantially similar issue. The Authority is obliged to reply, in accordance with the second paragraph of that Article, no later than 15 days after receipt of the document, to the address indicated in the letter. On the basis of the reply received from the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, we conclude that the petitioner did not receive such a notification. In addition to the above, the Ombudsman also noted that, although the Inter-municipal Inspectorate had informed the petitioner of its decision to withdraw the notification to the IRSOP, it had not followed her request for an adapted method of communication. After further enquiries by the Ombudsman, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate agreed that, in accordance with the UUP, it should have dealt with the cases as quickly as possible and replied to all correspondence within 15 days. However, in his opinion, this is not always possible, mainly due to the large number of reports received, the work priorities, as well as the prolonged sick leave. He stressed that the risk assessment, the public interest and the nature of the infringement must be taken into account when dealing with reports, the conduct of inspection procedures and the criteria for setting priorities, and was aware that this was not a sufficient justification. As regards the follow-up of the procedure, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate stated that it had been in contact with the petitioner by telephone and that a joint field visit would be carried out as soon as possible in the light of the petitioner's possibilities. <p/> The Ombudsman considered the response of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, assuming the veracity of its allegations, to be adequate, but at the same time expressed doubts that a positive development in the specific case would have taken place even without its intervention. The Ombudsman has been drawing attention to the lengthy nature of inspection procedures at both national and local level for many years, but unfortunately, despite the Ombudsman's repeated appeals, progress cannot be assessed as satisfactory. In any case, the large number of cases handled by the average inspector cannot be ignored, taking into account the already chronic staff shortage in all inspectorates. This does not, of course, in itself justify the lengthy decision-making process in this case and in many others. <p/> In conclusion, the Ombudsman expressed the expectation that, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate would conclude both inspection proceedings within a reasonable time and that it would inform the petitioner of its findings in a manner that would be appropriate for her, at the latest at the end of the proceedings. The Ombudsman considers the present petition to be well-founded and has found a breach of the principle of good administration.",Legal,train

If we don't eat the right combinations, even healthy foods don't help us. <p/> 1. Don't eat protein and starch together Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and protein in one meal. Do not combine bread, rice and cereals with fish, eggs, meat, milk and dairy products. The body needs an alkaline base to process starch and acids to process protein. This combination causes bloating, abdominal pain, indigestion, etc. <p/> 2. Eat protein only with vegetables <p/> 3. Eat starch only with vegetables Combine starchy foods such as rice, potatoes and pasta only with vegetables. <p/> 4. Fruit Eat fruit 2 hours before, or after a meal. Fruit is so special in every way that you will gain the most from digesting it on its own. It is important that fruit triggers the fermentation process, which in combination with other foods can interfere with other metabolic processes. Be careful with melons. Melons are faster to digest than other fruits, so be careful when mixing fruits together. <p/> 5. Don't mix starch and sugar Cookies can be really hard to resist, but when you mix starch and sugar in your mouth, enzymes are secreted to break down the starch, and the sugar makes your body acidic. Acidity slows down the breakdown of starch and you are trapped in an unsolvable digestive loop. <p/> 6. Do not combine milk with anything Pasteurisation destroys the enzymes that stimulate digestion. Milk starts to coagulate when it reaches the stomach and this slows down the digestion of other foods. Of course, this applies only to cow's milk. <p/> 7. Avoid sugar The problem of sweets is even greater because most of us already have a portion of protein, starch and carbohydrates in our stomachs. All of this further complicates digestion. In this case, we like to say that some food is stuck in our stomach, which is actually true, because the metabolic methods are mutually exclusive. You may have heard somewhere that it would be better to eat desserts half an hour before a meal. The benefit would be twofold: a large part of your metabolism would have been done by the time you had your main meal, and you would be less hungry and eat less. <p/> vkj",Instruction,train

960,"Funeral vehicles <p/> 01/11/2013 <p/> Andrej Godeša Photo and sources.<p/> Some people go to heaven after death, others at least want to go to outer space <p/> People have always believed in an afterlife. In preparation for their final journey, they once prepared a more or less lavish journey depending on their status in society and the extent of their wealth. Often, so many grave goods were accumulated that a means of transport was used for the final journey, especially if the distance to the resting place was somewhat greater. The tradition has survived almost unchanged to the present day. People plan their final journey using a wide variety of means of transport. <p/> Funeral rituals have of course changed over the millennia, but the essence has remained the same. Human remains had to be buried, burned, immersed or otherwise disposed of. Both out of respect for the dead and the belief that the grave is only a way station on the road to eternity, and for purely practical reasons. By removing the corpse, they prevented beasts from coming near the dwellings, and they removed the source of the unpleasant stench of putrefaction and the risk of spreading infectious diseases. As human society evolved, status symbols soon appeared. Even after death, the high-ranking did not want to give them up, as best evidenced by the building of the pyramids. Rulers were escorted to their final resting place in ornate stretchers, chariots or ships. They were stocked with everything necessary for the mighty to live in the next life. In 323 BC, a funeral chariot with the first simple buffers was used to transport the golden sarcophagus containing the remains of Alexander the Great to Alexandria. Handcarts and horse-drawn carts became the main funerary vehicle for the next few millennia. After the invention of cannons in the 13th century and their gradual increase in size, a variation of this transport became the cannon laffete, a wheeled base for carrying cannons, on which the coffins of military leaders and officers were placed. It was only in the 19th century, with the introduction of the steam engine and the building of railways, that the body of the deceased was occasionally carried by train, while carriages continued to rule the short distances. In some large American cities, special subway cars were built for this purpose, but they did not ""catch on"". Perhaps the world's most famous rail journey was in 1865, when a steam train was used to transport US President Abraham Lincoln on his last journey from Washington, where he was assassinated. The body of the great leader who united Americans divided by the Civil War and abolished slavery was transported by a mourning train through several states to Illinois, where he was buried in a tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Closer to us in time and place is the final journey of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, who was transported by train from Ljubljana, where he died in 1980, across much of Yugoslavia to Belgrade, where he is buried in a tomb at Dedinje. With the invention of the electric motor, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, new possibilities emerged for transporting the coffin from the deceased's home or hospital to the mortuary and on to the church, where a farewell service was held, and then on the final journey to the grave. It took almost half a century before motorised hearses became established, before engines became sufficiently powerful and, above all, reliable and quiet. The first mention of motorised hearses dates back to 1907, when a hearse with a built-in electric motor was introduced in Paris. Two years later, a petrol-engined hearse was built in the USA, but it was not until the 1920s that it became widely used. In the first period, especially during the First World War, the same vehicles were used for transporting the wounded and sick as well as for transporting bodies, but almost everywhere the basic purpose of the vehicle was soon separated by the choice of equipment fitted. In some rural areas of the USA, such combination vehicles were still in use in the second half of the last century. Because of the lower frequency of funeral transport, the vehicle was used as an ambulance to transport the wounded, and for the transport of the dead, the vehicle was decorated with curtains and flowers and other decorations before the journey and the vehicle was done. It was not until 1979 that such combinations were banned by US federal law. Most of the vehicles used for funerals are prestigious makes. This way, the deceased gets to ride in a luxury vehicle at least once (if not for life) after death. Maybe they use prestigious vehicles for this purpose more because of the relatives who would be embarrassed if the coffin was driven in a cheap car. In Europe, the most common funeral vehicles today are those based on Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Opel, Ford and, of course, in some places the legendary Rolls Royce or Daimler, while in the USA Cadillac and Lincoln are the leading models, and in Asia Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan. The production of hearse vehicles usually takes place in two phases. First, the chassis with the engine and the front section with the driving compartment are mass-produced in the factory, then the vehicle is finished by specialised coachbuilders who slightly reinforce the chassis and the brakes and equip the vehicle according to the wishes and fantasies of the final customer, the funeral company. Today, most funeral vehicles are made by converting station wagons from standard vehicles. Given the ""light work"" involved, these vehicles can last for decades with regular maintenance, so that specialist companies replace them more out of prestige than out of necessity. A few main styles of funeral vehicle fitting have become established around the world. These are usually the classical approach, which has survived from the carriages, which were richly upholstered with plush and curtains, or the limousine approach, where the vehicles are fitted with as many ornate glass surfaces as possible, which are inserted between the supporting pillars. In some parts of Asia, funeral vehicles try to emulate as closely as possible the classical forms of Buddhist temples, decorated with ornate, often gilded, decoration. More recently, in the desire for individuality and originality, some funeral companies have started to use more unusual combinations of vehicles for their clients' final journeys. In the UK, keen motorcyclists may choose a motorcycle with a sidecar to carry the coffin or the urn with the ashes on the final journey. They have come up with something similar with a tricycle and trailer. For those who are in a particular hurry to get to heaven (or more likely hell), they have produced a ""hot rod"" vehicle across the puddle with the symbolic number ""666"" on the door. In some parts of the world, boats are still used for funerals. At the turn of the 21st century, another wish of science and technology lovers has come true, and at the same time we have a new funeral vehicle - the space rocket. In the spring of 1997, the Pegasus rocket flew, carrying the ashes of 24 people who wanted to be astronauts, at least after death, and who could afford it, on its journey into space. The modified rocket, with lipstick-sized grills, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit for the next five years until it fell back in spring 2002. Among the ""passengers"" were Gene Roddenberry, screenwriter of the science-fiction film series ""Star Trek"", and Timothy Leary, a psychologist and futurist, best known for his ideas on the therapeutic effects of the drug LSD in the early 1960s. The next flight was the first real space funeral. The ""Lunar Prospector"" probe, which carried not only instruments but also a sample of the famous astronomer's ashes, landed on the Moon. Eugene Shoemaker (discoverer of the comet of the same name), the first man to be buried on the Moon, arrived there in the summer of 1999. In the following years, the death rocket flew several more times and has carried the remains of some 660 people into space to date. Among them are several famous people, such as astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto in the 1930s, James Doohan, better known as Scotty in the ""Star Trek"" film series, and Leroy Gordon Cooper, a member of the first US space expedition (Project Mercury) in the early 1960s.",Information/Explanation,train

These licences have to be renewed from time to time, and in March this year, when they wanted them again, Microsoft told them that such a licence was no longer valid for them and sent them the usual commercial contract, which more than doubled the price of the licences. CERN officials disagreed and revived the idea of switching to open source solutions. And the Microsoft Alternatives Project, or MAlt for short, was born. And what is the project all about? In their blog, they write that the aim of the project is to ""regain control of our own data"", and that it will start with the migration of mail services and Skype to open source alternatives, and if all goes to plan, all other services will follow. <p/> Microsoft must of course have reacted to the decision, because CERN is an extremely prestigious institution and therefore a nice reference. It offered a ten-year transition period during which the price of the licences would gradually increase, but the people in charge at CERN rejected the offer, saying that such costs were simply not sustainable. <p/> If the project is successful, the decision will certainly have wider implications. CERN is not the only institution of its kind to face what is known as vendor lock-in, or dependence on a single supplier.

Good quality safety glasses protect your eyes from mechanical and chemical damage, so you should go for nothing but the best when choosing safety glasses (similarly for hearing and head protection). Wondering where to buy the best quality safety glasses? The answer is Trgos in Lesce. We specialise in importing and selling top quality workwear, hearing protection and eye and head protection (hard hats and more). <p/> Safety glasses available in different designs <p/> Before choosing the right safety glasses, you should think carefully about the features you expect. Is it important that the goggles are equipped with solar filters? Are you looking for safety glasses with lenses that do not dew? Perhaps you need chlorofibre safety glasses? Do you wear corrective glasses and are interested in safety glasses that can be worn over traditional glasses? Do the glasses also need to have side protection? We have a range of safety glasses suitable for different circumstances, so finding the ideal glasses to protect your vision while you work won't be difficult. Of course, we can help you choose the really best safety glasses for your specific circumstances, but we're also the right place to go if you're interested in hearing protection at work. <p/> Optimum hearing and head protection <p/> In many jobs, hearing protection and head protection with the help of a safety helmet is also very important. Hearing protection can sometimes be provided with good quality earplugs, but there are also circumstances where full hearing protection requires the use of mufflers. Whatever kind of hearing protection you are interested in, you will find the ideal ear or hearing protection here. Probably even more important than hearing and eye protection are safety helmets. Among other things, we offer a safety helmet with a visor made of golden, dark glass. A visor helmet provides complete protection for the entire head. Thus, a visor helmet is an accessory that protects you from many dangers and is therefore definitely worth buying.",Promotion,train

986,"The Rectors' Conference of the four Slovenian public universities met in Maribor at the weekend for its first meeting since the University of Maribor took over the two-year presidency of the informal association. According to the Rector of the University of Maribor, Zdravko Kačič, the meeting focused, among other things, on the establishment of the e-Nakvis information system. <p/> Regarding the implementation of the system, which is experiencing some technical problems, Kačič said that they expect its quality implementation and smooth operation within six months, in line with a positive user experience. <p/> In addition to Kačič, the rectors - Igor Papič from the University of Ljubljana, Klavdija Kutnar from the University of Primorska and Danilo Zavrtanik from the University of Nova Gorica and his colleagues - also discussed the importance of the functioning of key support activities of universities related to the implementation of integrated career orientation for students, graduates and other target groups. <p/>The competent Ministry of Education, Science and Sport was called upon to ensure continued and continuous funding for the operation of university career centres and centres set up to support teaching, as these activities are a necessary part of regular higher education activities. According to Mr Kačič, these are funded on a project basis and are due to expire this year, so it would be advisable to start with permanent funding. <p/> There was also a discussion on legislation concerning universities, in particular the harmonisation of the law on research and development and the amendment to the law on higher education. The fall of the government was not the best thing for them, as they were on the verge of getting the draft laws through the parliamentary procedure. Kačič therefore hopes that they will not have to start all over again with the arrival of a new government. <p/> Papič also regrets that they are back at the point of two years ago, when the legislation was also practically in place, but after the elections the whole thing fell into the water. With a new minister, they have reached a point where a working group has already handed over a draft law on research to the ministry, but now the resignation of the government is putting the whole thing in doubt again. <p/> The rectors of the two Seaside universities are of a similar opinion. Kutnarjeva would like whoever takes office in the new government to accept the bulk of the law already drafted by the profession and send it for further consideration as soon as possible, while Zavrtanik regrets that they behaved somewhat neuralgically at the end of its coordination, since otherwise, with some pragmatic solutions, the law could perhaps have been in parliamentary procedure today. <p/> The Rectors also took note of a promotional video entitled Slovenia.

Smart, and they also addressed an initiative to the public agency Spirit to include in such films promoting the country in the future a presentation of its development potential, represented by the scientific and research work of universities and institutes.",News,train
987,"info@dc-dlan.si <p/> 0590 80 616 <p/> CONTACT US <p/> What does gender theory teach? <p/> Gender theory is the latest ideology to emerge from the social sciences. <p/> At its core, it denies the existence of two natural identities (male identity and female identity), denies the differences between them and denies the natural attraction between male and female. (Proponents of gender theory argue that heterosexuality is a ""compulsion"" of society that dictates that sexual relations must be between two different sexes and, consequently, procreative). <p/> Gender theory primarily teaches that a person's gender is not determined by his or her genitals, but that the individual decides for him or herself what gender he or she will be. Thus, the ""true sex"" is only that which the individual feels in his or her mind. This realisation has given rise to a wide range of genders that is difficult to match. Not only can an individual change his or her gender, but he or she can also switch between them, invent a new gender or decide to be genderless or asexual. <p/> At the same time, gender theory does not recognise that the relationship between man and woman is unique. It claims that all sexual orientations and practices are the same. Thus, there is no difference between heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality or any other sexual experience or experience. <p/> Why is gender theory an ideology? Gender theory is not a scientific theory because it is completely divorced from the natural sciences. It also does not have a single author, but has been developed piecemeal over more than 60 years. It began to develop in the 1950s (through the Marxist feminist Simone de Beavuor) and then in the 1970s in the USA through the Women's Revolution, which coincided with the sexual revolution. In the 1990s it was radicalised by the feminist Judith Butler (and her followers), who still argues that gender identity is an illusion. According to her, even biological bodies are not a natural given, but shaped by culture, by society. <p/> Why did it all start with feminists? They were convinced that talking about masculinity and femininity and their differences leads to even more stereotypical thinking and to a deepening of masculine and feminine gender schemas, the result of which is the perpetuation of women's subordinate social position. <p/> Gender theory reached its global peak in 1995, when the UN adopted the new term 'gender' at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, thereby signaling that gender would no longer be spoken of as a stable natural given (biological sex) but as a merely unstable and fluid category (social sex) that has no pre-given essence or meaning. Today, gender identity is seen only as a deep inner sense of belonging to a gender that may or may not correspond to one's innate sex. <p/> This policy was launched by the UN 20 years ago and has infiltrated every pore of society: politics, the judiciary, the media, philanthropic and humanitarian organisations, schools and universities, music, art, film and literature. <p/> The various LGBT lobbies and influential NGOs in the main European institutions (ILGA at the European Commission and others) have played a major role in this revolution. <p/> When did the ideology start? <p/> Robert Stoller (1925-1992) of the University of California, Los Angeles, was the first to divide sexual identity into biological sex (sex) and social sex (gender). Humans are therefore defined by two dimensions: biology (chromosomes, hormones, external and internal sex organs, secondary sex characteristics) and the social-psychological expression of gender (sex roles, behaviour, actions, traits). <p/> The distinction between biological and social sex is not in itself false. It becomes ideological when social gender is assigned a dominant role in determining gender identity. <p/> Gender ideology began when theorists isolated biological sex from social sex. This separation made the two categories completely unrelated, without the influence of one on the other. <p/> The truth is that biological and social sex are interdependent, complementary and intimately linked within the developmental process. We cannot imagine a body that does not have a direct influence on the development of psychological sex and that is not reflected in concrete ways in society. From this point of view, social gender is not, under any circumstances, simply determined by society or ""taught"" from the outside. <p/> Science in the 1950s and gender theory <p/> Dr Money, who was a psychologist and sexologist, was developing a new theory of gender around 1970. His idea was based on the premise that a newborn baby is born psychosexually neutral and that by the age of three, it can be assigned either a male or a female sex. So, it is only parents and society that mould children into men and women. The biological component of sex - chromosomes, gonads, hormones, external and internal sex organs - is merely a kind of ""plastic"" that can be either overlooked (chromosomes) or altered at will. <p/> Dr Money, who was head of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, and his colleagues did not see the human being as a whole, whose psyche and physicality develop mutually, from conception onwards. The inextricable link between endocrinology and brain development and their influence on the development of the individual's psyche and behaviour was not a topic they wanted to explore. He preferred to calculate human components in his own way, believing that the psyche would adapt to newly imposed chemical and surgical changes if only education was persistent enough. <p/> A sad combination of circumstances brought a boy of less than two years of age to Moneye's practice, who at eight months was left without a sex organ after an accident. Dr Money, through prior indoctrination of his parents, had raised him as a girl. What has become apparent over the years has had a catastrophic effect on the psychosocial development of this boy and on his entire family. But since no one but the immediate family saw this, Dr Money used this case in books and professional articles as a successful example of the proof that biology is changeable and that nurture plays a key role in the formation of sexual identity. <p/> The growing women's movement in the USA, which had been fighting for decades against the biological basis of gender differences, saw in Money's theory a scientific explanation that the differences between men and women were the result of social expectations that had been shaped by a patriarchal pattern. <p/> Moneyev's theory and the feminist movement have virtually merged into one: man and woman are basically identical, having been born ""neutral"". All the visible differences between them (their gait, posture, tastes, interests, hobbies, the way they dress, speak, feel, relate; children's choice of games and toys, adults' choice of occupation, their roles in society and the family, etc.) are merely a matter of habituation, which can be overcome by a persistent revolutionary movement and through re-education. <p/> That Moneyev's theory does not hold water and that the Decalogue has been falsely presented as scientific was exposed in 1995 by Dr Milton Diamond. Investigative journalist, David Colapinto, wrote a high-profile article on the case in Rolling Stone magazine in 1997 and the world-famous bestseller Bruce, Brenda, David in 2000. The boy who was raised as a girl. <p/>What do scientists say today? <p/> Johns Hopkins Hospital, famous in the 1970s for its state-of-the-art sex theory, took a different course after Moneye's gradual withdrawal. After the arrival of Dr McHugh, an advocate of bringing sanity back into the profession, the Gender Identity Clinic, which had been surgically altering the sex of adult human beings, was closed down as early as 1979. <p/> Last August 2016, Dr McHugh, in collaboration with Dr Mayer, published the largest study in the field of sexuality and gender identity in the scientific journal The New Atlantis. Together, they worked on over 500 studies published from 1950 to the present day. They have taken a hard look at all the factors that have a major impact on the development of a person's sexual orientation and gender identity. They have paid a great deal of attention to mental health and the real difficulties experienced by non-heterosexual people and people who have problems with their sexual identity. <p/> With regard to sexual identity, they simply confirmed the fact that it cannot be independent of biological sex. Among all the studies examined, they found no scientific evidence to confirm that there is a physiological cause that determines a person's feeling of having been born in the wrong body. <p/> Furthermore, they found that adults who have undergone sex reassignment surgery continue to suffer from poor mental health. The scientists also found that so-called social stressors (discrimination, prejudice, stigmatisation) were not the main source of suffering, leading these people to experience fear, anxiety, isolation, alcoholism, drug abuse and suicidality (41%). Above all, they found that these are the ills that stem to the greatest extent from the person himself, from the conflict that he carries within himself. <p/> They also looked critically at attempts at sex reassignment in children. They have observed that a very small number of children who are overwhelmed by the feeling of being trapped in the wrong body when they are growing up will continue to have this opinion of themselves after they have grown up. For this reason, there is no evidence that children who exhibit atypical behaviour during puberty should be encouraged to undergo hormonal and surgical sex reassignment. <p/> Poor psychological health continues to be associated with people who suffer from discomfort in accepting their own bodies, and both doctors are working hard to help these patients in the best possible way. <p/> Gender theory in the school system <p/> Gender theory is already part of the regular curriculum in many countries. In Slovenia, the advocates of gender theory have also ensured that for more than a decade now, Slovenian public schools have also offered programmes called ""against homophobia"", ""against stereotypes"", ""against discrimination"", ""for inclusion of all"", ""for human rights"", etc. They are carried out in our country by various associations such as Amnesty International, the DiH Association, the Peace Institute, Legebitra, the TransAkcija Association, etc. <p/> Through debates, brochures, magazines and games, children are taught that there are several genders, that everyone has the right to determine their own gender and to experiment with their sexual orientation. <p/> Example: a few years ago, Amnesty International published the book Love is Love and disseminated its content in Slovenian primary and secondary schools. I quote a few sentences from the book, which show that it denigrates the traditional family, the role of dad and mum in bringing up children, promotes homosexuality and creates a great deal of confusion about sexual identity. <p/> ""Is the father figure always male?"" (p. 20) <p/> ""Is the mother figure something that is essentially tied to the female gender?"" (p.20) <p/> ""Let us remember that gender is something that we must have the right and the possibility to create ourselves and not according to the dictates of our genitals, which should force a person to be a woman or to be a man!"" (p.26) <p/> ""Being lesbian or gay, bisexual or transgender, intersex is normal and totally cool."" (p.39) <p/> Primary school children read books like ""My name is Damjan"" (about a girl who wants to be a boy), ""And with Tango there are three of us"" (about two penguins who get a daughter named Tango), etc. <p/> Changing the language of legislation <p/> ""Change the words and you will change the way society thinks"", wrote Lenin. Language became the main tool for achieving cultural change. Words like 'family', 'marriage', 'love', 'sex' take on a new, different, polysemous meaning; the words 'natural', 'normal', 'perverse' are removed. In certain countries (e.g. Switzerland, the canton of Bern), words with a more neutral sound have been introduced. <p/> The words ""father and mother"" and ""husband and wife"" are the most affected. They are taking away gender from these terms because they are convinced that society must not produce the herosexual family as the only example of a family. They therefore prefer to choose neutral terms where no one will be discriminated against and where all the symbolism of natural family ties will be erased and consequently irrelevant. <p/> Instead of ""father and mother"": <p/> ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2"" (Spain) <p/> ""genetic donor"" (Quebec Civil Code) <p/> Instead of ""husband and wife"" <p/> ""person 1"" and ""person 2"" (proposal for Slovenia, 2015)",Opinion/Argumentation,train
