2,"Project INNOVAge and the Oreli Institute <p/> The Oreli Institute responded to an invitation from the Development Centre of the Heart of Slovenia, which, in the framework of the INNOVAge project, had the task of bringing external experts in the field of elderly care, telecare, e-health, eco-innovations in housing and houses adapted to the elderly, to a study visit in Helsinki, Finland. 13 European partners are involved in this project, including the Heart of Slovenia Development Centre as the only Slovenian partner. <p/> The main objective of the INNOVage project is to transfer good practices in Europe in the field of active ageing and independent living of older people in their own homes, supported by smart ICT (information and communication technologies). <p/> So, from 10 to 12 June 2013, we visited the activities and the current situation in Finland. We prepared a presentation of our innovative model of helping the elderly in their homes, which we developed in Kamnik. After the successful presentation and after organising networking events and networking with partners and external experts of partners, we held several meetings. We received confirmation that the Slovenian - Kamnik project is innovative, of high quality, grew out of the needs on the ground, supported by expertise and interesting to implement in other settings. <p/> We found it interesting that a lot of experts are developing ICT to a very high level, but we heard little or nothing on the subject of support systems that would enable the concrete use of ICT in practice. At the Oreli Institute we are aware that it is necessary to have not only the tools, but above all the knowledge and infrastructure to use a well-developed tool.",Promotion of Services,train
3,"In November, the month of addiction prevention, members of the Local Action Group for Addiction Prevention will hold a series of expert lectures for parents of primary school children in Celje... <p/> The lectures, which will be organised this month at nine primary schools in the municipality of Celje, are aimed at parents of pupils in grades 6 to 9. The lecture programme is financially supported by the Municipality of Celje. The lectures will focus on the protective factors of education that can help to prevent drug use. Drugs, both licit and illicit, are increasingly being used by children. The lectures will also provide parents with information on what behavioural and physical changes to look out for when they suspect that their child has used drugs. Although the topic is topical, shedding light on effective parenting skills and communicating with children in conflict situations in addition to addiction problems, only 160 parents attended last year's series of lectures in eight primary schools. This time, the organisers hope for a better response. The series of lectures will be delivered by experts in medicine, psychology, social work and criminology.",News/Reporting,train
5,"Miscellaneous <p/> This year, for the 30th time, the Swiss compared all types of new cars on the basis of criteria set out years ago by the Heidelberg Institute for the Environment (IFEU). For the first time, hybrid cars lost first place to natural gas cars. <p/> Three eco-cars, the VW eco-up, the Skoda Citigo and the Seat Mii, took first place <p/> How the table is made The comparisons are always based on the latest scientific findings and the state of the art. Over the last ten years, new findings have continuously influenced the scoring, as the environmental impact of individual emissions has always been reconsidered. CO2 emissions, emissions of fine particulate matter, the burden on humans and the natural environment have become more important in the scoring. CO2 was found to be the main greenhouse gas, and vehicles account for one third of all emissions, which is why its share is so high. Interestingly, there are no electric cars on the list, as the assessors did not obtain reliable data on their characteristics. <p/> The table below shows all the passenger cars, from small to large, that scored the highest in the evaluation. <p/> Noise, toxins and nature In Switzerland, two thirds of people feel overwhelmed by noise, mainly from traffic. The constant noise environment causes stress and ill health, and is also bad for heart patients and cancer sufferers. Measurements have shown that the impact of the noisiest car is as disturbing to people as if ten cars with the lowest noise levels drove past at the same time. The most toxic substances are emitted by a vehicle on a cold start and depend on the type of fuel. They also point out that modern petrol injection engines emit extremely high levels of soot. They measure the impact on nature in terms of NOx emissions. Together with sulphur dioxide, they cause acidification of the soil, overfertilisation of soils and rivers, and are involved in the formation of harmful ozone peaks in summer. <p/> Impact prioritisation in the assessment <p/> Model selection Only vehicles emitting no more than 150 g of CO2 per kilometre, equivalent to 6.5 litres of fuel per 100 km, can be included in the assessment list. The exception is large cars with more than 5 seats, which can reach up to 180 g/km. Not all variants of one model have been considered in the comparison, as the list would be too long, so the more environmentally friendly variants have always been chosen. Niche models or vehicles from manufacturers with a negligible market share were also not considered. <p/> What the measurements showed Last year, the Lexus CT 200h Hybrid, a lower-mid-range vehicle, came first. This year, it was pushed into fourth place by three equivalent vehicles powered by a mix of natural gas and biogas, which is found at all gas stations in Switzerland. The first-placed VW eco up! also scores highly in terms of occupant safety, with the best result in the crash tests. The lack of occupant protection is therefore no longer an excuse to buy a car that is too big for its number. The new Toyota Yaris is out of the top ten due to excessive noise, even though it has an extremely low CO2 emission of only 79 grams per kilometre. <p/> The development of electric cars is moving very slowly. New models appear only sporadically, as customers do not show the necessary enthusiasm. Manufacturers also do not provide scientifically based data that can be used for evaluation. In addition, they find that the factory consumption data is not true and drivers should only charge their electric vehicles with green electricity to make them environmentally attractive, according to the evaluators.",Promotion of a Product,train
7,"JUDGMENT: The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed) (money or substitute items), of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence given. However, the court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather the procedural material and does not relieve the party of the obligation to plead all the facts and to adduce the evidence on which it bases its claims (judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11.5.2006). <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <The costs of the audit shall be borne by the auditee. <p/> SUMMARY: (1) The sums claimed in the application relate to the payment of the insurance premium (SIT 62,155,660.00) and to compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant as a result of the non-payment of the insurance premium (SIT 61,516,094.55 and EUR 1,081,484.50 in tolar equivalent). On 31.5.1996 the parties concluded an insurance contract (the Contract) under Policy No 814552, which was governed by the defendant's 'General Conditions for the Insurance of Animals', the 'Special Conditions for the Insurance of Fish in the Sea' and the addendum to that policy. The latter provided for the escape of fish from the applicant's cages as a result of a wind of the eighth degree of force on the Beaufort scale (gale) as an insured event. On 5 August 1997 the applicant reported the escape of 224 684 perch and sea bass. The Court of First Instance found that a storm had indeed raged between 25 and 27 December 1996, but held that the applicant had not proved that the number of fish allegedly escaped from its farm (from the cages on Platform III) as a result. <p/> (2) The Court of First Instance dismissed all the claims in their entirety. The Court of Second Instance dismissed the applicant's appeal against that judgment and, upholding all its findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirmed it. <p/> (3) The applicant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety by way of revision. In it, he relies on ""all the grounds of review"" referred to in Article 370(2)(1), (2) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A.). The Court of First Instance is asked to uphold the review and to alter the judgment of the Court of First Instance by granting the claims in the action or, in the alternative, to set aside the judgments of the Courts of First Instance and Second Instance and to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> (4) The review was served on the defendant, who did not reply, and on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> (5) The applicant was removed from the court register after all procedural steps in the review proceedings had been completed, with the exception of the issuance of the judicial decision. This act, which is a procedural act of the court, is not affected by the stay of the proceedings on the basis of the law itself (Article 205(1)(3) of the CPC), as the second sentence of Article 207(2) of the CPC is applied mutatis mutandis (thus the Supreme Court's judgment of 19.12.2006 in Case No III Ips 42/2006 as an expression of settled case-law). <p/> The revision is not justified. <p/> (6) The revision criticises the judgment of the court of second instance for a fundamental infringement of the provisions of the procedure referred to in Article 339(2)(14) of the Civil Procedure Code. It considers the infringement to be, in general terms, that the (contested) judgment of the court of second instance ""stated, contrary to the documentary evidence, some findings which contradict itself and which contradict the content of the documents or records of the depositions in the proceedings"". This is reflected, first, in the Court of First Instance's finding that, although the applicant, when reporting the damage on 30.12.1996, stated that 'a certain number of fish had also escaped', this nevertheless did not constitute a notification under policy No 8, but rather a notification of damage to the platform for a quarry on the platform. However, in order to satisfy the alleged ground of review, the judgment under appeal would have to be so defective as to preclude its review. That is not the case. The judgment under appeal is, in that respect (the last paragraph of the second page and the first paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal), capable of being reviewed: it is in agreement with the Court of First Instance, which itself gave full reasons (the last paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal).  <p/> (7) It is also possible to review the judgment under appeal (while the plea in law relied on is not raised) in so far as the auditor criticises it for contradicting the view that the plaintiff was late in declaring the escape of the fish in the light of the Contract and the provision of section 917(1) of the Law on Contractual Relations (LCCR) in force at the time, and the view that it did not forfeit its right to the benefit of the Contract as a result.  147 of the case-file) can be read without difficulty as meaning that the circumstances of the applicant's notification of the insured event - which was unusually (and unlawfully! ) late in the light of the care which the applicant, as a professional fish-farmer, should have been expected to exercise, and in the light of the applicant's established capacity to detect a significant decline in the number of fish (a 53 % escape of the insured population) - were taken into account by the court only in the context of its assessment of the evidence. The applicant did not (contrary to Article 918 of the Civil Code) lose its right to the sum insured by reason of the delay in informing the defendant, but its claims were dismissed on the ground that it had failed to prove the occurrence of the harmful event. <p/> (8) Finally, the judgment under appeal is reviewable even if the alleged illogicality between the assessment of the credibility of the farm workers who testified that the nets were blown down by the storm and the fish swam outside them and the evidentiary assessment that the plaintiff failed to prove the occurrence of the insured event were true. The assessment of the credibility of the workers in question is only part of the assessment of the evidence, which, however, was also assessed by the Court of Appeal on this point, with clear reasons (see the second paragraph of the third page of the reasoning). The substance of that evidential assessment itself, which is disputed by the auditor, on the ground that Platform I was completely destroyed in the storm, making it untenable to conclude that the fish did not escape from the nearby Platform III, is, as a question of fact, outside the scope of the review (Article 370(3) C.C.P.P.) <p/> (9) The substantive legal position of the Courts of Second Instance and First Instance, that the burden of proof of the occurrence of the insured event was on the claimant, is correct. It is not the case, as the Reviser submits, that the courts of second and first instance insisted that the claimant prove the escape of exactly 224 684 fish (see the third paragraph on page three of the judgment of the court of second instance). Their exact number could, in cases such as the present one, be determined (for the purposes of the litigation) by means of Article 216 of the CCP, but under conditions which are not met in the present case. <p/> (10) The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed in the action) (money or substitute goods) of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence adduced. That Article expressly provides that the court may do so if the amount of the sum claimed or of the replacement goods is either not ascertainable without disproportionate difficulty or not ascertainable at all. Neither of these (necessary, not sufficient) conditions is present in the present case. The court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather procedural material and does not relieve a party of the duty to plead all the facts and propose evidence on which it bases its claims (Supreme Court judgment and order, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11 May 2006). Since the procedural material gathered in the present case does not substantiate the assessment that any fish escaped as a result of the storm at all, the discretion of Article 216 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable. The courts of first and second instance were therefore correct in finding against the applicant on the basis of the burden of proof. <p/> (11) In so doing, the Supreme Court has responded to the revisionist submissions, which are of decisive importance. Since the grounds relied on did not prove to be well-founded and since it did not otherwise find that the substantive law had been erroneously applied, it dismissed the revision as unfounded on the basis of Article 378 of the CPC. <p/> (12) The decision on the costs of the review is based on Article 165(1) of the CPC in conjunction with Article 154(1) of the CPC. The applicant is to bear its own costs.",Legal/Regulation,train
9,"Melissa is added to teas and preparations for melancholy, restlessness, migraines and to strengthen the spirit. It also works against the herpes virus on the lips. Brings happy dreams <p/> Melissa (Melissa oficinalis) has been used medicinally for more than two millennia. It has been used to treat heart and stomach problems and has been praised for its beneficial effect on the digestive tract. It was generally believed to stimulate digestion, strengthen the heart, nerves and spirit, banish fear and anxiety and provide happy dreams. <p/> Relieves confusion <p/> Both traditional and rational or scientific medicine now advise the use of lemon balm preparations for melancholy, tension, restlessness and confusion. The action of lemon balm is described as sedative and tranquilising. It has been shown to be particularly soothing in nervous disorders, migraine and nervous heart problems. <p/> Relieves digestion <p/> Melissa tea and other preparations are used to treat digestive disorders such as stomach cramps, constipation and lack of appetite. The tea is prepared as an infusion: two teaspoons of the mixture is poured over a cup of boiling water, covered and strained after ten minutes. Drink several times a day. The best tea is made from fresh leaves, so make the most of the summer time when they are abundant in your home garden. This tea, unlike mint (Metha pipperita), can be drunk continuously over a long period of time without worry, as it does not cause any undesirable effects. <p/> For children, the elderly and pregnant women <p/> It is very healthy and also tasty for children and the elderly. It also helps with vomiting in pregnant women and has a beneficial effect on painful or weak menstruation. <p/> Against herpes <p/> External use of Melissa preparations is recommended for herpes on the lips. Melissa has the power to kill herpes and other types of viruses, inhibit inflammation and destroy microbes. <p/> Tea for the forgetful <p/> If you are constantly forgetting things, I suggest a tea mixture of lemon balm and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to boost your memory: a teaspoon of lemon balm and a teaspoon of rosemary flowers are steeped in half a litre of water, covered and left to steep for ten minutes. The treatment should last for three months - drink the tea three times a day for ten days a month, one cup at a time. <p/> Melissa bath <p/> For a soothing and melancholy bath, make an infusion of two handfuls of lemon balm with a litre of water, cover and leave to steep for fifteen minutes. Strain the infusion and add it to the bath water. / source:herasi /",Promotion of a Product,train

""In vulnerable communities, school facilities also provide access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition programmes and safe spaces where children are protected from violence and abuse. ""<p/> In the affected countries of the Horn of Africa, crucial support to the school system was already provided before the start of the new school year: <p/> In Kenya, many schools were opened in drought-affected areas, including during the holidays, to provide access to nutrition programmes for 1.2 million children.

The most interesting talk, in my opinion, was given by Gustav Martner, Executive Creative Director of CP+B Europe (Crispin Porter + Bogusky Europe) <p/> Mr. Martner lectured about advertising, internet, media, his mom, cable TV, kids, about how the microphone crashes - yes it's true, a couple of times the microphone failed while he was lecturing, but what I liked the most was that he got the audience on his side when he said that the microphone is a bullshit detector (for those who don't count, the microphone stops working when Gustav is loading the microphone).

13,"A lesbian and feminist club in every village Saturday, 14 January 2012 author / ica: IdaH <p/> The enhanced editorial team of Sector Ž will present Vesna Vravnik's new short film A lesbian club in every village, which premiered last December at the Canteen at the Trough. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia will be presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, Legebitra Programme Manager. In the second part, we will talk to Vesna Leskošek about the national survey on violence in the private sphere. <p/> Dear feminists. Welcome to the Sector Ž show on this beautiful winter Saturday, which almost smells like the eighth of March. The strengthened and expanded editorial team of the show will present a new short film by Vesna Vravnik, A Lesbian Club in Every Village. The film premiered last December at the Café at the Trough in Metelkova. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia were presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, head of the youth programme at the Legebitra Information Centre. The report is prepared by Tea Hvala. In the second part, Ida will talk to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> On 10 December 2011, a presentation of the short film and the research, which were produced within the framework of the Legebitra Information Centre, took place at the Canteen at the Trough. Both concern the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia and represent a courageous attempt to expose their - sorry, our - invisibility. <p/> The documentary Lesbian Club in Every Village was made by Vesna Vravnik, a filmmaker and lesbian activist, who said that she struggled to find enough female interviewees who were willing to expose themselves on camera. It was particularly difficult for girls and women living in smaller Slovenian towns, where the fear of being judged and isolated is particularly well-founded - which is not to say that the situation in Ljubljana is ideal. When asked why she titled the film ""A Lesbian Club in Every Village"", Vesna replied as follows: <p/> The high school girls who agreed to participate said that the hardest thing to resist is being judged by those who have the most power over them: their parents and teachers. ""We don't expose ourselves at school,"" said a 16-year-old lesbian from Ptuj, ""because we are afraid for our grades. There are quite a few of us, but we are afraid of the older teachers. ""Another added: ""My class teacher called me into her office and told me to choose another school because I had appeared in the Pride Parade - because 'it doesn't go through with them'"". The perplexing question of why she did not sue the homophobic class teacher and the public school that acquiesced to her threat is urgent, but unfortunately also rhetorical. Why? Because we have to wonder again who even dares to seek legal remedies in a country where even the Constitutional Court is homophobic. <p/> With Team Dresch, the legendary lesbian band from the USA, we can sarcastically conclude that lesbians are again and still underground. Which does not mean, of course, that we will not circle a big YES for equality before the law in the referendum. <p/> We continue with the presentation of the extensive research conducted by the Legebitra Information Centre, which last year prepared an anonymous online questionnaire on the situation of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. Since not much is known about their lives, or ours, they wanted to find out what problems we face, what kind of environment we live in and how (if at all) we shape it. The analysis of the data is not yet complete, so here are just a few excerpts from the presentation at the Canteen at the Trough by Eva Gračanin, Head of Legebitra's Youth Programme. As the concept of ""non-heterosexual women"" is very broad, she first presented the sample of the survey, which included a whole range of gender identities. <p/> The women interviewed were older than those in the film, so it is to be expected that they would have pointed to work, not school, as the most risky environment for coming out. The fact that only 12 of the women came out at work is a testament to the fact that there is a very high chance of losing your job after coming out, or having to ""fire"" yourself because of the pressures. The data on the political participation and social life of LGBT and all other Others was also telling. Eva Gračanin said the following at the presentation: <p/> Perhaps the fear of public exposure and loneliness is easier to understand if we add one more piece of data to the above: only 20% of the women said they felt completely safe in their environment and family circle, and the same percentage of women said their families did not even know about their sexual orientation. More encouraging was the information about trustworthy friends: 60% of the women have such friends. For those women who are not so lucky, we would like to dedicate the song ""Way Out"" by German musician Ellen Allien, and we invite all listeners to listen again in May, when we will focus on a more detailed analysis of Legebitra's survey on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. <p/> In the second part of the programme, we spoke to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> To summarise: Violence against women, which according to the above-mentioned data is a very real reality in our society, is therefore the result of deep-rooted chauvinism and patriarchal structures.

As the snow keeps falling, the consistency of the clearing is all the more difficult.

The ploughing and preventive gritting started in the high altitude areas at 17:00 yesterday and continued throughout the night, but as the snowfall was very intense between 5 and 7 am, when almost 10 cm of additional snow fell, the winter service contractors repeated the ploughing in the morning, explained Rafael Jurečič, Head of the Economic Infrastructure Department. <p/> Further information <p/> Citizens can report unforeseen events or emergency interventions to the concessionaire's hotline (041 671 484) or call the 112 Call Centre. <p/> Thank you to all road users for your patience and cooperation <p/> Due to the exceptional conditions caused by ice, snow, sleet and hail, the winter service is considered to be the most difficult and demanding, and therefore the Municipality of Krško asks for the patience and understanding of road users once again. As always, it is recommended that drivers take their chains and other appropriate equipment with them to avoid possible collisions and congestion, which can further hamper the winter service.",Announcement,train

21,"Posts tagged 'incinerator' <p/> In the autumn 2010 issue of Dupličan, Bogdan Pogačar published the following article, which we reproduce in full: <p/> A directive of the European Union required Member States to issue new permits, or to re-examine and, if necessary, renew existing permits, for all industrial installations that started operating before 30 October 1999 by 30 October 2007. <p/> Slovenia is one of only six countries not to comply with the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and will have to defend itself before the European Court of Justice. It faces a fine of €80 million, which the country will have to pay over the next four years. Given that the inhabitants of the southern part of the municipality of Kamnik (Perovo, Bakovnik, Šmarca, Volčji Potok, Duplica) regularly have legitimate concerns about the quality of the air they breathe, which is part of their everyday lives, such indifference on the part of the State is incomprehensible to me. The fact is that we live in a densely populated area and in close proximity to industrial plants that pollute the air with emissions from their activities. Of course, these are companies that have been operating here for many years and cannot be relocated elsewhere, but everything must be done to reduce emissions into the air. It is not just about the health of the most vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, but also about reducing the value of movable and immovable property in the area. <p/> The most painful thorn in our side is the 'environmentally unfriendly' operation of the Tisa Ltd. wood biomass heating plant, which has been preventing us from enjoying a good quality of life for 13 years.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

26,"In the fashion world, there are supposed to be rules of dress that real fashion enthusiasts do not follow. What is right and what is wrong has recently become even more of a subjective decision for the individual, so it is right that we should also debunk some of the fashion myths that we have blindly followed up until now. Why is this happening? Because fashion history is unfolding in such a way that what was once fashionable, which has become unfashionable, is now ""in"" again. But with an innovative twist. <p/> Rule No.1 - Same shoes and same handbag <p/> Once such an important rule that we held sacred, but nowadays you can safely forget it. Where we used to be on the lookout for shoes that matched our handbag, now we look for shoes that complement, contrast or even just match in a small detail. Give yourself a break and treat yourself to a crazy combination of a neon handbag and floral sandals. <p/> Rule No. 2- Don't mix patterns <p/> Mix them up to no end! If the designers of famous brands and fashion gurus can mix them, then so can you. You can look for inspiration from designers like D&G, Betsey Johnson, Preen and Mary Katrantzou, and many more. If you can't find your own designs on the shelves of the more affordable clothing brands, there are fabulous designer goods available in metro stores where they can make you the garment you want. <p/> Rule No. 3 - The older you get, the more you ""cover up"" <p/> It's like life after 40 is over! The vast majority of women look much better in their 40s than many women in their 20s. And if you have all the attributes of youth, why hide them? If you still have perfect legs at 45, treat yourself to a knee-length skirt and heels. Just make sure you don't overdo it and don't dress in clothes designed for 20-year-olds. Mini-skirts only suit 20-year-old girls anyway. <p/> Rule No 4- Never wear tights or open-toed socks <p/> If you had dared to step out on the street in such an outfit a few years ago, you would have been met with a lot of ridicule and strange looks. But nowadays, many women are wearing this very combination! Take Rihanna or Alexa Chung, who have taken the fashion world by storm with their unique styles. Now it's time to pair your favourite tights with summer open toes and a short skirt. <p/> Rule No. 5 - underwear must never show through your clothes <p/> Remember when we used to hide our bra straps with fervor? Or better still, the whole bra, just so it wouldn't show. And when we came across the sheer material of a beautifully tailored blouse, we were in for a big surprise, precisely because of the visibility of the underwear. Fashionistas don't even remember that myth anymore, let alone follow it! For peace of mind, you can have a sheer white blouse and your favourite coloured bra.

34,"Kurtic finally takes Allegri away <p/> Ljubljana - Massimiliano Allegri paid dearly for Milan's painful defeat against Sassuolo, for whom Slovenian international Jasmin Kurtic also plays. The former Perugia coach was left without a job the day after the defeat. <p/> Massimiliano Allegri announced some time ago that he would retire from the Milan bench at the end of the season. The 3:4 defeat against Sassuolo, after the rossoneri had already led 2:0, meant that his story on the bench of the seven-time European champions had already ended a few months earlier. Domenico Berardi, 19, was fatal for Milan and Allegri, taking Sassuolo fans to heaven even after two passes from Jasmin Kurtic, while Milan supporters wondered how low their favourites could go. <p/> After the new defeat, the red-and-blacks remain in 11th place, just six points above the places leading to the second league and a whopping 30 points behind leaders Juventus. Milan have not been this low for a long time. Who can lead it out of the abyss? For some time now, Clarence Seedorf, who is contracted to Botafogo, has been mentioned as the most serious successor to Allegri, and Filippo Inzaghi, who is gaining his first coaching experience in Milan's youth team, is also among the very serious candidates. Allegri's legacy Milan have played far below the expectations of the fans this season under Allegri's leadership. But the question is who could get more out of Milan's current squad. Valter Birsa, on whom Allegri has shown great confidence, has also scored for the two Serie A victories. Otherwise, Allegri had a mediocre squad, which would have had a hard time in the fight for the top spots. <p/> Allegri came to the world's fashion capital in 2010 and won the title right away.

For brave people, it can mean the start of something new, better, more successful and happier. <p/> For myself, I still claim to be rich. Wealth is family, healthy children and personal health.

Today, hunting is no longer a struggle for human survival, but is primarily about protecting nature and preserving wildlife so that we can preserve both for our descendants. <p/> Many people do not understand our mission, so in our LD Fram we have decided to present part of our activities to the people under the slogan Take care of the birds. <p/> So in 2011, we took part in a fair in the courtyard of the castle in the municipality of Rače - Fram with our presentation. Since we have 51 members, we symbolically made just as many bird feeders, for which wood was donated by farmers from our area. They also thought our idea was original and good. Then, with the help of the carpenters in our LD, we made the bird feeders. We also lit our logo on each one to remind the recipients of our charity. Of course, we didn't forget the bird feed we also asked for. <p/> Our LD has hunting horn players who take care of hunting music, which is part of hunting culture, and it was to them that the honour belonged to play the opening melodies and announce the start of the fair. We decorated our stand appropriately, as befits hunters, with our emblem, and we also provided food and drinks. <p/> The response of the visitors was very positive, as the food and feeders ran out quite quickly. We were also pleased, as we made contact with people and introduced them to our mission, our care for nature and wildlife.",Opinionated News,train

51,"Racist assault <p/> Man charged with attempted murder for alleged self-defence <p/> Almonte, a Dominican, was in the wrong place at the wrong time on 26 March. Shortly before midnight, he was attacked by three shaved heads in the Domžale bar Pri Jurčku. It was allegedly a racist attack. According to the reader's testimony, the young men waited until the stranger was alone and then attacked him from behind. In order to defend himself against the kicks and punches, the attacked man crouched down and then swung a knife at the thugs. He cut two of them and ran away, but then surrendered to the police. <p/> Although this was a reaction in self-defence, the police then only charged the Dominican. Not those who allegedly ""struck first"". Since the end of March, Almonte has been in custody, which has already been extended once, as the court had to hear several witnesses and appoint a medical expert for three people, the Ljubljana District Court explained. The case file, which will be handed over to the prosecutor's office, accuses him of two counts of attempted manslaughter, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. After all the interrogations they have conducted, they believe that the Dominican man came after the Slovenians, not the other way around, and that he used the knife with the intention of killing them. But this is probably not the whole truth. The racist shaved heads allegedly threatened the witnesses of the incident: if they exposed themselves, they would retaliate, the reader wrote. The investigation therefore probably did not cover everyone who saw the incident. Only those who testified in defence of the attackers were exposed. We tried to verify this, but the court refused to grant us access to the file because the case is still pending. <p/> ""I would like to point out that racism exists in this country and is a very serious problem. Intolerance is only escalating - to oppression, hostility, hate speech, physical violence.

61,"DOG - A CREATURE FOR THE LONELY? <p/> Living with an animal is good for the body and soul. Children who are lucky enough to grow up around animals develop more feeling (empathy) for others, the ability to accept the differences between living things, their communication is fuller (it is easier for them to perceive correctly something besides words). They also have fewer allergies and express their emotions more easily. <p/> The above is said in an uiber simple way, in a homey way, a la Nina (jest). But it is an officially recognised fact that. So I did not make it up. <p/> I can tell you from my own experience in therapy with a dog (I don't have many, but I have a few) that children really do sometimes - when they have problems with this - open up more easily to a dog than to a human. Why? Because the dog does not judge. For him you are great when you are sad and when you are happy. It doesn't take your sadness or disappointment as an attack on its personality. So it accepts who you are. And it tries to improve your mood. Even when he is the cause of your disappointment, he doesn't take it out on his own resentment or hurt, but approaches it in a constructive way, trying to make amends in any way he can. It's funny for me to think like that... Funny that a higher evolved being, i.e. a human being, has to learn this extra many times, but a dog is just given it. So, on that point, I say calmly (and I don't mind if someone jumps in the loft about it)... Well, I will say that in some cases, at this point, the dog is more advanced than the human in terms of social skills. In some cases. I just find insensitivity to another's pain an extremely frightening trait. <p/> I have often heard the statement: lonely people have dogs. I always come to two conclusions from this statement, whether it is written or spoken and in what context: <p/> it reflects a person who thinks that he is an extra good soul just because he sometimes gets involved with someone. He does not know that this is not dictated by his character, but by the fact that he is born a social being. There are many ways to be involved with anyone. Roughly in 2 ways: bad or good. If I (magari with the help of animals) had conquered the good, I would know that this statement dilutes by negativity something that does not even need a negative connotation. If you like flowers, you like flowers, if you like animals, you like animals. If you like them, they are not superfluous. Just as simple as that. There is no need for pejorative approaches and words that can only bring pain when a person is belittled and nothing else. To me, that is hypocritical. A lack of understanding of acceptance of other living beings, garnished with the cellophane of (supposedly) trying to understand. A person with feeling for others would not express it that way. He would have benefited from the example of canine companionship. But I am glad he does not. Because it's not the dog's fault. He is not a doormat, he is a living being. <p/> Of course, a dog is a wonderful companion. Among other things because, as I said above, he knows how to coexist. Calm souls show emotions and moods in a relaxed way. We humans are not always and everywhere good at that. When we grow up, we are... well, less uninhibitedly genuine. He is also a wonderful listener and as a rule does not give away secrets. Intermezzo: those who know their animals, or animals in general, well know that they also tell some secrets. Just not, as a rule, in such an extreme way as the currently still famous bullmastiffs. Such expressions are maddeningly rare, because very few animals are so totally nerved - destroyed. I, for example, years ago, denounced my landlord for charging around the flat when I was not at home because of animals. Because I know my animals. In a humiliated confession, he then asked me - how did you know, since I hadn't moved anything? But there is no substitute for human closeness. That goes both ways, of course. No human being can replace a dog's closeness either. And the fact is that the dog as a companion really helps the desperate... because it gets them out, with people! ! ! Not because it replaces them. Because it cheers them up and brings them back to sociability. All this, of course, does not mean that all dog owners are the same. Hello? Are all parents the same? All rugby players? All at the same school? The important thing to say here is that the overly desperate don't snog the dog anyway. Fact. And that like-minded people walking their dogs is no worse than like-minded people playing volleyball.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
62,"Heh, but this kind of statement baffles me... are these compartmentalising people consistent? So dogs are supposed to be lonely according to them. What about for the fish? What about cats? Or chinchillas? What about birds, turtles, horses, etc.? Gosh, I find this really funny. I'll tell you. For all the animals, there are people who know how to see the joy in any daddy. <p/> A puppy is <p/>really such a sweet companion who gets you out and about - whether you're lonely or there are too many Kittens around, you just like to go to peace for a bit. And another thing - there really is something in his eyes that you rarely find in human eyes - loyalty without selfishness, M. <p/> Well, to be fair <p/> (and not in the style of I. Gartner! ), then it has to be said that a lot of people have a dog because they ARE lonely. AND very lonely! There are too many people who are canine asocials and would rather have a dog than a human companion. There are far too many (let's say) grandmothers who don't watch their grandchildren because the children make their pet...um...nervous.....There are far too many people who prefer dogs to children.... There have been heated debates about this on some forums this year.... <p/> In short... THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE who have lost touch with reality and give a dog the love they are incapable of giving to their fellow man. <p/> But that doesn't mean that we are not normal in between.... <p/> Those of us who love dogs, but at the same time know that a dog - however we turn it - is still "" just "" an animal. .... . <p/> MM <p/> Untitled comment <p/> I knew someone who was always greeted happily by a puppy when he came home from work. he said, a little jokingly, that the puppy always made him happy, but his wife never once greeted him so happily at the door, greeting him, d <p/> auntie:) <p/> I disagree. if there's anything a single man is already missing - it's a partner. i.e. a man. but somehow I persist in believing that he's not looking for a dog, heh. because a dog can't replace a man. it can only bring him more life and depth. and that's got nothing to do with this situation. <p/> you want a dog if you like it as a creature. that's how it is when you are a child and when you grow up. the feeling of loneliness is born in the person, not in the surroundings. even married people have it sometimes. <p/> but if some unfortunate soul takes it (the dog) for that reason... the uiber has brought himself around, heh. because in that case the dog is just a means to keep himself so busy that he 'forgets' his feelings. a workaholic would then work more. gulp. self-curation and problem-solving I call it. <p/> for me, the dog has never been a means of making contact. i do just fine without it. <p/> giggles, clots:) <p/> I don't really bother about what is found in a dog and what is found in a person. both are fine with me. the dog comes to me, I like it and therefore I accept the whole package it brings. <p/> for me <p/> animals are part of life, they belong to human life, just like other people do. But it is true that it can be much more tiring to coexist with people than with animals. A human being is a bit half degenerated in our time here and now...., (puneguzitsevsegapachserjessepovsodane... ) and his psyche is fucking him up, of course, the cockroach yes... so it's really healing to socialize with animals <p/> hm, milena:) <p/> to be fair, I assume that many people have said so themselves. what I think about this, I already said in my reply to my aunt... come on, please read it, so I don't write it again. <p/> but if you feel that way about it, from your reasoning... i guess i don't need to point out that it is a labelling and / or she-said-she-said system. so far from real and fair for me. <p/> i have said many times before that i find it disingenuous to devote exclusively to animals or exclusively to humans (and not really in this post yet). and i find the not saving grandmothers with grandchildren you mention from this very title sick (and vice versa as well). it's just that you have to take the time to educate the children about the dog (some are really total antitalents) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to take the time to educate the children about the dog (one is really a total antitalent) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to educate the children about the dog. <p/>people who prefer dogs to children and people who prefer dogs to people are in the same basket. the difference is only in age, but it's the same. <p/> otherwise, this post is about the fact that being a dog guardian is not even close to being lonely after defolt. <p/> I love dogs. I love people. and any way you turn it - man is also ' just ' an animal. if mankind, in its self-importance, discarded all other living beings, it would breathe nothing and could only eat itself. the funny thing is that sometimes it does it without doing that. <p/> giggles, darja:) <p/> but I don't take them literally as a rule (somehow it makes sense to me that there was probably a period of falling in love, hihi). it is true, though, that we humans have this poison in us called self-importance. and then the dog's ability to be happy every time is quite charming. <p/> and you know, I didn't usually meet any guy at the door either, hehehehe... because I don't hear or smell as well as a dog. <p/> duck:) <p/> but the point this time is quite different. the point is that we should respect humans too. um. well, it's really intertwined, yes. if you respect both the animal and the human, then a respectful attitude towards the coexistence of animals and humans is quite automatic. <p/> just this one <p/> we have it too and I can't imagine not having it because it has brought such joy to everybody that it's hard to say. <p/> What I find interesting is a statement my child once made when we asked him how it is that he treats kittens and puppies differently from people, shows them all the love, in short, treats them differently from the way he used to treat people.His answer was ANIMALS HAVE NEVER NEEDED MAN BUT MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN. <p/> Hey Mermaid <p/> Yes, animals are part of life and being with man. Whether they live with you or with a neighbour. In my life I have had the opportunity to observe completely different cultures in relation to fish. Let's say in Greece. The dog strictly belongs out of the house. It is not allowed to sit on the sofa or armchair. Or bring hair and germs from outside to inside. They don't even let it near a small child. And if by chance a little furry thing wandered into the playground, the mums would scream and shout. And if the unfortunate creature had the misfortune to make a lot of noise (especially in the cities), it wasn't too hard for the neighbours to poison the dog (we had a kitten in Athens once, and I don't even know what it did to them). <p/> On the other hand, I observe the English. They are very nice to animals (well, there are extreme exceptions, but I'm speaking generally). In the army and police, dogs get decorations and titles (Sargeant, Lutenant, etc.), and there is not a house in the countryside that doesn't have two dogs. When I asked ""my"" family why they all have two dogs, they said: ""So that the fish don't get lonely... all the time, we are not and can't be with them all the time, so it's nice not to have just one animal but to have a family! ""So it's not that humans need company, but that the dog also needs company. I also meet people from other cultures who find fish ""unclean"". Yes, there are different views. Only those who really know how important fish are respect them. And now, in England, they are considering reintroducing the brown bear and the wolf, which are also native here, but have historically been exterminated. I am very interested to see how this debate ends. <p/> Grandma:) <p/> hmm... i wouldn't talk about how many of them and why they prefer a dog to a child... because i don't know any of them and i don't have one. when i try to empathise... the thing that jumps out at me the most is that it's easier to protect a dog. if you don't trust the world, the upbringing and the influences of others... it's easier to be responsible for a puppy. because you can separate it from the upbringing of a stranger. but anyway, i insist that it's not ok to turn away from people. <p/> I don't like this kind of labelling in general. i know couples who had a dog for a long time but not a child. now they have a child too. and i find it ugly and unnecessary to just compartmentalise. there is no rule what you have to have first. <p/> and I honestly don't see why anyone should be obliged to coach football instead of volleyball, or have 2 children instead of one, or go into parenthood if they don't want to (or as long as they don't want to). to please others? Why? let them live their own ideas and performances... <p/> and why should someone who doesn't want to have children - and a dog - be worse than someone who doesn't want either a child or a dog? but someone who doesn't want to have children and has fish is immaculate in everyone's eyes, or what? <p/> if someone wants to have children, let them have them, yes, in these cases it is the motives that matter. if they don't want to have children, they don't. let others have that freedom of choice, and let us stick to our own. it is a great disservice to the child to impose social pressure on the child. <p/> zuzi:) <p/> hi, it's true that they are part of life. but when it comes to living and being a neighbour, it's both direct and indirect. it's all part of life, but there are significant differences. <p/> let's say. i have a ricky. i chose to live with him, not with all the dogs of all the neighbours. the neighbours don't bother me (even when they are loud, no), but they are not so directly part of my life that i would want to pee their poo out of my garden. luckily the neighbours are so correct that it's clear to them, heh. <p/> and there are differences in societies, yes... for me, the english version is the closest. i find it very real this respect for all beings, to see not only through oneself, but also to them, for them.",Forum,train

Apart from the fact that your father is an alcoholic with all the attendant bad behaviour, both you and your mother are materially dependent on him. They also share a flat. <p/> Given that you are studying and are now 22 years old, you can really count on not being alone in this home for much longer, and probably for some time to come. <p/> Your mother's situation has, of course, worsened with the loss of her job. <p/> The first thing I think is important: that you see your situation as something that is transitory, that will not last forever. You will finish school and you will be able to leave, as my sister did. You will also be able to help your mother in one way or another. <p/>Now it would also not make sense for the mother to just give up, that she will not be able to earn anything more and that she will be totally dependent on the father. <p/> For your present mental distress, it is really urgent that you both seek help. I do not know what part of Slovenia you are in, but today we have groups in all the major towns and cities that could help you in this respect. Individual counselling is also possible. I enclose some addresses. <p/> This is not just about helping to get your father into treatment, but for the relatives of an alcoholic who are in need of help. <p/> And this: you have a boyfriend and you are ashamed to tell him how it is at home. I think it would be a great comfort to you to be able to share your pain with a man who means something to you and who would, of course, also have a proper understanding of it.

79,"Repayment of the third quarter <p/> A press conference was held today, 25 February 2014, at the premises of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MESS) at 16 Masarykova cesta in Ljubljana, where State Secretary Aljuš Pertinač presented the method of securing funds for the payment of salary disproportions to public institutions that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. <p/> According to the State Secretary, the Ministry of Education and Science received many negative reactions to the letter prepared by the Ministry of Finance concerning the provision of funds for the payment of the first instalment, namely that each direct and indirect budget user must provide the necessary funds for the payment of the salary differential due to the elimination of the third quarter of the basic salary disproportionality within its financial plans, since the additional funds needed for the payment of this obligation must not have an impact on the increase in the budget deficit. The MoFRE took the disagreements and professional concerns to the competent authorities in the Ministry of Finance and asked for help in resolving the issue, but ""all they heard was that fiscal consolidation was continuing and that there was no money"". <p/> The State Secretary said that, in view of the fact that the funds for the payment of the obligations under the Supreme Court judgment were not provided for in the 2014 Budget of the Republic of Slovenia, and in view of the aforementioned position of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Finance, the MoEFA, after careful consideration and in full awareness of the gravity of the situation, had decided to transfer the missing funds to the public institutions that would need the Ministry's assistance in securing the funds for the payment of payment of the first instalment of the salary disproportionality compensation. The Ministry's position is that the payment of the liabilities following the judgment should not adversely affect the performance of the core activities of public education and research. <p/> In January this year, the Ministry sent a letter to the indirect budget users under its responsibility stating that each indirect budget user in the field of activity of our Ministry should, as a rule, provide itself with the necessary funds for the payment of the first instalment of the salary difference, within the limits of the institution's available resources from previous years and the resources available for the implementation of the activities in 2014. Exceptionally, if a public institution demonstrates that it is unable to provide the funds to make the first instalment of the salary differential due to the abolition of the third quarter of the basic salary disparities, the Ministry should provide the additional funds. <p/> The Ministry assessed the institutions' applications for funds to pay the third quarter of the salary disproportionality according to uniform criteria, taking into account the estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure or expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013, taking into account the expenditure on the third quarter of the salary disproportionality for the period from 1.10.2010 to 31.7.2011. The Ministry co-finances applications from institutions up to an amount that covers the estimated deficit of expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013. In addition, according to Aljuš Pertinač, the Ministry also took into account the liquidity criterion and examined the balance of cash, bank credits and short-term financial investments as at 31.12.2013 in relation to the amount of the first instalment liability. <p/> For a full explanation of the criteria according to which the MoEFCC assessed the institutions' applications, please watch the video of the press conference below. <p/> Your comment:",News/Reporting,train

82,"The efficient use of condensing heat is influenced by a number of factors, the main ones being the hydraulic integration of the condensing boiler into the heating system and the temperature of the return water from the heating system. <p/> In low energy houses (NEH) and passive houses (PH), the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems are upgraded with solar systems. When designing solar systems, it is important to bear in mind that modern individual components are not a guarantee of good system performance. It is more important that the components are coordinated with each other and optimally integrated into the domestic heating and hot water system. <p/> Today, most houses have a habitable attic, and there is also intensive construction of attic dwellings. However, many loft dwellers dread the summer. It is unbearably hot in their apartments on summer nights. When building a new or adapted attic, you should also ask about the properties of insulation and other materials. This will save not only sleepless nights, but also later expenditure on ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which are not needed if the roof is properly and sufficiently insulated. <p/> The eco-material label is used to describe a product that is characterised by its ability to minimise the impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. In the case of thermal insulation materials, from the point of view of the user, a division between traditional materials and ecological or alternative materials has become established in practice. This division can be partly disputed, since when choosing any insulation material, one must take into account its good qualities, while at the same time taking into account its disadvantages. <p/> Photovoltaic modules, made up of cells connected in series, convert solar energy directly into direct current. The sun's rays fall on the surface of the solar cells and the sun's radiant primary energy is converted into electricity. The transformation is direct, with no intermediate transformation into thermal and mechanical energy. The incident light on the crystal lattice of the selected substance releases an electric charge. In radiation, light quanta - photons - strike the faceplate of the semiconductor and are absorbed. This releases electron pairs, which remain separated due to the internal electric field and thus generate an electric voltage. <p/> The use of geothermal energy (heat from the earth) as a source of energy which, in terms of the quantity of resources, meets the criterion of sustainability, does not increase global radiation due to CO2 emissions when harnessed, and can therefore be considered as a renewable source of energy.",Information/Explanation,train

88,"Coronary heart disease <p/> Share: <p/> Coronary heart disease is a condition that develops when the coronary arteries, the main blood vessels that supply the heart with food and oxygen, become damaged or diseased. Coronary artery disease is most often caused by plaque deposits (plaques), which contain cholesterol. <p/> Plaque on the walls of the arteries narrows the artery and reduces blood flow, which means that the heart receives insufficient oxygen and nutrients. Reduced blood flow can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. When a blood vessel is completely blocked, a heart attack can occur. But this never happens from today to tomorrow. In fact, coronary heart disease is a disease that takes years and decades to develop before it shows its teeth. For a long time, the patient has no symptoms and is not even aware of it, which is why it is so dangerous. Because it develops slowly, the patient is also unaware of the changes in his or her lungs, which he or she most often attributes to ageing. Then, suddenly, he is struck by a heart attack (another name for myocardial infarction). That is why it is important to protect ourselves against coronary heart disease while we have time, while our actions will be most effective. The recipe for this is well known: healthy living or lifestyle changes: a healthier diet with less fat, good quality fats, more fresh vegetables and fruit, lots of smaller meals, chewing food for a long time, more fish and less red meat, but also less alcoholic beverages, no smoking and as much exercise as possible. It's a recipe we all know, but it can be hard to follow. <p/> If the coronary arteries are narrowed, they cannot supply the heart with the blood that gives it oxygen. When the heart is beating strongly, for example during physical activity or if we are under severe stress, this lack of oxygenated blood is particularly dangerous. In the beginning, poor blood flow will not cause any major problems. However, as the plaque builds up and the coronary arteries have less and less flow, the patient will have various health problems. One of the best known is chest pain, a tightness or squeezing, as if someone were squeezing your chest. This pain is usually caused by the physical or mental stress mentioned above. Women typically feel the pain slightly differently from men: as a stabbing and very sharp pain in the abdomen, back or arm. A fairly typical warning sign is shortness of breath. If we walk up some stairs that not long ago we could jump up and down without any problems, but now we are short of breath, we should be alert and tell our doctor. Extreme tiredness, exhaustion, can also be a sign of illness. <p/> When the pain is very severe, do not wait. You should see a doctor immediately. It will be best if such a patient is taken straight to the emergency room. Time is very precious in such cases and timely and correct action can save a life.",Information/Explanation,train
90,"Partition walls <p/> It often happens that when building a new residential building, we overlook a flaw in the construction plan or a wall cannot be built as planned. In such cases, partition walls can be the solution. They are also often used in commercial premises to enclose individual employees and give them a little privacy in their own little ""office"". They are a quick and inexpensive solution. They achieve good acoustic and thermal performance. <p/> Partition walls are constructed with a substructure, which can be wood or metal, on which plasterboard panels are installed. There are a large number of plasterboard suppliers that also offer water-resistant plasterboards. Such panels are used for bathrooms and other wet areas. For better strength, the wall should be covered with one to three layers of plasterboard. Stone wool is inserted into the substructure to provide better insulation. All plumbing and electrical installations can also be installed in the partition walls without being visible from the outside.

93,"In a logistic sense, a ""rare disease"" - e.g. operable childhood epilepsy - is an enormous challenge for the health service of a small country, which has to provide the highest quality treatment in centres that have the experience to do the job - and these can only be developed in settings with sufficient referrals, i.e. abroad. Slovenia is too small for it to be professionally and economically rational to develop specialised teams for all complex diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of childhood epilepsy. The prerequisite of ""at least 25 operations per year"" (and, at the same time, a steady stream of intensive diagnostic treatments) is not achievable in such a small population, and we are therefore urgently dependent on collaborative action in international networks. Of course, if there is no national support for more enterprising ideas and real support for an organisation to disseminate its own knowledge and work for patients in a more grey region. Patients in the region are interested, they come to Slovenia for other opinions and advice. But it has long been the case that in Slovenia, the health policy has never supported the views of the Syrians, not even when it was about the big and world-renowned names (neurosurgery). Today, staffing is barely sufficient to prepare our patients, who are rightly sent abroad for further treatment. The profession has never had the support of management in this either. Where are we if we wanted to offer this to the wider region? <p/> It would be very wrong, in a time of 'austerity' in a time of global financial crisis, to start applying restrictions to those patients who are most vulnerable and in whom it is reasonable to expect a major improvement in health. It would be very wrong for the recently launched public debate (e.g. by Spomenka Hribar, certainly well intentioned) to be based on bad publicity. <p/> The fact that carefully selected children with epilepsy go for treatment to the best foreign centres is, in fact, also proof of the quality of our health care. Nasa's reflections on the theme 'to be or not to be ... an orphan' have also been well received in international circles, particularly in Scandinavia.

After the fall of Gorizia in the Sixth Battle of the Soča on 9 August 1916, Renče found itself in close proximity to the military operations on the Soča Front. The Austro-Hungarian line of defence ran only a few kilometres away from Renče: over St. Mark's Hill above Šempeter, the hills of Vrtojben and Biljen, crossing the Vipava River at Miren and ascending to the Karst past Miren Castle. The Italians wanted to cross the relatively low hills into the Vipava valley.

127,"Why a GTi when there's an XY <p/> Peugeot has offered two special versions of its little 208. Choose the GTi, or the considerably cheaper XY, which, despite its slightly weaker power unit, meets the needs of dynamic drivers. <p/> Nomen est omen, a name is a sign, goes the Latin proverb. Janez Novak is the name of a hard-working Slovene who does not take the right to spend his holidays on a towel by the sea, who is willing to change all his nails for the victory of our basketball players, who is happy with two beers, now and then, he also manages, following the example of ""the rich ones"", to outsmart the state on a levy or squeeze reimbursement from the insurance company for the damage caused to his car by a stranger in the car park in front of his best neighbour. <p/> Not a cliché <p/> With the car code XY, similar clichés might be in the foreground. Ixipsilon it is. But they aren't. The Peugeot 208 XY is actually a very nice refresher, and something of an example that there is still a reserve even in the classic B-segment and that taking buyers between crossovers is not necessarily the right solution, not even for their wallets. The special equipment and extras of the little Peugeot give it a considerable boost on the street. Different front light cues with distinctive white daytime running lights, 17-inch wheels, rear spoiler, chrome inserts including logos, a bold choice of purple for the name... <p/> Parallels with the chunky GTi <p/> Inside, the premium sporty feel is also very much in evidence thanks to the seats, the led lighting and trim, the large screen of the powerful, at times over-complicated infotainment, the dual-zone climate control, the self-dimming mirror, the metal gear lever (a very uncomfortable feeling in weather extremes)... there are plenty of other parallels with the chunkiest of the litter, the GTI. <p/>Both are three-door only, both have wider tracks and a stiffer chassis. And both have unusually positioned gauges for the sake of clarity, so you sit up high, higher than is appropriate for a car inspired by its illustrious predecessors, because, like the GTI, the XY has an ancestor in one of the more civilian versions of the little ripper from 25 years ago. <p/> 156 hp the right choice <p/> So the 208 XY has plenty of sporty driving talent, so despite the diesel option, it's a real sin not to be powered by the (cheaper! ) 1.6 THP engine. Fortunately for the tester, it is. You could say that the powertrain was very lively most of the time, i.e. during normal journeys and during known distances. Good consumption, torque at low revs, good cooperation with the gearbox. When it had to, the car left the figure in the drawer and became a little wrecker, 115 kilowatts at low weight is just not that easy. It didn't shy away from corners either, the chassis and small steering wheel making it easy to handle even close to the limits of physics. It's almost a sin to write, but in a corner it was even more unrelenting than the much sportier RCZ. <p/> A thoroughbred aristocratic underclass yet very talented, this XY. When a GTI pulls up alongside it, there's no end to the embarrassment. Is the extra 40-odd horsepower of the GTI, which is the only real difference between the two cars, even worth almost four grand extra? Indeed, at a discount of just over 16 grand, with all that equipment and power for an iksipsilon, it seems like just the right ""deal.""

For the Diocese of Ljubljana, Bishop Gregory Rozman announced the celebration of nine First Fridays in 1941. Seventy years have now passed since then. That is a long lifetime, but some ninety-year-olds can still remember this inter-war event. The Bishop was concerned about the growing unbelief among the people and he explained the devotion of First Fridays as making reparation to the Heart of Jesus for all offences against God and also against the Church. That year, the war struck with only the first sweep, and the anti-religious spirit had been obviously and secretly at work for a long time. The Bishop called for repentance and respect for God's commandments. Is this call unnecessary today? Let us take a look at two families that call themselves Christian. After all, it does not even matter how many children they have. In the first, the day begins around six o'clock in the morning for the parent, and a little later for the schoolchild. They don't even see each other in the morning. The parents have a quick morning coffee, no time to even cross themselves and they are already on the carriageway. They all have lunch together later in the afternoon, and the aces don't even say goodbye. In the evening, the TV news is on and the schoolboy has a pile of homework for the next school day. It's fast approaching, and because the boy is independent - as he has to be - he takes the time to heat something up in the microwave, have a quick wash and throw his nice, friendly, ""... good night, Mom. ' They go to Mass on Sundays several times and the boy doesn't feel bad at all at the service. But, he thinks, we don't pray much at home, even though Grandma often reminds us about it. They don't even have breakfast together in the second morning, but they pray first before lunch. They also pray together in the evening. On Sundays, they go to Mass in their own way, the parents are the readers of the readings, and the children are the singers and altar servers. The family resolution for the new calendar year is different each time, most often of a charitable nature. Neither the first nor the second family thinks particularly of the First Fridays, but neither of them allows anyone to dishonour any person or any religion. There are many families like this nowadays. If you put their religious life on a human scale, it would probably swing. Nor would a geometric measurement show the same line for the boundary of the spiritual. Let alone in families where there is hardly a whiff of faith left. What about those to whom faith is completely alien. What of those who are opposed to faith. The call to conversion is still needed. Perhaps ever more so. But it is necessary to know how to hear it. Yet, as loud and frequent as it is, it cannot touch ears that do not listen. The condition for a different way through the spiritual world is the willingness not to turn a deaf ear to Christian values and virtues. Faith is chief among them. Bl. It was very dear to Slomšek. He called it the light of faith, faith be your light. How precious light is, however, is best known in the darkness. Do we not find ourselves in darkness even when we cannot help ourselves in difficult circumstances? The smallest bit of faith can make it a little brighter. Trusting in God's mercy and help is that sliver of light. In the mystical vision of St. Faustina Kowalska, Jesus instructed her to pray much for the poor. She was a hidden pray for people she did not know. God would be caught in his own snare if he did not keep his promises. We have no influence on how and when they come true, other than our own perseverance in trust. All things work together for good to those who love God, says the Apostle Paul. Paul says in his Letter to the Romans (Rom 8:28), and adds. We must trust. On Fridays and holy days.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

136,"Nicotine addiction <p/> Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that depends primarily on the absorption and metabolism of nicotine. In addition to sociological factors, our genetic make-up has a particularly important influence, as it can explain more than 50 % of the total risk of nicotine dependence. <p/> Scientists are discovering new genes with smaller effects alongside the well-known genes with large effects, such as CHRNA3, which have contributed significantly to understanding the biological mechanism of addiction. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. Changes also occur in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> More details on nicotine dependence <p/> Add to these facts the link between smoking and heart attack, lung disease and cancers of the tongue, throat and lungs, and you have enough reasons to quit. However, this is often where a major problem arises. The World Health Organisation estimates that less than 5% of people who have tried to quit smoking unaided persist one year after their last cigarette. This is due to nicotine dependence influenced by genetic factors. <p/> Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon that depends, among other things, on nicotine absorption and metabolism. Different people react very differently to the same amount of nicotine, which is determined by genetic factors. They can explain more than 50 of the risks of nicotine dependence. Scientists are discovering new genes to further explain the causes of nicotine dependence, which could go a long way towards solving the problem of addiction. <p/> Understanding the biological mechanism of addiction has made a significant contribution to the search for genes that might influence nicotine dependence.

156,"Beatification of the Drin Martyrs in Sarajevo <p/> 28 September 2011 at 10:11 <p/> On Saturday, 24 September 2011, five Drin Martyrs, religious of the Daughters of Divine Love, were beatified in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the ceremony, presided over by Card. Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was attended by some 18,000 faithful. The faithful from Slovenia also made the pilgrimage to the beatification in 13 buses. Among the five new martyrs are two Slovene women from Dolenjska, Sr M. Krizina Bojanc and Sr M. Antonija Fabjan. <p/> The journey of the Daughters of Divine Love from Pal via Romagna to Goražde took four days and four nights. They arrived in Goražde on the afternoon of 15 December 1941. They were placed on the second floor of the barracks. That same evening, wild and drunken Chetniks broke into their room and tried to kill them. In defence of their human dignity and their promise of chastity, the sisters broke free from the hands of their attackers and jumped out of the window one by one. Meanwhile, the Chetniks broke down in front of the barracks and executed the severely wounded sisters with knives. They were dragged to the river Drina, which carried their bodies away a few days later. S.M. Berchmana stayed in Sjetlina for ten days, where she recovered quite well. Then she was to go to Goražde, to the other sisters, who were already dead. Two Chetniks took her away on a sledge. When he returned, the coachman said that she had arrived safely at her sisters' home. The attendant, however, had a rosary around her neck. It is recorded that she was killed on 23 December 1941. Sisters Jula, Berchmana, Krizina, Antonija and Bernadeta, known as the ""Drin Martyrs"", served God generously and with selfless love, as missionaries in the ""afflicted Bosnia"", especially by helping the poor. They confirmed their fidelity to God by shedding their blood. <p/> Word of their martyrdom spread far and wide. Therefore, on 4 December 1999, Cardinal Vinko Puljić, Archbishop of Vrbas, after having obtained the necessary permission from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, issued a decree to begin the diocesan process for their beatification. The beatification of the Servants of God Sr. M. Jule Ivanišević and the four sisters is not only an official recognition of their martyrdom, but also a high recognition of the spiritual values for which the sisters lived and sacrificed their lives. Jula Ivanišević, Berchmana Leidenix, Krizina Bojanc, Antonija Fabjan and Bernadeta Banja are witnesses to an extraordinary fidelity to God and an active love for the poor. In faith, we rightly hope that their shed blood will be the seed of new Christians who are aware and responsible, and of new spiritual vocations for new times. Martyrs are strong intercessors in every need, especially in the difficult trials and dangers of life. Many have already seen this. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Krizina Bojanc, baptised Jozefa, a nun and martyr, was born on 14 May 1885 in Šmarjeta, Dolenjska. At the age of 36, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo. Full of sisterly love, she was distinguished for her constant prayer, sacrifice and penitential life. During her lifetime she was called ""Sister of Prayer"". She crowned her life in fidelity to Christ when, on 15 December 1941, she gave her life rather than renounce her vows and Christ. Her martyr's blood is clear proof that she loved God more than she loved her own life. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Antonija Fabjan, also baptised Joseph, a nun and a martyr, was born on 23 January 1907 in Mali Lipje in the parish of Žužemberk. At the age of 22, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo and made her vows on 19 March 1932. She was distinguished for her simplicity, sincerity, piety and self-control. Faithful to her religious vocation, she was tortured and killed on 15 December 1941, together with four other sisters. Out of love for Christ, she accepted martyrdom so that ""the life of Jesus might be made manifest in her mortal body"" (cf. 2 Cor 4:11). <p/> Both Slovenian sisters come from the diocese of Novomeč. <p/> The veneration of the Drin martyrs will take place on their death day, 15 December. <p/> The Martyrs are models of fidelity to God, of human and feminine dignity, of active love for their neighbours, and intercessors for new spiritual vocations, especially for women, as well as in the various trials of life.",Information/Explanation,train

169,"As the warmer days arrive, heralding ever shorter clothes, advertisements are coming out from all corners to convince the female world that they are not beautiful if their body is covered in body hair. How many women are touched by this is a story in itself. But no matter which route is taken, there is always a warning not to do it in areas where there is a wound on the skin. <p/> Before we hit the shelves with teeth whitening products in our quest for a shiny, white smile, it's a good idea to think about, or consult a dentist about, which types of tooth staining actually bother us. Whether it is external staining caused by smoking, eating highly pigmented foods such as coffee, tea, red wine, etc., or internal staining, which can be caused by certain medications (e.g. tetracyclines in antibiotics) and ageing. <p/> During the Lent Festival, specifically from 1 to 6 July, a Healthy Smile Workshop will take place at the Art Kamp venue. Participants will be given a free live demonstration of the correct technique for using a toothbrush, and it will be a great opportunity to ask anything you have always wondered about healthy smiles but never had the chance to ask. All participants will receive a Curaprox CS 5460 ultra soft toothbrush and lots of useful information. Visit us in Maribor City Park! When? 1-5 July from 16h to 20h and 6 July from 10h to 13h. <p/> Have you ever been in the company of someone with bad breath? Have you ever suspected yourself of having halitosis? What did you do then? Chewed gum, ate a menthol candy? Rushed to the nearest toilet and immediately brushed your teeth? If we want to get around halitosis, then the various ""fragrance facades"" will not do us much good. We need to find out why. We need to find out where the bad breath is coming from. <p/> The causative agents of gingivitis are the bacteria in soft plaque, whose toxic secretions trigger inflammation after the body's immune response. When we approach the management of gingivitis, our attention is directed towards the causative agent. Logically, if we remove the causative agent, the inflammation will not occur. <p/> As part of the Youth Week, which will take place in Kranj from 10 to 18 May 2013 and brings together many interesting, fun and useful events, a Healthy Smile Workshop will be held on 13 May in the Main Square. During the workshop, participants will be given a free 'live' demonstration of the correct techniques for using a toothbrush and interdental brush. It will also be a great opportunity to ask anything you have always wondered about maintaining a healthy smile, but haven't had the chance to ask. Join us on 13 May between 4 pm and 8 pm at the Main Square in Kranj. <p/> The mouth is a place that most people don't pay attention to in their daily oral hygiene routine.

170,"Overeating in secret <p/> Bulimia - an eating disorder in which a person is preoccupied with the appearance of his or her body and has a fear of becoming fat - which was only defined in 1980, is affecting more and more people. According to statistics, more than five per cent of the population officially suffer from this eating disorder, but in reality many more do. Like anorexia, bulimia affects more women than men, up to eight times more. Unlike anorexia, a person suffering from bulimia can conceal their distress for much longer than an anorexic person, as they tend to have a normal to moderate weight gain. The BMI of anorexics is very low, while that of bulimics ranges from 20 to 25. <p/> Huge amounts of food <p/> A characteristic of bulimia is repeated overeating, which occurs over a very short period of time. During this time, the person eats huge amounts of food, changing all the flavours from sweet, bitter, salty, sour... When he overeats, he feels guilty and induces his own vomiting, often with the help of laxatives and diuretics. Overeating and vomiting are cyclical, recurring several times a week. Most people who suffer from bulimia (75 %) belong to the so-called purgative type, which is characterised by overeating, vomiting and laxative use. The non-purgative type (25 per cent), on the other hand, indulges in fasting and excessive physical activity after binge eating. In bulimia, the person cannot control himself or herself, and therefore cannot choose the appropriate amount and type of food. However, it should be noted that most people who are overweight do not suffer from bulimia.",Information/Explanation,train
171,"Population mobility, which is supposed to bring the Union closer together, could also be a major factor in its disintegration. As the crisis in southern European countries intensifies, their populations are migrating northwards, with increasing numbers of scientists and researchers among them. Although this should be seen as a positive development, Dimitris Katsikas, head of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, believes that this is something that should concern us above all. <p/> Of the €14.7 billion that will be available for Erasmus+ in the 2014-2020 EU budget, at least €238.9 million will be available for sports activities. The focus will be on support for grassroots sport and on tackling cross-border threats to sport. These include doping, match-fixing and violence. Education and training will receive the largest share of Erasmus+ funding (77.5%). <p/> Slovenia will receive €13.65 million of decentralised funding under Erasmus+ in 2014, Education Minister Jernej Pikalo explained in Brussels. The European Commission is already working with EU Member States to prepare for the publication of the 2014 Pre-Bid, which is expected in December and will be very important for us, he stressed. <p/> When the European Commission publishes calls for tenders for funding, it is often not very easy to choose what it actually wants, what it will fund. Any information that can help in preparing a proposal or finding partners is therefore very welcome. Young people who want to get European funding in the fields of education, training, culture can use Eve's electronic online platform to find out about the projects it has already selected. It also provides project promoters' experiences, documents and guidelines, as well as information on organisations looking for partners to collaborate on various European projects. (dk) <p/> The European Cultural Foundation, through the STEP programme, enables promising artists and cultural practitioners to exchange experiences and knowledge in Europe and neighbouring countries. It follows three main principles in supporting projects: empowering people through arts and culture, connecting knowledge resources and linking cultural policy to practice. The call, which is always open, is open to young people up to 35 years old. <p/> 160 young people from 33 countries have taken their seats on the benches of the European Parliament - young people who may not even be 18 today, but who could be among the European Union's decision-makers in the future. As part of the EuroNestScola project, they simulated the work of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. They adopted resolutions on the work of the Eastern Partnership, which links the EU with its neighbours in Eastern Europe. The Euronest Inter-Parliamentary Assembly was established on 3 May 2011 and brings together MEPs and parliamentarians from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. (dk) <p/> Young people looking for scholarship opportunities, European programmes suitable for them, traineeship opportunities can find the information they need in one place. Eurodesk is the European Commission's free information service for young people and those who work with them - youth information officers and leaders, teachers, social workers, in short, everyone who works with young people. Eurodesk has been active in Slovenia since 2001. <p/> Only six EU Member States, not including Slovenia, have a plan to provide young people aged 16-24 with quality employment, further education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education, under the EU's €6 billion youth scheme. Preparations for the implementation of Member States' schemes were the focus of the recent Youth Employment Summit in Paris. <p/> Political parties at national level are not doing enough to attract young people and convince them that it is worth their while to vote in European Parliament elections, according to a study by the League of Young Voters and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA). In 2009, more than 50% of those who voted in the European Parliament elections were aged 55 and over, while the proportion of young voters aged 18-24 was only 29%, meaning that MEPs are mostly representatives of older people and therefore young people are disadvantaged when it comes to representing their interests, according to the study. <p/> EU citizens have the right to work without a work permit in all EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway. The European job portal EURES offers advice for graduates from universities and colleges on the 6 most important steps to take when looking for a job in another EU country, from finding a job vacancy to settling in your new country. For those interested in doing research abroad, information is available on the EURAXESS website - Mobility for scientists. And the European Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee has endorsed a proposal for a directive to help those who decide to work abroad. ""EU citizens have the right to work in other EU Member States on the basis of the European Treaty and European law. Yet they still face discrimination on grounds of nationality,"" says rapporteur Edit Bauer. The proposed Directive, she explains, does not introduce any new or additional requirements for Member States, but only clarification and assistance for those who decide to look for a job abroad. The proposal adopted by the 0dB will be the basis for negotiations with Member States within the EU Council. (dk) <p/> The European Union does not have an official capital, but Brussels is considered its unofficial capital, as it is the seat of two of the EU's three main institutions, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament, which has its seat in Strasbourg, sits mostly in Brussels. The Court of Justice of the European Union, the EU's judicial arm, is based in Luxembourg. <p/> Some time ago, the European Union realised that non-payment of fines for offences committed across the border of the country where the offender resides was widespread and decided to take action. In 2005, it adopted a Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition of financial penalties. Under it, EU countries where a resident of another Member State commits an offence but fails to pay can send the decision to the country where the offender/defaulter resides and that country must recover the fine as if the person had committed the offence at home. A country that receives such a decision from another country can only refuse it if certain conditions exist. For most citizens, the most important thing is that enforcement of the fine is refused if the fine is less than seventy euros.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train

Lean into the carbon plate under your feet, but make sure you don't pinch the windscreen washer button, which is down there. We'll be bounced around a bit, but you can hold on to the roll cage with your hands,"" Nicolas explained to me as we prepared to start our adventure in the cockpit of the works car. <p/> No, it wasn't a flight in a military jet fighter, but the experience was very similar. Two adrenaline-fuelled men (well, at least one of them certainly was), both wearing flame-retardant pyjamas, helmets on their heads, strapped firmly into a clam seat, chatting in the cockpit of a hellishly expensive machine, surrounded by wires, switches, levers, monitors and carbon-fibre components. The hot, bare metal interior is permeated by the intoxicating, almost slightly intoxicating, smell of high-octane propellant. Mhm ... it really does smell like mint tea. How soothing and calming. It should also be prescribed drop by drop in pharmacies to all petrol addicted racing drivers and journalists. <p/> When the cabin door closes, a mad but sadly all too brief adventure begins, which is actually akin to driving a jet fighter. With one difference. That, of course, those of us who have had the opportunity to ride in a jet military aircraft are, after all, outnumbered by those of us who have sat behind the wheel or in the passenger seat of such a vehicle. In Russia, for many years now, it has been possible to take a ride in a MiG, and at the airport in Slovenj Grad it is also possible to buy a ticket for a ride in a south-eastern seagull. <p/> You cannot buy a ride in a Peugeot 307 WRC. For no money. Especially not a drive in a factory car, behind the wheel of which, just a few days ago, former World Rally Champion Marcus Gronholm was still sitting. Well, it's true that it is possible to buy a 307 WRC, or it will be possible next season. But it's also true that you will only be able to get your hands on this car with good connections and if you have at least a few virtuoso drives or if you can boast World Rally Championship-level results beforehand. <p/> Well, then, you are only a modest few hundred thousand euros away from buying such a hand-built racing car. The official figure, according to the men from Peugeot's motorsport department, is between 700 thousand and a million euros. But as one local racing driver said, once you've bought the car, all you need is a bucket and a cloth. At least to clean it every now and then, because you're not going to drive it anyway. Unless you've also bought, for almost the same amount, the spare parts and the big truckload of equipment needed to maintain such a race car. And you need a team of four or five mechanics (read engineers) who are skilled in maintaining, servicing and handling this sophisticated apparatus on four wheels. <p/> Jeep, the Peugeot 307 WRC is no longer just a racing car. It's a top-quality machine for achieving the highest goals. It is a machine for winning rallies in the World Rally Championship. <Let's get back in the car! Having driven a few laps of Peugeot's previous 206 world rally car on this same circuit two years ago, I kind of knew what to expect. Well, at least I had a hunch, unlike Avtomagazin's Dusan and Alyosha, who were about to be baptised by fire. Several years of active participation in the domestic rally championship, and two years as a co-driver before that, had given me the courage to sit in the passenger seat for the three demonstration laps, completely relaxed and smiling ear to ear. To see what a little Frenchman can do behind the wheel of a big Frenchman. Come on, poba, scare me if you can, I thought, because the man doesn't know anyway that I'm no stranger to racing and that I've driven a similar car on this very track. <p/> But my smile and my courage did not last long. Even though I knew that the car allowed everything that was already beyond the limits of what was possible and had nothing to do with the law of gravity and the rest of physics, after the first metres and the turns, I was breathless. No, I wasn't afraid that something would go wrong, because I trusted the driver, the car and the safety of the track. I was more amazed at what the car really could do and how docilely controllable it was in the hands of a true master. You know, when you're behind the wheel yourself, the first thing you want to do is to get the whole car back, because the Peugeot people wouldn't be too impressed if I tipped their toy on the roof. The question is whether, after such a misfortune, they would have let me get behind the wheel of, say, a 308 WRC in 2008. <p/> After half a lap I started to enjoy it again. With one eye on the track in front of us, I was watching to see if the owners had changed any of the corners in two years, and with the other eye I was watching Vouilloso twisting the steering wheel, when to change gear, when to apply the handbrake, how he was pressing on the accelerator, whether he was braking with his left foot or his right foot, and so on. Our two laps were over too quickly, but I was quite happy. It was a pure pleasure to drive, but the fact that we finished meant something completely different. That we were going to change seats. For the next three laps, the little Frenchman goes into the passenger seat, and I cram myself into a seat that is too narrow, the steering wheel too long. To give him back his dear soap. <p/> The journalist colleagues in front of me have already worn out the Michelin racing tyres for the gravel, so Nicolas motions for me to pit. <p/> ""Let's get a fresh set of tyres and refuel,"" he says, and it occurs to me that sometimes it's not a bad idea to be last in line. New tyres! Yes, when I'm racing alone, I hear that word too rarely, unfortunately. Meanwhile, I pull the Peugeot into the red service area and the engineers roll out a set of new tyres from the big service truck, which is resplendent with stars and wreaths indicating the number of World Championship wins. Mhm, just for me. And I'm enjoying every moment. <p/> The vehicle is lifted onto four special pedestals by two cranes and all four wheels are taken off at the same time. The four of them struggle to replace them and all I hear behind the wheel is the shrill beeping of the electric wheel-bolting guns. The head of engineering lifts the bonnet and plugs in a laptop computer, checking that the engine is OK. <p/> And I am still sitting behind the wheel, waiting for the team to do their job. The guys wipe down the windows, scrape the mud, soil and stones that have accumulated around the wheels off the undercarriage and, in the meantime, someone opens the tailgate and uses a pump to pump high-octane, highly flammable, fast-burning, volatile racing petrol into the car's fuel tank. <p/> Mama mia, if only moments like that lasted forever! Can you imagine how soothing such a situation is for the ego of a casual and hobby racer from the sunny side of the Alps? ! Like valerian drops. Sitting in the factory car of a former world champion, with the team around you trying to prepare the car for your drive, while you chat about the car's special features with your co-driver, the guy who stunned the world this year with a great drive and top times in the Rally de Catalunya. Yah, and what good does that do him? He can still just be my co-driver! <p/> Joke aside: Nicolas Vouilloz is a nice man. The multiple world downhill mountain bike champion has a two-year contract with Peugeot. He competes in eight World Championship rallies in last year's 206 WRC under the Peugeot factory team. The world got to know him at this year's Rally de Catalunya, where he finished 10th overall and twice finished second on stages, once just three tenths of a second behind the winner. Talent! The driver of the future? Undoubtedly, as he was also behind multiple World Champion and reigning champion Peter Solberg and this year's champion Sebastjan Loeb. <p/> Nicolas tells me to pull the metal lever on the steering wheel quickly and hard towards me. The car twitches slightly and a big orange R appears on the screen in front of the driver. I move the same lever away from the steering wheel. I pull the lever. Position 1. First gear. Let's go. Slowly to the racetrack. I look at my co-driver, who knows exactly what I'm interested in. <p/> He just nods his head. You can do it! Greeemooooooooo! Gaaaas! Jihaaaaaaa! The cake goes off like a cannon. With two carbon rings on the steering wheel, you shift up and down with just the finger of one hand. It's just like Formula 1, but instead of buttons on the steering wheel, there's a ring. Why? Because you have to turn the steering wheel rapidly as the car slides sideways through corners, and the gearshift button is always close at hand. That way, the steering wheel is always in place in any position. Where you need it. <p/> After the first lap, my co-driver opened the door to a world of heaven by moving the knob on the centre console two laps. He switched the engine electronics programme from the stage position to the post-stage position. The car breathed at the top of its lungs. The loud popping of the electronics of the turbine-powered vehicles was virtually inaudible in the car. Only the electronic hiss and shifting of the turbo gearbox, combined with the waterfalls of rocks loudly blasting the bottom of the car as the wheels spin idle under the sheer force of the power, caress the ears. <p/> The Peugeot soars over rough potholes. And every new gear is rewarded with a jolt to the shin and a new sticking of both occupants deep into the racing seat. By far the most impressive thing about the car is the insanely good chassis. It absorbs potholes you think will rip the wheels off and makes sure that even on long jumps, the car lands unfeelingly on the wheels. Crazy! The brakes are the same, stopping the car at 100 or 130 km/h before a corner as if it were cemented in place, after just a gentle touch of the racing shoe. And that's on gravel. <p/> I can say that I have never driven a more drivable, more beautiful, more docile and predictable car. The 307 WRC is a true special, a car that drives itself. Well, just the wrong way. In fact, it's the only car that really is driven by the driver, not the other way around. Once you get a taste of this machine, you realise that in a ""civilian"" car, the car is still being driven by the driver, who is trying very hard to keep it on the road. <p/> It is a testament to how tame this beast can be that, believe it or not, during our drive, my co-driver, the very saintly Nicolas Vouilloz, also grabbed the safety cage firmly with his right hand on several occasions, and unexpectedly hissed ""ssssssssss"" through his teeth into my intercom, which could only mean that the boy does not like to ride in the passenger seat very much, or that I was unexpectedly fast in certain corners, even for such a master of the steering wheel. Yes, you'll never imagine what a great compliment it is for a racing driver when such a master inadvertently utters, ""Ssssss! "" <p/> And so we're driving home in a 90-horsepower diesel, lazily making our way along the straight highways of France, Germany and Austria to Ljubljana, when my TV colleague Stropnik throws me a bone: ""Dude, what fools we are! We are driving 1300 kilometres there and 1300 kilometres back. We spend two days in the car and a lot of money on fuel and tolls. All to drive three laps there - in the car! Who can understand that? At least if you were there after driving for twelve hours, you could run around for three laps or ride a bicycle, instead of just getting in another car, doing three laps and then skating home for another twelve hours..."" <p/> Hm, actually David is quite right. We are indeed weirdos, but at the same time I know very well that he thinks exactly the same as me.

192,"Comedy was part of the state apparatus and should be interpreted as an important institution of Athenian democracy. It was a joyful assembly, since the citizens were also the audience. Through comedy they celebrated themselves, i.e. the rule of the people. Since it is a joyful assembly, comedy must be defined as political. The people identified with the comic hero who, as a mediocre, triumphs against society and attacks the highest authorities (leading politicians, influencers, priests, gods) in the name of the people. <p/> Ambitious, sensuous, full of striking characters, panoramic descriptions and dramatic plots, Tibetan writer Alai's short story ""The Red Poppy"" opens a window on pre-occupation Tibet. Set in the 1930s, it describes the rise and, at the same time, the decline of a wealthy family of a powerful chieftain, his Chinese wife, his first son and heir, and his second "" idiot "" son, who is also the story's narrator and its unsung hero. <p/> The international symposium took place on 12 November 2010 at the Museum of Žiri, on the very day of the signing of the Treaty of Rappal 90 years ago, which severely affected the lives of many Slovenians. Its legacy was lived by our ancestors and is still being lived today. <p/> Europeans, open this book, step inside it. After a few steps in the darkness, you will see strangers sitting around a fire, come closer, listen: they speak of the fate they have meted out to your shops and the mercenaries who guard them. They may notice you, but they will keep on talking, and not even quietly. <p/> Most people here think of an overpopulated, poor, third-world country when they think of India. The Orientalist view that the Indian subcontinent is overpopulated and poor contains a not very hidden subtext about the cavalier relationship between the two: they are poor because there are too many of them, and they will remain poor as long as there are so many of them. <p/> Since the 13th century, municipal statutes have been the constitution and code of the municipalities along the Adriatic Sea. Today, they are just a symbol of (justified) pride in the past, as the present Slovenian translation of the statutes of the municipality of Isola reflects - 6 November 2010 marks exactly 650 years since the solemn promulgation of the first extant codification of Isola law. <p/> My father died in Auschwitz.

In an era where modern technology is reducing the impact of many forms of media advertising, promotional products are becoming increasingly important for reaching new customers. <p/> Why promotional products are still effective Retailers are increasingly using promotional products to attract new customers because of their usefulness. Television, as an advertising medium, is increasingly under threat with the rise of new TV channels, and it is easy for viewers to skip adverts. In the case of a promotional product, the advertisement cannot be skipped, as it is part of the product and is visible whenever the product is used. <p/> Promotional product manufacturing on the rise Today, promotional product manufacturing is booming because it offers advertisers what many other advertising methods do not, i.e. your message is guaranteed to reach the desired population. Despite the many messages we bombard our potential customers with, advertising with promotional products is effective because many of the messages are internalised. For a message to be internalised by customers, it needs to be repeated many times. A promotional product with its own message is the ideal way to achieve this. <p/> Targeting and measurability Internet advertising makes it easy to reach your target audience and monitor the impact of your advertising campaign. We can do the same with the right promotional product. For example, we print a unique promotional code on the promotional product, which then helps us calculate how much we have recouped our investment. <p/> Promotional products as part of your promotional plan Promotional products will continue to be just one part of your marketing plan, but they play a very important role and should not be overlooked. Promotional products are a great way to make a service tangible and achieve brand awareness through constant messaging. <p/> UK - A 2011 survey by The British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA) showed that marketers much prefer to buy practical promotional products that have been proven to be good and effective in the past. These Top 3 products include pens, notepads and post-it notes, and canvas shopping bags or ECO bags. <p/> When asked how they get the promotional products they want, almost 70 respondents said that the supplier they currently work with is a key source of information. <p/> Despite the fact that more and more money is being spent on marketing, more and more companies want newer and more original ways of promotion to differentiate themselves from the rest. Products made from environmentally friendly materials have become increasingly important in recent years. Eco promotional products not only increase sales and brand awareness, but also communicate what kind of company you are. <p/> Read the full article on the new eco-guidelines that the promotional products industry is following at www.ppiblog.com.",Promotion,train

In 1965 their daughter Katja was born and a year and a half later their son Vanja was born. <p/> He attended primary and music school in Piran, social science grammar school in Koper, and studied comparative literature in Ljubljana. Between 1989 and 1996 he taught classical guitar and musicology at the Music School in Sežana and Komno, and composed incidental music for theatre productions at the Primorska Drama Theatre (The Egg, The Runaway Robot, Vida Grant, The Miraculous Stone, The Little Prince), the Ljubljana City Theatre (Audition, Pahljača), the Cankarjev dom and the Helios Theatre (Brigades of Beauty) and the Glej Theatre (Don Lorenzo). <p/> He started writing as a high school student.

He finally chose his career as a writer in 1996 and has since been teaching guitar on a part-time basis at the Comunità degli Italiani ""Giuseppe Tartini"" di Pirano (Community of Italians ""Giuseppe Tartini"" of Pirano). In 2002 he became a member of the Association of Primorska Literary Writers. In 2003 he obtained the status of a self-employed writer in culture. <p/> He writes for children and adults.

202,"Boris Pahor, writer, fellow-traveller and harsh critic of all three totalitarianisms of the 20th century, visited Kamnik <p/> Kamnik (4.5.2010) - Boris Pahor, writer, academic, Prešeren laureate, Knight of the French Legion of Honour, multiple Nobel Prize nominee, and recent recipient of Austria's highest state decoration, visited Kamnik today, where in front of a packed hall of the Kamnik Parent Library he spoke about his views on Slovenian society in the present and the past, both in his native Slovenia and abroad. His sparkling critical remarks touched everyone, regardless of political or ideological affiliation. In short, despite his 97 years, Boris Pahor is still at the centre of a critical shake-up of our society. <p/> VIDEO: Writer Boris Pahor thanks for the invitation to Kamnik and critically evaluates the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia. <p/> Short biography <p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920, and later witnessed the fascist persecution of the Slovenes, which led him to join the national liberation movement during the Second World War.<p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the Fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920. In 1944, he was arrested and sent to the concentration camps of Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof and Bergen-Belsen, which he survived with resilience and returned to Trieste after receiving treatment in a French sanatorium. After graduating from the University of Padua, he took a job as a teacher at the rebuilt Slovenian school in his hometown. <p/> Outline of his literary work <p/> Boris Pahor is considered one of Europe's best-known Slovenian writers.His works deal with the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps, often touch on the subject of the Slovenian minority in Italy and the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region, and he is also known for his social and political engagement. Among his best-known works are the collection of novellas The City in the Bay and the novels Nomads without an Oasis, Clash with Spring and, above all, Necropolis, which has been translated into several European languages. Boris Pahor's literary works were re-evaluated only after Slovenia's independence, when he was awarded the Prešeren Prize and the Honorary Medal of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia. To this day, however, the writer maintains a critical stance, for example in the controversy over the Italian Day of Remembrance for the post-war killings and the departure of Italians from Istria, accusing Italy of forgetting about fascism, while also criticising Slovenian restraint. <p/> The discussion with the writer Boris Pahor took place under the title ""Witness to the past"" and was moderated by the young writer Mitja Čander. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""The minority should be united in its political speech"" <p/> As a left-wing democrat, the writer Boris Pahor, together with the Catholic writer Alojz Rebula, laid the cultural foundations of the Slovenian minority in Italy after the Second World War. The renewed Slovenian cultural and political life encouraged Pahor to become involved in it by editing magazines such as Zaliv. Throughout, the writer from Trieste maintained a critical distance and view of Slovenian reality, defending his independence of thought, which naturally led him to clashes with the then dominant left-wing component in the Slovenian minority and with the new communist government in Slovenia. Although he himself was politically left-leaning, he never agreed with the position of Slovenians within the Italian left-wing parties, but instead advocated independent political action. <p/> Boris Pahor attracted a very diverse audience. Kamnik has not seen an event in a long time that brought together citizens of such different political and ideological persuasions. <p/> ""The TIGR fighters were the first fighters against fascism"" <p/> Boris Pahor stressed that the members of the TIGR organisation were the first to resist fascism. Their activities were multifaceted, including the collection of arms for a possible anti-Italian uprising in the event of an Italian attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Unlike the Communists, however, they were concerned to ensure that their actions caused as few casualties among the Slovene population as possible. When they killed one Italian in an action and this led to the Italians killing four Slovenes in revenge, they realised that such a struggle was not worthwhile. <p/> Pahor also pointed out that the post-war oblates refused to recognise the TIGR, and only recently has the TIGR been gaining ground again. Now, young people are also joining the organisation and are committed to the cause of slovakia. On the other hand, Pahor has repeatedly warned against the sale of Slovenian land in Primorska to the Italians, which would lead to the re-Italianisation of Primorska. He was also very critical of Ljubljana, or central Slovenia, which showed no great interest in Slovenians abroad. In Pahor's opinion, Slovenian school textbooks also do not sufficiently inform young people about the suffering of the Primorje people under fascism. Pahor is also against defending the struggle against the liberation movement as merely a struggle against communism. <p/> Matej Tonin listened attentively to Boris Pahor's thoughts. <p/> ""Slovenia behaves towards its neighbours like a war loser"" <p/> On the one hand, Boris Pahor also regrets the break-up of Yugoslavia, although he has never been against an independent Slovenian state. Slovenia's problem is that it does not have the same power as the former Yugoslavia, but our country's main problem is that it is too humble in its demands on its neighbours when it comes to asserting its national interests and protecting its national community. ""Slovenia is behaving as if it had lost the war, not won it"", Pahor added. <p/> Several books by Boris Pahor were also available for purchase in the foyer of the hall. <p/> ""The post-war massacre of Home Army soldiers - a morally reprehensible act"" <p/> Pahor took the former regime in the former Yugoslavia by storm with the publication of the booklet ""Edvard Kocbek, a Witness of Our Time"", which he and Alojz Rebula wrote in 1975 on the occasion of Kocbek's 70th birthday. In the accompanying interview, Kocbek spoke for the first time about the post-war massacre of returned Slovene Home Army soldiers, which raised a lot of dust, and Pahor was banned from entering the country by the Yugoslav communist authorities. <p/> For Boris Pahor, he is a victim, a victim no matter which political-ideological pole he comes from. That is why, despite the fact that he was taken to a German camp precisely because of his betrayal of the Home Army, he condemns the post-war killings of Home Army soldiers (around 10 000), because they were killings of unarmed prisoners of war. In this context, Boris Pahor advocated that the killings in the fojba, which in recent years have been exploited by Italian nationalists and even the highest representatives of the Italian state, should be placed in the broader context of events and it should be said that there were even bigger abysses in mainland Slovenia, where the communists after the war threw Slovenians - political opponents - and that the fojba should also be seen in the broader historical context of the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region under fascist Italy since 1918 or, in other words, in the period of the Nazi occupation of the territory of the Littoral region. Italy, unlike Germany, which carried out a consistent denazification, did not carry out a de-Fascistisation. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""Communism was a religion, even though it did not recognise God Stalin, in organising this ""Communist Church"", modelled himself on the institutional structure of the Catholic Church: with a Pope, cardinals, bishops and chaplains - of course, by other names.... There are 15 beasts in every man, and if a man lives in a totalitarian system, every such system acquires certain collaborators and believers who are ready to support it with all their being. This could explain the emergence of various leaders, e.g. in our case the ""udbovtsy"", who blindly trusted the Party and, like true believers, believed in communism, without giving a second thought to not deceiving their neighbours... Josip Broz Tito could be considered a criminal by many criteria, but he also has the merit of having Primorska annexed to Yugoslavia and Slovenia."" <p/> Speaking of the Christian socialist Edvard Kocbek, whom he knew well, he said that communism should be realised in Slovenia, on the Christian-socialist foundations that Kocbek envisioned. But because the Slovenian communists had taken a different path, one that restricted freedom of thought and the individual, the communist model ended as it did in failure - and according to Pahor, communism as it was deserved it. <p/> In Pahor's view, Christians and parties that defend Christian values and the welfare state, like Krek and Kocbek, should also participate in any government. Only this, in Pahor's view, can lead to balanced development. <p/> However, the writer was also critical of Christians because, in his opinion, they put too much emphasis on wealth and appearances. In his opinion, it is difficult to become a good Christian from a Catholic ...",News/Reporting,train

213,"After two Mondays in a row what I promised myself not to get out of my head happened, I had to load too much and too little into my phone, into the target and past it, especially for you, instead of having a good read of the 5200 characters of a meaningful and concise summary, this time, just in case, I am starting to write on Sunday, 30. January at 7:15 pm at the ICSMC Office while an all-day meeting of anarchists is going on in the hall, who have asked me not to publish their photos because violent Nazis are searching for their faces on the web. <p/> The Carnian Outlaws are still retreating from the Cultural Pool after ten years of occupying this monument to the ruined social system of socialism. Behind the latter, Šulc sheds no tears. In a decisive internal document, the municipality of Kranj, and the people with names and surnames in it, judged the Pool to be a building fit for demolition, and this made the job of Gross, the representative of the land-owners, much easier. For the last two years, the Municipality has been RENTING a building built by self-managed labour from a ""generous"" representative of the entitled descendants for a large sum of money. This temporary unhealthy state of affairs has ended, the four-day over-the-top festival ""Dost mamo"" with the subtitle ""Izbruh's Last Pogo in the Swimming Pool"" has been survived by Šulc et al, and the property of the Izbruh Association is being moved to a warehouse, which, with luck, has been borrowed by a comrade. Gregor Kosi of the Bakery and I agree to convene the first meeting of the Pohorje Battalion in Kranj near Brdo and there let ourselves be irradiated by the facts and impressions of the freshly abandoned self-contained scene. In ten years of cultural struggles, at many hundreds of events, no one was killed and no one was wounded. Gregor and I are determined to drive the wedge that the Bakery Industry drove into the bottom of the Pool at the ""Slovenian Cultural Pig"" a few years ago. <p/> Franjo Frančič visited the MKSMC on Monday, bringing three books for our library that are being discarded by public libraries for lack of interest: the first is Dr. Franjo Derganec's memoir ""The Bloody Rose"", the second is Lad Ambrožić Novljan's ""March of the Fourteenth"", and the third is ""Radio Liberation Front"" by Jože Javoršek. Franjo was happy to see a good direction by Katja Peganova for his text. He was returning from Trieste where the premiere took place. He was constantly talking and hitting the nail on the head, describing today's youth as the wormy foundation of the future. He is happy that his daughter listens to Edot Maajko and he went to buy her ""Spomen ploćo"" for her birthday. <p/> On Monday, when I was ""like a sick shit"" (claims my wife Arijana) getting ready to report for four years of soft terrorism and to complete my report to the Youth Office, the top brass of the Likej Association came by, with Tonči Kuzmanić, let's say, at the head. I was unpleasantly surprised because Tonči does not see the unravelling or complication of the current issue of the municipality of Ankara as clear proof that the right and the left are united, because it is about the interests of Capital or the Port of Koper. It seems quite obvious to me that the parliamentary parties are in no hurry to comply with the will of a few thousand citizens, never mind the millions of euros that the Port of Koper brings in. Tonči has been incomprehensibly reticent in his assessment of the matter. His first reaction was that he did not know enough about the matter. <p/> On Tuesday, I met with a lover of tidiness and efficient use of time and space, Simon Kardum, at the Kino Šiška. He was accompanied by his henchman Manček, who some time ago lectured me to be ashamed of myself for putting myself at the head of the Youth Field NGO Foundation at the age of sixty. There will be nothing of Brecljevanie in Šiška, but on 9 March this year, in the cathedral, which is by no means a public cultural trough, there will be a multimedia event ""Feu Marko Brecelj"" with a performance by a second-hand singer-songwriter, video projections and performances by DPZN. The subtitle of the event is ""For the second time, for the first time at Kino Šiška"". The first time I performed there with the Bulldozers was in 1975 at the Golden M. We did a performance called ""Day of Disease"" and we called it ""Ashes and Leukaemia"". <p/> On Wednesday, during the day, we sent out the Doganetta ""Judgement in the name of the people"", and in the evening, Franci Blašković presented an excellent CD ""Kobra je u brajdi"" at the Kabina Gallery, and one with which he is not satisfied: ""Ipak je lepiej travu pušiti nego Gori uši slušati"". On the night of Wednesday to Thursday I had no choice: I plunged myself into slow and mind-numbingly weak reporting for the aforementioned reputable institutions. I smoked French cigarettes exceptionally during this effort. The substantive report for the four-year soft terrorism programme may be of interest to some. It will be published at www.dodogovor.org. <p/> On Thursday morning the MKSMC came to do electrical measurements and came across a sleepless man from Klanec. I immediately called their boss and ""dropped"" Supervisor Vid and Supervisor Samuel on him at ten o'clock. These two young members of ours described and listed in detail the oversights and negligence of his unforgettable contractors, headed by the palm buyer Danjel. That afternoon Dr Vlasta Jalušić gave a lecture on ""History, Politics, Law / Rights: Hegel"" in the MKSMC hall but unfortunately I was unable to attend due to the unavoidable financial part of the report to the Youth Office. It was super fine, I was half out of my mind. And at the end, cinema! Vid spun us the US-Argentine 35 millimeter too crime flick ""Our Father"" (""Padre nuestro""). <p/> On Friday, when I was quite euphoric from nine hours of sleep, Arijana started to sweat and immediately gave me a dramatic ultimatum. The nine formerly thick white envelopes with slips of paper, receipts, lists and now and then even notes, which had been (briefly) waiting in the top left inside pocket of my jacket for eight months to three weeks to be counted and sorted out by me, had to go immediately on the table and into the sunlight and under the magnifying glass. Some of the receipts for the June Friendship Offensive were barely legible with a magnifying glass and a good deal of imagination, and one no longer had a speck of colour on it. At the time of writing, the contents of all the envelopes have been examined three times, the worn envelopes have been replaced with new ones, and things have been tidied up and sorted out in my pocket and in my head. The anarchists left two hours ago, the kitchen is left in order, Teja and Luka have cleaned the floor! Cha, cha, cha, cha. <p/> Vid has just embedded an audio recording of Friday's meeting with the initiative groups organising the concerts on the Dodogovor website archive (Sunday, 30 January 2011 at 23:20). It's not short and it's mostly me speaking. I had so much to say about our twenty years of fighting against the wind and the reasons for the decision to freeze the DPZN co-organisation in February and March. You are welcome to listen! It is better for you if you give it up. Only then don't bring out the insulting, yellow details of my truthful and righteous sub-pedagogical fabrications. We're already at six thousand seven hundred characters, the situation is alarming, my sturdy editor Boris Vasev is looking at his watch, and there's just this: on Saturday twenty of us watched a good Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", Vid was baking popcorn, and Tomi suggested a hip hop concert by the uncontrolled in the last days of February. Who are the Uncontrolled? They are Slovenian citizens without controlled origins: mainly Bosnians, blacks, American women under Triglav. I have long been urging them to come to MKSMC to prepare something, which of course Breclj with his negative karma could not manage! But 23 year old semi-controlled Tommy, the president of the ""KAM"" association, managed to do it. When we are allowed to vote in Koper, he will stand as an independent candidate. Vote for him!

218,"Happy hillbillies at the Philharmonic! <p/> 09 Apr 2012 <p/> There is a lot to learn from all history, including folk-music history. There is only one aspect to this: whether the musician has something to gain from the experience of others, or whether he or she has simply stood still all his or her life. A shining example of how wide one should spread one's wings is the Veseli Hribovci ensemble from Ljubljana. <p/> Veseli hribovci was active for twenty years, led by the academically trained musician Stane Žnuderl, who was usually also the author of the music and lyrics, and who always ensured a high level of performance for those times.The ensemble was extremely popular both in Slovenia and abroad (in the German-speaking area, of course, it was called Die lustigen Bergsteiger), and it also performed in the most important Slovene cultural centres, and it was always in search of the new, the different, the original. Although the Merry Hillmen appeared on the then Radio Ljubljana only in 1959, they had already played two years earlier, but without radio ambitions. The very origins of the ensemble are interesting. They performed the operetta Na planincah naszych (On Our Mountains) at the KUD Vič in Ljubljana, for which the libretto was written by Miha Kunaver and the Veseli hribovci leader Stane Žnuderl wrote the music. When I met him a few times, he always got very angry at such memories, because he could not understand that some radio and television editors, who get their salaries from RTV subscriptions, cannot or will not listen to their listeners. But he also got angry at the idea that there was nothing wrong with local music, it just needed to be brought up to the right level. It was the quality of the music that made the Merry Hills people one of the first to appear on the radio programme Thursday Evening of Local Songs and Hymns, as guests on the first television programmes and on many radio programmes in the field. Back then, it was also the case that the editors of other programmes tried to bring the most popular groups, especially folk-entertainment groups, to the field. Žnuderl was fond of telling anyone who disparaged local music: ""We also performed at the Slovenian Philharmonic, where we - probably one of the few, if not the only ones - played no less than seven polkas and waltzes. And live, in front of the TV cameras. I myself began by whistling the entire first movement of one of my compositions, which created a real enthusiasm among the audience. ""The Merry Mountaineers were among the first to follow the Avseniks across national borders, which were still very closed at that time. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, they always sang in Slovene. On the other hand, they were so inventive that they performed the song dedicated to the town of Kindberg in both languages and gave the notes to the mayor of the town. Although at that time we were still seen by many as part of the underdeveloped Balkans, this approach convinced everyone and opened the way forward. It is no wonder that the Merry Hillmen recorded 78 songs for German-speaking audiences. And thanks to Žnuderl, they were always among those at home who were looking for a new expression. They were probably the first to add zithers to a quintet in one of their songs, Peter Ambrož, a member of the Slovenian Octet, sang with the Veseli hribovci, and they recorded a large vinyl album with the Stari Ljubljančani, legendary singers, including the Lumbar brothers, members of what were probably the most popular radio singers of the time, the Fantje na vasi (Boys in the Village). To put it another way: Stane Žnuderl never slept on the laurels of his first successes, but always tried to add something new and original to the new ones, and the quintet itself was set up in such a way that it was recognisable from afar. The release of each of their new albums was a great event, as was each public performance. On top of that, the Veseli hribovci from Ljubljana were also good-hearted. They donated a sum that was seven times Žnuderl's professor's salary for the construction of their home in Debele Rtič. It means that all the musicians really had a good heart and that their basic mission was not - as in many cases today - just to make sure that they performed as much as possible for the sake of earning money, everything else being of secondary importance.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

On the agenda of the meeting were: the role of Syria in the Middle East, EU-Russian Federation relations, the European perspective of the Western Balkans, intercultural dialogue and Tibet. <p/> THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE ROLE OF SYRIA <p/> The first topic of the Gymnich was a discussion on the situation in the Middle East and the role of Syria. The timing of the discussion on the Middle East peace process and Syria was appropriate given the widespread perception that the Annapolis process is slow or stalled, that there is no change on the ground, that Israel continues to take unilateral measures and that there is a crisis in Gaza. <p/> I briefed colleagues on the assessment and results of my recent visit to the region, where I had the opportunity to exchange views with PR Mubarak of Egypt, MFA Al-Gheit, Arab League GA Moussa, PR Abbas, FM Fayyad, MFA Al-Malki, Israeli PR Peres, FM Olmert, MFA Livni, Netanyahu, Serry and other interlocutors. The talks or assessments of the peace process were dominated by scepticism on the Arab side and moderate optimism on the Palestinian and Israeli sides. <p/> We agreed that a final solution to the BVMP should include Syria. We agreed not to isolate Syria but rather to consider including it. In the past, Syria has taken advantage of our disunity, and we decided to pay more attention to coordinating EU Member States' and EU institutions' contacts with Syria. <p/> We decided that we should not reward ""bad behaviour"" <p/> Solidarity with Lebanon and the Siniora government is needed. <The EU will continue to support the Annapolis process and looks forward to a positive outcome in Moscow. <p/> EU-RUSSIAN FEDERATION <p/> Another important item on the first day of the meeting was the exchange of views on current developments in the Russian Federation and on EU-Russia relations, including in the context of the preparations for the June Summit. The complexity of EU-Russia relations in the political, security and energy fields was underlined. At the same time, the fact that Russia is our largest neighbour and an important strategic partner was highlighted. The June summit is an opportunity to strengthen political dialogue at the highest level and to convey messages to the new Russian leadership. The strategic partnership with Russia needs to be developed as a whole, ensuring EU unanimity and solidarity. Cooperation with Russia also needs to be strengthened in joint ESDP missions and in addressing international issues in the common neighbourhood with a view to ensuring security, peace and security. <p/> We also discussed the negotiating mandate for the new EU-Russia Framework Agreement (PCA). The majority of countries support the early approval of the negotiating mandate and the start of negotiations for a new framework agreement. This means during the Slovenian Presidency. <p/> Lithuania has also expressed its support for the conclusion of a new PCA. Minister Vaitiekunas said at Gymnich that Lithuania will be the first to benefit from a regulated relationship between the EU and the RF. Because of the particular problems they have with the RF, they want to add to the mandate for a new agreement: (1) the issue of the closure of the Druzhba oil pipeline and the Ignalina nuclear power plant (at the end of 2009 Lithuania will thus be fully dependent on the RF) (2) the mention of the disappeared Lithuanian entrepreneur (3) the resolution of the frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood and (4) the guarantee that negotiations can be suspended at any time. They propose that the Secretariat and the EC prepare an analysis on how to boost EU-RF relations. They also advocate relations with the RF at ministerial level. <p/> Incidentally, the UK and French Foreign Ministers Miliband and Kouchner have also written to the Presidency on this issue. In it, they wrote, inter alia, that ""Russia's foreign, security, economic and domestic policies have been a cause for concern in recent years. Perhaps influenced by its new-found value, Russia has questioned the international commitments it made in the 1990s. This has made Russia a more difficult partner. We need to find the right joint response. ... We must underline that we welcome and support President-elect Medvedev's plan to promote the rule of law in Russia. We will certainly judge Russia by its actions, not just its words, and the EU must insist on Russia's compliance with its international commitments on the rule of law and human rights, including those arising from United Nations and Council of Europe documents"". <p/> Ensuring the diversification of energy routes and sources must remain a priority for the EU. The new Framework Agreement should also include a chapter on energy, which is particularly important for the EU in view of the importance of the Russian Federation as an energy supplier. <p/> Realism needs to be brought to relations with Russia. Russia often brings issues into relations with the EU that cause disunity between Member States and increase tensions between them (the issue of frozen conflicts, its attitude towards Kosovo, its opposition to the entry of Ukraine and Georgia into the NATO Membership Action Plan). <p/> The Foreign Ministers underlined the desire to make Russia a trustworthy and transparent partner, which will also be achieved through Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. <p/> The Presidency, together with the Commission, will ensure that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of progress in the negotiations. <p/> WESTERN BALKANS <p/> I am extremely pleased that at Gymnich we have formulated a positive message on the European perspective of the Western Balkans. We have met all the representatives of the Western Balkans, including the Serbian Foreign Minister Jeremić and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Mr Thaci. <p/> A general overview of the situation in the Western Balkans shows that much progress has been made in recent years: greater stability, democratic reforms, economic growth, improved regional cooperation, progress towards the EU through the Stabilisation and Association Process. These achievements now need to be consolidated and built upon, and the Western Balkan countries must work to consistently meet the commitments and conditions within the Stabilisation and Association Process. <p/> Already last December, we agreed in the Council that the Commission would prepare a Communication on the Western Balkans and that we would hold a debate on its content early this year. <p/> Fostering direct contacts between the Western Balkan countries and the EU, especially among the younger generation, is crucial for the internalisation and consolidation of European values by the citizens of the region. This applies in particular to citizens of the former SFRY, who were able to travel freely throughout Europe before 1990. In this context, I would like to highlight the dialogue on visa facilitation that we have already started with Serbia (31 January), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (20 February), Montenegro (21 February) and Albania (7 March). At Saturday's meeting, I and my colleagues called for the early completion of the so-called ""roadmaps"" containing realistic criteria for the introduction of a visa-free regime for the countries of the region. We also discussed the possibility of introducing free visas for the countries of the Western Balkans as part of the roadmaps already mentioned. <p/> We also discussed how to further strengthen regional cooperation and economic development in the Western Balkans, both of which are key to further stabilising the region and bringing it closer to the European Union. In this context, the EC Communication highlights a number of important areas and proposes some new initiatives, e.g. in the field of energy and transport (launch of negotiations on a transport agreement), a new initiative to set up an Investment Fund for the Western Balkans, and an initiative for enhanced cooperation between the Western Balkans region and the EU in the field of civil protection. <p/> The establishment of the Regional Cooperation Council (27 February in Sofia) represents another achievement in the field of regional cooperation and an expression of greater regional ownership. <p/> There is unanimity within the EU that the existence of a strong and active civil society is crucial to accelerate the implementation of political and economic reforms, and to strengthen democracy and promote reconciliation in the Western Balkans region. In this context, we at Gymnich welcomed the establishment of a special fund for the development of civil society, as proposed by the EC in its Communication. <p/> Concretising the European perspective of the Western Balkans <p/> The region is specific and needs special encouragement, especially in those countries where the EU integration process is faced with weak political will or low administrative capacity. The EU therefore needs to act with particular determination and courage in the region. The Slovenian Presidency will work to reaffirm and further concretise the European perspective of the countries of the region. <p/> At the meeting, we underlined that significant progress in the accession negotiations is possible in the current year, provided that Croatia meets the ""benchmarks"" and other conditions contained in the EC's March communication. <p/> Despite its difficulties, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has established a positive example of a multi-ethnic society. It needs further support and affirmation to strengthen internal cohesion. We sincerely hope that Skopje will meet the conditions (""benchmarks"") set out in the Accession Partnership as soon as possible, which, on the basis of a positive assessment in the next EC Annual Report, would allow a date to be set for the start of accession negotiations later in 2008. <p/> Montenegro and Albania have recently made significant progress in fulfilling their obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, which constitutes an important incentive for other countries in the region. In the Brdo Declaration, we called on both countries to accelerate the implementation of the Interim Agreement and to step up efforts to build institutional capacity, public administration and an independent judiciary as a condition for upgrading relations with the EU. <p/> As regards Bosnia and Herzegovina, the implementation of police reform remains a condition for the signing of the SAA, and we underline that BiH's future in the EU is only possible as a united, comprehensive, functional and multi-ethnic state. <p/> Politically and economically, Serbia plays a key role in the region and is currently facing strategic choices about its future. Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are key to Serbia's continued progress towards the EU, and Serbia is well placed to play its role as a regional locomotive in this area. <p/> In line with the conclusions of the December European Council, we reiterated at the Gymnich meeting that it is possible to accelerate Serbia's EU approximation, including the granting of candidate status, but that all this depends above all on the will of the current political leadership and of the future one that will take over the helm of Serbia after the May elections. <p/> We stress that we want to separate the EU perspective from the Kosovo issue, but Serbia must ensure that it does not close its own path to the EU or cut all bridges to the EU by taking actions that may threaten the security of the wider region. Statements and/or actions that threaten the stability of Kosovo are not acceptable. <p/> Once again, we have focused a great deal of attention on Kosovo. We have stressed that Kosovo, like the region as a whole, has a clear EU perspective. The EU will continue to work closely with UN KFOR, OSCE and other international actors to consolidate stability. In this context, I would like to underline my conviction that the full and effective deployment of EULEX and the ICO throughout the territory of Kosovo will be an expression of the success of our commitment to Kosovo's stability and the success of the CFSP as a whole. The maintenance of the UNMIK presence and the full implementation of the mandate under UNSCR 1244 throughout the territory of Kosovo is a key prerequisite for the stabilisation of the situation. In this respect, we consider it of the utmost importance to initiate the EU/EULEX/ICO political dialogue with the Kosovo Serbs. The stability of Kosovo is crucial for the stability of the entire region. <p/> INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE <p/> Intercultural dialogue was the final theme of the Gymnich. The discussion focused on an assessment of the latest developments in Tibet and on the question of attitudes towards Islam, including in the light of the recently released film by Dutch MP Wilders. <p/> Concerning Tibet, we reiterated our concern about the latest developments, condemned the violence and expressed our solidarity with the victims. We called for an end to the violence and expressed our expectation that the Chinese authorities ensure transparency of information and free media access to Tibet. It was stressed that the Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. In this context, we stressed the demand for the preservation of the Tibetan language, culture, religion and traditions. We agreed to pay particular attention to the human rights situation in Tibet. <p/> On the relationship with Islam, the debate was focused on the recent release of a film by Dutch MEP Wilders on Islam. The principle of the right to freedom of expression was stressed, but it was also pointed out that Islam cannot be identified with violence. Most Muslims reject extremism and violence, and the victims of extremism and violence include members of the Islamic faith. Freedom of speech, which is and remains a fundamental value of the EU, must respect the faith and beliefs of others. <p/> Concerns were also expressed, among other things, about the ongoing legal proceedings against the Turkish AK Party and its members. If banned, this would be the first case of a political party winning a democratic election being banned, which would also be contrary to the opinion of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.",Other,train

248,"We women love make-up and we love to go to the chemist for a new eye shadow and spend a fraction of our salary on a new powder. But all that money can be thrown away if we don't use a proper, good quality brush that is designed for the task we are using it for. One look at the wide range of brushes on offer can be confusing for even the most skilled in the art of make-up artistry. So which brushes to choose? <p/> The quality of the brush depends on the quality of the bristles used. Although you might think that natural bristles are the best, this is often not the case. When buying natural brushes, we need to know what kind of hair they are. Often animals are even killed just for their hair. The best brushes are those made from hair that has only been shaved off, preferably the first time. The second clipping still leaves the top of the hair clipped and therefore sharp. Of course, you can also choose synthetic brushes, but these are mainly used for applying foundation and concealer. Artificial bristles harden over time, while natural bristles become softer. <p/> Foundation brush <p/> If you want velvety skin, invest in a good foundation brush. This will cover imperfections better and more accurately and, above all, when applying a liquid foundation, it will smoothly blend with sponges and fingers. <p/> Kabuki <p/> These little brushes are packed with bristles. They are perfect for applying mineral make-up. Make-up applied with these brushes is applied in thicker layers due to the large number of hairs in the brush. <p/> Concealer brush <p/> There are several types of concealer brushes, but they are usually a smaller version of the foundation brush, making it easier to apply concealer precisely to areas around the eyes, pimples and other imperfections. If you apply concealer with a brush, it will last longer than if you apply it with your fingers, as the latter way of applying the concealer mixes with the oil on your fingers. <p/> Fan brush <p/> Fan brushes are used when you want to apply a small amount of foundation - for example, on areas where your skin is oily and shiny. Because of its specific shape, we need to choose a brush that keeps its shape. <p/>Blush Brush <p/>This is a special brush that is used to precisely blend and highlight the cheekbones. It can also be used to sweep away bits of eye shadow that have fallen onto the face during application. The brush must be large enough to cover the entire part of the face to be shaded in one stroke.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

252,"Merkel would agree to minimum wage <p/> Berlin, 21 November (STA) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel today signalled that Germany is on the verge of introducing a minimum wage. Ahead of a crucial negotiating phase in the coalition talks, she stressed that she was ready to compromise and estimated that the Social Democrats (SPD) would not sign the coalition agreement if it did not contain a deal on the introduction of a minimum wage. <p/> According to Merkel, ""a grand coalition is not a politician's heart's desire"". But the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the SPD must respect the will of the electorate, she said. <p/> ""The Social Democrats will not conclude negotiations without a legally defined universal minimum wage,"" Merkel said, according to the French news agency AFP. Her CDU, however, opposed such a move and the Chancellor insists that she and her party "" will try to do everything to prevent job losses "" as a result of this measure. <p/> The CDU believes that the minimum wage should be non-binding and limited to specific industries or regions, while the SPD insists on the introduction of a universal minimum wage of €8.5 per hour. <p/> Otherwise, the issues of dual citizenship and homosexual rights remain among the more contentious sticking points in the negotiations. Merkel insists that a deal is possible. ""We will see in the next few days if we succeed. ""According to the Chancellor, the coalition treaty should stand next Wednesday. <p/> According to the negotiators, there are still more than 100 policy areas open. It has even gone so far that CDU representatives have started mentioning new early elections. <p/> Today, after several meetings in small working groups, the negotiators of the three parties will meet for a seventh round of talks in a large group. They will discuss financial and health policy. They are also expected to touch on integration, with a deal on dual citizenship unlikely to be reached today. <p/> If the negotiations with the SPD are successful, Germany will be led by a grand coalition for the third time since the Second World War. In 2005, negotiations on the formation of a coalition government lasted 65 days. <p/> But even if the negotiations are successful, there is one more hurdle to overcome. According to the SPD's statutes, it is up to all of the party's 470,000 or so members, many of whom are not in favour of a coalition with Merkel, to decide whether to join a coalition.

256,"Mole <p/> Mole <p/> The common or European mole (scientific name Talpa europaea) is a species of insectivore adapted to life underground. It rarely comes to the surface except during dry periods when it goes in search of water. Signs of its presence are moles. <p/> Mole shrews are active both during the day and at night, constantly searching for food. They dig tunnels at different depths. If the tunnel is just below the surface, it starts to throw soil to the surface, creating a mole. The tunnels can be 30 to 50 metres long. When looking for food, it runs through the tunnels for four hours and then rests for the same amount of time. Although the tunnels of different moles may be intertwined, they avoid each other, especially outside mating season. If they do meet, a fierce fight ensues, which can lead to death. Scientists hypothesise that moles also mark their territory by scent-marking the ground from the musk glands located on their abdomens. It is only during mating season that the male seeks out the female. After mating, the male leaves the female to care for the young. <p/> It feeds mainly on earthworms, although it will not give up insects and snails. The mole needs a lot of food and eats half its own weight daily. The greyhound does not have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, but can still detect food and water at long distances. Because it lives underground in the dark, it does not need good eyesight. However, it has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect very faint vibrations. Its muzzle is covered with hairs, which help it to find prey. The mole has more sense organs than any mammal. We know very little about its sense organs. Because they cause damage to meadows and fields, farmers often kill them. <p/> The mating season of moles is very short. The male seeks out the female underground, where they mate. The male then leaves the female and is no longer interested in the fetus. Gestation lasts for one month. Three or four young are born between May and July in a nest for which the female has built a special room. They are naked when they are born, but after 24 days they have grown fur. They can leave the nest after 35 days to find their own territory. <p/> Protection <p/> In Slovenia, moles are protected and deterrents are used to combat them. We have developed an extremely effective and natural deterrent, Celaflor Mole Repellent, in the form of beads with the active ingredient methylnonylon ketone. It is completely harmless to humans and animals. It is important to follow the instructions on the product and to allow the mole to escape from your garden (do not fence the garden on all sides with beads).",Information/Explanation,train

267,"Washington Post: Snowden reportedly caused less harm than initial estimates <p/> National Intelligence Director James Clapper has assessed that former National Security Agency (NSA) contract analyst Edward Snowden has caused less harm to US intelligence officials than initially estimated, according to the Washington Post. <p/> ""We are still assessing the damage, but it seems that he did not take away as much material as we first thought. There were a lot of things he could only look at, but he couldn't get them off the system,"" Clapper estimated on Thursday, speaking to the newspaper. He added that the damage was still extensive. <p/> US intelligence officials initially feared that Snowden had leaked data on the armed forces' command and control communications network. This was not to be the case. <p/> Since last year, Snowden has been making public embarrassing facts about the workings of US intelligence, from mass surveillance of Americans to eavesdropping on allied leaders and even economic espionage. <p/> All these publications have so far caused little embarrassment at the top of President Barack Obama's administration, but the essential damage is that the US is exposed as no better than, for example, China, which is regularly accused of hacking and spying. <p/> The US administration is not afraid of embarrassment, because it has already gone through this with the WikiLeaks releases. Intelligence officials are more concerned about whether Snowden might have taken something that could give other countries useful information about the workings of the military and spies. <p/> Clapper's assessment is probably very premature. The world's media have so far published only about 300 documents, Snowden is believed to have another 1.5 million in his possession, and his journalist friend Glenn Greenwald, through whom the documents are going to the media, promises that the saga will not be over so soon. <p/> There are therefore more than too many documents to continue negotiating Snowden's repatriation from Russia in a way that does not immediately put him behind bars.

273,"Ravne is situated in the rugged landscape of the lower Mežiška Valley, squeezed into a wide basin, flanked by rich forests, with the Uršlja Mountains standing in the background to the south. This is the most populated part of Carinthia, where the town of Ravne already meets neighbouring Prevalje. Today, Ravne is the largest town in Carinthia, the administrative, economic, educational, sporting and cultural centre of the Mežica Valley, and in many respects beyond the borders of Carinthia. The area around Ravenna has been inhabited since antiquity, when a Roman road led through the town. Roman ceramics, mosaic pebbles, bricks and money have been found on the site of an ironworks. Ravne was first mentioned in 1248 as Guttenstein and as a market square in 1317. The basis for its development was the steel industry, which was only able to develop further with the collapse of the steel industry in Črna, Mežice and Prevalje. The steel industry also developed very quickly, and in 1952 it became a town and changed its name from Guštanj to Ravne na Koroškem. The wider Uršlje Gora area with the Roman Spring, Prežihovna, Ivarč Lake and the ski resorts at Ošven and the sports park at Ravne form the backbone of the tourist offer. The focus is on excursion tourism, with an emphasis on the presentation of cultural and historical heritage (the Ironworks Museum, Ravne Manor) and natural attractions (Votla peč, Uršlja gora), the offer of sports and recreational activities in nature (Ivarčko, Ošven, Ravne Sports Park), and rural tourism or the offer of tourist farms.",Information/Explanation,train
274,"First documentary by Natalia Gros <p/> New Partisan Cinema in cooperation with Film Servis presents a new documentary on sport climbing, directed by Jureto Breceljnik, entitled Chalk & Chocolate. The film tells the story of Natalia Gros, one of the best climbers in the world, who takes on one of the most difficult routes in the country: Histerija (8c) in Mišja Peča. About a year ago, she became the fourth woman in the world to climb this difficult route. The camera follows Natalia's story both during the conquest of Histeria and during the competition season (training, competitions, injuries, testing). The filming started in December 2007, when Natalia first set out on the route, and the crew was with her from day one until the day she climbed the route. It shows both the tears and the joy, with the background of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Natalija started her climbing career at the age of 7 and has been one of the world's top climbers for many years. In 2007, she achieved the European title of her career, and became the most successful female sport climber of the season. Now that she has made her first film, she is thinking of swapping the climbing world for Hollywood when her career is over! <p/> The film has already been previewed at the 3rd International Mountaineering Film Festival 2009 at Cankarjev dom, where it received great applause and two awards. The jury awarded the film the Best Climbing Film prize for its concise and effective portrayal of the work, highs and lows of top climber Natalia Gros, and the Audience Award for Natalia's honest confession and perseverance. <p/> The documentary is also a success online. A clip from the Hysteria climbing film was uploaded to www.videoclimb.com, where it was voted the second best climbing clip of 2008 in the world.

Knowing her not only as an atheist but even as a fierce critic of the Church, my wife asked in amazement if her sister had the sacraments. The acquaintance said <p/> Well, I fucked up again. While browsing through the TV programme, I noticed Masquerade, a Slovenian film on Saturday night. I must admit that it was the first I had heard of it, but my beloved immediately told me how I had no idea that it was a cult film by Boštjan Hladnik and that it was probably worth seeing. I hate to say it <p/> For a long time now, polls have shown a growing decline in the reputation of the Slovenian Roman Catholic Church. Not only atheists, but even believers have a negative opinion of it.

I watched the brilliant Austrian film Der Bockerer again last night (for the fifth, sixth time? ? ? ? ).

288,"In April, a group of my colleagues and I were unemployed. We were employed in a private company - d.o.o. Because he could no longer keep up with the work and the salaries, he terminated our contracts of employment. The problem is that to date we have not received our severance pay, and he owes us three or two more recourse payments. Now, when we go to him to ask when we are going to get this money, we always upset him. He says he has no money. But he has suggested that we should file for bankruptcy. We do not think that is necessary. <p/> In my previous company, I resigned regularly. The director did not give me permission to take 5 more days of the old leave, nor to take a pro rata part of the new leave, but she gave me a decision stating that the pro rata part of the leave would be paid out, but that I still had 5 days of the old leave left??? The pro-rata part was 12 days, because I left my job in June 2009. I would like to know what is the basis for calculating the value of these 12 days of leave, or is it my gross salary. Should I also be paid for my old leave, given that she has refused to respond to my written requests? <p/> When my maternity leave ends, I will move from an 8-hour working day to a 4-hour working day with the same employer. When do I need to sign a new contract, how long before I start work? I will take one more period of annual leave before I actually start work. I would like to know whether it is normal to sign a new contract after the end of the leave, so that the leave is still counted as 8 hours of work - I mean in terms of pay - or to sign a new contract already during my maternity leave (in which case, of course, the start date of the 4-hour work period is given with the end of my maternity leave and the leave is counted - again, I mean in terms of pay - as if I had worked 4 hours at that time)? <p/> In this case, is it sufficient to sign an addendum to the employment contract with the employer? Or do I have to arrange anything else with the CZS? <p/> The annex includes how many hours per day/week the worker will work and the period during which the worker will work part-time and that the worker's working hours are from 8am to 12 noon. And during the period of part-time work, the worker is entitled to be paid for the work done according to the actual work commitment. Is this sentence on pay written correctly? There is no mention of transport to work, payment for snacks, time for snacks, recourse. Is it taken for granted that I am entitled to it as you stated in your previous answer or as defined in the employment contract, or does it need to be further defined and specified in the annex? If necessary, please help me with what it should say. <p/> Dear Sir or Madam, I would like to ask for your help or if you could give me your opinion: I am employed part-time by two employers. I have no problems with one employer, but I have a problem with the other employer: I have been working 4 days a week for 5 hours (verbal agreement, nowhere written down, the contract says flexitime and 20 hour week) and have accumulated about 120 hours of extra work by working Fridays and Saturdays (training, work meetings, etc.) and by coordinating various projects. Now his only offer is not to pay me the hours but to extend my contract and make up the hours and leave during the summer holidays, but there are some demands he is making that I cannot agree to and would prefer to have the hours paid. <p/> Leave: I have a few days left on my contract. I have repeatedly asked him verbally if he will give me written permission to take the rest of my leave. He ignored my request. On the day I was supposed to bring him the written request, I fell ill. I emailed him to ask him to approve my use anyway, but after five days I have still not received a reply. I also mentioned to him that I had already been granted leave from another employer before the end of my contract. So I am forced to take sick leave, even though I would prefer to take my own days, as sick leave is only paid for 90. Hours: I want my hours to be paid. I have seen in one of your letters that there is no such thing as overtime, which is paid from 130-150. Since he is ignoring my e-mail, any agreement with him will no longer be possible and I will probably be forced to go to court. <p/>Questions: 1. Can I sue him for unused vacation days, given that I have neither an approval nor an explanation for why he would not approve it nor an agreement to compensate me for unused days? Would he necessarily have to give me at least one of those things? Until when? At the moment, I have only two requests by e-mail and no reply. What happens if you simply take the leave without consent AND if it is less than 5 days before the end of the contract, that is to say, even an extraordinary termination is no longer possible? 2. As regards hours, I have a computerised timesheet for the last time for the month of May, which clearly shows the use of leave and the contribution of hours, so that the hours are demonstrable. I will also request a statement of hours for June. Does he have to pay me the hours at my recalculated hourly rate of pay, or can he just set the price of my hours as he sees fit? His idea once was that my overtime hours were worth €1 per hour. 3. What is the possibility of paying for these hours, given that I am his part-time employee? Is a subcontract the only option? I have the option of being paid through a private institution of which I am a co-founder and where I am employed for the other half. Is it possible to simply do a cooperation agreement? Is this legally sustainable? 4. What options do you think I have in terms of hours and leave? If I am informed correctly, do I have the possibility to file a lawsuit 30 days after the ""event"" or the end of the contract? <p/> I have 28 years of uninterrupted service, I have a level IV school education, I am a miller. I have been employed by my last employer for 5 years and I have received an annual leave decision for 22 working days, 20 days of basic leave, 1 day for professional complexity and 1 day with my last employer, compared to 26 days last year. Have I been deprived of this leave and how much am I entitled to? <p/> I have been offered a part-time job, i.e. 6 hours a day (as a result of the new calls for tenders from the Social Security Agency to subsidise shorter working hours). <p/> On an 8 hour day, my gross salary would be somewhere around €550 plus transport and snacks. Since my employer has opted for 6 hours a day, I am now wondering how I can calculate the drop in salary that comes with working two hours less a day. <p/> So the 8-hour wage is known. What is my possible salary for 6 hours? I have no dependants and I only claim the earnings allowance of less than €8300 per year. Is this calculation simply proportional or are there coefficients for this? <p/> I am also interested in all other contributions. Are there any reductions and which ones? Transport? meal allowances? Pension fund? <p/> I wonder at what age a woman is protected so that the employer cannot dismiss her (so that she is then on the SPIZ)? Can she fire older workers indefinitely to get a younger team? (working in a shop) <p/> And also, my childcare leave expires in 1 month and I am thinking of going back to work for 6 hours a day. I wonder by when I have to decide to do this and if I do, can I change back to 8 hours a day at any time after that (if I can't financially cope, for example). <p/> I am writing to you because I am on notice at work. As my last day of notice is on a Saturday, I have to go to work the following week as my last day is a non-working day and I have to work it. I wonder if this is really the case! ? <p/> Hello, I started my first job on 1.4.2008 and I would like to know whether I am entitled to a pro rata share of the recourse allowance for the first year? I should mention that I had a fixed-term contract for 6 months initially, which I extended for another 6 months from 1.9.2008 and which will expire at the end of this month. So far, my employer has not paid me any recourse. I wonder if I should receive any and how much? Thank you in advance for your reply. Matej <p/> I work in a public institution, I have a permanent job, but I was off work in 2008 - first sick, then maternity leave, so I wonder if I am, and if so, how much recourse I am entitled to for 2008?",Correspondence,train

292,"Lithuania wins, National TV disgraces <p/> The European Junior Basketball Championships concluded yesterday after ten days of competition, with Lithuania winning. After an unfortunate loss to France in the quarter-finals, then to Germany for 5th place, our national team managed to beat Greece yesterday by a huge margin for 7th place. So, out of nine matches, our team won seven and lost two. I am quite satisfied with what the younger members have shown, because they still have a lot of basketball challenges ahead of them, but I am much less satisfied with the coverage of the matches on our national television. <p/> I have to admit that this was the first time I watched the European Junior Basketball Championships, as in previous years I didn't even follow basketball that much, but that changed with the 2010 World Championships. So now I watch our national team whenever I can and I can say that I have never been as disappointed with TV Slovenia's coverage as I was with this year's European Championships. The whole event took place in Slovenia, with matches in Kranjska Gora, Domžale and Ljubljana. The first match was played by the younger members of our national team on Thursday 12 July, when the championship kicked off, against Italy. I did not even know that the matches started on that day, even though I follow TV SLO 1 and 2 quite a lot, because I did not see a single announcement for the championship, as I did, for example, a month ago for the football championship or now for the Olympic Games. It seems that they are much more interested in commercials than in viewers, and the junior championships are obviously less important than the senior championships. But after the Italy game, the news reported: <p/> RTV SLO will broadcast the matches on TV SLO Channel 2 and on the web portal from Monday, when the second round of the competition starts. <p/> Quite interesting, as the competition took place in Slovenia and next year we will be hosting the 2013 European Basketball Championship for Members, also hosted by Slovenia. This deprived me of watching the three games on television, but with the upcoming championships, we could prepare for the best possible coverage in the future. As I mentioned, there was no trailer, and thus no major publicity for the championships, so I missed the first day of the second part of the competition. Fortunately, at least they were posting news about it on their portal, so I caught the end of the second match of the second part. From then on I thought everything would be fine, but it wasn't. I watched the very next match on TV SLO 2 HD and the coverage was so disastrous that I can only wonder what will happen next at the 2013 EP and what will the performance be like then. During the broadcast, the picture was interrupted several times so that only the commentator could be heard, and the footage of the last actions at the beginning and end was played with such a blackout that the whole thing was unwatchable. <p/> After the unfortunate defeat against France, when our national team was still in contention for 5th place, I was already looking for the next broadcast, but I could not find it on the schedule or on any of the channels the next day. There are actually four channels - TV SLO 1, 2 and 3 and the online channel, MMC TV - but none of them had the coverage that many of us who followed the championships missed. The most surprising thing is that after the end of both the 5th place match and the France race (which took place at a time when there could have been coverage on TV SLO 2), there was a clip of the European Football Championship, instead of which there could have been a clip of this match. Fortunately, for the last match for 7th place, they only arranged for a broadcast, which still (for me at least) did not justify the mistakes that they should not have made. <p/>I only hope that for the 2013 European Basketball Championship, coverage will be provided, not only for our team's matches, but also for other matches, because it is nice to see other teams playing as well.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
293,"I am the mother of 21-month-old Rene, a very lively and persistent boy who loves to play football whenever and wherever possible. He is very playful, sociable, smiley, puts even the most serious and sad people in a good mood and captivates everyone who sees the sparkle in his eyes. Rene was born with a congenital deformity of the right leg called fibular hemimelia - a lack of the fibula bone that holds the foot and knee in the correct position. I found out about the deformity when I was pregnant, as I was regularly monitored in Ljubljana due to the loss of two children in previous pregnancies. Given the bad experiences I had had before, I was prepared for the worst-case scenarios, which fortunately did not materialise and Rene is otherwise perfectly healthy and without any other problems. At the moment we are solving the height difference with the help of adapted shoes and orthosis, which are regularly custom-made at the URI Soča in LJ, but this has become increasingly difficult since sometime in the new year, as the leg has become quite bent in the foot and knee due to the increased load. The doctor expects that walking with such a leg will soon be impossible and that Rene will end up in a wheelchair, and advises early surgical treatment. At the Orthopaedic Clinic in Ljubljana, where we have been treated since birth, they suggested amputation of the leg as the only possible solution. I got myself active online and on FB and got in touch with Dr Dror Paley, a doctor from the USA who has his own clinic in Florida. He has been dealing with fibular haemimelia for 30 years and has successfully operated on more than 200 such children. We visited him at the beginning of April and he promised us a full recovery. It takes 3 operations, which are recommended to be done at the age of 2 years, which together with rehabilitation and surgery to remove the fixator cost 180.000. There is a possibility of an operation in Milan and a follow-up in Florida, which would bring the total amount down a little. The date he proposed us is 20.6.2014. As Dr. Paley is only in Italy 1 x a year, we decided to try in every possible way to raise the necessary funds and catch the opportunity. I immediately submitted an application to the Health Insurance Fund, but the process is quite lengthy and, according to the experience of parents with similar problems, most of the time only partially approved, if at all.

307,"Elvis Kudič, athlete (09 / 2013) <p/> When I first came to the Althea Centre, I was immediately taken care of. It all started with tap dancing, and then Nena and I talked about what I was training. I said athletics and that I was very scared of competitions, but Nena suggested mental training. After the first session I felt different, I have been doing it for a year now and the progress is very good (from 1 to 10 it's a 10! ). I am relaxed, confident, I have a goal in mind. Of course, there are still a lot of things to improve. I feel great in Althea. <p/> Kristina Novak, tennis player, 13 years old (09 / 2013) <p/> Filip Zupančič, tennis player (08 / 2012) <p/> I've had a lot of mental training, but none has been as reliable as the IMT® mental training at Althea®. During the training you relax (sometimes you almost fall asleep, although you are still fully concentrated) and when you wake up again you are full of energy. Nena and I have been working together for a little less than a year now and the results are obvious. I feel great even in the face of injuries, and I perform very confidently in tournaments. The exercises we do are reliable, they help me a lot. From my side that would be everything, I really recommend you if you have / will have any possible problem to come to Althea® and feel this great atmosphere. Filip <p/> Blaž Kavčič, top tennis player (07 / 2012) <p/> I first came into contact with the Althea® Health and Harmony Centre a little over two years ago when I had to put my best friend (tennis racket) in a corner because of a tear in the back of my leg. I was in great mental distress as no therapy was helping and I didn't know what to do. For a top athlete, there is nothing worse than having to lie down and rest... Since then, I have always turned to them when I am in trouble. <p/> As soon as I entered Althea I knew I had come to the right place. On the first day of therapy I was welcomed by a physiotherapist and her friend Tecar®. After just a few therapies I could feel a big difference. My leg was more relaxed and the pain slowly subsided, and soon I was able to return to the tennis courts again. But there was still one big problem... I couldn't put the same strain on my leg as before the injury and I felt I couldn't help it. I had a brake in my head ... <p/> That's when Nena came to my rescue. With IMT® training, we broke through the block in a few days and my movement on the court became much better and I felt I was the one on the court again, because it was very difficult to send the ball past me. Nena also taught me to listen to myself and my body. Now I can often help myself. <p/> I would like to thank everyone at Althea® from the bottom of my heart, because they have saved me many difficult days that I would have had to spend without tennis. Tecar®, Bionic®, IMT® and kinesiotaping is surely the best combination of therapies for injury recovery and I highly recommend Althea® to anyone who needs help. <p/> Blaž Kavčič <p/> Miran Stanovnik (28.5.2012, after his injury in Dubai, completion of therapy) <p/> After Miran's injury in Dubai, in addition to physiotherapy and kinesiotaping, we also did IMT® intuitive mental training and energy therapies as a support to the basic therapy, in order to speed up rehabilitation and to clean up the effects of the injury on all other levels, not only on the physical body. The following is a description of his experience, which was very powerful, because he gave himself completely to the therapy and his intention was to completely rehabilitate all the consequences (physical, mental, energetic) of this injury, as well as all the previous ones that had happened to him, in the shortest possible time, which is why the reaction was more intense and the result was extremely fast, which was his intention, which he had set for himself. <p/> Dear friends, My meetings with my pleasant and professional friends from the Althea® Centre in Lesce are coming to their final stage. The rehabilitation has more than succeeded. But I have tried something new again (at least for me). Nena kindly asked me if we could also try one energy therapy (reiki) together with IMT® mental training. Of course, why not. Of course I didn't expect any revolution, but I participated fully, like everything I do. She also warned me that I might get a little cold after the treatment because the energy would be cleansing... Well yes, it's no joke I can tell you that. I got so cold on the way home after the treatment that I set the internal temperature in my car to 28 degrees Celsius and it wasn't enough. At home I covered my head with two blankets (not duvets) and that was barely enough. But within an hour my body reacted with a fever (38 degrees). After a few hours I just lift my head and ask Nena for a commentary on the events. Such a strong reaction to everything we did, cleansing on all levels, because I was prepared for it and went into the process ""full on"", says my therapist. Yes, I spent a few more days in bed, but the very next day there was a significant improvement in the condition of the injury, and the very next day I forgot about the crutches for walking around the flat, which means that it helped, and since that day I have only used them for walking up the stairs... A crazy good experience, I tell you. Now I've read it again and I see that my writing looks terribly ""cracked"", but I'm not going to correct it, because everything I said is true. <p/> Miran <p/> Jure Robič, top extreme cyclist (09 / 2010) <p/> Dear Nena, I have been promising you for too long that I would write about how I experience our ""sessions"". Well, now I have made time for you, just as you have always made time for me whenever I need you, day or night. When I told you in the first session that I trusted you and believed in you and that you could do whatever you wanted, just to get better and get back to racing as soon as possible, I had no idea that change could be so fast and so effective. When you got me up and racing in four days after a serious injury, with the help of Bionic®, Tecar® and especially your IMT® mental technique, I started to understand why things were happening to me in the lake in the first place. A new world is really opening up for me, as you predicted. I know it's all in my head, it's just that now, with your help, I know how to put what's bothering me out of my mind. I can't wait for us to continue. See you)) <p/> Miran Stanovnik, top motorcyclist (07 / 2010) <p/> My first meeting with Nena and Althea® was the result of a conversation and a personal recommendation from Jureto (Robič), who couldn't praise the ""treatments"" enough. Despite the relatively long distance from my home, I regularly visited Althea® in Lesce when I had injuries, which are an integral part of almost every athlete's life. I have received individual massage treatment, Bionic® therapy, Tecar® therapy, as well as IMT® intuitive mental training, a method I am really enthusiastic about. The result was shockingly good for me. I don't bother with the details of how each segment works, because for me it's important that it works. And that is for sure. <p/> I did not believe in it at first, but then I was convinced by the real effects, and I was completely taken in. At the beginning, I thought, what is this going to do for me, how can this possibly work, this is just something, blah blah blah, ... but, as I said, I was fascinated by the effect. Every human being has certain blockages, unprocessed patterns, every human being has a problem somewhere - maybe they are aware of it, maybe they are not. Nena, I was taken by her very calmness, I felt that myself. She is a woman I trusted immediately. After giving birth, I had a big problem with iron. There was no way, even with medical help, that it would improve. Quite by chance, when I met Nena, I complained about the matter and she suggested that we look at where I might have a blockage, the psychological reasons that were causing it. Well, we did find the cause: I had a desperate guilty conscience because I wasn't with my daughter non-stop and all that was eating my iron, and when we looked at all these patterns of guilt, cleared them up, came to terms with it, when I looked the matter in the eye, it got abnormally better and better. During the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Nena and I spent a lot of time in contact via Skype. This IMT® mental training can also be done remotely, and she helped me to step over difficult mental barriers. I was able to. Sometimes you may think that the problem is somewhere on the surface, but when you look deep inside you realise that it's the patterns you have in you from childhood that are now ""jumping out"". I found myself in this IMT® training, in this therapy. It helps me a lot. It's not just a therapy for sport, it's a therapy that enriches me for life. I realise that I still have a lot of work to do on myself and this is a method where you can see the effect after just one therapy, you can see the progress, the change immediately. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be happy with themselves. For me, this therapy has opened my eyes, and I look at certain things with different glasses. I calm down when I have therapy with Nena, she calms me down, after all it is my time, which I spend on myself and enrich myself. <p/> Vasja Rupnik, biathlon team Slovenia (06 / 2010) <p/> I myself have never believed in intangible, unexplainable things, but after I started working with the Altheo® Centre, with Nena, I started to realise that it is only the ego that is the problem to a better and more confident performance in competitions, and in life! With the help of therapies, which are not even therapies, but a conversation, or with Nena's help, digging into your subconscious, you discover that fears and blockages are part of you, you just have to dare to discover them, to do that you need the desire for a better and easier life, of course, without Nena's help and guidance it's not possible, so thank you for the feedback and I recommend it for the future! <p/> Maja Kokol, children's presenter, animator and singer (05 / 2010) <p/> I have been dedicated to children in my work in various ways for 23 years. Working and socialising with them has confirmed to me over and over again how fairy-tale and magical this world is. That is why I believe in miracles, fairy tales and angels - Nena is certainly one of them. The severe trials, the extreme sadness and the fear of ""tomorrow"" are the circumstances that have brought her my way. I am a great optimist but I can say that without her help I would not have made it through that period - especially not in that way. Nena is not only a friend but also a great therapist who gives me energy, warmth, words... - whatever she feels I need at that moment. Because she is so visibly successful in all this, her ideas, advice or just telling me about something good always opens my heart and makes me curious - and so it was with the IMT® technique. She changed my life, completely - turned it upside down like a whirlpool, leaving behind the devastation of old patterns, thoughts, connections and sowing new seeds with a firm and determined will. That is why, my dear Nena, you are my angel - in all forms, in all areas. With your help, I have become who I am and for that I will always be grateful! <p/> Nika, tennis player (02 / 2011) <p/> IMT® therapy helps me with all the things I do, not just tennis. I have noticed much less fussing (if any) about others or about external things that I can't control. I am much more in touch with myself and my needs. I am somehow living more in a kind of ""peace"". At the beginning I had doubts in myself in terms of opening up. I am a person who finds it very difficult to trust someone completely and therefore to believe them. I have to say that I trusted you from the very beginning of our IMT® therapy, which is not typical for me. The therapies also help me in general in my life and are not only related to sports. In fact, for many years I lived in a bubble that I didn't want to get out of. Everybody could say or do anything to me, but I always acted completely calm on the outside. With your help, I am now actually speaking my mind, without fearing the outcome. I don't even think about what if it had been, or why it happened, but I live in the moment and do what needs to be done. My own execution, accuracy and power of my strokes has also improved with the IMT® therapies we do. <p/>Spella (12 / 2011) <p/>The barrel of repressed problems and fears has finally been filled. There was no more room and the eruption had to happen. For me as a psychological problem. I landed on antidepressants. But since I am still too young to walk with crutches (that's what doctors call treating mental problems with pills) I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that Nena had a health centre, but I had no idea how it could help me. But since the devil is still a fly in the ointment, I figured it couldn't get any worse and called her. We made an appointment for therapy. And lo and behold, after the very first IMT® session, I felt relief. A second one followed, and a third, ... Today I feel really great and I am eternally grateful to Neni. And yet more proof that the therapies really do help. One of my many fears was walking in the woods. I didn't go there alone if I could, even though I enjoy the woods. Every noise made me shiver, I was afraid of meeting a person, an animal... This fear of mine was rooted deep in my subconscious and stemmed from events in my past. After one of the therapies I went to the forest to test the effect. Alone. Amazing. The fear of forest visitors and the silence with the occasional rustling of leaves, wind, ... was gone. Walking means relaxation, recharging my batteries, talking to myself. <p/> Everything in life happens for a reason. Nena, you were one of the better and more beautiful ones. Thank you. I love coming back to therapy because it really helps me to understand what is going on around me. Therapies make my perception of the world more positive.",Review,train
308,"Severe consequences <p/> Phuket... a well-known island all over the world. It attracts a lot of tourists from all over.It reminds me a bit of Zakynthos except that it is bigger and of course has bigger and nicer beaches. <p/> On arrival at the airport we booked a hotel in Patong Beach. We rented motorbikes and this is where our exploration of the island began. <p/> TRAFFIC In Thailand, traffic is on the left (as in England). We had rented a car earlier when we were in the north. At first, my father had problems driving. The steering wheel is on the right hand side and then everything else gets confused. When he wanted to turn on the indicator he turned on the windscreen wipers instead. Luckily we took the automatic, otherwise he would have had problems with the gearshift, because he was repeatedly looking for the lever on the right side, where the door was. <p/> I am quite an experienced ""motorcyclist"" myself. I've been driving my scooter around for about 4 years, so I took over as driver and drove my mum around. I thought that driving on the left side would be a bit of a hassle, but I got used to it quickly. I had more trouble parking in the garage.Almost everybody here drives motorbikes and then, of course, they have special garages for motorbikes. Other road users also gave me a bit more trouble. People overtake here on the left and right, sometimes elsewhere if they can. There are no rules, so you really have to be alert and careful for your own safety. <p/> SUN After a short sightseeing tour of the island, swimming followed. Almost all the beaches here are sandy and more crowded with sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. When you want to have a nice rest, there are already vendors from the ""shanties"" selling all kinds of things on the beach (watches, food, clothes... ). After a rest and a swim, we drove to a shopping centre a little further away. It was already really hot outside so I couldn't wait to see the cold shops. Trying on clothes in the mirror, I was surprised by the bright red colour of my hands, just like tomatoes. The sun was burning me badly. I must admit that I didn't put on much sunblock. My skin is naturally darker and I have a lot of pigment. As soon as the sunny days start I get a nice tan. I don't like to sunbathe and I know it's not healthy. I have never had problems with sunburn and that is why I am much more surprised. <p/> I was burnt on my arms (mainly because of the motorbike), shoulders, knees and of course the bottom of my legs. The sun is much stronger here than here and the change, when the body is not used to such a high amount of heat and sun, is also to blame for my severe burns, in addition to the fact that I didn't put enough sunscreen on. <p/> I was in for a hard, tiring night full of pain. Aloe Vera and menthol rubs, as well as after-sun creams and compresses, helped my recovery. Today I am much better and even the red colour has changed to a nicer, more tanned brown. <p/> From now on I will not go anywhere without sun cream and I will apply it much more often, because I am risking my life. A lot of times, the effects of the sun lead to skin cancer and also to more wrinkled and aged skin, and I don't want to have wrinkled skin at 18 and risk skin cancer!",Opinion/Argumentation,train

December is proverbially considered to be the busiest month of the year, but we can say that this weekend, despite the holidays and the resulting higher traffic density on our roads, did not stand out from the average. There was only one road accident resulting in serious injuries and two road accidents, two of which resulted in minor injuries to four occupants. 15 road accidents resulted in damage to property. Over the weekend, 19 drink-drivers were detained. <p/> A traffic accident with serious injuries occurred on Friday at 19:30 on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur. A 50-year-old driver was driving a car on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur, from the direction of Leona Dobrotinška Street towards II. Bataljona. As he drove his vehicle to the intersection with Gajstova cesta into a sharp right-hand bend, at the end of the bend he drove his vehicle too close to the right-hand edge of the carriageway and collided with a 63-year-old pedestrian, who was walking from the opposite direction, along the left-hand edge of the carriageway. After the collision, the pedestrian, who was wearing dark clothing, fell on the bonnet of the car and hit his head on the windscreen, after which he fell on the road and was seriously injured.

312,"Are systematic examinations really compulsory? <p/> At the Association for Freedom of Choice, we are receiving an increasing number of indignant letters from parents informing us of the unacceptable practice of paediatricians and school doctors in cases where a child is not brought for a systematic check-up. Some parents are even threatened with reporting to the CSD for ""neglecting"" their child, while others are told that they will no longer be their doctor of choice if they do not come for a check-up (even if the child is healthy! ). Clearly, there is increasing pressure on parents from paediatricians and some state institutions, which is not least reflected in increased dissatisfaction and resistance from parents. <p/> The health centre is threatening one family directly in writing - without any legal basis! - that if they do not bring their baby for a systematic check-up, the Social Work Centre will be sent to their door. In the accompanying document, I am sending you an official clarification from the Ministry of Health (from January 2011), which makes it clear that systematic examinations are a RIGHT in Slovenia and that they are NOT MANDATORY. <p/> What is the situation with these systematic examinations now, are they compulsory (ZZVZZ) or not (statements of the Ministry of Health)? Do you get the CSD by the scruff of the neck in this country if you don't go for such a check-up? Where and why, who gives them this right to send the CSD over parents and de facto impose systematics as compulsory? Are such threats and pressures from doctors and the state permissible? <p/> We believe that this is an intensive increase of pressure on parents beyond all permissible limits, and therefore civil society movements are considering a form of public protest against the intensification of repression against parents by paediatricians and the state. If we fail to stop this - will soon every parent who fails to turn up with their child for a systematics session receive threats or even a CSD hearing? <p/> This practice by paediatricians and other actors in the health sector is contrary to legislation and guidelines for good practice for paediatricians, as well as to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Republic of Slovenia is in flagrant breach of by failing to regulate this area by law. <p/> Article 18 emphasises that the primary responsibility and care for the growth and development of the child in all respects belongs to the parents (or in special cases, legal representatives), and the best interests of the child are the primary parental concern. In order for parents to be able to achieve this goal, States Parties must provide them with appropriate support and establish institutions and services that parents can use to achieve this goal. Article 24 highlights the right of the child to enjoy the highest standard of health and to have access to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. It is the role of the State to ensure access to these facilities and technologies and to ensure that all segments of society, especially parents and children, are informed about these options, have access to education about them and to basic knowledge about child health and nutrition, the benefits of breastfeeding, hygiene and a clean environment, and disaster prevention. Nowhere in the Convention does it say that families must submit to compulsory procedures in the area of preventive health and medical examinations and interventions. The fact is that, because of pressure from paediatricians, a good number of Slovenian parents are already going abroad for check-ups, mainly to Austria. There, many parents are even asked what they have come for, because the child is healthy and, in their opinion, would not need so many examinations. More proof that something is very wrong in Slovenia. <p/> It is also a fact that recently the CSDs have taken children away from some families for similar reasons. Will we parents have to fear our own country in future? If you find this topic interesting, we invite you to contact our association for more information, the contacts are listed below. Above all, the Ministry of Health owes the Slovenian public an immediate clarification on all this.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

The players of Elektra Esotecha then showed great fight and heart in the meetings between the eight best Slovenian teams, for which they... <p/> OPEN LETTER TO THE ASSOCIATION OF BASKETBALL JUDGES OF SLOVENIA <p/> Dear Sir! <p/> The management of Elektra Basketball Club set the goal for the 2006/07 season to qualify the members' team for the Champions League, which we have done. The players of Elektra Esotecha then showed great fight and heart in the meetings between the eight best Slovenian teams, for which we would like to publicly congratulate them. They managed to beat two participants of the regional league, one of them even in both meetings. Our players also played well in the other meetings, securing their place in the top half of the Champions League standings. Considering the fact that we started this season with a new coach and a thoroughly renewed and rejuvenated squad, the club did not expect that we would even have a chance to fight for a place in the play-offs. That is why the club's management is already publicly congratulating the team on another great success, because regardless of the outcome of the matches in the last round of the Champions League, we will be among the top five Slovenian teams, where we have been for the last three seasons. This is certainly a great success for Elektra Basketball Club, as all the better-ranked teams have a budget from two to ten times bigger than our club's. <p/> On Wednesday, 9 May 2007, the 13th round of the UPC Telemach Champions League took place. In this round, Zlatog and Elektra Esotecha met in a very important match in a local derby. The tension on both sides was high, as the match was almost decided on the third place of the national championship, but at the same time, due to the nature of the local derby, there is always some uncertainty in the mutual meetings. The match was won by the home team after an even game, for which we congratulate them and wish them every success in their future participation in the regional NLB league. <p/> We cannot avoid commenting on the officiating by the representatives of the Basketball Referees Association of Slovenia. In the first quarter of the meeting, when the refereeing was at its most correct, the players of our team were more than a worthy opponent for the favoured home team. However, from the beginning of the second quarter onwards, the judging criteria changed. The changed criterion, which was very clearly against Elektra Esotecha, was most clearly enforced on the floor by referee Dragan Gojkovič from Ljubljana. Even one of the best Slovenian and European delegates, Aleš Kamnikar, did not react to the changed judging criteria. <p/> We would like to point out that this season we have often been satisfied with the officiating, and a few times not so satisfied, but we have taken the decision not to bother with the referees and the officiating. But what referee Dragan Gojkovic allowed himself to do in the middle of the match goes beyond all the unwritten rules on tolerance of refereeing errors, which are based on the nature of their work. Dragan Gojkovic made what we consider to be a number of unusual and unfair refereeing decisions during the match, which he then made some compensatory decisions to mitigate at the very end of the match, when the winner was already decided. This kind of judging and compensation is certainly not honourable for a referee who officiates matches of the highest level. However, in order not to criticise, we would like to publicly praise the young and promising referee Uroš Kolar, who refereed the whole meeting correctly and fairly. <p/> The coach of the Elektra Esotech team made the following official statement after the match: ""I admit that I am guilty because I believed that hard work in the hall - even five or six hours a day - can bring results. Unfortunately, I found out that only stories from behind the scenes and cooperation with various grey eminences count. Today, I am asking the referees how it is possible to make 31 personal mistakes with 'rough' play, even though we were in a zone defence for 35 minutes. How is it possible to have a ratio of 31:20 for personal fouls and 18:35 for free throws. When we made eight free throws in the last minute of the game. I was able to go into the dressing room and look my boys in the eye, who were still in tears 10 minutes after the game. If only someone else had the courage to come into our dressing room and shake their hands for their tremendous play and incredible fight. I made this statement consciously, even though I know that the Premier League Players' Association made a decision before the season not to talk publicly about the trial. ""<p/> The management of Elektra Basketball Club fully supports Bojan Lazic's statement and we expect the Slovenian Basketball Referees Association to explain in this open letter how such a blatant fiasco by the representatives of the referees' organisation could happen in such an important game. At the same time, we expect an answer as to why some Slovenian referees want to decide the winners of the meeting instead of the players on the floor? <p/> In the hope that in the future the refereeing on Slovenian basketball courts will be more coherent, we would like to welcome you and at the same time to inform you that this year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of basketball in the Šaleška Valley and next year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Elektra Basketball Club. We would like to let you know that, based on the rich tradition in the Šaleška Valley, quality basketball will continue to be played in all age categories, regardless of the subjective opinion of individual referees as to how far the success of our club can reach. <p/> On behalf of Elektra Basketball Club and with the full support of the club management.",Correspondence,train

316,"Responsibility, in my view, should not only mean that they can (or even should) make decisions for the child, but above all that their decisions should be responsible, sensible and beneficial for the child's development. Also in the SSKJ, responsibility is defined (among other things) as a quality, a characteristic of that which, because of its importance, its consequences, requires great knowledge, care, and as an attitude in which someone has to give an explanation, a justification for their work, their actions Responsibility is therefore given to someone because it is assumed that they have the knowledge and the ability to do the ""right"" thing with the thing, the task, entrusted to them. The power that parents are given is not supposed to be given in itself, but because they know how to make better choices. Such responsibility is undoubtedly stressful for a parent. After all, most parents want the best for their children, but it is difficult for them to know what is really best for the child. So my mother wanted more dolls when she was a child and now she is stocking her daughter with dolls so that she does not feel frustrated. What may not be realised is that her daughter does not like dolls at all. <p/> The decision-making power that comes as a package with parental responsibility often grates on the nerves of various experts. Parents can decide whether to allow the school doctor to carry out a systematic check-up with the school doctor at all. Parents can decide whether or not their child can see the school counsellor (the exception, of course, is acute situations that need to be dealt with immediately - e.g. fights between children, extreme abuse of classmates or teachers, disruption of classes). Parents decide whether or not the doctor can treat their child. Parents decide whether or not the child can see a psychologist. All this power is great, of course, as long as parents really work with it in the child's best interests. But, unfortunately, this often does not seem to be the case. <p/> At school, for example, the child is highly socially anxious, unself-conscious, unaccepted by his classmates, and often finds it difficult to come to school. Teachers notice this problem and find it most useful to have the child see a school counsellor to develop social competences, to try to develop a better self-image. But the parents say no. Our child is not like that already. But at home he is normally talkative. The school has nothing to interfere in our family. <p/> Similar situation. At the age of three, the entire population of children in Slovenia undergoes a systematic psychological examination. This screening identifies both children who show mental disorders and children who are at high risk of developing neurotic disorders or maladjustment. Of course, not all children identified as being at risk will necessarily develop disorders. But the results of this screening have fairly good predictive validity. The prediction that the developmental trajectory of children identified as at-risk will be towards a neurotic structure is therefore true with a high probability. The psychologist therefore identifies a child as being at risk and suggests a form of follow-up treatment. If the parents do not want this treatment, it will not be given. And a child whose adverse developmental course could be reversed at the age of three may be a behaviourally problematic toddler at the age of ten, getting on the nerves of his parents and even more so of the school. Perhaps, of course, it is not necessarily nothing. But it is better to work preventively on a larger number of children than to have to take curative action when it is actually too late. And if someone has to finish his personality development later as an adult with a psychotherapist, this development will take somewhere around twice as long as it would have taken if it had been carried out normally in childhood. <p/> Parents thus have almost godlike powers over their children's development, and the various experts can only oppose them when the parents are very clearly endangering the child's health or life. The latter is difficult to prove, especially when the threat is not physical but psychological. And practically impossible when it comes to matters such as potentially risky personal development, which is ultimately only potential.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
317,"Since we were extremely lucky to have Boštjan Romih visit us at the faculty and give us a very entertaining lecture on oratory and public speaking, here are some pointers that I found most useful and interesting. <p/> As we know, eye contact is the cornerstone of contact and there are two principles to be observed in relation to it: uniformity and randomness. It is therefore necessary to be careful to look at each listener for approximately the same amount of time. At the same time, we need to avoid patterns that could be picked up by the listeners. <p/> When speaking, we should also not apologise in advance (e.g. I apologise in advance for not having had time to prepare well for the talk. ). It is very likely that listeners/viewers will then only be more aware of our mistakes. When public speaking, we also avoid smiling to show fear and discomfort (no smile is preferable to being forced). <p/> When speaking in public, we often don't know where to put our hands. It is best to position them at belly button height (more chance of actually using them than if they are hanging by the body). Markers, power point remotes, sheets of paper (but they should be smaller - e.g. A5, and the notes should be legible and in a large enough font) can help as a fixation point. But then we have to make sure that we gesticulate with the hand that is free, and that we are not holding these tools. <p/> If you want to practise speaking with distinctness, try speaking with a pencil between your teeth.",Instruction,train
318,"In every profession there are people who are more and those who are less friendly. But when dealing with customers, you should not be unfriendly, arrogant or even rude. Nurses come top in these qualities (in my experience). From the fact that one nurse, during the driving test, tried every means to convince me that I was anaemic - she did not even ask me if I was, which is what she said: ' You are anaemic, you are so anaemic. ' And she did not give up even after several assurances that I was not anaemic. Apparently it is difficult to understand that blond and blue-eyed people also tend to have less pigment in their skin. The height of rudeness is the nurse at my gynaecologist's (a woman who the whole medical establishment knows to be a tease), who gives you a hard time whether you do anything wrong or not. The desire to get a prescription for the pill on a day when they are working with normal clients and not with students is utopian with her. If you explain to her nicely that you are studying more than 100 km away and that you cannot come on a specific day, she tells you to go and see the man on duty on Saturday. That's logic for you. Also, as a student, I can only get an appointment over the phone on Monday (that's the day they have reserved for female students), not any other day of the week. Someone please explain this to me. <p/>The waiters have been in a bad mood for the last week. First I get several accusatory no's because I want to order food that is out of stock (how was I supposed to know it was out of stock! ? ! ), then my classmate and I are told to get our own Coke from the fridge. Serving at the table is obviously a utopia. Whereupon we are given glasses full of limescale, which they refuse to change because apparently they can't be washed any nicer. But I wash the glasses by hand and they are never full of limescale. Then, suddenly, a waiter thinks that rum tea is great if you make it with black tea. Well, it's not great, and I have used an extravagant amount of sugar to make it edible at all. How a waitress who cannot make either can work in a bar where there is a big sign outside saying mulled wine and hot chocolate, and who cannot make either remains an enigma to me. Especially since at least mulled wine is very easy to make ... <p/> Certain people think that customers need to understand that they are having a bad day. Unfortunately, I have never considered that to be the customer's task. If I myself am polite and friendly and don't complicate things (except in extreme situations), I expect kindness in return. Or at least the absence of unkindness. Not unnecessary complication, nagging and insults. Because I believe that these same run-of-the-mill nurses and waiters would not find it acceptable if one day they came to see me as a client (e.g. in my capacity as a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist) and I was rude to them because I was just having a bad day.

Knowing that you don't want a long term partnership and sex, but still finding someone and lying to them until you get pregnant is just not OK. Pippa's case is ok because she only found out later and did not knowingly lie - and she and her ex-partner probably suffered a lot during the divorce. I understand where you are coming from, because it does not seem fair to me either that I will probably not be able to have a 'normal' family and children. But even heterosexual people often have problems finding a suitable partner. But you can use knowing yourself and your expectations to create the kind of relationship you really want. If you find an asexual partner or donor, you can also get pregnant without direct sexual contact. <p/> Yeah, the donor option is also an option and it's probably going to have to be a bit over the pond when the clock is ticking because I really want to be a mum one day and yeah, it would be really nasty to have a boyfriend just to get pregnant, so I'm really going to have to get into action in a couple of years and find an asexual partner to get emotionally involved with or a donor <p/> Yeah, it's really difficult and I guess if I find a man to live with I'd have to have the talk.But most of all I want to have a child in a few years time without having to have sex.I am fed up of telling my mum that I only see myself with a child without a man maybe that sounds selfish to have a child without a father so the real one gets a boyfriend go to bed when you get pregnant get rid of him.She doesn't even understand that I am repulsed by the thought of having sex <p/> It doesn't sound selfish to me. There have always been single women who have been without a man. If they can take good care of a child, then I don't think it's selfish. What I think is selfish is lying to your partner and only being with him until you get pregnant. <p/> white wrote: <p/> She doesn't even understand that the thought of sex is repulsive to me <p/> Maybe she should talk to her mother. Mine took time to accept me though. However, she is now OK with the idea that I am asexual and that I don't want a sexual partnership. I also want to have a child and I don't know how that will happen one day. But I don't bother about that. It will be what it will be. <p/> Yes, it really doesn't make sense to lie to a man just to get pregnant.In my own words, my greatest wish is to become a mother without having to go to bed and to raise a child on my own, otherwise a woman can play the role of both mother and father <p/> Yes, it is really unpleasant if parents have their own views on parenting and I know how it is for a child if he doesn't know which way to go with whom he should stick with.I am single and probably will be single with a child I have already looked into the possibility of insemination without intercourse a little and it looks good so when the time comes I will be able to have a child.Just today my mother shocked me by saying that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Just today my mother shocked me by saying, that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months' time so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Sad. Obviously your mum cares more about what people will think of you (and your mum) than what you really want. Social pressures are a terrible thing and I hope you manage to stay true to yourself. I hope you have a supportive environment in which you feel accepted regardless of your asexual feelings. Without that, it can be extremely tiring",Forum,train

335,"IAC and the Coggins test <p/> For those of you who take your horse to competitions, shows or other events where large numbers of horses gather, you will have heard of IAC. An IAC test is usually required to enter competitions, and sometimes to transport horses to a new stable, when a horse changes ownership... <p/> But do you know what the acronym IAC stands for, and why it is so important to have a test to prove that a horse is not infected? <p/> Introduction IAC is an acronym for I nfectious a nemio k onj, a viral disease that is in many ways related to the disease known as AIDS. <p/> In both cases, it is a viral disease for which there is neither a vaccine nor a cure. Although most infected horses quickly succumb to the disease, a small percentage of affected horses make at least a semblance of a recovery, but these same horses still carry the virus and become ill again when they are subjected to greater strain or stress. It is precisely because some horses look healthy despite carrying the virus that testing is needed to show the true picture of the horse's health. This also ensures the safety of all horses in the same stable, in the same pasture ... <p/> Transmission Recently, research has revealed new findings in the field of transmission of this disease. The disease is mainly transmitted by blood-sucking insects (hookworms, flies, mosquitoes ... ). For example, if an infected horse is bitten by an adder and then by a healthy horse, the disease is transmitted from one to the other. The virus only survives in the mealworm for a short time (15-30 minutes), so the disease is usually spread between horses that are housed close to each other, e.g. in the same stable or pasture. The disease occurs wherever horses and bloodsucking insects are present. <p/> Clinical signs In equine infectious anaemia, there are three groups of symptoms: acute symptoms, chronic symptoms and latent carrier symptoms, which are barely noticeable or absent. <p/>Acute symptoms include fever, listlessness, lack of running. It is difficult to diagnose an acute horse as the symptoms are generalised and the IAC test will not be positive for a month and a half after infection. About one third of infected horses with acute signs die within a month. <p/> Chronic symptoms include recurrent short acute periods with weight loss, swollen abdomen and legs and anaemia. The horses will test positive for IAC. In this condition, the horse may last for several years before the disease finally debilitates it. <p/> Most asymptomatic infected horses will show no recognisable signs of infection but will test positive on the Coggins test. <p/> Coggins test To ensure that a horse is not carrying the IAC virus, a simple test called the Coggins test is performed. This test checks whether antibodies to IAC are present in the horse's blood. Blood samples must be examined by an authorised laboratory. This test is often needed at competitions and transport events and is the simplest way of proving that your horse is healthy and is not a threat to the health of other horses at the event. <p/> Once you have passed the Coggins test, there is no need to repeat it just to keep calm. Your horse will not be IAC positive unless it shows serious signs of illness after contact with another horse whose IAC status you do not know. Further IAC tests should only be carried out for the purposes of the situations described above (competitions, shows, transport... ). <p/> Prevention With the blood testing programme and the required tests at major events, the number of cases of infection has been drastically reduced. When the testing programme started, it was believed that this approach would even eradicate the disease completely, but there are just so many asymptomatic carriers each year that the disease still occurs. There is no vaccine for IAC. It is therefore important to ensure that your horse and the horses it comes into contact with are tested and that they test negative. More and more horse boarding providers are requiring an IAC test for all newly arrived horses, which certainly goes a long way in preventing the spread of the disease. If you have horses in your care in stables or on pasture, require an IAC test from all new horses coming into your care. <p/> One more piece of information for anyone interested in having an IAC test: the Coggins test is carried out at the Equine Veterinary Clinic in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the price of the rapid test (results in one day) is €25, while the normal test (results in six days) costs a little less. The IAK test is valid for one year in Slovenia. <p/>Shops and services",Information/Explanation,train
339,"Friday 01 August 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections to the National Assembly. Therefore, in the first half of June, we sent a questionnaire to the parliamentary parties asking about their attitude towards family policy, the work they have done so far and their plans or promises for the new mandate in this area, as well as their opinion on some concrete proposals of the Family Initiative. We asked the parties to return the questionnaires to us by the end of June. <p/> Only the NSi group sent us a fully completed questionnaire within the deadline. They expressed their support for most of our proposals and listed several solutions they had proposed and implemented during the current mandate. In addition to the more high-profile ones, which you are probably all familiar with, let me mention two less well-known ones, such as the 50 per cent reduction in the contribution for the use of public roads for families with four or more children and the abolition of the administrative fee for marriage. The fact that these are not just words is borne out by the experience of this term, when the NSi Group of Deputies has repeatedly asked us for our opinion or for consultation, and our proposals have been taken on board, at least to some extent. Of course, we would have been even happier if there had been more of this. <p/> The second and so far last questionnaire was sent to us by the LDS. The questionnaire is only partially filled in and considerably less specific. For the most part, they did not really say anything about the specific proposals of the Family Initiative, with the predominant answer being ""it is interesting, needs to be changed, and then maybe worth supporting"", with the feasibility mostly based on the constraints of public finances, and with quite a few of the proposals they also made it clear that they did not support them. Interestingly, despite the fact that they have had the scissors and the canvas for 12 years and that the situation has not deteriorated in recent years (in some areas it has improved), they are very critical of the current state of family policy. <p/> We were also promised a questionnaire by the SLS, but have not received it to date. They have repeatedly shown their support for pro-family solutions in the past and have proposed some of their own. We hope that they will also send us something more concrete as soon as possible. <p/> The SD referred us to their alternative government programme, which is quite interesting reading in some points and also promises some of the solutions that the Family Initiative has been pointing out for quite a number of years. In some areas they advocate completely opposite proposals, and in others the text is quite intangible. Caution in reading it is warranted by past experience, because when the party had significant influence in government for a number of years, there was no real will and no real listening to the same proposals. You can find the programme on the SD website. <p/> Lipa has sent us its statutes and programme, and has promised an electoral programme. The party programme received contains very little that is tangible, and not much space is given to parents and the family. Perhaps the electoral programme will be something more concrete. <p/> Sunday 22 June 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections for Members of the European Parliament. A significant part of our electorate are parents, and so their attitudes, plans and work on family policy so far are also important to us when choosing parties and candidates for the parliament. <p/> The Family Initiative, the Association for a Family Friendly Society, is a non-partisan association of parents and friends of families that has been working for the best possible position of families in Slovenian society for 10 years. During this time, several governments have changed and we have held a critical mirror up to all of them, proposing the best possible solutions, opposing the bad ones, praising the good ones... This has certainly been the best demonstration of our professionalism and party independence, which is why our membership has been growing. <p/> Before the 2008 elections, we would like to ask all parliamentary parties about their attitudes to family policy, what they have done in the past (you know, actions count for more than promises) and what they intend to do in the next parliamentary term, if the electorate entrusts you with the leadership of the country. <p/> That's why we have contacted all political parties and asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards family policy. Once we have compiled the results, we will also present them to the public. For those parties that do not respond, we will assume that they are not interested or do not consider this area worthy of attention. <p/>Family Initiative hopes that the questionnaire has been / will be accepted by the parties as an opportunity to present their programme and plans in a concrete way.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

343,"Wednesday 30 November 2005 <p/> Allow me to begin by briefly introducing myself. The Family Initiative is an association of parents in particular, which has been working since 1997 (and formally since 1998) for legislative solutions to improve the comparative position of parents and families. In the past, we have been more concerned with preventing changes that would worsen the situation of parents and families than with improving legislation. Over the years we have worked in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience and have proven ourselves through sound and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, without emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/> We are following with interest the debates and your documents on reforms to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. Of course, we are trying to get a picture of how the whole set of reforms will affect the situation of parents and families. To analyse the impact of the various legislative proposals on family benefits and taxes, we have developed computer simulation tools some time ago, which we are continuously upgrading and adapting to new proposals. We can say that our calculations have proven to be correct in the past. When we try to process your reform proposals in a similar way, we are faced with the problem of the lack of concrete data and figures that are necessary to carry out the calculations and, ultimately, to reproduce and verify the calculations that have already been presented so far. <p/> Moreover, the data already presented on some of the proposals show that, if they are not implemented in the right way, they could be quite harmful to families, especially families with several children. In our view, it would not be necessary to interfere with the concept of the reforms if they were to be implemented in a way that would also be acceptable or beneficial, or at least harmless, from the point of view of parents and families. <p/> With our knowledge and experience, we are ready to help in the preparation of reforms that will contribute to creating an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parental role than they do today, and therefore prefer and choose parenthood more often, because we agree with the Prime Minister who, when presenting the Government's programme, said that the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem in our country. <p/> We are therefore asking for a meeting to review together what is proposed in concrete terms (with the necessary figures) by the reforms, so that we can use simulation calculations to see what this means for parents and families and where the proposals might need to be adjusted. Given that you have said publicly that you lack simulation tools, it may be interesting for you to see what we have produced and how much it could be useful for you.",Correspondence,train
345,"Description <p/> How do Dawn Journey lollipops work? <p/> Dawn Journey lollipops contain ginger and peppermint extracts. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) helps to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with using a means of transport, while peppermint (Mentha piperita) contributes to the normal functioning of the digestive tract. For best effect, we recommend taking the lollipop half an hour before travelling. <p/> What is travel sickness? <p/> Seasickness, or travel sickness, develops as a result of conflicting information being sent from the senses to the brain. The senses are adapted to collecting information from an environment that is more or less stationary. When this suddenly starts to move when travelling in a boat or driving a car, the information reaching the brain via the optic nerve does not match the information transmitted by the balance organ in the inner ear. <p/> Travel sickness is much more common than it may seem at first sight. It is more common in children, but becomes less common with age. <p/> Tips for travel sickness in a child <p/> In the morning before travelling, your child should eat a light, warm meal. This prevents irritation of the stomach lining and contraction of the stomach walls due to hunger. <p/> Make sure the car is well ventilated before travelling, as bad air and heat aggravate travel sickness. <p/> If the journey is short, do not give the child food or drink during the journey. If he/she is very thirsty, he/she should drink plain water. Do not overdo the food. <p/> Place the child in the central part of the boat, bus or plane, on the centre line, facing the direction of travel. <p/> Do not give the child books or games, do not let him/her watch cartoons or films on DVD. When sailing on a boat, work and general lingering below deck is discouraged. <p/> Try to distract the child as much as possible during the journey. Try to actively engage the child in conversation or play word games with the child that require close observation of the environment as the vehicle passes by. You can also play a fairy tale on CD to distract the child. <p/> Try to remain as calm as possible. Children often feel nauseous precisely because they sense their parents' fear of nausea. <p/> HOW TO USE: <p/> 1-3 lollipops a day. The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. The food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. A varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle are important. <p/> WARNINGS: <p/> Lollipops are suitable for children over 4 years of age. All ingredients in the lollipops are suitable for younger children, but younger children should lick the lollipop under parental supervision. <p/>STORAGE: <p/> Keep out of reach of children! Store in a tightly closed container in a dry place at temperatures up to 25°C.",Instruction,train

355,"Toronto Another Bust Abroad <p/> At this year's first edition of the Slovenian Music Week, representatives of prominent foreign festivals (Exit, Terraneo, Sziget, Vienna Waves) selected a few Slovenian artists to perform on individual foreign stages. In Odzven we have already introduced the band Dandelion Children, who performed at Exit in Serbia, with a short video-interview, and this time we asked some questions to the Toronto band Drug Bust, who will perform at Terraneo in Croatia on 7 August, and two days later at Sziget in Hungary. (In the autumn, we will also introduce the band Zebra Dots (ex-London), who will perform at Waves Vienna in Austria. ) <p/> Toronto's Drug Bust is one of the more exposed Slovenian protagonists of so-called indie-rock. The band was formed as an international project in London in 2007 by frontman Izak Košir (also a music journalist) and Canadian musicians Neil Leyton and Rich Ragany. Shortly after the launch, the latter two left the band and Košir was joined by Finnish musician Rami Helin. The current line-up consists of only Slovenian musicians, along with Košir, Vid Polončič Ruparčič (guitar), Nejc Kržič (bass), Tamir Gostiša (guitar) and Dorian Granda (drums). For the debut album Enfant Terrible, released in 2010 on Sedvex Records, Helin was in charge of recording and production. The album was distributed in the USA and was available on the most well-known online retailers such as Amazon, CD Baby and iTunes.",Information/Explanation,train

The first is The Cracks of Time, the second is The Kingdom of the Great Serpent and the third is Megaliths. <p/>The author has devoted her life to researching proto-civilizations and changing (what she believes to be) mistaken historical truths. This book is no different. If the reader has any knowledge of historical facts, reading this book, and indeed all the others, will really put him or her in a dilemma. <p/>The Kingdom of the Great Serpent reads very smoothly, with a lot of historical facts, but they are explained in a different way than we have been taught. Official scholarship has not dealt much with her works, as it is very difficult to deny her claims, which are supported by many evidential sources. The book is about the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbian America. Her very first sentence: 'The Kingdom of the Great Serpent is not a book about Indians. "", shows very clearly the author's disagreement with official history. America was not discovered by Christopher Columbus, but there have been many civilisations on this continent since prehistoric times that are not given the status they deserve by official history. Many of the archaeological remains that have already been discovered testify to their remarkable knowledge of construction, which has been overlooked, and many more are still waiting to be discovered.",Review,train

363,"The opposition SDS party, headed by former Prime Minister Janez Janša, has submitted proposals to Parliament for measures and 5 laws to improve the economic and social crisis. The starting point is the claim ""Slovenia entered the crisis in good shape"", which SDS and J.J. MPs keep repeating. It is true that the period from 2004 to 2008 was a very successful one, both in this country and in the world, but on the other hand, both in the world and in this country, it has been shown that high economic growth and prosperity are based on unrealistic foundations, that a giant inflated bubble has been created which has infamously burst. Slovenia, led by the government of Janez Janša, unfortunately made some big, irreparable mistakes in this ""golden age"", which are plaguing us today in the crisis: Firstly, it did not make the necessary structural changes in any of these favourable times, it did not invest enough in knowledge, research and technological progress. For example, in 2008, the Janša Government allocated a whole million euros for technological and scientific projects in small and medium-sized enterprises; now the figure is already EUR 14 million. Second: In otherwise good times, it has run up huge debts (e.g. motorways were built entirely on credit during this period), it has not reduced the deficit, and what is more, it has even increased it during these fat cow years. Thus, in 2008, gross indebtedness increased by 161 compared with 2004, or from 57% of GDP to 112% of GDP. In order to embellish the balance sheet of your term of office with the accounts, you were prepared to create and trigger a crisis of international proportions because we were not prepared to approve a fictitious budget surplus. The new Government and the crisis that awaited it as soon as it began its work was an empty treasury, nothing, a hole. What is more, the J.J. Government left the new Government full of uncovered bills for pre-election promises that had yet to be found through budget adjustments: money for the extremely damaging public sector wage reform, and thus wage increases that will give us a massive headache, money for student meals, for free nursery schools for the second child ... The previous Government could not have left us a worse bill of goods than yours, Mr Janša. And last but not least, it was the previous Government that allowed and silently monitored the granting of tycoon credits for management takeovers in the so-called state-owned banks NLB and NKBM, which our MEP Vili Trofenik first pointed out, but the information was hidden from him, Minister Bajuk dodged and then disappeared somewhere. Much of the high economic growth was based on credit-financed accelerated construction activity, which also pushed up inflation. Many companies, which were more or less strongly influenced by the state and managed by dedicated personnel close to the government of the day, got into trouble, performed badly and are today on the verge of collapse: Interevropa, Luka Koper, Paloma, Elan, Hit. Not to mention, in particular, the controversial operations at Dravske elektrarne (21 million credit to the Maribor diocese), Eles (financing of Canadian rowers, and Pavlin's Olympics), or the unreasonable decision to build a new building for the Ministry of the Interior, the absurd and excessive purchase of Patrias and a warship, the 200 million increase in the cost of the construction of Block 6 at TEŠ due to the delay in issuing the consent, the inadequate management of the construction of oncology, paediatric and neurological clinics, the new emergency room at the KC ... sad and wasteful stories, which I list with one purpose and one question: do the successors and creators and promoters of all this really have the moral right to criticise, to smarten up, to offer themselves as great saviours? Is it not all just a disguised manoeuvre to divert attention from their own culpability and complicity? The fact is that the previous J.J. Government is unequivocally co-responsible for the difficult situation in which SLO finds itself at the moment. <p/> For a long time, the SDS and the Government of J.J. did not want to and did not acknowledge the crisis that was already prevailing in the world. It was not concerned about the high rise in inflation, which we in Zares, especially our MEP Matej Lahovnik, have been pointing to as the first sign of an unhealthy situation in the economy. Last autumn, you were still saying out loud that there was no crisis in Slovenia and that there would be no crisis, you were doing everything you could to play down the public's predictions of trouble, and you were saying all the time that Slovenia would not be affected by the financial crisis. When the crisis was already here, when experts (e.g. Umar) were already opposing Virjant's public sector wage reform, Virjant was still pushing ahead, and it is precisely this move that has led to the most criticism from the OECD, which is why we are having major problems in the budget. <p/> J.J. said at the Brdo conference on managing the economic crisis a few days ago that the anti-crisis measures of the current Government are ill-advised, those in power do not know what to do, they should rely only on others. Are things really as simple as they are explained by omniscient saviours such as former ministers Vizjak, Grims, Černač ... The whole world is in crisis, the leaders of individual countries are looking for different rescue measures, groping around in the dark, so to speak: some things are proving to be appropriate and effective, others are like a shot in the dark. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists are not unanimous, economists think differently, individual governments look for different ways. Each country has to find its own appropriate way of dealing with the crisis, and in doing so we have to be aware that Slo is not an isolated island, that our economy, which is predominantly an export economy, is influenced by other economies. It is even more true that the resources at our disposal to deal with the crisis are very limited, and we need to think hard about what measures to direct them towards. Is the deliberate and prudent action of the current Government really a harmful delay? Are the measures really unwise, or is it perhaps just a case of recognising that it is really easy for the opposition to propose measures because it does not have to think about global finance, debt, sustainability ... Is it not perhaps just too easy to propose tax cuts and relief in all sorts of areas, while at the same time offering a whole range of 'gifts' such as contributions towards the purchase of housing for young families or a new car - nice, no less. But is it not better to help Revoz and the many manufacturers of parts for the car industry in Slovenia directly than to help the entire global car industry and, in particular, car dealers and car sellers in Slovenia.The Government has prepared a comprehensive response, and we in the Zares Group of MEPs support it. We believe that it has acted appropriately, with the first two packages of measures being prepared primarily to stabilise the financial system, ensure the liquidity of banks and provide funds for the normal operation of businesses. A number of measures were also adopted to ensure better and more efficient absorption of EU funds. The second part of the measures was aimed at preserving jobs, both by encouraging shorter working hours and by encouraging and increasing funds for development investment. The OECD assessed that the measures to help banks were adequate but not yet working. Much can certainly be expected from the guarantee schemes, which have long been blocked because of a veto by the Council of State. In the meantime, 1 500 new companies and 15 000 new jobs have been created with state aid as a result of the measures. We are now facing the coordination and adoption of the measures in the third package. The vast majority of them are generally considered to be good and appropriate. Slovenia needs to find the right mix of measures, given its specificities (e.g. the fact that it generates 70% of its GDP from exports), that will work on the money supply, on the demand for goods and investment and on entrepreneurial activity, but also those that will mitigate the social consequences of the crisis. <p/> A word about the broader dimensions of the SDS and its most exposed members. It is a deliberate action in several directions:first, we are witnessing an increasingly serious and threatening behaviour in the National Assembly, aimed at giving the impression that the functioning of Parliament is anarchic, uncontrollable, full of procedural evasions, procedural gymnastics, creating the impression of an emergency, deliberately prolonged debates, blockages in the work of committees, extraordinary sessions, etc. The Government's performance is portrayed as poor, inadequate, mismanaged, delayed, insufficient, based on internal frictions and inefficiencies. Behind such inflammatory criticism, there is a tacit hope that the Government might lose its compass and stumble into inappropriate and ill-considered solutions that could lead to even greater outrage. But we in the Zares Group of Deputies believe that it is precisely times of crisis that require a lot of talks, coordination, clashing of opinions and concepts of views, social dialogue... In times of crisis, the impression is created that we need a more firm and decisive, authoritative hand, and SDS is already offering it in a certain way. But such a hand can very quickly become a leaden hand. What is happening? People today no longer believe in moderate and reasonable solutions, they are not satisfied with small steps in times of need, they demand quick and radical moves. They are demanding that the guilty be found, that convictions and punishments be handed down, that the scoundrels be dealt with, that there be more order and discipline. And it is not difficult to invite such people, in need and in trouble, into the streets, to goad them against the real and imaginary culprits of their plight, and this is a wonderful warm bed, as Boštjan M. Zupančič says, for various forms of fascism, chauvinism and psychopaths of all kinds. And times of crisis are already known in psychiatry as a paradise for psychopaths. These are already very dangerous matters, which I hope will not be played out in the SLO.In your proposal for measures, you also set out your analysis of the crisis and said that capitalism will emerge from the crisis better, also in value terms, because of its flexibility. A very outdated and ossified mentality. Indeed, many of us are pointing out that economic growth and the model of prosperity that it generates, and that has so far guided global economic growth as a neoliberal and financial model, has not produced good results. It has benefited only a narrow, privileged group, with the rich getting richer and richer, the poor getting poorer and poorer, with capital and ownership privileged and labour deeply undervalued and humiliated and excluded from decision-making. These models were close to your government for most of its mandate (after all, you substantially reduced taxes on the richest, you did not tax wealth) and it was only at the end of your mandate that you started to advocate a social model of the market economy in the light of the forthcoming elections and the poor public image. The current economic growth model is therefore, in our view, socially unjust and, given the limited natural opportunities and goods and the disregard for nature, ecologically unacceptable. Politics also bears a heavy share of the blame for this, as it has been deeply complicit in unethical and immoral behaviour, where power and money have been the only sacred things. Quick money without work. And corruption has become socially acceptable behaviour and the norm. Unfortunately, it has also become rampant in our country and, unfortunately, it has become particularly rampant in recent years, under your government. <p/> Let me conclude my presentation of the Zares Group's views on the measures with a direct assessment of the proposals: <p/> among the measures there are many good, useful and appropriate ones, which the Government will take into account <p/> a whole series of measures that you want to present as your own are merely copied, regurgitated, and are taken verbatim from those already announced and published by the Government <p/> many of the proposed measures are clearly unrealistic, populist, and prepared in order to achieve quick kiss-and-meet-you-good-effects. <p/> While the measures were rejected as inappropriate in the Committee, we would like to stress that, for two reasons in particular <p/> Firstly, as this is only a consideration of the decision that the DZ supports the package of measures, but cannot intervene in their substance, amend or supplement them, the decisions as they stand make it impossible to consider and define each one of them. So in a way: take it or leave it - all or nothing. Is this really what the proposers are saying: that they would like to cooperate and propose to the Government, to help - but their proposal is such that it is virtually untouchable. A very self-important and omniscient move, so to speak. <p/> And secondly: it is an unstoppable and inappropriate method of mixing up normal and established powers between the two branches of government - between the powers that Parliament has and those that the Government has as the executive branch of government. Measures are not merely a matter of setting out a principled direction, but rather of providing concrete guidance for binding action, which is a matter for the Government. The Government must continue to be the policy-maker of the country, which must otherwise be bound by the frameworks set by the National Assembly. What the proponents of the measures are proposing, however, would fundamentally interfere with the role of the Government, even limiting and making it impossible. This, too, suggests that there is, after all, a deliberate dismantling of the three branches of government, as is also indicated by some of the amendments to the Constitution for the Second Republic that are being proposed at the same time. This is already a very dangerous game. That is why we in the Zares Group will not support the measures.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
364,"Lukšič does not expect Janša and Janković to take ""radical measures"" <p/> Ljubljana, 08 January (STA) - SD President Igor Lukšič believes that the findings of the anti-corruption commission regarding their assets should make Prime Minister and SDS President Janez Janša and PS President Zoran Janković think twice and then do ""what the majority expects"".Lukšič also believes that the SD President and SDS President Janez Janša and the PS President Zoran Janković should rethink the matter. But he said it was difficult to expect them to decide on ""any radical measures"". <p/> It is very bad for Slovenia that we have two people at the top of Slovenian politics who ignore the practice we want to introduce in the country, i.e. that politicians have transparent finances, that they are able to explain where their income comes from, and if they are not able to do so, that they leave their posts, Lukšič said in response to the findings of the anti-corruption commission. <p/> He hopes that ""this is the drop over the edge that will finally mean the introduction of a new practice in Slovenian politics"". Asked specifically whether Janša and Janković should resign, he said that the right thing to do would be ""to think the matter through and then do what the majority expects"". <p/> However, he does not want to talk about the options that would follow a possible resignation - whether he himself would opt for a technical government or for early elections. First, he says, they both have to make the right move, and only then will there be time to think about the way forward. <p/> He adds that ""there is no point in getting ahead of ourselves, because unfortunately experience shows that in such situations, people in Slovenia have so far, as a rule, not decided to do what they should have done"". <p/> What is important for Slovenia, he says, is to get a government that is credible. Lukšič points out that the government has 18% support and that this is a key problem. He also problematises the fact that a government with 18% support is going to sell Slovenian assets. ""We simply know that this will not be done credibly, it cannot be,"" he concludes. <p/> "" If these deals are run by people who cannot explain how 200 000 came into their account, how will they be able to explain where these huge billions will go. 12 billion are at stake,"" the SD leader added. <p/> The Anti-Corruption Commission found that SDS President Janez Janša and Positivna Slovenije President Zoran Janković had violated anti-corruption legislation when auditing the assets of party presidents. According to the Commission, Janković failed to declare assets worth at least €2.4 million, and part of the financial inflows into his personal bank account came from a chain of transactions that started in Grep. As for Janša, he notes that his assets have inexplicably increased by €210,000.",News/Reporting,train

368,"Source of the survey, which is also at the bottom of this article. Author of the column. Thirty years ago, his parents might have had a problem with this innocent childish line. If there is a cult of personality and the state is a proletarian dictatorship - and in the SFRY it was almost a constitutional principle that the proletariat was in power - then children in schools must not make a fool of the supreme authority. <p/> Indeed, until the end of the 1980s and the Slovenian constitutional amendments, Article 133 of the Penal Code, which criminalised freedom of conscience and expression, was also in force. The verbal offence meant that one was not allowed to speak over the state, the system and the leaders. The statement ""Comrade Tito has a fat arse"" would have caused problems with the authorities in the SFRY. <p/> For many people who are strangers to Slovenia's obsession with socialism and Titoism, it is inconceivable how, in 2012, so many sensible people can be fascinated by the figure of one of the typical dictators of the 20th century. Because twenty years ago, nobody thought about Josip Broz.In the late 1980s, when democratisation was beginning, you would have laughed at someone idolising a marshal or even dressing in similar uniforms. <p/> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it did not occur to people to deplore Yugoslavia, Titoism or self-management. There were too many challenges, and faith in the future was strong. Interestingly, there was no noteworthy event at Dražgoše in that period either. Third-class officials spoke, a few hundred people gathered. <p/> At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Titoism died out in Slovenia. <p/> Then something started to change at the beginning of the new millennium. Dražgoše suddenly took on a whole new glow and significance. They became a kind of value centre for an orthodox, pre-modern and quasi-partisan political rallying cry, aimed at mobilising the far-left electorate. In the light of historical facts, Dražgoše became Lažgoše. <p/> On a broader, social level, a reinterpretation of Titoism and history in Yugoslavia began to take place. Instead of historians shedding light on all the characters of the time - the only exception being Professor Jože Pirjevec's biography Tito and Comrades - and honestly saying that Slovenia had a semi-colonial attitude towards the southern fraternal republics (no, Slovenians will never admit that), an avalanche of amateurish interpretations of our heroic history took hold. <p/> Suddenly, we became the only nation to have preserved the tradition of Titoism. Only in Slovenia is the attitude towards Josip Broz markedly positive, and the memories of the SFRY bright and nostalgic. <p/> What is the reason for this, why is it so? <p/> Probably from our social pathology. Because other, much larger and more historic nations, which have the historical traumas of the 20th century, face similar problems in evaluating their psychopathic leaders - regardless of the degree of their autocracy. The Spanish, for example, with Franco. But Franco was at least as benevolent a dictator as our Tito. <p/>The Italians did not come clean with Mussolini. Partly because of a horribly incorrect education system which has not yet established the right degree of critical distance from the fascist period. <p/> The Russians are reviving the cult of the Georgian Stalin. They, too, have freaks dressing up in uniforms just like those worn by the Generalissimo with the moustache and going around, addressing people, appearing at obscure and less obscure events, pinching children's cheeks and saying that they are Stalin. <p/>Sick. But in societies that have not come clean about their traumas and fears, it happens. There is not such a big difference between Russia and Slovenia in this respect. <p/> The only reason Germans can't openly emulate Hitler (except right-wing extremists, whose political activities are largely banned) is because they have been sent through a process of denazification by their Western allies. The Austrians got away with it, hence Haider. <p/> There are more problems with the Slovenes. I have already written about this. The worse the present, the better the memories of the past. Since there can be no biological link with Titoism in the younger generations, institutionalised nostalgia for the old days is reinforced. This is no longer an innocent joke perpetrated by a certain Godnič. The revival of memories of the Day of Youth and the Titoist relay is a phenomenon per se. It is yet more proof of how lost, hopeless and pre-oedipal our 'liberal' and 'democratic' society is. <p/> So that there is no misunderstanding: the cult of Tito, of Franco or of Mussolini should be cultivated by people in peace in their own homes and, for my sake, in their cellars. In their private lives, they can do whatever they want. They cannot do it in public, or even within the framework of public institutions. <p/> Can you imagine if we had been lamenting Titoism in 1988 or 1992? Of course not. Only a few radicals did it then. Most Slovenians were happy to be out of the SFRY and out of the poverty of a failing country. <p/>Why, then, does it feel different today? Because of the economic and social situation? Certainly, the middle class is already or will soon be impoverished, more and more people are living on the poverty line, and in such a crisis situation it is understandable to recall times that most people no longer even remember, but are considered socially just (nobody went hungry, everybody was employed and similar wingnuts). But only in a society that is still a long way from maturity. Only in a country that is not aware of the foundations of its statehood. <p/> The idolatry of Titoism and the cult of personality is not irrational, as many people think. In my view, it all comes together in the context of Slovenian social pathology. We lived a relatively comfortable life materially and socially in the SFRY. The party elite in general. When the system collapsed because it was based on economically unsustainable assumptions, we decided to try capitalism. <p/> Capitalism has not worked very well in Slovenia. A friend of mine, who is a top workaholic and manager, says that the reason it has not is that the Slovenes have been 'Balkanised' by Yugoslavia and simply do not want to work any more. <p/> That is probably true to a certain extent. But the key problem of the hysteria about Tito and the Day of Youth can be identified very easily: as a country we have no identity, as a nation we have no will and no energy. <We really do not deserve a country of our own. And to paraphrase our beloved Titoists, Josip Broz would never have given it to us either. <Josip Broz symbolises socialist Yugoslavia after the Second World War: the reconstruction and construction of a war-torn country, socialist self-management, resistance to Stalin and the policy of non-alignment. It symbolises peace and full employment. On the other hand, it symbolises the cult of personality, the Naked Island, the beheading of liberals and the post-war killings. Under his leadership, Yugoslavia enjoyed great prestige in the world, and he will be remembered as an exceptional statesman. <p/> Špela Šipek, editor <p/> I think most people remember Tito as the figure of the commander who led the partisan army to victory over the fascist invaders and traitors. He symbolises the figure on the pedestal through which the PR machine promoted positive values such as comradeship, brotherhood, education, strengthening of mind and body. And, on the other hand, it symbolises the crime against those killed immediately after the end of the war and the persecuted political opponents. It thus symbolises the trauma of a part of the Slovene nation whose ancestors were killed or imprisoned, and of a part of the Slovene nation that is proud of its resistance against fascism. Although Josip Broz-Tito symbolises the past in its entirety, he also symbolises the division of the Slovenian nation, which is no less fervent now than it was twenty or sixty years ago. <p/> Janez Furman, parish priest <p/> Broz and Kardelj once came to the cross while walking along Brdo and looked up at Christ. Edi begins to explain how their lives were not always exemplary, yet they had come so far and this poor man had worked for the good of mankind and finally ended up on the cross. The marshal replies, ""Eddie, when we die, they will have no nails. ""And indeed, at the time of their deaths, you had a hard time coming up with nails. Before a critical historical distance can place Tito in the real context of his era, there will be spears being broken about his personality and his time in charge of the late SFRY. The abuse and the immature view of democracy have led many to associate the Marshal's figure as a mythical hero. Others who survived the Naked Island or any other repression would have erected a memorial to his sacrifice. Despite his glorification, we are all ordinary mortals together. <p/> Nina Ivanič, actress <p/> It is difficult for me to answer this question objectively, because as a primary school pupil I was constantly listening to and learning about Tito as someone who was all goodness, honesty, heart, ability and I could go on and on. In our childhood eyes, he was a great hero and a man with a big heart. That is what we were taught, that is what we believed. But there are two sides to every story, and so there are two sides to Tito's story. Over the years, many things have been revealed and all the glamour around Tito has slowly dissipated. In my adult eyes, he now symbolises something quite different from all of the above. Behind the pretty veneer, there is often an ugly and dirty side. <p/> Jure Apih, columnist <p/> There is not one Tito, there are many Tito's. He is the locksmith apprentice from Zagorje who learned to play the piano without any schooling, who won a medal in sabre fencing from the Austrian army and danced with the Queen of England on his island. He is a Bolshevik agent who mysteriously survived Stalin's purges. He is the leader and marshal of the only real resistance army in the Second World War. He is the war criminal responsible for the greatest indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners and civilians in Europe. He is the only leader who dared to stand up to Stalin and to lead his people on a third path between socialism and capitalism, between one-man rule and self-rule. He is the historic spiritual leader of a non-aligned world, of more than half of humanity, and his funeral brought together a crowd of world leaders like never before. He was a thistle and a ""sweetheart white"". Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo is the apprentice against him. <p/> Irena Prijovic, economist <p/> JBT symbolises the leader of Yugoslavia. What this symbol means to whom depends on the individual. It depends on which generation one belongs to, whether one is and how one lived at that time, whether one is a foreigner or someone who was once a Yugoslav. It depends on how history is summarised and interpreted. Personally, I associate Tito with a peaceful childhood, my own ignorance and the kind of illusion we were living at the time. <p/> I have just returned from Berlin and I am still under the impression of the symbols of the divisions of post-war Germany in that city. While the East Germans demolished the wall for a long time in various ways, and once it physically fell, we ourselves paid the highest possible price by fighting a war on the premises of the former state. <p/> Dr. Samo Rugelj, columnist <p/> It depends for whom. For some of the older generation, Tito is often still a symbol of the ""good old days"", when life was more carefree, albeit with a lower standard of living and political monogamy, but without existential fears. To my generation, Tito was a great leader who was forged into heroic heights for us with stories and songs, but personally he is best remembered for his illness, his treatment at the Clinical Centre and his magnificent funeral. I no longer had any special emotional relationship with him: when I spent a good year in Belgrade a few years later in the army, I was not drawn to the House of Flowers, even though Slovenians like to go there. For the younger generations, our children, Tito is a textbook historical figure who led Yugoslavia, or the SFRY, and they need to think hard to remember what that acronym even means.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

373,"It's like the Slovenian government without Dimitri Rupel, hehe. 1 I am writing this after watching yesterday's Trends. I stopped watching the show some time ago (mainly because of the lack of culture and unprofessional guests), but after a huge outpouring of black bile, I decided to watch it anyway to see where all the anger came from. Let me add my little finger to the debate for the time being. <p/> The point revolved around Michael Jarc, who wants to call a local referendum on the building of a mosque. I don't know the exact question (and, coyotes of journalism, they haven't published it anywhere - more proof of how much they care about the truth as long as it pops! ), but it seems to me that he doesn't want to completely block the building of a mosque, maybe just some minarets and/or accompanying sports facilities. This question has already been answered by the Constitutional Court, which ruled on a similar issue in 2004. At that time it stated: <p/> 35. From the foregoing it can be concluded that the objective pursued by the contested regulation is to restrict the right under Article 41(1) of the Constitution. However, such an objective is inadmissible in the light of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, according to which human rights may be restricted only for the sake of the rights of others (and in the cases provided for by this Constitution), because it is only for the purpose of restricting a right and not for the simultaneous protection of the rights of others. <p/> Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Decision calling the referendum is incompatible with the right to the free exercise of religion. Thus, the interference proves to be constitutionally impermissible already on the basis of an assessment under the so-called legitimacy test, and therefore the Constitutional Court did not need to engage in a further assessment of its excessiveness. <p/> So nothing will happen with the envisaged referendum. Although this did not stop Jelincic from (as always) starting a dispute 2 - although he then coldly told Becirovic to his face that he was a fool for equating him with Haider. The ever-noble Member is certainly as cunning as a pretzel, although the wiser ones are quick to overlook him. Once you have acquired some legal knowledge, he comes off as pathetic when he is clinging to the Slovenian Constitution and when he wants to lecture Mire Senica while the latter looks thoughtfully into the distance through the camera, inventing synonyms for his interlocutor in his head, without batting an eyelid. <p/> It seems to be popular lately for lawyers to engage pro bono only for cases that have the potential to be highly publicised in the media (Čeferin in Strojanovi PRESS) - lawyers are not allowed to (only) advertise. Andrej Saje also provided a newsflash bomb by saying that he wished the Islamic community all the best in the construction of their building, as he wanted everyone to have equal opportunities in terms of religion. OK, I guess we're not in the 14th century anymore and the Church has managed to civilise itself a bit and they're no longer impaling heretics on stakes or handing them over to the secular authorities to be cremated. But at least a little bit of rancour wouldn't hurt, no. At least a crude observation about the wrong God, pretty please? Well, it's not as if everyone is saying that the other side belongs to the wrong God and so, after taking all the creeds into account, we'll all be burned in Hell together. Or what? <p>Let us return to the mosque. As far as the morons have been and fallen out, everyone has one iota of a point. So, to combine them all into one (of) sentence. We definitely need a mosque. There is a good percentage of Muslims in Slovenia, and I do not see how it can benefit all of them to deny them a place to gather and a chance to practice their religion. We should not turn a blind eye - there are around 50 local places of worship in Slovenia, and the Orthodox faith also has its own church. The second issue is architectural. Very interestingly, Jelincic has pulled out a regulation from the naphthalene, which says that the building must be A metres away from the railway tracks 3. It must be appropriate to the surroundings or respect the architectural guidelines of the surroundings 4 As I am informed, the minaret is not compulsory, nor is the circular shape of the central building. I was also a bit disturbed by the picture showing a supposed mosque (although no tender/competition has yet been carried out), around which there is a hefty pile of sports and other facilities. It is true that they themselves know best what they need to carry out the precepts of their religion, and that even the Catholic Church has a house next door where ... er, well, yes ... religion takes place. However, the suggestion of tennis courts, a gym and a football pitch seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. After all, they (read the Arab Emirates) will be paying for everything themselves, so let them afford it if they can. <p/>After watching this, I'm not any more convinced that I'll start watching the Dren Dren Dren Dren Dren again, because they're on an even lower level than before. Uroš Slak really gives the impression that he only invites such guests autonomously for the sake of shouting, because when it flares up, he can't seem to extinguish it or turn the flow of the shouting conversation around. Apparently, they really cannot agree on anything or come to common conclusions, all that matters is the show, the shit and the stupidity. Anyway, I am in favour of the mosque (not exactly there and then and there, as they imagine in Trends, but let's wait for the actual tender) and I think that once it is built, there will finally be peace around this subject, which is being blown up to the proportions of a galaxy quite unnecessarily. So far, I have not seen anyone stoning a cuckolded man in an Orthodox church, or anyone burning down the home of a neighbour because he invites his friends to pray there. <p/> Or would you rather have a semi-stealing series called Brother to Brother, which costs EUR 1.5 million, and therefore we get True Reality cancelled because they cannot scratch together EUR 50 000? Although, somehow, it seems to me that this is more of an excuse to turn the national broadcaster into a brainwashing car wash, in the same way that it is now popular to lay off workers during a 'global crisis'. <p/> Anyway, every now and then I laugh at / marvel at the bizarreness of our professionals when they want to get into computing or the Internet - in today's case, it will be the legal profession. Sandra Cico, a lawyer, as a representative of the Association for the Protection of Audio-Visual Works, has sent the two sheets below to some (where is T-2, for example? ? ? ? ) Slovenian Internet access providers, demanding that they be blocked from accessing the torrent tracker PirateBay.org. It gives them 24 hours, then threatens them with legal and criminal proceedings. <p/> I understand the legal profession and the wishes of their clients, especially if one of them is about to receive a pile of money. However, this 'letter' is both legally and technically misguided. OK, they get the plaudits because they obviously know what an IP range is and what a tracker is, but for everything else I do not know whether to blame the ignorance of the law firm or the nepotism of Association 1. I would never dare to send such a request myself, even if local factors were very strong and very persistent. <p/> Banning the Internet, or parts of it, is ridiculous, impossible and slightly totalitarian. We all remember when udba.net hit - we streamed masses of scanned lists, searched there for our enemies and a few days later we were surprised by a fucking ""blackout"". Of course, the real geeks found themselves, and we grabbed some politically incorrect proxy and went back to the hilarious history of Danilo Potnik, Win Parachute and Ivan Janša. So the demand to ban a particular site is very ineffective, but it is also undemocratic - if memory serves, I pay for uninterrupted access to the entire web, if anyone has done anything illegal there, let them get on with it, leave the other users alone. <p/> The legal aspect can be problematic, especially because (as we are used to) the subject is not regulated with sufficient precision, let alone extensive case law. The requirement is interesting in its own way because it obliges Internet access providers to ban a site as if they had something to do with it (in Sweden, hello? ! ). The old Slovenian Penal Code knew a nice institution, cascading liability. It was really only for responsible editors, printers, etc., but we could follow that model. Of course, if the KZ-1 had not completely abolished cascading liability. Why? Well, the Minister's answer is as ""convincing"" as abolishing relative limitation periods. <p/> Liability on the Internet would go something like this: first, of course, the author, whose identification can become a whole project on the Internet, as there are plenty of tools for anonymisation. Second in line would be the webmaster. I'm not really talking about a webmaster per se, I'm thinking more of SiOL with its nest of blogs that anyone can open. If we couldn't get to that point, or if he was hiding in the Philippines, the domain owner would come into play, in very extreme cases of course. That is kind of where it all ends for my taste. It certainly ends with the Internet access providers, because, firstly, there is simply too much traffic for anyone to be able to monitor all their subscribers, and secondly, this requirement is absurd, because then, for example, all the providers in the world are responsible for the illegal streaming of copyright content via PirateBay, whose subscribers are, in a communist way, sharing games, music, programmes, porn amongst themselves. It is like the passengers on the trains in Madrid in 2004 suing the train company because a bomb was planted there by terrorists. The providers are just offering Internet access and there is no logic in having anything to do with something that someone creates and puts on a server at the other end of the Earth. <p/> Finally, a reflection for all the budding Slovenian pirates - THEIR responsibility in downloading illegal content from various trackers. Too many of them are brave, because so far there have been no serious / mass / high-profile police actions in Slovenia targeting anyone other than the traffickers, so they go around the forums shouting and beating their chests that nobody can do anything to them, while at the same time citing some EU directives and regulations. Let me disappoint you, oh, dear fellow-travellers. The Criminal Code (even the new one, strange that they have not abolished these things yet) knows about the infringement of copyright and other rights, which Sandra Cico already refers to - Articles 148 and 149 of the CC-1 are recommended reading. Add to that Article 38 - aiding and abetting (in the commission of a crime) and you have the perpetrator, streaming illegal content from the web. This applies to all ""ordinary"" pirates as well as to trackers (Filebits, Partis, Slobytes, etc.). This is really only a theoretical construct, and I cannot imagine Slovenian police officers and prosecutors looking at the troves of data on seized computers or 12 geeks sitting in court. After all, maybe we can look forward to live blogging, heh. <p/> As for these societies, it seems to me that we have quite a lot of them in Slovenia, although most of the time we don't hear anything intelligent from them, but it's more like air stirring. [ ] <p/> It is the title of a textbook on the Turkish invasions of Slovenian territory by Vasko Simoniti. And every time a multi-tourism kinastera comes to my mind, I start thinking about a topic related to culture. Today, I am going to get stuck into our beloved Slovenian language and spelling, or rather, into their squinting. <p/> Let's start with food. Hello. Olive oil. I have never heard a more butthurt word. Just as the oil itself became very fancy - almost art - when Jamie Oliver unhygienically poured it over arugula and parmesan. And it has also suddenly become artful to call it OIL. Let's go slowly: we know the tree that borders on the shrub, Olea europaea, that is, OLIVE. So, by induction, we find that the logical name for it is OLIVE fucking OIL. Mainly because it is the delicious olive that goes into the press, not just the tree - the olive. True, the SSKJ allows both terms, but olive is completely redundant. Especially since some SSKJ authors suggest the word crack for bun. Mhm. <p/>The other part, where there are untold problems, is the overlapping or, in the vernacular, umlauts. There are usually no peculiarities in the writing, except that the Council on Kanal A will apparently have to quickly upgrade the encoding to UTF-8 or change the font, because surnames with ü's are written as ue, although it is true that Slavoj Žižek is always left without a cross (above his head) abroad. It's the pronunciation that gets complicated. <p/> At the end of last year, we got a third President of the Republic, Danilo Türk, who won by a large margin. But even today there are some people (most of them in 24 hours on POP TV) who find it difficult to pucker their lips for the letter u and pronounce the letter i. All too often, however, they hear the disparaging Tirk; the unforgiving call him Turk (Zmago Padalec PRESS). Hans-Gert Pöttering, the current President of the European Parliament, is suffering a similar fate. He is most often rechristened Pottering or Petering. But it is the same, who would even bother! <p/> After a hard lesson, it is always good to relax / have fun, so take a look at how the new President Türk is perceived by the legends Ivan and Miro Serpentinšek, sorry, Serppentinschäck.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

Clearly a component that sellers don't put in the online shop, well at least most don't.

If they have a spoke that is the same as yours is another question. If your spoke thickness is the classic 2.0 mm there should be no problem, you just need to find out the length. <p/> Hi David, if you have a cracked spoke on the gear side you will have to remove them. otherwise it won't be possible.

382,"Coats of arms in the Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle <p/> 17.09.10 Author: Aleksander Hribovšek <p/> The Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle is the only major architectural monument in Slovenia that is decorated with coats of arms and commemorates the former regency. Its present appearance shows the most important architectural elements of its Gothic base and Baroque superstructure. The history of the construction reveals two layers of time. The first dates back to 1489, when Emperor Frederick III established a benefice at the castle in honour of St George, St Pancras and St Helena, and the second to the additions made after 1616. The exact year of the beginning of the construction is not known, but it was certainly built before the foundation of the benefice. <p/> The castle chapel is mainly decorated with the coats of arms of the governors of Carniola who served in Ljubljana from 1261 to 1742. They were painted by Abraham Kaltschmied, a copper-engraver, draughtsman and engineering lieutenant at the time, when Count Corbinian of Saurauški was the head of the provincial Estates. The regional governors were the chiefs of the land, alongside the Emperor, the supreme ruler. They were at the head of the Land Estates and the Land Administration. They were appointed by the rulers on the proposal of the provincial Estates. The governor administered the land and was the supreme judge, taking orders from the ruler and presiding over the provincial assemblies. Initially, he was the king's deputy, but during the interregnum he was deputy to the various rulers who briefly held the land. The Habsburgs retained the office of governor, who became deputy to the Prince of the Land and commander of the Land's army, as well as president of the Land's Diet. <p/> The coats of arms in the chapel can be divided into three groups: on the north, west and south walls are painted the coats of arms of the sixty Land Governors of Carniola, followed by the coats of arms of the five Austrian rulers on the chancel ceiling, and the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscape on the ceiling to round off the whole composition; the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscapes are on the chapel ceiling. The chapel was first decorated with them between 1742 and 1747. The first year, 1742, is on the painting plan held by the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia (ARS), while the year 1747 is painted in the chapel itself, next to an inscription stating that the coats of arms were to be restored in that year, but this may be an error and the coats of arms may have been painted for the first time at that time. The chapel was probably also restored in 1849, when the west wall and its armorial decoration were demolished. In 1915 the chapel was rebuilt again, this time after the earthquake. In the late 1980s, a final and thorough restoration began, which was completed in the early 1990s, including the west wall, and the coats of arms were to be restored to their original appearance. At least roughly. <p/> Miha Preinfalk from the Scientific Research Centre of the SAZU and Prof. Barbara Žabota, Professor of History and Sociology, examined the fate of the coats of arms in St George's Chapel at the beginning of the new millennium (see bottom of the page), from the time of their creation to the present day, and pointed out the many discrepancies and mistakes that occurred during the renovations. They also give five lists of the coats of arms depicted and compare them. We will concentrate on the first two only. The first list gives the probable state of the original painting and is based on the 1742 painting plan. The basis for its creation (not only the content, form and order of the inscriptions, but also the coats of arms themselves and their heraldic style) is the list of regional governors in Valvasor's Slav of the Duchy of Carniola (the first fifty-six governors). Whether Valvasor's list is historically accurate or not is of secondary importance for our presentation of the coats of arms. The second list shows the present state after the last renovation, as visitors can see it on the walls of the chapel. <p/>There are considerable differences between the lists themselves in terms of variations in the form of the inscriptions (e.g. MAJNHARD or MAYHART), minor sloppiness (e.g. SEVFNIG instead of SEVENIG) or errors (e.g. BERG. instead of BEGR. "" begraben "" or buried), which probably occurred during the restorations. Also, the 12 coats of arms have incorrect years. Errors are also found among the regnal coats of arms. Thus, the correct date of death of Archduke Charles is in fact 10 July 1590, and not as indicated in the first and second lists, which are compared below. Duchess Mary (wife of the aforementioned Archduke Charles) was not the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bohemia, as shown in the current situation or in the second list, but in fact the daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria (BOEHMEN instead of BAYERN), as the coat-of-arms image itself testifies. <p/> In the photographs below we can compare the two lists. The captions on the photographs show the current state of the frescoes on the walls of St George's Chapel, while the captions below the photographs show the first list, or the list based on the 1742 plan for the frescoes. <p/> Discrepancies and errors also occurred during the painting or restoration of the coats of arms. In most cases, where there has been a discrepancy, it is simply a case of using the wrong colour of a field or attribute, or sometimes of using the wrong pictorial template altogether.",Information/Explanation,train

385,"Additional content <p/> SIPINA E-Reader <p/> The SIPINA-E-Reader system provides voice-controlled e-services for the interactive delivery/reading of information for users with disabilities (especially the blind and visually impaired). The SIPINA-E-Reader system is able to recognise the speech of users (speech commands and supported speech management) and enables the delivery of information in the form of speech. It connects to the SIPINA cloud-based system via a WiFi connection. <p/> The figure shows the functional architecture of the SIPINA system. The system is based on the concept of distributed processing and technology clouds. The main guiding principles of the SIPINA system architecture are: <p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), <p/> SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System).<p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System). <p/> Structure of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> Technical characteristics of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> SIPINA-E-SPEAKER enables a high quality and efficient delivery of speech modality services. SIPINA-E-SPEAKER consists of a Java GUI and several modules that provide the necessary operation and communication with the SIPINA system: for audio, the tcp/ip protocol, and the RTSP/MRCP communication protocol. For all interaction, the user needs nothing more than a microphone image. The microphone colouring and the audio signal signal the user when the system expects a response from him. While the system is playing the system message or information requested by the user, the microphone is inactive and does not allow control by the user. This ensures that the system speech is not recognised as user speech, which can be a problem with mobile terminals. <p/> The SIPINA-E-RECORDER is designed as a TCP/IP client. It consists of software to run on Android, Blackberry mobile phones, and also platforms such as tablets. The system is based on the Java programming language for mobile terminals. SIPINA-E-BRALNIK allows remote reading of information, if possible connecting to a WiFi network. The functional specification of the software is given in this document. The functionality of the individual modules is also described. <p/> SIPINA-E-RADER dialogue <p/> The dialogue in the SIPINA-E-RADER system is system-managed. The system defines the individual dialogue states and offers the user a set of choices in each dialogue state. The user can select from the given choices and thus determine the further course of the dialogue. The system messages, which are played to the user by the system in the form of voice messages, provide the user with all the necessary information to choose the continuation of the dialogue (self-declared system messages). The user can determine the continuation of the dialogue by speaking individual words or short phrases. The system messages include instructions on which words the user can use to continue the dialogue in a certain dialogue state. <p/> The user of the SIPINA E-BRALNIK system can choose between the following news sources: Radiotelevizija Slovenija, 24ur, Delo, Hefajst. For the selected source, the user can select the news areas covered by each source. The names of the areas for the selected source are transmitted by the system to the user in the form of a system voice message. At the same time, the speech recognition system's grammar (the set of words that the speech recognition system can recognise) is adapted to allow the recognition of the words of the areas of the selected source. The headline of the first news item of the selected source is then played after the selected area. The user can initiate the reading of a news item by saying the word ""read"" or the reading of the title of the next news item by saying the word ""next"". The user can trigger the reading of the title of the previous news by pronouncing the word ""back"". In each dialogue state, he/she can choose to move to another area (pronounced 'another area') or another source (pronounced 'another source').

390,"An applicant for a review of a public tender does not, under the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures, per se acquire the status of a party to an administrative dispute in which the administrative decision awarding the concession is challenged, which concludes a tendering procedure in which he did not participate. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, No U 2088/2001-9 of 30 January 2002 is confirmed. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the contested order, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the defendant's decision of 22.11.2001 under point 1 of the operative part of the order and dismissed the application for interim measures of 23.11.2001 under point 2 of the operative part of the order.By that decision granting a concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services, it was decided to grant the concession to M. d.d. for a period of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal, V., L. It was also decided that the concession shall include the right to use the frequency bands, to install the relevant public telecommunications network, to interconnect the network and that the concessionaire shall be obliged to ensure the operation of its network in accordance with the Regulation on the granting of concessions, with other regulations and with the concession contract, to pay a one-off non-refundable concession fee of 22 billion Slovenian tolls and to pay an annual fee for the use of the allocated part of the radio spectrum. The defendant published a public tender for the award of up to three concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia in the frequency bands 1900 MHz-1980 MHz, 2010 MHz-2025 MHz and 2110 MHz-2170 MHz in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 19/01 of 16.3.2001. The first call for tenders was unsuccessful because only one tender was received, and a new call for tenders for the award of the concession was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 46/01 of 8.6.2001. At the time of the opening of the tenders, the expert committee noted that five potential tenderers had submitted tender documents on the basis of the call for tenders, and that two tenders had been received within the time limit for submission of the tenders within the time limit for submission of tenders. One bid did not contain all the elements required in the tender documents and was therefore not considered. On 3.9.2001, the applicant submitted a request for review of the concession award procedure to the National Audit Office. By decision of 8.11.2001, the latter rejected the request for review. The concession award procedure, which had been suspended as a result of the submitted review, was continued. The expert committee, which drew up its report of 19.11.2001, found that the tender submitted by M.d.d. met the conditions of the tender documents. In the grounds of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgment that it had taken its decision to reject the application on the basis of the preliminary examination of the application under Article 34(1)(4) of the Administrative Disputes Act (CLA). A claimant in an administrative dispute can only be a person who has the status of an active party in the administrative proceedings, a person who has the status of a passive party and a person who has participated in the administrative proceedings as an intervener in order to protect his rights or legal interests. In the procedure for the award of the concession, in addition to the successful concessionaire, parties to the procedure may be those tenderers whose bids were not accepted. The tenders for the concession were submitted by M.d.d. and D.d.o.o. within the tendering period, but the applicant did not participate in the tender. In an administrative dispute challenging a decision taken in an administrative procedure in which the applicant was neither a party nor an intervener, the applicant does not have standing, since the contested decision clearly did not infringe its rights or direct interests based on the law. The applicant has not established the right or the legal interest to assert the claim alleged in the application and its active standing, which is a procedural prerequisite for bringing an administrative action, is not established. The applicant's request for a review of the procedure for the award of the concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services was rejected by decision of the State Audit Commission of 8.11.2001. Article 23(2) of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 78/99 and No 90/99) provides that there is no ordinary or extraordinary remedy against the decisions of the State Audit Board, but that an action may be brought before a competent court to seek damages from the contracting authority. Objections relating to the award procedure which have already been decided by the National Audit Office do not constitute legally relevant objections in the review procedure of the concession award decision. In the explanatory memorandum to 2. point 2 of the operative part of the judgment, the Court of First Instance stated that the applicant had not established that the decision challenged in the action infringed its rights or its direct interests based on the law, which is a procedural prerequisite for a decision on an application for an interim injunction under Article 69 of the Civil Procedure Code. This follows from the reasons set out in recital 1 of the operative part of the judgment, since the applicant has failed to establish its standing to bring the action. The Court of First Instance therefore dismissed the application for interim measures pursuant to Article 69(2) of the Civil Code. <p/> The applicant appeals on all three grounds set out in Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appellant claims that the Court of Appeal should set aside both points of the contested order and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a fresh decision. The applicant claims that it has standing to bring the action and the application for interim measures in the present proceedings. The Court of First Instance bases its position solely on the fact that the applicant did not submit a tender in response to the invitation to tender and thus did not participate directly as an active party or as a passive party or intervener. Such reasoning effectively limits the potential claimants in an administrative dispute exclusively to direct and formal parties to the procedure prior to the adoption of the administrative act, for which there is no legal basis in Article 18 of the CPL. The circle of potential claimants in an administrative dispute is much wider under that provision. Anyone who believes that an administrative act infringes a right or a direct benefit of his or her based on the law may be a claimant. The theory also recognises the active standing of a party who has not even formally participated in the administrative procedure, provided that he can, of course, establish or prove his legal interest. In a tendering procedure, the legal status of intervener within the meaning of Article 43 of the General Administrative Procedure Act cannot exist. It was only possible to participate in the tendering procedure as a tenderer or as an applicant for review under the Act on Review of Public Procurement Procedures. In the review procedure, the applicant was granted the status of a party and active standing. It is reasonable to assume that, taking into account the specificities of the tender procedure, the applicant was indeed a party to the tender procedure as an applicant for review and was granted such status by the defendant and the National Audit Office. It therefore considers that it had already demonstrated its legal interest in participating in the tendering procedure in the procedure preceding the defendant's decision by submitting a request for review, since it did not submit a tender on the ground that the tendering procedure was unlawful. It can therefore legitimately claim that the contested decision of the defendant, as an administrative act adopted in the context of a tendering procedure, infringes its rights and directly benefits. In fact, as a result of the illegality of the invitation to tender, the applicant lost the possibility of obtaining the concession which was the subject of the invitation to tender and which was finally awarded to M. by the contested administrative decision, as an act adopted in a procedure which the applicant claims to have been unlawful. It is untenable to hold that it has active standing to bring an application for review in the same proceedings in which, following the conclusion of those proceedings and the adoption of the administrative act, it does not have active standing to bring the action. Apart from the finding that the applicant did not submit its bid in the tendering procedure and the erroneous assertion that it did not assert or protect its rights in the concession award procedure, that is to say, in the tendering procedure, the Court of First Instance does not give any other substantive reasoning in the contested order. It did not serve the application and the application for interim measures on the defendant for a response. Nor did it hold the main hearing which had been requested in order to further substantiate the allegations by examining witnesses. It did not even state reasons for its decision, since it did not state the reasons on the decisive facts, which constitutes an absolute fundamental infringement of the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. By failing to hold a main hearing, the Court of First Instance substantially infringed the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. In addition, it erred and failed to fully establish the factual situation as regards the applicant's legal status and activities in the tendering procedure itself and its rights and direct benefits, and, as a consequence, it erred in substantive law in holding that the applicant did not have active legal standing to bring the action in the present proceedings. The applicant also has standing to bring an application for interim measures and, in accordance with the provisions of the CPL, fully maintains its application for interim measures in the present case. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant submits that the applicant cannot be a party to these proceedings as it lacks standing. The applicant did not submit a bid for the concession either in the first or in the re-tender. The fact that the applicant has already provided mobile telecommunications services does not automatically confer a legal interest in bringing the present action. Since it did not participate in the concession award procedure by submitting any tender, the concession award decision did not decide on its rights. The administrative measure therefore does not affect her rights or a legitimate interest. The possibility of exercising the right to obtain the concession ended with the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a complete tender for the invitation to tender. The fact that the applicant has been granted a legal interest in the review procedure before the National Audit Office does not automatically confer a legal interest in the administrative proceedings. In the proceedings before the National Audit Commission, the status of a party is determined by Article 9 of the Law on the review of public procurement procedures, whereas in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, it is determined by Article 18 of the CPL. Each law defines the active legal capacity of the parties in a different way. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures provides for a wider range of beneficiaries who may initiate a review procedure on the ground that an independent body is reviewing the legality of the public tender itself. Given that the party has been granted the status of party to the proceedings there, the competent authority has already assessed the legality of the call for tenders and rejected the request for review. The defendant submits, first of all, that the whole tendering procedure is unlawful and that it was therefore not possible for it to participate in the procedure. In the proceedings before the Administrative Court, however, the circle of persons with standing is narrower. It is for the competent court to determine whether the appellant's request to intervene is justified. Such a procedure prevents the chicanery of intervention by those who cannot show any prejudice and who would only make the proceedings more difficult for an active or passive party. The appellant therefore requests the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal as unfounded. <p/> The appeal is not well founded. <p/> In the Court of Appeal's view, the Court of First Instance was correct to dismiss the applicant's action on the basis of paragraph 34(1)(4) of Article 34(1) of the EC Treaty. <p/> of Article 34 of the CPL. The applicant's plea that it has active standing to bring an action in an administrative dispute is unfounded, since it relies on its indirect participation in the tendering procedure by virtue of the fact that it was the applicant in an application for review of a procurement procedure to which it was granted the status of a party. According to Article 18(1) of the CPL, a claimant may be an individual, a legal person, an organisation, a locality, a group of persons and others who consider that a right or a direct benefit of theirs based on a law has been infringed by an administrative act. However, according to the provision of Article 9 of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the RS, No 78/99), a request for review may be lodged by any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority, which is alleged in the request for review as a misconduct of the contracting authority in the procedure for awarding the public contract. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures is a specific regulation governing the legal protection of tenderers in public procurement procedures, which is implemented by reviewing the public procurement procedures defined in the Public Procurement Law, the bodies competent for the protection of the rights of tenderers and the procedure governing the work of the bodies under this Law. However, there is no ordinary or extraordinary legal remedy against a decision of the State Audit Board, only an action before a competent court of law to seek damages from the contracting authority. Given the purpose and object of this law, the active standing in a review procedure is substantively different from that in an administrative dispute. Any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and any person who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority may bring an action for review. For this reason, a party to a review of public procurement procedures does not per se acquire the status of a party to administrative litigation proceedings when the decision to award a concession is challenged. The decision to award a concession puts an end to the tendering procedure, and an action against such a decision may only be brought by persons fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18(1) of the CPL. In the present case, the request for review of the concession award procedure was examined by the National Audit Commission and the specific request of the defendant was rejected. The subject-matter of the administrative dispute cannot therefore be a repetition of the identical claim, which is in fact the applicant's claim. In an administrative procedure, the applicant could only assert a right or a direct benefit based on a right which would be infringed by the decision to grant the concession. The grant of the concession is not a right of the defendant. The defendant's only right in a tendering procedure for the award of a concession is to submit its tender to the contracting authority within the time-limit, on the same terms as the other participants. Neither the Telecommunications Act nor the Regulation on the granting of concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services gives rise to a direct benefit to the applicant based on the Act. It is apparent from the appellant's submissions that the defendant is only claiming an interest in fact in obtaining the concession, and is not demonstrating a legal interest by challenging the concession decision. In the present case, since there is neither a right nor a direct interest of the defendant based on the law which is infringed by the contested administrative measure, the Court of Appeal considers that the Court of First Instance was correct in its decision that the applicant had not established its active standing in the present administrative proceedings. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the action at the preliminary examination stage on the basis of Article 34(1)(4) of the CPL. At that stage of the proceedings, the Court of First Instance ruled exclusively on the applicant's standing, and therefore did not infringe the provision on the main hearing procedure (Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code), since it did not rule on the substance or examine the substance of the contested measure. Nor did it serve copies of the application for interim measures and the application for interim measures with annexes on the defendant at that stage of the proceedings. It does so only after it has not dismissed the action under Article 34 of the Civil Procedure Code or annulled the contested measure under Article 35(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or declared it void under Article 35(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court of First Instance also did not infringe the provision on the procedure in an administrative dispute (Article 72(3) of the CPL), since it based and explained its decision on the distinction between tendering, review and public procurement procedures and an administrative dispute (pages 3 and 4 of the judgment). <p/> The pleas in law alleging erroneous and incomplete findings of fact and incorrect application of the substantive law, however, relate only to the applicant's active standing. <The appellant's plea in law alleging that the application for interim measures was dismissed is also unfounded. The applicant does not have standing to bring an application for interim measures if it does not have standing to bring an action in administrative proceedings and, moreover, does not state on what grounds that that part of the order is unlawful. <p/> The Court of Appeal held that the grounds on which the applicant challenges the order of the Court of First Instance are not established. Nor are the grounds on which the Court of First Instance is required to act of its own motion. It therefore dismissed the appeal as unfounded on the basis of Article 73 in conjunction with Article 68 of the CLA and upheld the order of the Court of First Instance.",Legal/Regulation,train

400,"Fairy tales and stories <p/> ABOUT Fairy tales and songs <p/> Children, do you like fairy tales and songs? I love them so much! It's cold outside and I'm writing these animal stories for you. My thoughts rush back to my childhood in the Slovenian Highlands. I see our family - the Ježe family, we were told - gathered in a vineyard around a kerosene lamp. Mica is reading stories, my father is mending shoes, the rest of us are shelling pumpkins for oil, sifting buckwheat for kasha sausages, shredding corn off the cob for corn fritters or sifting beans. Some women spin. <p/> No, I can't say that the somewhat pale light of the kerosene lamp made my childhood any sadder, on the contrary, it was quite joyful, full of curiosity, longing and duty.... <p/> In the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows in the corners and haylofts were full of fears, especially when our neighbour Ferdinand - the eternal young man - told us about the enchanted queens in the enchanted castle, about the dragon who had come for the castle's daughter, about the serpent in the spring, about the witches, the devil, the goblins, and about death. Fairy tales about the nuns and the judges must have been told to each other by the ancient Slavs. And Ferdinand had to tell us the happy one about the ""ass-gold"" several times. <p/> It was cold outside. Snow covered the hill and down the hill, and smoke from the chimneys of the dwarf wood-houses was drawn straight up into the sky, across which the mysterious moon passed from time to time. But it was warm behind the frosted shutters. A fire crackled in the stove or in the cooker. Somewhere in the distance, on another hill, dogs barked and howled at the pale moon... <p/> At that time, when I was young, nature was still clean. There was laughter and weeping, songs and quarrels, and then again visits, feasts, baptisms, funerals and carols. <p/> Today, all that is very different. After the first, a second war, four years of suffering and misery each time. Between the wars, life changes. The Partisans liberated our homeland, we erected memorials to our dead heroes. We began to live a new life, as our greatest hero, Tito, had envisioned in his early youth. <p/> Today, instead of a kerosene lamp in the middle of a pile of beans on the table, a light bulb from the ceiling glows. Electricity lights, heats, drives machines and cooks. Today, it is not Ferdinand telling the neighbour's fairy tales. We sit in front of the television and see and hear what is happening in our homeland and far beyond. We talk long distances and call acquaintances by pressing the electric bell... <p/> We could hardly have dreamt of all this in our youth. But nature was cleaner, wider and quieter. Perhaps at carnivals or at feasts, village musicians would swish. And on occasions, the song came straight from the throat, not from the radio or from gramophone records. It came from the heart, our beautiful Slovenian song. <p/> The past turned into memories. I can still see my mother looking after me when I go out into the world, to art, to Golden Prague. After many years, I have returned to my Slovenian hills, among you, to tell you some animal tales, sing a song, make a clay sculpture and paint a picture. You see, I can do it all! <p/> Written on the leg after New Year 1974",Opinion/Argumentation,train
402,"Doc. dr. Matjaž Ambrožič (* 1967), after graduating from the social science and language gymnasium and serving his military service, began his theological studies at the Faculty of Theology in Ljubljana in 1987. He was ordained a priest in 1993. He first worked as a chaplain in Kočevje (1993-1996) and in Novo mesto - Šmihel (1996-1996). In the autumn of 1997 he went to Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he completed his post-graduate studies at the Faculty of Church History and received his doctorate in 2002. Then he was a spiritual assistant in Vrhnika (2001 - 2004) and today he works in the parish of Ljubljana - Stožice (2004 -). He is engaged in scientific research and lecturing at the TEOF of the University of Ljubljana and at its Unit in Maribor (assistant 2001, assistant professor 2004). His scientific and research activity is devoted to the field of local church and world history, as well as art history. He also spends a lot of time studying archival material. The results of Ambrožič's scientific research activity are mainly scientific monographs and treatises: - Bell Ringing in Slovenia, AES 15 (1993) - Il ruolo ecclesiastico, culturale e politico di dott.

The strike will last until called off. <p/> The Sanitec programme combines the production of sanitary and kitchen fittings and the production of forgings. <p/> It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maribor Foundries Maribor (MLM), which failed to convince enough shareholders at Tuesday's general meeting to recapitalise. <p/> At the AGM, the owners are expected to decide on a recapitalisation in the form of a new conversion of NKBM, Abanka Vipa and Probanka's receivables into equity.

Alpha Energy, a company in Bellingham, Washington, which manufactures photovoltaic energy systems, has built a real small solar power plant that will generate more than one million kilowatt hours of energy per year. This energy will be used to light up the car parks of the used car dealers who have made this investment, and will also allow them to offer their customers free plug-ins for their electric cars. Most importantly, of course, they will be feeding this solar energy into New Jersey's energy grid. <p/>This cleaner technology investment will save 860 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the same amount of energy that would have been generated from non-renewable sources such as coal, gas or oil.

410,"Some time ago I decided to go in for rainwater tanks. Since I have a garden, and since last year - as usual - the water ran out, and I intend to enlarge the garden this year, I had no choice but to buy this thing and get water for the rainy days. First of all, I was looking at flea cisterns. Then I sent out some enquiries for new cisterns. Finally, I found black tanks, the price was good, and I bought two. As the seller was willing to bring the two tanks to me, I squeezed his hand for another EUR 10 for the transport and the deal was done. Then the work began. <p/> On the first day we dug up one huge bush. We not only dug it up, we also broke it down into several smaller ones and on the second day we planted these smaller bushes by the road in another part of the garden. The next day we dug up the ornamental grass and planted it also in smaller pieces in another part of the garden (nothing goes away here). On the third day, we dug the soil for the trellis I had imagined. As the ground is uneven and I want the cisterns to be higher than the ground, they had to be raised. On the fourth day we made the trusses and then waited five days for 4 euros so that we could buy two knees for the gutter and finish the job. <p/> We waited five days for those 4 euros... :) You don't know whether to laugh or cry. On Tuesday I went to the ATM to see if by any chance any virtual money had come in, and yesterday when I checked again, it said that the card was blocked. Oops... the money was in the account, but how to get it and what happened on that night from Tuesday to Wednesday, I wondered. Lo and behold, the execution from Durs arrived. The contributions for the Social Insurance Institution, which I hadn't paid by the due date. I knew that would be the case, but I was kind of hoping that I would get the EUR 600 I had left (I had already paid EUR 700) before they remembered me. The important thing is that I paid the loan and that I still have some money left for the essentials, and the EUR 120 that the banks have charged me for the blocking, the execution and the costs, I will also have to swallow. In short, when I got the 4 euros, we could finish the job. Thank you... <p/> I know, yes, the plastic is not very pretty to look at, but I'm going to do some studying. First I need to see how the inox or whatever is around this plate heats up, then I'll either just cover the tanks with bamboo or plant some ivy around it. In any case, it will not stay as it is. Otherwise, I like it. The garden is right next door, the v-tank holds 1000 l, and the field is a little further on. It has to grow like a ludo, I would say.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

415,"Origins <p/> Despite claims by the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan has always been part of China, its historical records do not record this. The earliest official records of Taiwan date back to the Three Kingdoms Period (222-280), when the first exploratory expedition of several thousand people was sent to the island from the Kingdom of Wu. However, in these records, Taiwan is identified as an area outside the boundaries of Chinese civilisation. When the island began to be colonised by foreign powers in the 16th century, the majority of the island's inhabitants were of Malayo-Polynesian origin, not of Han ethnicity. <p/>European trading bases (1624-1662) <p/>The first European conquerors to take an interest in Taiwan were the Portuguese, but they did not colonise the island. They called it Ihla Formosa, or Beautiful Island, and took the name with them to the world in the mid-16th century. The Dutch, who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines in 1622, initially settled the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), where they established military rule. From there, they controlled maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and made passage difficult for Portuguese traders. In 1624, they were driven out by Ming troops and relocated to the main island of Taiwan. From Tainan, they dominated the south-western part of the island. The northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the Spanish conquistadors in 1626, but the Dutch drove them out in 1642. The Dutch government encouraged Chinese immigration to Taiwan because it needed a large labour force on the rice and sugar cane plantations. <p/>The Zheng family government (1662-1683) <p/> In China, Ming subjects fought against the Manchus, who gradually occupied China. In 1644, the Manchu Qing dynasty ruled China and the loyal Ming military forces fled to Taiwan. Commander Zheng Cheng-gong 鄭成功 (Koxinga), who had settled in northern Taiwan, continued to fight the Manchus for almost two decades, with the aim of re-establishing the Ming dynasty in China. After several unsuccessful battles in China, in 1661 he rebelled against the Dutch government in Taiwan and negotiated an agreement to take power. 1662 saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Dongning 東寧, which, after Koxinga's death, was ruled by a son and a grandson until 1683, when the Qing dynasty took power. At that time, Taiwan became administratively part of Fujian Province (臺灣府) and thus part of the multi-ethnic Manchu Empire of the Qing Dynasty. <p/> Qing Dynasty (1683-1895) <p/> During this period, thousands of poor Chinese immigrants came to Taiwan in search of a new start and a better life. Most of them were employed on cane and rice plantations, which were the main export commodities. As a result of the Opium Wars (between 1839-42 and 1856-60), 4 Taiwanese ports were opened to foreign traders, making Taiwan increasingly attractive in international trade. Taiwanese sugar, camphor, indigo and tea were highly sought-after export commodities. During the Sino-French War of Vietnam (1884-5), the northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the French and it was only then that the Chinese court slowly became aware of the vulnerability of the Chinese coastline to attack by foreign forces and the strategic role Taiwan played in this. The signing of the armistice between France and the Qing dynasty was followed by a reorganisation of the political administration, making Taiwan an independent province of the Qing Empire in 1885. The provincial capital is moved from Tainan to Taipei, and gradually Taiwan becomes much stronger. <p/>Japanese rule (1895-1945) in Taiwan and developments on the mainland<p/> In 1894, the Japanese invasion of Korea, which the Qing dynasty regarded as its tributary state, sparked the first Sino-Japanese War. Under the harsh terms of the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty of 1895, which formally ended the war, Taiwan, together with the Penghu Islands, was handed over to Japan. The people of Taiwan were disappointed by the dynasty's decision and tried to fight the Japanese invaders on their own. They established the Republic of Taiwan 臺灣民主國, which survived 5 months of fierce battles, from May to October 1895. <p/> During the 1950s, Japan carried out a systematic assimilation of the Taiwanese and rapidly developed the island's economy. Taiwan had by then developed the most modern industrial and transport infrastructure in Asia (except for Japan itself), which set the stage for Taiwan's further development. <p/> In China, however, disillusionment with Manchurian rule grew in the late 19th century. The political programme of the revolutionary Dr Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙 Sun Yixian / 孫中山 Sun Zhongshan), who fought for the overthrow of the Manchurian monarchy of the Qing dynasty, gradually gained increasing popular support. His political ideals were summed up in a doctrine called the ""Three People's Principles"" 三民主義 (nationalism, democracy and national welfare), which aspired to an independent and democratic China. On 10 October 1911 (Xinhai Revolution 辛亥革命), Sun's military forces successfully captured the capital of Hubei province, Wuchang, and proclaimed secession from the Manchurian Qing dynasty. The revolution gradually engulfed the whole of central and southern China. These rebellious, south-central provinces declared independence and established an independent republic with Nanjing as its capital. The provisional government of the newly established Republic of China, headed by Sun Yatsen (his official enthronement as President on 1 January 1912 is considered as the founding day of the Republic of China and is still celebrated in Taiwan today), was very weak as the northern provinces were still loyal to the Manchurian Empire. In order to preserve national unity and avoid civil war, Sun renounced the presidency and offered it to the Northern Army General Yuan Shikai 袁世凱, who on 12 February 1912 obtained the abdication of the last Manchurian Emperor, Xuantong 宣統皇帝 (Puyi), ending the reign of the last dynasty in China. The Republic of China thus became the legitimate heir to the Qing territory, which at that time included Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Taiwan was then still under Japan). Yuan Shikai soon disappointed the revolutionaries greatly. Instead of democracy and social reform, he sought to establish a new dynasty and the imperial throne, and to destroy the Party, thus completely flouting the Constitution of the Republic. Sun Yatsen therefore reorganised his alliance (the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance 中國同盟會) into the Chinese Nationalist Party 國 民 黨 (KMT). After a failed attempt at revolution again, he relocated to Japan, where he continued the revolution until Yuan's death in 1916. In 1917, he returned to Guangzhou and worked to reunite a completely fragmented China ruled by military strongmen. He founded the famous Huangpu 黃埔 (Whampoa) military academy, which became a centre for raising a revolutionary army to reunify China. After Sun's death (1925), General Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正 Jiang Zhongzheng / 蔣介石 Jiang Jieshi) took supreme command of the army. In his famous three-year military expedition to northern China, Chiang defeated many feudal lords and annexed the military provinces to the rule of the Republic of China. In March 1927, Nanjing was restored as the capital of the Republic of China, and with the capture of Beijing in 1928, Chiang triumphantly completed the Northern Expedition. Power over China thus passed to the Nationalists, but unification did not bring lasting peace. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921 and initially working with Chiang, was gaining more and more strength, and the ideological tensions between the two parties were becoming increasingly insurmountable. China was increasingly threatened by the danger of a Japanese invasion. <p/> Japan launched an attack on Manchuria in 1931, establishing a puppet state known as Manzhuguo 滿洲國. The last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Puyi, was chosen as the formal leader. For reasons of national interest, the Communists and Nationalists then reunited to fight the Japanese forces, but the cooperation was merely symbolic and there was no genuine truce between the two factions. The incident between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing in 1937 led to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for eight years, until the end of the Second World War. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which ignited the Second World War, the Republic of China, which was on the side of the Allies, played the role of an important war front, receiving massive American aid. At the end of 1943, a declaration (the Cairo Declaration) was signed in Cairo by US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Chiang Kaishek, in which the return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands was assigned to the Republic of China. The Japanese surrender and the Postdam Declaration adopted in August 1945 gave legitimacy to the Cairo Declaration. The departure of the Japanese forces, however, refocused all the energies of the communists and nationalists on the battle for their own power. This gave the Chinese civil war full momentum. <p/>Republic of China power <p/> After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Nationalist ROK army, on behalf of the Allied Powers, invaded Taiwan and accepted the Japanese surrender. On 25 October 1945, Taiwan officially became part of the Republic of China. <p/> White Terror 白色恐怖 1945-1972 <p/> The Taiwanese people were very happy to see the restoration of ties with the mainland, the departure of the Japanese army and the arrival of representatives of the Nationalist ROK government. However, relations between the Taiwanese people and the new immigrants from the Chinese mainland soon became strained. The priority of the ROC government was the conquest of the whole of China, while Taiwan and the local population were not of paramount importance to the government of the time. The early period of the ROC government in Taiwan was marked by corruption, illegal land grabbing, inflation, outbreaks of infectious diseases and shortages of basic goods. All of this consequently led to one of Taiwan's greatest tragedies: the 228 二二八事件 Incident. The incident took place on 27 February 1947, when a woman illegally selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Taipei was attempted to be punished by a group of police officers and agents of the Monopoly Bureau. The scuffle ended in a shoot-out in which a Taiwanese bystander was killed. Immediately, tensions arose between the discriminated civilian population on the one hand and the KMT civil servants on the other. <p/> The conflicts escalated into mass demonstrations, all of which were suppressed in blood. Thousands of Taiwanese, mainly educated people, were killed by government forces at the time. Although repression in the later period did not reach the level of 1947, political arrests and detentions were commonplace in Taiwan until the early 1970s. This period has therefore earned the name ""beil terror"". The incident planted the seeds of hatred between the locals and the newcomers, with far-reaching consequences for Taiwanese society. The newcomers made up only 15 % of the island's population, but for many years they maintained their superiority over the 85-strong native population. It was not until 1995 that the ROC-Nationalist Party government, headed by President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝 Li Denghui), formally apologised for the repression and passed a law to compensate all victims of the terror, declaring 28 February a public holiday two years later. <p/>ROC government relocation to Taiwan <p/> In 1949, the Nationalist troops in China were finally defeated. To escape the Communists, Chiang Kai-shek and his government took refuge in Taiwan with some 1.5 million supporters, where he established a new base for the R.C. On 1 October, Mao Zedong, the commander of the Communist troops, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tiananmen Square. Thus was born the ""two Chinas"". Both governments, the PRC and the ROC, asserted their legitimacy over the territory of the whole of China. With the support of the USA, the ROC, as the legitimate representative of the whole of China, established close diplomatic relations with most of the democratic countries of the world and retained its seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the international situation turned in favour of the PRC. During this period, however, the political and economic development of the island, independent of the PRC, gradually transformed the Taiwanese people's self-conception of their identity and belonging.",Information/Explanation,train

425,"How to buy a phone <p/> A normal smartphone is the same in hardware as a computer from a few years ago. Because we always have it with us, it is a powerful productive tool that is always at our disposal. Computers have made us more efficient, why not smartphones? <p/> With hundreds of millions of smart devices and the same (if not less) productivity, the main question that arises is whether it might all be too much? We carry a games console, a web station, a music box, a mailbox, a navigation system and the list goes on. Too often, we choose a phone because it is overloaded with features, and we end up using only five per cent of the hardware and software. The situation is reminiscent of the power ratio in word processors, where Microsoft Word is still the leader, even though most of us use only a handful of bundled features that could easily be covered by any free alternative. As with tablets, the most important thing is to know what we want from a smartphone. <p/> Choosing a smartphone is, at first sight, very similar to deciding on a tablet companion. The operating systems are almost all the same, they have the same applications, advantages and disadvantages. In principle, there is no difference between a phone and a tablet. In addition, it is wise to have both devices in the same camp, so that we do not buy apps twice and do not catch ourselves while working with the user interface. Unfortunately, it turns out in practice that smartphone buyers do not make their choices based on hardware. When they buy, they often even overlook the attractive design and usability of the bundled apps, because the pace at which devices fly off the shelves is dictated by mobile operators, which is why sales figures for different phones vary so much from country to country. If the country's biggest mobile operator drops the price of the best Finnish Nokia model to one euro at the time of bundling, it will outperform, say, Samsung's champion overnight, even though the Korean sells like hotcakes around the world and nobody wants a Scandinavian Windows phone despite its excellence.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

435,"For your consideration... <p/> I belong to that school of modern observers who believe that the world is at a turning point. In the course of history we have repeatedly lost confidence in eternal truths. Among them, in religion, in the State and in the world being flat. Today, we are giving up this trust to the market as we knew it until recently. The most radical language of new values and demands for a reorganisation of the system is spoken today by civil society initiatives. They do not see the existing model of market capitalism as the solution for a sustainable and just society. A new language is also being spoken by a growing part of the economy, which is adapting its business models, attitudes and value creation processes to values and co-creating them in dialogue with the needs of the people. Social and economic value creation processes are being reinvented, based on self-organisation, commodity exchange, participatory and democratic forms of ownership. The present is beginning to speak a language that holds the promise of radical change for the better. <p/> Not many people speak this language, but they are increasingly being heard. Because we all want to believe that something better is possible. Because we need to believe that better can always be (more) possible. <p/> We all understand part of this language. Some say it is useless, that it is outdated. Others believe that it can only partially explain and justify the needs of modern society. Still others add new slogans to enrich it and throw out concepts that do not belong. We seem to be reassembling the alphabet of the world. And, given the current indicators of the overall balance sheet, this is more than necessary. What this alphabet will bring will be determined by the concrete actions and changes that this new language will trigger. We can still hope that we are living in times of change. <p/> As we write this first blog entry, it is also our first text entry dedicated to the online community that has started to coalesce in recent months around the people who co-create the Vive mission [ 1 ]. In the period behind us, this community has taken small but courageous steps towards the goal of a better life that defines us as a collective, as collaborators, as colleagues, as friends, as a community. While we are aware that we could not have set ourselves a broader goal than a better life, we are slowly realising that this goal has very clear trajectories. <p/> In the process of defining our values, fleshing out our goals and strategising our work plan, we have continually stumbled over the breadth of the notion of a better life. What values bind us together as a community of colleagues? Which values are those that represent our minimum common denominator? How do we offer something truly new, something that is our product, in a crowd of organisations, ideas and activities that all promise us a better life? <p/> If, after this paragraph, you think that we have found all the answers, we must disappoint you.

439,"The Bologna Renewal <p/> The central objective of the Bologna Declaration (BD) is the creation of an open Common Higher Education Area (CEEA), allowing European students and higher education staff to move freely within it, to have comparable skills and competences, and to be employable. <p/> The Bologna Process takes its name from the Bologna Declaration, signed in Bologna (Italy) in 1999 by ministers responsible for higher education from 29 European countries, including Slovenia. The document set the guidelines for the development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process (BP) is to be implemented in the signatory countries (and other countries later associated) by 2010. <p/> The objective is to be achieved through various measures such as the establishment of comparable and transparent higher education structures and levels, mutual recognition of relevant and comparable higher education qualifications, the establishment of mutually recognised credit and quality assurance systems, the promotion of student and teacher mobility, the development of the European dimension in education and the increased competitiveness of European higher education in the world. <p/> The BP Guidelines also link to one of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, which foresees that by 2010 Europe will be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. <p/> The path to the BE is also represented by previous documents, reflecting in particular the aspirations for university autonomy, comparable qualifications and their recognition within the ERA, and their standardisation. <p/> Despite the scope opened up by the BD, it is not a comprehensive document specifying implementation and serving as a ""how-to guide"", but leaves a large degree of autonomy to HEIs and partners. Nevertheless, the CBD highlights some key points: <p/> the central role of universities in the development of the European cultural dimensions <p/> the independence and autonomy of universities <p/> the ERA as the main route to mobility and employability of EU citizens and the overall development of the continent <p/> the adaptation of higher education systems to constant social change and the evolution of scientific knowledge <p/> the international competitiveness of European higher education. <p/> The main objectives of the BD Declaration are: <p/> the adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees, including the ""Diploma Supplement"" form - in order to foster the recruitment of European citizens and the international competitiveness of the European higher education system <p/> the adoption of a system with two main levels of study, the Bachelor (minimum 3 years) and the Postgraduate (Master, PhD) degrees awarded after the first level, is also relevant for the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification <p/> establishing the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) as an appropriate means of facilitating greater student mobility Credits could also be obtained through lifelong learning <p/> promoting mobility <p/> promoting European cooperation in quality assurance, by developing comparable criteria and methodologies <p/> fostering the necessary European dimension in higher education, in particular in relation to curriculum development, inter-institutional cooperation, mobility schemes and integrated study, training and research programmes. <p/> Ministers of the signatory countries meet every 2 years to assess the state of implementation of the BP in the individual Member States and in the ERA as a whole.

The number of associated countries has increased significantly since 1999, to 45. <p/> What does the reform of higher education bring you? <p/> At the end of May this year, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted an amendment to the Law on Higher Education, and in mid-June the Law on Recognition and Valuation of Education was adopted. These two laws constitute the basis for the implementation of the higher education reform, which is based on the guidelines of the Bologna Process, or the process of creating a single European Higher Education Area. The reform will be introduced gradually by higher education institutions (faculties, academies, etc.), and the following innovations will be the most visible for students: <p/> 1. New structure of studies <p/> a) Studies will now be shorter and divided into three diploma levels: <p/> * 1. Bachelor's degree, which lasts three or four years and is run as a higher professional degree or university degree * Bachelor's degree, or Master's degree, which lasts one or two years (so that together with the first bachelor's degree in the same field of expertise, it lasts five years) * Bachelor's degree, or Doctoral degree, which lasts three years. <p/> Exceptions are study programmes for professions regulated by European Union directives, which may be structured differently. <p/> b) Conditions for admission to the higher degree <p/> To be admitted to the second cycle, you must have completed a first cycle degree in a relevant professional field. If it is not in the same field of study (e.g. if a student wishes to continue his/her studies in economics at a second level after completing a first degree in mechanical engineering), a maximum of 60 credits of additional study may be prescribed for this transition. These can be taken as part of the electives in the first bachelor's degree, or through examinations and courses prior to enrolment in the second bachelor's degree. <p/> Admission to the third cycle is open to anyone who has completed the second cycle, who has completed programmes in professions governed by EU directives which are worth 300 credits or more, or who has completed a four-year programme at level 1 and who has demonstrated specific achievements which can be assessed at 60 credits. <p/> As a general rule, 60 credits will be awarded for admission to the new two-year programmes at the second cycle to those who have completed the old bachelor's degree programmes in the same or related fields of study. <p/> The completion of a specialisation may be used for admission to the third cycle only if there has been a notable success in research or professional work, which may be assessed at 60 credits, or if additional study requirements of 60 credits have been set. <p/> Those who have completed a master's degree under the old system shall be awarded 60 credits of study requirements on entry to the third cycle (doctoral studies). <p/> c) Deadline for the introduction of the new structure and transition period <p/> The first academic year in which enrolment in the new degree programmes should be possible will be 2005/2006, and the last academic year for the introduction of the new study structure will be 2009/2010. <p/> Students enrolled in higher education before the introduction of the new study programmes will continue and complete their studies under the conditions in force at the time of their enrolment, up to the end of the academic year 2015/2016. If a student repeats a year and the programme in which he/she enrolled is no longer available, he/she shall continue and complete his/her studies under the new study programmes. <p/> 2. Diploma Supplement <p/> All students will receive a Diploma Supplement free of charge together with their diploma, which will be issued in Slovene and one of the official languages of the European Union. The Diploma Supplement is an integral part of the diploma which includes information about the higher education system and the student's performance (grades), as well as a unified description of the nature, level, content and status of the study programme. Students will benefit from the introduction of the Diploma Supplement, as all the skills and knowledge they have acquired during their studies will now be recorded in the Diploma Supplement, which will also make it easier for them to find a good job and to enrol for further studies. <Study requirements in the study programmes will now be evaluated in terms of credit points (ECTS), which means that each student's workload in the official programme will be credited (the work a student puts in to complete the requirements, including seminars, tutorials, independent study, lectures, the preparation of a thesis, etc.). Each year of the study programme will comprise 60 credits. The first cycle will be 180 or 240 credits (three or four years), the second cycle will be 60 or 120 credits (one to two years, but in such a way that, in the same field of expertise, together with the first cycle, the programme lasts for five years), and the third cycle will be 180 credits (three years). <Joint study programmes <p/> Higher education institutions will be allowed to establish and run joint study programmes with other Slovenian and foreign higher education institutions. This means that students will study at different higher education institutions within one study programme and will obtain one joint degree at the end of their studies. <p/> ... will now be cheaper, shorter and simpler and will replace the nostrification system used until now. <p/> 6. Tuition fees and access to studies <p/> No tuition fees can be charged for full-time studies at public higher education institutions at the first degree level. Free studies at the second cycle will be provided to at least 30 % of students, with social status, regional representation and the scarcity of professions being taken into account as criteria for determining the proportion of students to be included in this ratio, in the ratio 70:20:10. <Co-governance and student participation will be increased <p/> Student membership of higher education bodies has been increased from one in seven to one in five, and students now have one in five votes in the election of university rectors. Student surveys will also be given greater importance in the area of student co-governance. Students will also be represented in the Public Agency for Higher Education, which will carry out external evaluations of higher education. <p/> 8. Foreign students: <p/> can receive scholarships in Slovenia, but only if the principle of reciprocity is applied <p/> lectures will be able to be organised in a foreign language, even if the lecture is not also organised in Slovene.",Information/Explanation,train

444,"Frames for your posters <p/> There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering poster frames. We also need to consider where the frames and posters will be placed. If it is a marketing poster that will be installed outside, you need to be aware that it will be exposed to the weather. It is wise in this case to purchase waterproof frames so that the first storm does not destroy the posters, because in this case our efforts would be for nothing. The easiest way to find quality poster frames is online, as there are many quality manufacturers (3d art). Of course, it is always best to choose one where you can see at first glance a good price/quality ratio. Frames also differ in a few other ways, mainly in terms of where they will be hung. So you can choose from shop window frames, wall frames, hanging frames and, wouldn't you believe it, car frames. In fact, larger vehicles can be fitted with frames designed for marketing posters. Not only are frames made in traditional sizes, but you can also adjust the size of the frames to suit your needs and your poster format. Nowadays, it is well known that designers love to be creative and for creative posters you will also need creative frames. It is for the latter that some companies specialising in the production of marketing accessories will be able to help you and provide you with what you expect at the best prices. You should also consider that the frames will be functional and that you will be able to easily change the posters on display.",Instruction,train

450,"Emissions of dense white smoke - Štore Ironworks <p/> For the last few months, the Štore Ironworks has been emitting abnormally large quantities of dense white smoke into the air on a daily basis, which is very smelly and, I am sure, very harmful to health (old iron with admixtures such as paint, grease and other hazardous substances). The emissions always start in the evening, with very dense clouds of white smoke spreading most often to the eastern part of Celje (depending on the wind). The timing of the release suggests that it is deliberate. Why don't they do it in the morning! ! ? ? <p/> I would ask for the following clarifications: <p/> Does the Municipality of Celje know about this problem? <p/> Why the Environment and Spatial Planning Inspectorate does not act or did not act when the occupancy permit was issued. <p/> Comments (1) <p/> 06 July 2006 at 09:38 <p/> You have contacted the Municipality of Celje with questions that we cannot answer accurately. There are several companies operating in the area of the former Štore ironworks: Steel Štore (formerly Inexa Štore d.o.o.), Valji d.o.o., Energetika d.o.o., Kovis Livarna d.o.o., ITRO Štore. The control of emissions from these facilities is not carried out by the Municipality of Celje, but by the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Inspectorate for the Environment and Spatial Planning, Unit Celje, Krekov trg 9, 3000 Celje. The Inspectorate is responsible both for controlling emissions from technological installations and for verifying whether the installation has an occupancy permit in accordance with the Building Construction Act. You are advised to address your questions to them. The inspectorate also has information on which undertakings are operating in compliance with the regulations and which have yet to bring their operations into line. According to Article 172 of the Environmental Protection Act, companies will have to obtain an environmental permit for installations that may cause pollution on a large scale by 31 October 2007. The law stipulates that if an undertaking fails to obtain an environmental permit by the prescribed deadline, the Ministry will issue a decision on the cessation of the operation of the installation.",Correspondence,train
452,"While enjoying a stroll through the colourful streets of Burano at the end of April, I was interrupted by a telephone call from Stojan asking 'Hi, Momak. Would you like to go to Mont Blanc? "" Although it was already warm in summer, I froze for a moment. My answer was yes. An old holiday must be made the most of. If it is an active one, so much the better. <p/> After all the coordination, Polona, Stojan and I are finally part of a mini-team that monitors the weather forecast over Shamonix and gathers information on a daily basis. On Monday, we make a quick decision to leave on the morning of Tuesday 13 May... from rainy Ljubljana. We set off for Italy, past Venice, Milan, towards Aosta and through the tunnel under Mont Blanc to Chamonix. On the way, we have a coffee on the Italian autostrada with Klemen, who is going to the same places on business as a mountain guide. <p/> In the evening we arrive in a still cloudy town under snow-capped peaks. You can't see the peaks, but you can feel the cold of the glaciers. <p/> In the evening we are in the same hostel as Klemen Gričar and Tomaž Jakofčič, ""gasterbajters"" with a lot of experience up there. They give us selfless advice and answer all our questions. <p/> Our original plan was to take the gondola on Wednesday to the Aiguille di midi, 3842 metres high, from where we would ski down the Vallee Blanche and do a tour to the Torino hut, where we would spend the night. On Thursday, the plan was to ski down the Valee Blanche to Montevers and then take the cog railway back to Chamonix. <p/> On Friday we planned to ride again to the Aiguille di midi mid station, and from there climb up to the Gran Mulets hut, and on Saturday night start for the summit. The weather forecast for Saturday was also promising. <p/> Polona, at the suggestion of Klemena, checked the reservation at the Gran Mulets hut and was informed that we had a reservation from Thursday to Friday. Apparently the dec up there had written the date wrong when the first booking was made. <p/> The combination of days, times, reservations starts. In the end, we come to the conclusion that we will climb up to the Torino hut on Wednesday, descend into the valley on Thursday and immediately climb back up and to the Gran Mulet hut. Well, the plan is one thing, the reality is another. <p/> When we arrive at the Aiguille di Midi lookout, we do not even get a panoramic view, let alone the conditions for skiing on glaciers covered with 30 cm of fresh snow. Fog and clouds obscure the peaks and descend to the valley. This time the weathermen have kicked the darkness. <p/> This is this from the acclimatisation tour. Unfortunately, we descended to the valley by gondola. <p/> On Thursday we finally wake up to a clear morning. <p/> We take the gondola up to 2,310 m, to the Plan de l'Aiguille, and from there ski under the north face of the Aiguille de midi towards the Gran Mulets hut. <p/> Soon, the full majesty of the mountains and glaciers is revealed. <p/> The sun is already warming up strongly, but the ice sculptures are still mighty. <p/> Before crossing the Bosson at the Jonction section, we take narrow bridges over glacial crevasses to reach the flank below the Gran Mulets hut, which stands on top of a rocky ridge. <p/> From here, the Aiguille di midi is visible from the other side, with Chamonix below. <p/> On the other side of the flank, icebergs glisten in the sun. <p/> At the bottom of the hut, we take off our skis and follow the carved path up to the hut, chain and rope in tow. <p/> In the hut, we settle into our shared beds and wait for dinner. While we wait, I do a few laps around the house... <p/> Next to the hut is a building which, if it had water in it, could be called a toilet. So it can only be called a ""shithole"" with a capital R, as the ""septic tank"" is down there on a glacier somewhere. <p/> Prayer flags colour the day. <p/> The sun slowly goes to rest, and up here the real show of light and colour begins. First, the snow expanses take on a whole new hue with soft shadows... <p/> The wind doesn't let up up there. <p/> A ball of fire will slowly hide under the clouds. <p/> The permafrost under the hut ensures a constant climate. <p/> And it's... day. My 44th , ... birthday. It was beautiful. <p/> When the sun hadn't even set, we were all in bed ... by 3am. Then up, breakfast, a night descent along the chain and rope to the snow below the hut and a start in the glare of headlamps to the summit. <p/> We walk in the dark on the groomed spur for a good while before the day begins to wake up. The lights are still burning in the town ... <p/> It starts with blue light up here ... <p/> Slowly the outlines of the hills turn into colourful pictures. <p/> The glaciers remain cold despite the first warm rays of the sun ... <p/> ... and the crevasses beneath the Dôme du Goûter are menacing. <p/> And when you look around, everything is still so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful. <p/> The valley is slowly waking up while it's coldest up here. <p/> You talk to the clouds and the nettles and ask them to let the sun go ... <p/> And the top is so close ... and far away at the same time. <p/> The last metres below the Vallot bivouac are pretty blown. The skis go on the ruzak, and instead of skis, I mount the crampons on my feet. The breath was getting deeper here, but there was no real strength in my legs. After a good five hours of walking we reach the bivouac. <Polona and Stojan are already at the bivouac when I get there. Looking down ... <p/> ... towards Mont Maudit ... <p/> ... and towards the one we came for. <p/> Ahead of us, there are already a few convoys going at a slow pace towards the summit. <p/> There is some hesitation about whether to go with or without skis towards the summit. In the end, we decide to go without. Meanwhile, Klemen continues past the bivouac with his team. <p/> We follow a little way behind him. After a few hundred metres, I realise that my lungs are straining almost to empty and my muscles simply don't have enough energy anymore. The pace is getting slower and slower, and at this rate we would have blown our timetable for the descent. There is no alternative but to turn around. I give Stojan and Polona a clear path to the top, but they decide to descend. <p/> Meanwhile, the wind picks up a bit up there. <p/> We continue to enjoy the views as we prepare for the descent. <p/> The summit will wait ... until next time. Meanwhile, one team is already skiing down the north side of the mountain. <p/> Another hello to the summit, and then the descent. <p/> For the first few pitches the snow is hard, blown, icy in places, and so are the muscles. I stop several times, trying to enjoy at least the views <p/> Below the bivouac, the skiing is better. The only distraction from carefree powder is the thought that we are near and on a glacier, and that there are glacial crevasses hiding under the snow. The fact that the previous day a mountaineer fell into a crevasse fifteen metres deep also gives us food for thought. He was lucky in the accident, as he was pulled to safety unharmed by helicopter rescuers. <p/> During our stops, we admire the snow and ice masses, so innocently white, yet menacing and dangerous. <p/> We ski towards the approach. The snow becomes a little crusty in places, a little heavier lower down, but still skiable. <p/> Soon we are above the Grand Mulets hut. <p/> We cross the Bossons over the Jonction, strung up. We are not the only ones. Somehow we are skiing at the same time with two Spaniards and a group of Austrians. <p/> The sun is already quite strong down here and it is not very pleasant to wait in line to cross the glacier. We are quickly across, then under the northern walls of the Aguilla di Midi we continue our way to the middle station of the gondola. <p/> The crossing is rather protracted, more so than the other way round, as we have some work to do. Finally, the greenery of the valley and the gondola come into view. <p/> We arrive in Chamonix in the afternoon, beautifully tired, hungry and thirsty. Maybe even a little disappointed. But, all the same, we have reached an altitude of 4362 m, skied down from there and arrived in the valley alive and well. For one of this year's final tours, that will be a big enough success <p/> P.S. Apparently, the summit is still where it was before we wanted to climb it ourselves. And I think it will be there for a while... waiting... maybe for us too <p/> One more thing about the costs: after the tour, we took a free afternoon in Chamonix, spent the night, and then headed home the next morning. <p/> For the trip from Tuesday to Saturday, for tolls, tunnel fees, fuel, accommodation and gondola tickets, we each spent just over 300.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

454,"Closing ceremony of the Fabula Festival <p/> To close the successful Fabula Festival, which this year was crowned by the visit of Scottish literary star Irvin Welsh and his performance in front of a packed CD Club, the organisers invited three Slovenian authors and one female author to speak (and read). Stanka Hrastelj, Milan Kleč, Marko Sosič and Dušan Šarotar talked about myths, their influence on our everyday lives, their importance for literature and our (un)conscious involvement in mythical worlds. On this occasion, a collection of short fiction Myths of Our Everyday Life was published with one story from each of the invited authors. <p/> It is not entirely clear why these four authors were invited to participate. Were the organisers guided in their selection by the intrinsic and substantive merits of the selected writings, or was it more than a random selection? Given the diversity of the four stories collected, which sometimes have almost nothing in common with myths or are simply a negation of them (Stanka Hrastelj), the second option seems more likely. Nevertheless, at least for Dušan Šarotar and Mark Sosič, judging by their reflective answers, the subject of myths is not alien to them and served as a good starting point for the emerging story. <p/> Dušan Šarotar pointed out that interpreting myths is something he does all the time, because myths are nothing but memory, and we are all made of memories. Myths, he said, also connect people in time and space, define a community through time and give it meaning and solidity. Marko Sosič agreed that in the field of the unconscious as well as the conscious, we are entwined in Slovenian folk traditions and ancient myths. However, he stressed that we need to develop a critical attitude towards the mythical images of Western society that serve as models and ideals. In order to face the present time and ourselves, Sosič said, we must acquire the distance necessary for critical reflection. <p/> Stanka Hrastelj focused on the female characters that define the Slovenian mythological field. She reflected on two in particular: the beautiful Vida, who seems to be the obvious choice, and the figure of the Cankarjan mother - a suffering mother and wife who sacrifices herself for a man and expects his eternal gratitude in return. This figure - as the author has rightly observed - is still very much present in our society. In writing the short story, however, Hrasteljeva did lean on the character of the beautiful Vida, but added a twist in the form of a happy ending. The author also pointed out that myths serve as a mirror to explain our behaviour, because they are rooted in the behaviour of humanity. <p/> Milan Kleč did not say much. During Šarotar and Sosič's debate, he provided a comic interlude with a story about a skylark that had wandered onto his balcony and was persistently making noises there, disturbing his (peace of mind), as such a squawking was supposedly a harbinger of death. The tale of a heroic confrontation with a winged peace-builder in a residential neighbourhood and its subsequent removal - combined with Kleč's tormented appearance, as he acted as if he would rather be anywhere else than on the stage of the CD Club at that moment - gave the hundred or so visitors to the evening a good laugh. Tina Kozin, who asked the same questions to all the guests, did not let herself be confused and, when it was Kleč's turn to answer again, she cleverly adapted the question to the author's narration (and situation). <p/> At the end, each of the invitees read an excerpt from his short story, with the exception of Milan Kleč, who decided to read a poem by the recently deceased Matjaž Kocbek instead of his own story. Marko Sosič chose the legend of the Lady of Devin as the basis for his story ""Contempt"" and set it in the currently very topical theme of unemployment and the resulting feeling of shame Milan Kleč's story ""Krakow"" describes the fulfilled wish of a poor student and waitress who pays her way to this Polish city and a supernatural exchange, which happens at the end of the story Dušan Šarotar, in the story ""Among the High Clouds That Will Sing"", set the action in Sobota and framed it with the fascination with the stars and the many folk beliefs about the stars that are still present today Stanka Hrastelj - as mentioned above - told a modern story about the beautiful Vida with a happy ending. <p/>Myths are an extremely broad and rewarding subject, and there is, of course, much more that could be said about them. As Marko Sosič pointed out, myths are born out of man's attempt to understand the world, but despite the remarkable scientific advances of recent centuries, man remains essentially the same, as does his need for stories to make sense of the world. <p/> The Fabula Festival 2013, which celebrated its tenth anniversary, has come to a close. It is a pity that the tradition of awarding the Dnevnik Fabula, Slovenia's only literary prize for the best original short fiction collection, has come to an end this year.

457,"@ PJ. I will briefly repeat my reply to your comment: congratulations and good health to you in the future. I wonder if you have written down the diagnosis "" lame from the waist down "", and the cure somewhere. Do you keep this knowledge you have gained to yourself or are you interested in sharing it with someone else who is dealing with a similar intractable problem. <p/> For me it is a little different. A very aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis (in terms of percentage cured) was contracted by a family member. Unexpectedly, while she was waiting for surgery, I gave her a month of therapy using the procedure or technique carried out by Zdenko Domančič and his team. For 30 days, 2x a day. I did the therapies exclusively at her request, it is difficult to explain how this came about. On the third day her condition started to improve. She was able to start walking up stairs again, she hadn't been able to do it before, she had a cold all winter, she had difficulty breathing, sinus problems, chronically blocked nose, she hadn't smelled for a year. No antibiotic was helping her effectively anymore. In the meantime, while she was waiting for the operation (she had to undergo a few more tests), she was not receiving any medication to treat her cancer. When she was operated on, it was found that, of the five tumours, four had disappeared and one had gone from 15 mm to about 5 mm. I admit that I am not foolish and I do not know what we managed in the long run. Time will tell. I am still continuing with the therapies, following the advice of the people in the bioenergetician's circle. <p/> That is why I was interested in your description of the effect of the energy flow on the diseased tissue. <p/> @David: as I have said before, and I feel you are realising yourself, vanity can be a problem here and difficult to overcome. So I will just say this: the conclusion is that you are on the right path. It might be worth familiarising yourself with the content on stimulating the pituitary gland. <p/> @david: I do not know if we have understood each other correctly. I can imagine what it is like for you in the situation you are in ... We too were diagnosed with cancer three years ago with the youngest in the family. Unfortunately, at that time I was not yet aware of the therapy that was being researched in the 1960s and was supposedly achieving excellent results. <p/> As I said, it was roughly about (electromagnetic) stimulation of the pituitary gland. This resulted in the formation of bodies that fed on the malignant cells, which reduced the tumour. At the same time, the inhibitors, in turn, inhibited the development or proliferation of stem cells into malignant cells... <p/>I'm sorry I didn't go into the details, but if I had another chance, I would have. We said goodbye to the youngest in our family a year ago. I suspect, however, that what you are describing is exactly this model of treatment. <p/>David, now a word of caution: P.J. obviously brings spices that the dish does not need to tickle you in the first place, and then writes about inferring that it is a crowd that is supposed to be on the right path. This makes you an information broker for others and no longer just for yourself (different levels of responsibility, after all...). <p/> I did not follow your dialogue and I have no idea what it is about ... but I am naturally cautious about similar transitions from singular to plural. <p/> Ah, that post cut off part of the communication - but as far as I'm concerned, it's still the case that a person should give partly different information on his/her own behalf than if he/she gives it on behalf of a group (even if it's the same joint project of whatever). <p/> @ niko: thanks for the warning. It should have used a colon. I'm sprinkling myself with ashes for that mistake. <p/> As for responsibility, I have to agree with you. In caring for the patient, we (each individual who accepts this role - not to get bogged down with interpretation again) are about to take (again, each individual) full (co-) responsibility for the outcome. <p/> P.S.: Perhaps a clarification on why the change from singular to plural (or, as written, more correctly - dual). <p/> In most treatments there is a patient and a therapist. The course of treatment and cure also depends on the patient and not only on the therapist. Hence the sentence that both of you (all involved), judging by the results described, are (are) on the right path. <p/>@PJ. Now I understand. I can see that you have had quite a few difficult ordeals. Actually, this technique that I am using is the work of Zdenek Domančič. Personally, I think that this therapy has a holistic effect on the patient's immune system (I have seen it myself in several patients after only a few days) and that the body may (or may not, depending of course on the patient's condition) react positively and fight the condition more easily. Although the very act of laying on of hands makes the cancer cells feel unwell. Anyway, if you are interested in more, go to youtube and type in the name of the bioenergetician mentioned, there is a lot said there and research has also been done at various institutions around Slovenia (jozef stefan, I think also at the oncoloske) ... <p/> @Niko, thank you for your concern, but I no longer worry about being unfairly grouped somewhere or thrown in some trash can. I've been called everything from a janissist, to a right-winger, to a pro-Russia, left-winger, and so on, on blogs <p/> @Niko, I don't resent anyone. We're all just human, which is why blog-level resentment is absurdly fucking ridiculous. Which ends up being cruel when someone keeps slandering and moderating you. And yet absurd if the cause is ""virtual"" <p/> I'm not saying I don't resent things too, I do, but it has to be related to a greater amount of money, time, and consequently unattained planned goals. <p/> Man, you weren't disciplining anyone - you were just defending yourself. There was no talk of overstepping the bounds of power. , <p/> There is a note somewhere here among the older posts about how it came about that I put Dajana in spam (etting) and she no longer has access to this blog - the only one and it really wasn't my intention to oppress anyone in such a way, but with her all the normal solutions fall away (the woman is polluting all over the place for absolutely no reason). She only understands that one step too far towards the abyss. <p/> I forgot to leave this link here, under this heading, which was the trigger for the end-to-end, over-amplified and predictable clichéd parroting with the noticeable manifestations of dementia of the blogger Dajana and of the gentleman who has sovereign mastery of the knowledge and functioning of the egos of bitches, Mr Ervinatro. <p/> For your amusement, nobody has given me as much publicity as these two have done on the siol! <p/> werner, you must be very young, I can tell by your naive euphoric conclusions, hehe ... <p/> but I find this strange: in all the American films, the Russians are Americans - well, sometimes Yugos In no time at all, all the ""Russians"" speak English <p/> and then they make the film in such a way that the Russians are made to look like cowards. ------- similarly with the commentators on the net ... ........................ . hint: for me, the ""smart"" person is the one who gives me money and pays me for it - all the others are ballast that I shake off <p/> You don't know, but my teachers know that there is so much of what I do in me - purely from within, without reading, imitating or going anywhere to get knowledge ... , I just like to go and test what is in me.

Because she is hateful and labile. Not even Abraham helps her! ! Maybe I will - because I do everything with love. I will show love to her too. In a slightly different way. ******************** Actually, I feel sorry for her. She's deprived of everyone she expected anything from. But that's her own fault. When she realises that she is doing injustice to countless people by slandering them and spreading lies about them, she will be on the right path to realising love. ************************************************** And when she does, I will be the first one to embrace her. I promise. *************************************************** P.S. If a man wants to get something, he has to give it.

I am conditioned to find a grain of truth through reading when I learn it from myself, so I am doomed to plagiarism in anything I recognise as good. <p/>The teacher who imparted knowledge to me left me a few years ago after 25 years of teaching, after letting me know that he had learned enough from me to feel that he had fulfilled his task and was leaving this world.

462,"Movember: Cancer facts and misconceptions <p/> To raise awareness about men's health, Playboy Hall of Fame hockey players asked passers-by, acquaintances and friends what they knew about cancer. They chose 10 interesting statements and asked an expert in oncology, MSc. Mirjana Rajer, MD, PhD, who explained and justified whether the claims were fact or fallacy. <p/> 1. Cancer treatment is more stressful than the disease itself. <p/> Fallacy. Of course, treatment has its co-morbidities, but it cannot be said that treatment is more exhausting than the disease itself. The argument comes from history, when so-called 'supportive care' was not so developed and, for example, patients who received chemotherapy vomited profusely. Nowadays, we have very effective drugs to prevent this. But it is also true that patients often attribute problems to the treatment that are not really caused by it. It is easier for the patient to find the 'culprit' in the treatment. An example might be a patient who is having radiation to the chest area and has pain in his legs. The patient is more likely to think that the radiation treatment is to blame than, for example, that the vascular problems in the legs are the real cause. Nowadays, treatment is more tailored to the patient than ever before. If a patient is going to undergo a strenuous treatment, we talk to them beforehand, explain why it is necessary and they say whether or not they agree with what is proposed. <p/> 2. Any form of cancer is incurable. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are nowadays completely curable. Especially if the disease is detected at an early stage and treated as soon as possible. Rather, we can say that all cancers are curable if they are detected early enough. More than half of all cancer patients are completely cured. Of course, we can also say that the glass is half empty and say that we do not cure half of them, but the results of treatment are getting better every year, and we are all working very hard to do that. <p/> 3. People who get cancer can only lie in bed and be passive. <p/> Fallacy. Patients are physically active to the best of their ability. Many people with cancer continue to lead an active life, which includes both daily chores and sport. Many patients keep in excellent shape, go hiking, dancing ... Cancer does not mean that a patient can just lie in bed. Patients are even encouraged to be active. However, we notice that it is often the relatives who restrict the patient, saying that he or she is not allowed to work in the garden, go out of the house or similar. The important thing is to talk to the doctor, which is usually the time when we resolve any dilemmas about the patient's activity. <p/> 4. Cancer is only curable if you are lucky. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are - especially if detected in time - completely curable. Prevention and early detection are key. People are not sufficiently aware of the importance of screening programmes such as SVIT (for bowel cancer), ZORA (cervical cancer) and DORA (breast cancer). The aim of these programmes is to detect cancer at an early stage, when it is still curable. I often hear that people have received an invitation to take part in SVIT and have thrown the invitation in the rubbish. But when they hear that someone has been diagnosed with cancer and cured through this programme, they dig through the rubbish to see if the invitation is still there, and they go and take part in the programme. <p/> 5. If there is no family history of cancer, then I am not interested in cancer. <p/> Fallacy. Heredity is only one factor and contributes to a small number of cancers. Most cancers are caused by other things, such as environmental damage, smoking, etc... So it is a mistake to think that if no one in the family has had cancer, we will not get it either. <p/> 6. Lung cancer is caused by smoking alone. <p/> Fallacy. Smoking is an important factor, but there are other factors: I am pointing out heredity, the polluted working environment, radon in buildings ... 15-20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. However, smoking is a risk factor that can be prevented, so raising awareness of the harmful effects of smoking is very important. <p/> 7. Chemotherapy is harmful to the body and is only in the interest of pharmaceutical companies. <p/> False. Chemotherapy is one of the established options for cancer treatment. But of course, every drug has side effects. It is an exaggeration to claim that chemotherapy is only in the interests of pharmaceutical companies. Ask a person who is healthy as a result of chemotherapy. <p/> Fact. It is true that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances of cure. At this point, I would like to stress once again the importance of screening programmes. People should take part in them in greater numbers than they do now. <p/> Fallacy. We starve ourselves before we starve cancer. Most cancer patients who are treated for cancer develop metabolic changes that lead to a metabolic stress state. Stress metabolism is also characterised by processes in which glucose is formed from the body's protein and fat stores. Insufficient food intake or starvation further accelerates glucose production. In this way, the body's deterioration in the face of cancer is further accelerated. This does not kill the cancer cells, as they are able to obtain sufficient energy and individual nutrients one way or another. <p/> On the contrary, we have a lot of scientific evidence that weight loss contributes to poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, adequate nutritional support of the cancer patient is part of the cancer treatment according to modern medical recommendations. <p/> You can also find out more about cancer itself and prevention at free lectures organised by Playboy Hall of Fame players as part of the MoGame event. Cancer, the disease of a hundred faces. The lecture will be given by oncologist Mag. Mirjana Rajer, oncologist, and Marija Vegelj Pirc, psychooncologist, and former football player Jaka Jakopič will share his personal experience of cancer.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

472,"Polona Požgan Štorman, a graduate in political science and a graduate in history, is known to most people as the presenter of the morning programme on Radio Centre. She has been working at the radio for 16 years. She fell in love with it at the beginning of her student years, when she started working at Radio Student in Maribor. ""Everything related to speech and communication inspired me so much that I decided to make radio a part of my life. And it did,"" explains Polona, continuing, ""In all these years, I never thought about driving to work at 5am. Working in radio is a pleasure. Good company, good music, laughter, raving around the studio at the crack of dawn, morning coffees, sunrises, sometimes even a bit of a grumble, and I'm always pampered by my two radio men - Sašo Papp and Štefko Bratkovič. "" <p/> A committed radio personality, she is also a homemaker and enjoys cooking. Her favourite hobbies are cooking and baking. She has two very grateful eaters - her son and her husband. She loves cooking so much that she might be a professional chef if she were born again. ""Maybe I imagine myself in this role a little too much like Catherine Zeta Jones in No Reservations, but... why not? ! "" she remarks wryly. <p/> POLONA POŽGAN ŠTORMAN on her MAKS Of all her roles, Polona's favourite is that of a mother. ""If you were to ask Maks what he calls his mother, I would tell you that I call him 'love'. And that's the best word to describe our relationship. Max is my love and I adore him. He is three and a half years old and he is a boy like most others. He is mainly interested in toy cars, saws, lawnmowers, diggers and other motorised vehicles. I am not very good around them, so I involve him in other games, ones that are closer to me. We cook together almost every day. When he wakes up at the end of the week and sees that I am home, his first words are: ' Mum, let's go bake cakes now! ' What impresses me most is that Maks is a very happy child. He laughs and sings all day - of course he loves Taboo and knows all their songs by heart. When he gets serious and annoying, it's clear to me that something is wrong with him. He is a Leo, which means he is very stubborn. Sometimes it gives me grey hairs during this period, but I console myself with the fact that he will need this trait at some point in his life,"" Polona enthusiastically recounted. <p/> Polona's days are, in principle, meticulously planned. By Sunday evening at the latest, she knows what her schedule will be for the whole week. She gets up very early, her watch chimes at five minutes past four o'clock. ""If it rang exactly at four, I would think it was horrible, five past four is more normal,"" she explained with a laugh. She then works on the radio from five to eleven, then goes to the office or to lectures. Together with her friend Mojca Lubanjšek Pehant, she runs the school of rhetoric Retorik, d.o.o. No matter what she does or how much she works, she always has a maternal feeling inside her, which pushes her to work so intensively and so organised that she has enough time for her child. You would think that at this pace you would go to bed quickly, but that is not true for her at all, and it is true that she is in bed by 11 p.m. at the latest. <p/> Since she has had Max, her life has changed a lot, and for the better. Today, she wonders how she could ever say that she has no time or that she is sleepy. She wonders what she did before she had Max. Today, she feels that she has time for everything and does not need much sleep. Maks gives her energy in the afternoon or evening. The child never weighs her down, never tires her out, quite the opposite. <p/> She herself has never wondered what it is like to be a mother. She feels that she is a good mother. She and Primož were both very excited about Maks and when he came into the world they were mentally prepared for him. There were never any concerns, only some questions, and her mother, who used to be a midwife, solved them professionally. <p/> Every day when she comes home, Maks first plays and sings to her. ""Every day, really. He usually plays that it's Maco or Izi, they're the guitarists in the band Tabu, which his dad Primož is also part of,"" Polona told us. ""Now Maks is in the Good Fairy phase. He has a well-developed sense of humour and knows exactly how and with what to make people laugh. ""Sometimes he comes up to me with big eyes and asks me very seriously: 'Listen... are you my mummy?' He asks this because he knows that I will chase him around the flat. ""But she is happiest that he is healthy, and she tries to remind herself of that as often as possible. <p/> Primož likes Maks to be stubborn and to stick to his guns. ""I think it shows he has character,"" Polona laughs. So far, Maks has shown his true stubbornness two or three times by throwing himself on the floor and shouting, but otherwise he is very persistent. Polona is more strict, but she has often found that Primož is more of a logician when it comes to parenting. During her pregnancy, she ""devoured"" all the parenting books she could get her hands on, but she herself found that this was not the best. <p/> In the future, she wants Max to be healthy first, responsible second and independent third. If she can deduce by herself, these qualities bring happiness. But more importantly, she wants to instil in Max responsibility - for himself, for others, for work and for life. <p/> Maks has been playing with saws for two years now, and excavators and rollers and the like, and he is also moving into the Lego era. Towers are popular. But since the first year, the most used toy in his room is drums. His father, who is a drummer, bought them for his first birthday. For his third birthday he got new, more useful ones, but they are too loud for (Mum's) ears. That's why Maks now has headphones. ""He says they are green, which means they are red,"" Polona said laughing. <p/> Otherwise, the rules in their family are clear and every night Maks has a choice - either a cartoon or a game to play with Primož. During the day, cartoons and TV are not allowed. The exception is a Taboo video, which he sometimes wishes he could play drums or a children's guitar alongside. <p/> About early learning in kindergarten, Polona thinks: ""Everything in its own time. We don't have any extra-curricular activities for now. Maks still sometimes 'poops' his pants and it would be a bit funny if he was to learn English while doing that. "" <p/> Maks has been attending kindergarten since September. Polona was quite scared of going to kindergarten because he had been at home with a nanny for two years before that. But he has settled in beautifully. She is convinced that this is also thanks to the wonderful teachers, Petra and Martina. He loves them very much, he still talks about them at home. He now has friends at nursery and Primož, who drives him to nursery in the morning, says that he gets impatient if they take too long. Polona is grateful that in the first week of kindergarten they dispelled her doubts and showed her that her child is safe and happy with them.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

In the city, the visitor will not find a single road or vehicle as we are used to on the mainland. From the beginning, the rich merchants and nobles of Venice have been transported by gondolas. Today, the gondola is renowned as the most romantic means of transport. Children will also find the boats in Venice most interesting. <p/> If you're up for exploring the big city, then you can certainly take your child to London. The city offers many attractions that are also interesting for children. If flying there on low-cost carriers is very cheap, you will pay a bit more for accommodation (cheap accommodation can be found here too, if you are not demanding), but above all for entrance fees, which are certainly not cheap.",Promotion,train

The cooperation with Sport 2000, which has developed into a strong partnership with suppliers, has contributed to this. <p/> In March, Gigasport will launch a new online shop, with a special focus on the close link between traditional and online business. <p/> In addition to the three offices mentioned above, Kastner & Öhler has one more store in Slovenia, K & Ö in Ljubljana. <p/> Kastner &amp; Öhler was the first foreign company with sports stores to operate in Slovenia.

491,"News <p/> At a discussion evening in Novo mesto, Roma assistants said that the scope of their work exceeds the stipulated 4 hours a day and that they no longer believe in the systematisation of this profession in schools with Roma pupils. <p/> On Friday, in the atrium of the Goga bookstore in Novo mesto, a discussion evening with Roma assistants took place on the education of Roma and the importance of Roma assistants. The event was organised by the Roma Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today and took place as part of the European Youth in Action project. Bogdan Miklič, President of the Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today, said about the project, entitled ""Centre for Media Research and Roma Coexistence"", that it comprises a collage of events that will take place all over Slovenia, in addition to Novo mesto, in Ribnica, the Kočevje region and another municipality. ""The project will include various workshops. Romani children will try out the role of journalists in Romani settlements, write short articles, and prepare short radio diary entries. The participants are young Roma, aged between 15 and 30, who come mainly from the Novometi region,"" Miklič explained. He added that they will appear in institutions that deal with Roma issues in one way or another. ""We will also meet with high school students, we want to appear in police buildings, various schools, to create a bridge between Roma and non-Roma, to breathe together, to find a common language and perhaps to break through prejudices,"" he stressed. <p/> Miljana Mikica Gligič, a Roma helper with many years of experience, said that a Roma helper has a very wide range of possibilities and does not have to be limited to primary school. <p/> ""If we were invited, we could also work in a social work centre, a municipality, a kindergarten, the state administration or the police,"" Gligič said. <p/> Lili Majer from Kočevje says she enjoys her work, but in the beginning she overcame her fear. ""I didn't know how I would be received by the pupils, their parents and the staff at the primary school, but I have no regrets about taking this job,"" she says. <p/> Mitja Novak works as a Roma assistant at the Frana Metelka Škocjan Primary School. He has many years of experience. ""At the beginning you feel responsibility and you have no feeling how you will be received. It took me three months to get used to it. I already knew the Roma parents and the children, but what worried me most was the reaction of the parents of the other children,"" he recalls. <p/> On Friday, we talked to Roma helpers about their work and Roma education. The discussion evening took place as part of the youth initiative of the Roma Media and Coexistence Research Centre, within the framework of the European Youth in Action project. Let's listen to a part of the discussion with the participation of Roma assistants Miljana Mikica Gligič, Lilica Majer and Mitja Novak. <p/> Ms Gligičeva explained that when she started this job, the condition for a Roma assistant was that he or she had a high school education and was familiar with Roma history and the Romani language, otherwise he or she could jump into the role of a non-Roma with the relevant knowledge. Subsequent applicants had to complete a 4-year course in Roma history and culture, mathematics, Slovenian and English. ""They have been awarded National Vocational Qualification Certificates, but apparently this counts for nothing, as there is a younger generation of Roma assistants who are being posted to schools directly from the Employment Service, even though they have not received the relevant training. Their contract does not say that they will work on teaching assistance, but on socialisation and integration of Roma,"" Gligic does not see how to mobilise Roma assistants in a different way. <p/> Novak adds that a condition for becoming a Roma assistant should be a certificate of national vocational qualification. ""The Ministry of Education has made this a condition for us to be able to continue to do this work, but things remain unresolved, even though it is the sixth year since we completed the training for Roma assistants,"" Novak notes. <p/> Mitja Novak believes that the Ministry of Education can provide answers in this regard, while Lilica Majer believes that the management of the People's University of Kočevje, which is the managing partner of the project ""Successful Integration of Roma into Education II"", which is developing and implementing the activities of the Roma assistant, would know more about this. Ms Miljana Mikica Gligič suggested that additional information be provided by Dr Vera Klopčič from the Institute for Ethnic Issues, who was present at the discussion evening. She stressed the great importance of the trust created by the work of the Roma assistants and the need to strengthen the links between the various stakeholders in society involved in the education of Roma. The participants agreed that it would be a good idea to organise an extended discussion evening with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education and other organisations.",News/Reporting,train
496,"For a person in pain, we think first about what caused the pain, and then about how to alleviate it. Pain is indicative of origin and cause, but rarely is it so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. <p/> 1. <p/> When something hurts, something is wrong <p/> Pain is often indicative of its origin and cause by its site of occurrence, its characteristics and the accompanying changes in the affected body part. Thus, a sore throat may be accompanied by redness of the pharynx, a sore elbow by a painful movement in a certain direction, a painful pressure on a certain spot near the joint. Painful spasms under the right rib arch after a fatty meal... So, when we think of the above-mentioned pains, we will think of sore throat, of prolonged overstrain of the muscles of the forearm, of gallstones... For most pain patients, these are unpleasant sensations caused by the activation of pain receptors in the tissues. These receptors are found in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissue, muscles, the popliteum and in the walls of internal organs (and in many places they are absent - for example, in the brain! Injury or damage to tissue releases so-called ""pain-inducing substances"" that act on pain receptors. This results in so-called nociceptive pain. This can be further divided into visceral (when the internal organs are affected - the pain will typically be in the form of painful 'spasms' - colic) and somatic (this is typically tearing and/or throbbing). When something hurts, something is wrong. Our everyday experience therefore equates pain with tissue damage or failure. When we miss a nail with a hammer and hit our thumb nail, the pain can be very severe, but we know the cause and are not frightened because we know that it is not serious and will pass quickly. When it hurts and the cause is not clear, fears arise. These can disturb our peace of mind much more than, for example, a ""chest prick"" for its own sake. That's why we want to explore pain. People choose to see a doctor more often and sooner because of pain (or other unpleasant body sensations) than because of a (painless) disturbance in a bodily function. Somehow they feel that if it doesn't hurt, it can't be worse. But if it hurts ... didn't the neighbour who was complaining of pain in his fingers have a heart attack? Didn't a colleague in the company have a sudden severe headache and bleeding in her head, but hasn't been back to work since? <p/> EXAMINE THE PAIN <p/> So, when there is pain, there is a need to see a doctor and there is a need to examine the pain. And how will the doctor proceed? In the case of a patient with pain, he or she first thinks about what caused the pain, and then about how to relieve it. Pain may give clues to its origin and cause - but it is rarely so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. It then treats the cause of the pain, and if the pain is relieved while the treatment of the cause takes longer, it treats the pain itself. (As we say, it treats ""symptomatically"" - symptomatic treatment is that which relieves the symptom, in this case the pain - but it does not treat the cause). Since pain is a subjective experience, it is from the patient that the doctor will learn most about pain (as well as other sensory abnormalities). When the patient does not provide all the information himself, he will make further targeted enquiries, especially if he has already formed a ""working diagnosis"" (hypothesis) of what the patient's pain is ""supposed"" to mean. In order to be able to direct the examination and investigations on the basis of the pain and to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, the doctor will collect information on the site of the pain, the nature of the pain (including its duration), the circumstances of the pain, the factors that amplify the pain and the factors that mitigate it. Of course, he or she will also be interested in any other information that is usually collected when talking to the patient (so-called ""history taking""). When the pain is sufficiently characteristic or accompanied by data to guide examination and investigations, the method described above will suffice. The examination process will be fairly straightforward and will not take much time. However, even in such a patient, it is often useful to measure the pain further. In a very simple way, we can assess it in the patient's own words: even with a basic record, we will define the pain in terms of intensity as mild, moderate, severe, very severe. It is also useful to note how much inconvenience it causes the subject (how it interferes with daily activities, how it disturbs sleep). Additionally - and still simply - we measure it using the so-called visual analogue scale: the subject marks the spot corresponding to the intensity of his pain on a 10 cm long straight line, bordered on the left by 0 and on the right by 10 (meaning either a state of no pain at all - 0, or a state of the worst possible pain - 10). By then measuring the marked spot (for example on a 10 cm line), a numerical indication of pain is obtained (for example 5, 5). This information is recorded in the report and will later be used to measure more precise pain intensity than just ""moderate pain"". If the patient scores the pain as 3 at the follow-up examination, we will get the impression that the pain is milder, although the patient will still self-report it as 'moderate'. Of course, a similar analogue scale can also be used to measure other inconveniences that accompany pain (e.g. how much the pain interferes with his/her social activities). In cases of chronic pain, it is useful to spend more time analysing it and to give the patient a questionnaire to fill in (this can also be completed in the waiting room). For example, such a questionnaire has been developed by colleagues at the Slovenian Association for the Treatment of Pain (Slovenian version of the Brief Pain Inventory, developed by Cleeland). Although psychological and social aspects may be present to some extent in any pain, these are explored in greater depth in chronic pain, or when the cause of the pain is not clear or seems disproportionate to the cause. All pain is perceived by the nervous system or the brain. Nerve connections carry pain information from the affected area to the brain. However, pain can also be caused by a defect in the sensory nervous system, in which case we speak of neuropathic pain. (In this context, the term 'neuropathic' is used in the broadest sense and means a nervous system defect. This should be explained because the term neuropathy is used in medicine to refer specifically to an affection of the so-called peripheral nerves. Neuropathic pain', on the other hand, refers to all pain arising from nerve damage or dysfunction, whether peripheral or central nervous system. ) When neuropathic pain is suspected, we ask targeted, detailed questions about the various accompanying neurological symptoms (such as tingling, burning, hot, cold and other unusual sensations at or near the painful site), as well as about possible additional disturbances of various other nerve functions. In short, a patient with suspected neuropathic pain will be questioned and examined differently from a patient with ""normal"", i.e. nociceptive pain. <p/> CLINICAL EXAMINATION <p/> In the case of suspected nociceptive pain, we orientate ourselves to the affected part of the body and examine it closely (otherwise we perform a general and local physical examination, which - depending on the pain - is oriented ""internal"", ""surgical"", ""orthopaedic"", etc.). In the case of suspected neuropathic pain, we focus on the ""neurological"" examination. While this includes the examination of many neurological functions, the most important part of the examination in pain is the examination of skin and mucous membrane tenderness. This examination is seemingly simple, but it is actually one of the most challenging elements of the neurological examination, both for the examiner and for the subject. In the sensitivity examination, we first look for areas of the body that are insensitive to particular qualities of sensation (to fine touch, to pain, to cold, to warm, to vibration, to joint position). We then compare whether, in different anatomically defined areas of the body, the subject feels these qualities normally or in the same way as in the area he/she describes as normally sensitive. In short, in this second part of the investigation, we try to determine the extent of the decrease in sensitivity in a particular anatomical arrangement. The anatomical distribution of the sensitivity disturbance indicates the nervous structure affected, with a particular nerve animating a different area of skin and mucous membranes than a single nerve root; in spinal cord involvement, again, the distribution is different; and in brain involvement, it is also characteristically distributed. It is, in short, the ""failure pattern"" that tells us a lot about which nerve structure is affected. Since there are many different ""dropout patterns"", practically all of them cannot be tested without completely ""tiring"" the subject, so an experienced investigator needs to create a working diagnosis (or a short ""list"" of the most likely diagnoses) on the basis of the information he or she gets from talking to the patient, in order to be able to investigate in a targeted way. In addition to the anatomical distribution of the sensitivity loss, we are also interested in the severity of the lesion. The quantitative extent of the sensitivity change can, of course, only be roughly defined by clinical examination (mild, moderate or extensive loss). When we investigate sensitivity in a patient with neuropathic pain, we will often be alerted to the fact that a mild stimulus is already felt as distinctly unpleasant, painful (this is allodynia). This patient will often go on to say that he or she feels a mild pain stimulus (for example, a light prick with a pinprick) as distinctly painful, and the pain may persist when the stimulus is no longer there (this phenomenon is called hyperalgesia and hyperpathia). In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we therefore specifically investigate whether allodynia and hyperalgesia are also present and, in addition to sensitivity to a static stimulus (pressure), we also investigate sensitivity to a moving stimulus (swiping with a cotton wool pad or brush). This sensitivity is not exclusively found in patients with neuropathic pain, but is less common in other pain conditions. The clinical examination of a patient with suspected neuropathic pain is quite extensive and demanding. This is why experts are trying to be more successful with a more targeted approach, which would be more manageable by a larger number of experts. French researchers have published a very promising short questionnaire (DN4) that can be used to discriminate well certain neuropathic pain syndromes. <p/> TECHNICAL TOOLS <p/> The sense of fine touch is orientation tested by a light touch with the finger, for a lighter touch a piece of cotton wool should be used. Good quantification of fine touch is possible with von Frey hair sticks (calibrated nylon filaments on a handle - ""monofilaments""). This method is particularly useful for studies where we want to have a completely standardised procedure. In Slovenia, hairpin testing has become established especially in the standardised screening of diabetics at risk of peripheral nerve involvement (diabetic polyneuropathy). For pain testing, we use a pumice stone (which is discarded after use! ) or a sharp broken wooden stick. The sensation of cold can be tested roughly by touching areas of skin with solid metal objects, or traditionally with a test tube filled with cold water. The sense of warmth is tested with a test tube filled with warm water. The sense of vibration is tested with a tuning fork. This sensation can be partially quantified with a special musical fork that has a scale to monitor the intensity of the vibration. When testing joint position sensation, we do not use any aids to assess the subject's sense of the position of a stationary joint and the subject's recognition of the direction of movement of the joint (as a rule, we mainly test the movement of the joints in the toes). Quantitative sensory testing has established itself as an important adjunct to the clinical examination, as it can provide quantitative and modality-specific information about the sensory impairment. Techniques are known to quantify mechanical sensation, thermal sensation and electrical stimulus detection. All of these methods are also used, at least in some places, for routine diagnostic purposes, but are, for the time being, of particular relevance to research work. The principle of these methods is to determine the threshold of sensitivity for a particular quality of sensation and, of course, the threshold of pain for a particular modality of sensation (pressure, hot, cold, etc.). Quantitative sensory testing is a ""psychophysical"" examination The tests require an alert, attentive and well-cooperative subject who understands the instructions well. We have already mentioned that touch sensitivity can be quantified by von Frey hair. These nylon filaments can also be used to determine the area of hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) to point stimuli in a patient with neuropathic pain. Thicker filaments also irritate pain receptors in the skin and can be used to determine the threshold for mechanical pain. Quantified testing of hot and cold sensation is done with special thermodes that are placed on a specific part of the body and adjusted to develop a specific temperature. In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we mainly use the method of determining the threshold of sensation. Patients with neuropathic pain often report paradoxical sensations (for example, feeling a very cold object as 'hot'). The sensation of vibration can be quantitatively assessed using vibrameters, i.e. an electromechanical device with a handpiece that has an adjustable amplitude of displacement, while applying standardised pressure to the skin. The vibrometer is used to determine the vibration detection threshold and the vibration decay threshold. In a subject with pain and suspected peripheral nerve impairment, electrophysiological methods can be used to define the impairment more precisely. The methods used are electromyography (measuring the electrical activity of muscles) and electroneurography (measuring the electrical responsiveness of nerves). A significant limitation of these methods is that they are only sensitive to abnormalities of the thicker and myelinated nerve fibres. Neuropathic pain arises particularly in the case of thin nerve fibre defects, which are not investigated by routine electrophysiological methods. In central nervous system disorders, other electrophysiological methods (measurement of sensory and motor evoked potentials) will only exceptionally contribute to a more accurate anatomical diagnosis. Therefore, in the diagnosis of central nervous system disorders, we prefer to use imaging methods, which are also useful in the diagnosis of peripheral nervous system disorders, depending on the suspected location of the lesions or lesions. At the level of pain experience, there are interactions between several nervous subsystems, as shown by studies using functional brain imaging methods. These can track changes in brain activity during the experience of pain. (PET and functional MRI methods are currently used in the investigation of pain for research purposes only. ) Especially in chronic pain syndromes, the investigation and evaluation of the psychological and social dimensions of chronic pain are necessary, but a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper. As nociceptive pain is treated differently from neuropathic pain, pain needs to be diagnosed accordingly. In neuropathic pain, we can expect better treatment success if we can differentiate between the different pain syndromes, not only in terms of the cause, but also in terms of the nature of the disorder. It seems important to distinguish between disorders with provoked pain and those with spontaneous pain. Stimulus-evoked pain can be more accurately defined by more in-depth sensory testing (especially quantitative sensory testing). While such a more precise definition of pain does not yet have a very clear impact on treatment decisions, it is hoped that a more precise definition of patients into those with dynamic hyperalgesia, static hyperalgesia and allodynia, respectively, will adequately identify specific subgroups for which we will soon be able to select appropriately targeted drugs. For the time being, a comprehensive patient interview and physical examination are an adequate basis for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain syndromes and for the follow-up of the patient during treatment. However, the management of more complex chronic pain conditions in patients usually requires a team approach to both diagnosis and treatment.",Information/Explanation,train

Otherwise, every John of Carniola will be salting his brain. On the other hand, it would be good if he could establish some kind of communication with the ""base"", because in this way he could explain in general terms, not on a concrete example, what he can and cannot do, and perhaps he could also say something about the rules and their meaning. As for the specific case - I believe that the reviewer has to publish the treasure, even if the description is scarce or even non-existent. Just as he has to publish the treasure, whether it is a technical masterpiece or a box of cottage cheese.

515,"Turkey, an economically highly developed country of more than 71 million people, has a remarkable history and culture and many well-preserved historical sites that are carefully maintained and cared for. Two of the most popular tourist destinations are the historic and picturesque seaside towns, which quickly captivate people with their oriental imagery. <p/> Antalya, with its riviera of long beaches, is sun-drenched for ten months of the year and is Turkey's main tourist asset. In the background, the mighty Taurus (Taurus Bull) mountains shield it from the northerly winds and hide a wealth of underground caves. It was founded by the ancient Greeks and still has its own walled quarter, as do the Jews, Christians and, of course, Muslims. Affluent Antalya is the largest city in the Mediterranean, and its population has exploded in recent decades. As recently as 1985, there were 261 000 inhabitants; now there are more than 1 200 000, and with the metropolitan area there are a million more. In addition, it hosts over ten million tourists every year. <p/> I started my walk through the old town of Kaleiçi from a vast platform with water towers and a monument to Atatürk, the reformist statesman who wanted to bring Turkey closer to Europe. Among other things, he introduced the Latin alphabet and rejected religious extremes, including the headscarf. Today, children climb his monument freely, and the country has gone off the rails. <p/> The platform overlooks the city centre, with its three mosques and a lone medieval brick-red minaret - the Yivli. I joined the strollers on the city promenade, where ice-cream makers keep the mood up - doing mischief with dondurma ice-cream on long sticks. And there I was, standing in the square in front of the Saat Kulesi clock tower, a good city landmark, turning off to the bustling bazaar among oriental smells and colourful stalls. I then continued to Hadrian's Gate, where I entered the Ottoman world from the modern part of the city. The gate in the city walls is a triumphal arch of three entrances, built in 130 AD when the then Roman Emperor visited the city. <p/> In Antalya's Old Town you can admire the sophisticated Ottoman architecture of the houses, which are home to lovely souvenir shops, galleries, small hotels and restaurants with romantic gardens. Older locals like to sit on the benches and walls, snoozing or playing their board games. <p/> Antalya has no town beach, as it is built on high cliffs. It does, however, have a charming little harbour, which is dangerous for boats in the winter months. Resting on a bench in Karaalioglu Park, near the 1st century red tower of Hidirlik, which still clings to the remains of the thick city walls, I noticed that old and young, Turkish and foreign, gather around here. I had a beautiful view of the harbour and Antalya on the cliffs. This park also ends at the sea with a steep cliff into which steps have been cut leading to small rocky platforms. <p/> The surroundings of Antalya offer plenty of opportunities for excursions as well as challenging sporting adventures. In the resort of Belek, there is a golf course stretching along the sea, along which we drove for more than half an hour, and there are areas for divers too. Not far away are historic towns such as Side, Myra, Alanya and others, where you can take public transport for a pittance. A visit to the park where the Manavgat River flows into the sea is unforgettable. Its refreshing waterfalls roar and spray droplets of water far out to sea, where they magically end in an arc of colourful rainbows. <p/> It's a story unto itself, the long Turkish Riviera, where one beach is as long as the Slovenian coast, with megalomaniacal hotel resorts, buildings like Harry Potter movies or replicas of Venice's St Mark's Square... <p/> Attractive Alanya <p/> Alanya is the oldest tourist town on the Turkish Riviera. It lies on the southern coast of Anatolia (Asia Minor) and is said to have been discovered by Cleopatra VII, the last Egyptian Pharaoh. She loved to visit here with her husband Marc Antony and their three children. One of the town's three beaches is still named after her - Cleopatra's Beach. Here, fine sand fills the turquoise sea. The pebbly beach flows east into the peninsula that divides Alanya in two. The peninsula rises steeply to a rocky hill, green at the top and hiding the remains of a once mighty fortress. You can also take a gondola almost to the top. Within the castle walls, you will find the Byzantine church, the Suleiman Mosque and the caravanserai built by Suleiman the Magnificent. The castle, which was beautifully restored just over a decade ago, was built in 1226 by the Seljuk Sultans as their winter residence, but the hill was already inhabited during the Hittite Empire more than three thousand years ago. <p/> In the Middle Ages, under Sultan Aladdin Kejkubad I, the city enjoyed a golden age. In addition to the castle, several important buildings remain from those times, such as the Kizil Kule - the Red Watchtower, which stands in the harbour below the castle and is an outstanding example of medieval military architecture, and the Tersane shipyard. <p/> On the other side of the peninsula is the town's harbour, once a favourite haunt of the notorious Mediterranean pirates. In the town, you can see the former Atatürk Villa, a fine example of Ottoman architecture. We also visited the fascinating Müze Museum, which illustrates the many civilisations of Anatolia. In the museum park, peacocks roam and strut among the remains of Roman statues and Islamic tombstones. The city thrives on tourism, and not far away is the famous Damlatas underground cave, which is said to be beneficial for asthmatics. <p/> Rich country, poor people <p/> Turkey has lush vegetation and fertile soil so that they can grow all their own food, much of it exported to the wider world. In Antalya, the masses of white-tiled greenhouses that stretch beyond the city to the foot of Taurus are visible from the plane, and there are no shortage of them among the hotel resorts. <p/> It is well known that the east of the country is poorer than the west, where there are a good number of millionaires and even 37 billionaires. However, the general impression is that, although the country is rich, they have quite a few poor people. But they have a great joie de vivre, because there are many children and young people, and everybody respects the elderly and likes to socialise with each other in large numbers. <p/> In the parks, you don't see walkers, cyclists, passionate joggers like in our country, not even people with dogs. Man's best friends live there in freedom. They are all chipped, probably neutered, and a little bit shorthaired, and they roam around happily. Incidentally, the Turks breed the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, a brave herding dog used in some African countries to guard livestock against wild beasts. <p/> The Turkish language is difficult, but thanks to the many TV series, some of the words are familiar. The first records of Old Turkic were found on Sumerian tablets, and analyses of these cuneiform tablets have shown that the language is one of the oldest recorded languages. What's more, Turks understand and still use 1200 of these ancient words. Some Slovenian words originate from Turkish, such as pavilion, kiosk, hut, yurt, tent, divan, sofa, sofa, canteen, bag, cap, pocket, top, fool, kayak, etc., and words referring to gastronomy (cevapčičič, baklava, kebab, ajvar, yoghurt, coffee, sour cherries, corn) or to horse equipment (bridle, hamat). Last but not least, we have some Turkish surnames such as Tur(e)k, Intihar, Hodalič, Jančar, Kordiž, Mankoč, Oman, Šalamun and others. There are also a few place names that remind us of Turkish times, such as Tabor, Grmada, Hudo, and even Ljubljana's Bežigrad was named after a Turkish refugee who camped there before the siege of Ljubljana.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

519,"WE CELEBRATE THE FULL SPEECH OF BISHOP JURJI BIZJAK <p/> We celebrate the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius, Apostles of the Slavs and co-founders of Europe, and we also remember Bishop Methodius, who is being beatified today, and on the occasion of the anniversary of his ordination, his successor today extends to him his heartfelt thanks for the grace of ordination, and we all thank them for their example as a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd, and as a faithful witness to all. The Holy Brothers are, of course, an example not only for the presbyters of the Church, but also for every member of the Mystical Body of Christ, since all of us share in all three missions of the Church, each in his own order and in his own vocation. The sign of the witness is the palm branch, the sign of the shepherd is the shepherd's staff, the sign of the teacher is the lamp. <p/> The sign of the teacher is the lamp: to the prophet Isaiah the Lord said: 'It is too little for you to be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the redeemed of Israel. Therefore I will make you a light to the Gentile nations, that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth' (Isa 49:6). And the prophet Malachi writes: 'The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and instruction shall be expected from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts' (Mal 2:7). The prophet Daniel says: 'The holy teachers shall shine as the brightness of the heavens, and they that have instructed many in righteousness shall be as the stars for all eternity' (Dan. 12:3). In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord said to the disciples: 'You are the light of the world ... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven' (Mt 5:16). <Shepherds are migratory, moving with their flocks from pasture to pasture, and so their staff is also a travelling staff. When Jacob's father Jacob was preparing to meet Esau after twenty years, he was in great fear. He turned to the Lord with all his heart and prayed, 'I am not worthy of all your grace and all your faithfulness, which you have shown to your servant. For (with) my staff alone I have crossed this Jordan, and now I have grown into two camps (after 20 years!). Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau! Why I fear him, that he may come and kill me, mother and children!' (Deuteronomy 32:11-12). The shepherd's staff is also similar to the royal scepter, which is also a sign of administration and provision, so the staff is also a sign of the shepherd's care for food and drink, including care for spiritual food and drink. The prophet Isaiah threatens the capital city of Jerusalem and says: 'Behold, the Almighty, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and Judah the staff and the support, all the support of bread and all the support of water' (Isaiah 3:1). 'Your rod and your staff are a comfort to me' (Ps. 23:4). <The evergreen palm tree is first of all a sign of life and growth, but palm branches in particular are also a sign of martyrdom and eternal life. The Evangelist John describes the triumph of the elect in heaven and says: 'After these things I saw a great multitude, which no one could number, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and holding palms in their hands' (Rev 7:9). To be a witness is, of course, first of all a great honour and thanksgiving, but it can also be a great effort and a miserable sacrifice. As the Lord foretold us: 'In the world you will have tribulation; but believe me, I have overcome the world' (Jn 16:33). The Apostle Paul comforts us: 'For I think that the sufferings of this present time cannot be compared with the glory that is to be revealed in us' (Rom 8:18). And the Apostle James: 'Count it all joy, my brethren, if you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness' (Jas 1:2). <p/> The holy brothers Cyril and Methodius faithfully and courageously carried out the entire threefold mission, leaving us a shining example of a brilliant teacher and a caring shepherd and faithful witness. The Lord also gave them an eloquence and wisdom that all their adversaries could not oppose or contradict (Mt 21:15). May their example encourage all of us to hold ever higher the three signs of our mission: the palm branch of witness, the shepherd's staff of stewardship and the lamp of teaching. <p/> I express my gratitude to Bishop Methodius for his episcopal consecration and paternal introduction to a demanding ministry, which I have accepted with great hopes and expectations. And to you, dear brother priests and faithful, I thank you for your prayers and your closeness, your understanding and your affection. When I look at the years as a whole, I think how quickly they have passed, and when I think of all that has turned and happened in the meantime, I think when did it all happen! May the Lord look upon our work and bless it, to Him be thanks for ever and ever. Amen.",Other,train

The variable part depends on the number of municipalities in the area of the development region and the development deprivation index of the region. The number of municipalities is weighted at 25 % and the development vulnerability index of the region at 75 %. <p/> (2) Co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest shall be carried out on the basis of a decision of the Minister responsible for regional development (hereinafter referred to as the Minister).

The funds shall be allocated on the basis of a signed contract between the service and the regional development agency. Where, by decision of the Regional Council, regional development agencies also carry out development tasks for the development region, they shall be co-signatories to the contract. The contract shall specify and quantify the tasks of public interest to be carried out by the regional development agencies for the development region. <p/> (3) Notwithstanding the criteria set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, in the event of a rapid and significant deterioration of the economic situation in the area of one or more administrative units in a development region, additional resources may be allocated to finance development tasks in the region which are in the public interest. The economic situation shall be deemed to have deteriorated significantly if the registered unemployment rate in the area of the administrative unit has been 17,0 % or higher for at least two consecutive months. The regional development agency must identify the area in need of special assistance and submit a time- and cost-estimated programme of additional development tasks in that area, specifying the objectives, the task promoters, the expected results and the indicators. Funds may be granted for a maximum period of two years. If, at the end of the programme of additional development tasks, the conditions for funding additional development tasks in the region are still met, a new programme may be drawn up. The eligible costs are staff costs and the costs of preparing the programme and projects related to addressing the identified development problems in the area in need of development assistance. Eligible costs are financed at 100 %. The previous paragraph applies mutatis mutandis to the procedure for allocating funds to finance additional development tasks in the region which are in the public interest. A development region receiving development aid under a special law shall not be eligible for additional funding under this paragraph. <p/> (4) The funds granted may be disbursed on the basis of reports submitted on the activities carried out. <p/> (1) In accordance with Article 35 of the Act on the Promotion of Coherent Regional Development, assistance to municipalities for the municipal improvement of Roma settlements shall be granted as special regional incentives in priority areas facing major structural problems. <p/> (2) The following municipalities shall be eligible for the assistance referred to in the preceding paragraph: <p/> - in which a representative of the Roma community is elected to the municipal council in accordance with the law governing local self-government, or <p/> - in which a special working body of the municipal council for monitoring the situation of the Roma community is set up in accordance with the provisions of the law governing the situation of the Roma community, the members of which are also representatives of the Roma community. <p/> (3) The Service shall carry out a public call for tenders or invite eligible municipalities to submit projects within the indicative quota referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. In the call for tenders or invitation to tender, the Service shall specify the documentation to be submitted for the grant of assistance and the time limit for submission. If the call for proposals procedure is used, the Service may set the municipality a deadline for completing the project proposal. The Service shall prepare a programme proposal which shall be adopted by the Government. <p/> (4) The indicative quotas for the eligible municipalities shall be calculated on the basis of the available amount of funds in the budget item of the Service, the total number of eligible municipalities, an assessment of the equipment of Roma settlements with water supply, electricity, sewerage and transport infrastructure, the number of registered voters of the Roma community in the municipality and the funds allocated to the municipality on the basis of Articles 21 to 23 of the Act on the Financing of Municipalities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 123/09, 101/07 - Decree of the European Parliament No. 101/07, and Article 57/08). <p/> (5) Aid may be granted to co-finance the following projects in Roma settlements: <p/> - water supply systems, including intakes and pipelines to the user's connection, <p/> - sewerage networks, where these are necessary to protect water resources or for other ecological requirements, <p/> - electrification of agglomerations, <p/> - new or reconstructed local roads and paths, <p/> - purchase of land for the improvement and completion of settlements. <p/> (6) In the case of land purchase, a ceiling for co-financing per square metre of land purchased shall be set in the invitation to tender or call for tenders, irrespective of the contract price. <p/> (7) Contracts for the allocation of funds may be multiannual, taking into account the contractual commitments already entered into in previous years when determining the annual quota available. <p/> (8) Projects shall be co-financed up to 100 %. <p/> Article 12 <p/> (Financing of programme implementation costs under special laws) <p/> Notwithstanding the co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest in accordance with Article 10 of this Regulation, the total costs of the preparation and implementation of a special programme by a regional development agency shall be financed under a special contract, but these costs may represent no more than three per cent of the value of the special programme. <p/> Article 13 <p/> (Emergency regional policy measures) <p/> (1) A regional incentive may be granted to self-governing local authorities and individuals as an emergency regional policy measure in specific unforeseeable circumstances arising from a natural, ecological or other disaster. <p/> (2) Urgent regional policy measures referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be implemented in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the Regulation on the granting of regional State aid (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06, 70/07, 99/08 and 17/09). <p/> III.

In two years I have gained many regular clients, mostly younger entrepreneurs and companies who wanted to invest in their key staff. In 2007, at the request of our clients, I added training to my services and began to pass on to my clients many of the skills I had acquired at the School for Quality Living. I started with group trainings - lectures, motivational and team spirit workshops. In 2011, I added intensive motivational workshops in small groups of 3-5 people, which are very suitable for key personnel and highly motivated individuals. I started to expand my knowledge with the topics of restoring inner strength and increasing performance. Later I expanded the training topics to: developing potential, managing stressful situations, managing emotions in working with people, rational energy and time management, improving interpersonal relations at work, modern communication skills, increasing productivity, creativity and performance at work, leading from the inside out, developing intrinsic motivation and others. As I am continuously learning and improving myself, in line with the new knowledge I am acquiring, as well as the identified needs of my largely regular clients, I am constantly expanding my areas of training. In 2011, I also actively focused on Human Resources Development and individual training. I am moving the personalised approach to training, which for many years was reserved only for senior managers, to all levels, with the aim of maintaining and developing healthy, happy, effective and successful individuals who can bring the most of their strengths and potentials to the business environment. I combine individual training programmes with Inner Strength - Energy Revitalisation programmes in a very innovative and effective way. All trainings are designed to encourage, motivate and raise awareness of employees to continuously develop their key qualities and potentials. I try to ensure that my trainings are also a blend of practical knowledge combined with a lot of motivating energy for the participants and my efforts are confirmed by many satisfied clients.

Alongside its futuristic design, it also featured a highly unusual steering wheel. <p/> Sixty years ago, Citroen presented the Ami 6, the car that bridged the gap between Spaczko and the Vise at the turn of the 1980s. <p/> Inventions are usually the result of people trying to make everyday life easier for themselves, and they are often made by ordinary people, by users, not by highly educated experts. Wipers are one of the innovations that have come about in this way. <p/> We know who made the first internal combustion engine, the first car, the first diesel engine. But who made the first lorry? <p/> On this day 60 years ago, the Amphicar, the first large-scale amphibious vehicle, was unveiled at the New York Motor Show. <p/> In London, on this day 160 years ago, a tram line was laid between Notting Hill and Marble Arch.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train

547,"That the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, decided to deny our publication on Saturday morning via the twitter profile of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the information circulating about his (possible) resignation due to the fiasco of the water referendum ... <p/> ... but not himself, personally, as Minister Vizjak, since his possible departure from the ministerial office is not a matter of a decision of the ministry, but of the Prime Minister and the SDS party, suggests at least two things: <p/> - The minister's (admittedly justified) nervousness ... <p/> - ... and the fact that the quiet behind-the-scenes battle (for) Minister Vizjak is far from over. <p/> Meanwhile, it is worth noting the following: within the SDS party, it is increasingly being realised that Vizjak is no longer the minister from the second Janša government and that Vizjak is now even being meaningfully defended by individual members of Odlazko's political media on the grounds that Vizjak is ""Too Big to Fail"", which is not unexpected either. It is a logical consequence of the fact that Odlazek's media was taken into ownership some time ago <p/> When the political scene smelled a bit of Tanja Fajon - as a possible prime minister (here), Sebastjan Selan, former director of the SOVA during Pahor's government, has already appeared, then director of Petan's flagship companies, the now-sold Marina Portorož and the not-yet-sold Terme Čatež, also allegedly involved in the secret filming of Minister Zdravko Počivalšek during the mask affair (source), when Selan himself made a quick buck selling protective medical equipment during the first wave of the epidemic of Covida-19. Selan has long been considered a silent and publicly unacknowledged advisor to Fajon and, according to our sources within the SD, has already started recruiting (read: promising posts and positions ""when we come to power""), and in doing so, of course - quite expectedly for those who are more familiar with the situation in the party - he has bumped into the SD Secretary General Dejan Levanič and another behind-the-scenes SD recruiter, former SD Director General Uroš Jauševec. <p/> Today and tomorrow, including the days after Sunday's water referendum, are indeed thunder days for the Janez Janša government. After the referendum fiasco and the opposition's threats of a new constructive no-confidence motion, three extremely important votes of the National Assembly are scheduled today and tomorrow, when the government will need at least 45 and even 46 votes: <p/> - Today's vote on the demographic fund <p/> - And (tomorrow's) re-vote on the amendment to the law on infectious diseases, and the vote on the election of a new Minister for Digitalisation - Marko Boris Andrijanič (NSi). <p/> Because if all these votes fall, the Janša government will be seriously shaken, maybe even fall (well, the government representatives assure internally that they have the votes of the MPs guaranteed), which would most probably be followed by early elections.

556,"Turnkey prefabricated houses are available for anyone who wants to live in a cosy warm home. In addition to prefabricated houses, wooden houses are also an excellent choice. All information, benefits, contacts, opinions in one place. <p/> Category Archives. In Slovenia, wooden houses, wooden prefabricated houses are still quite unknown, not widespread. Most of the prefabricated wooden houses are made of logs. In terms of speed of construction, prefabricated wooden houses are built about as quickly as conventional prefabricated concrete houses. So there is no fear of construction taking too long. The main advantage of prefabricated wooden houses, at first sight, for us non-experts in this field, is that the material is wood. And it is high-quality solid wood, which is a completely natural, ecological material. So a prefabricated wooden house is homely, cosy, natural to look at. In addition, prefabricated wooden houses have good insulation, they are extremely safe in terms of seismic safety and, believe it or not, what is not apparent at first sight is that they are very safe from fire. So prefabricated wooden houses are no less fire-safe than a traditional prefabricated house. <p/> In any case, it makes sense to at least consider the possibility of a prefabricated wooden house, because it is a quality, natural, homely construction. Most people who decide to build a house do not even know that they have the possibility of living in a wooden house. And many experts in this field say that prefabricated wooden houses are the future in Slovenia, where we are known for the large percentage of forests. <p/> Building a house is the biggest material project in life for most people (Slovenians even more so). And it is usually a once-in-a-lifetime project, so the decision on what kind of house to build really has to be the right one. Or are we going to say, three years from now, when the neighbour has a special house, ""Ah, let's do it that way...""? No, it is not. So it is a very important decision. <p/>But there are many questions here. More and more people are asking whether prefabricated houses are the right decision. We have already talked about the facts that support prefabricated houses. But the decision is by no means over. When we decide to build a prefabricated house, some say a turnkey house, we have to ask ourselves - do we want a prefabricated house or a conventional house. The layman tends to lump the two together. But the differences are, in the eyes of the experts, extremely significant. Classic turnkey prefabricated houses have the walls made in the factory, then they are just erected on the building site. Skeleton prefabricated houses, on the other hand, require more effort and work on site, where the so-called skeleton is first assembled, then the walls are filled in. <p/> Many people are convinced by the quality of prefabricated houses, despite their perhaps slightly higher price. An essential feature of turn-key skeleton construction is the increased load-bearing capacity of the walls, which in turn means greater seismic safety, greater storm safety and greater fire safety. Turnkey prefabricated houses generally have extremely good characteristics, exceptional quality, and the proportion of these is increasing. Skeleton construction of prefabricated houses is considered by some to be the best quality choice at the moment.

563,"The second man to climb all eight thousanders <p/> GL3 Post ID: 91944 <p/> Post ID: 39741 <p/> Diary of Jerzy Kukuczkà, a Pole <p/> WARSAW - The world's public has hardly known that another man has achieved a feat that only the famous South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner has ever been able to match. Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland managed to do in ""just"" nine years what Messner took a total of 17 years to do: climb all fourteen of the world's eight-thousanders. <p/> Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland is a true high-altitude mountaineer. He is a man who has left the beaten track, taken his own path, almost played with the eight-thousanders, and in the process opened up some new perspectives for mountaineering at such altitudes. ""On 18 September 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka was on the summit of the 8046-metre-high Shisha Pangma and confirmed Messner's ambition of ""one man on all eight thousand metres"" as the second man. Like Messner, Kukuczka, a trained electrical engineer, was trying to blaze new trails: not the usual expedition routes, but much more challenging routes, some of them even in winter! Do the two super-climbers - Messner completed his round of fourteen eight-thousanders just one year before his rival - see each other as rivals? ""I can understand the race for the most climbs, but not the race for the most eight-thousanders"", the South Tyrolean commented. Was that really an honest word? In any case, the Pole also stresses that he had no rival in sight in pursuit of his great mountaineering goal. He even seems to have unlimited respect for Messner's success: ""This man deserves all our respect; he was the first to climb all the eight-thousanders - some of them more than once"". Sympathetic words. Kukuczek started with Lotse (8516 metres) in 1979, followed by Mount Everest (8848 metres). In October 1981, he himself climbed Makalu (8463 metres). A year later, he climbed Broad Peak, and in the summer of 1983 he climbed Gasherbrum II and I. In 1985, he succeeded in Daulagiri (8167 metres) and Cho Oyu (8201 metres). Kukuczka's ninth eight-thousander was Nanga Parbat (8125 metres). ""Stations"" 10,11, and 12 were - all in 1986 - Kangchendzenga (8586 metres), K 2 (8611 metres) and Manaslu (8163 metres). Anapurna (8091 metres) was the next in February 1987. Lastly, as already mentioned, Shisha Pangma in September 1987. On the summit of this mountain, a Pole bivouacked, brought his skis and descended to base camp the next morning! Jerzy Kukuczka lives with his family - his wife and two young sons - in Katowice. He is considered to be rather shy, he does not want to be in the limelight, he does not like television cameras. He has made a reputation not only for his own climbs, but also as a leader of mountaineering expeditions. He has always tried to get as many climbers as possible to the highest peak. On Shisha Pangama, he was accompanied by Wanda Rutkiewicz, his compatriot, who is considered the most successful climber of the highest mountains.",Opinionated News,train

When the competitors arrived, it was immediately noticeable that the women's part of the competition in particular was going to be very modest in participation this year. Only three female competitors in the body-fitness category and two in the bikini category showed up. This is almost disappointing for a competition of this reputation. Apart from the competitors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were not very competitive this year, most of the competitors came from Croatia. I missed the representatives from Slovenia and Hungary, whose participation greatly increased the quality and competitiveness of the competition. <p/> The number of visitors to the competition was also disappointing. The visiting hall has been considerably fuller in recent years, and the fans have been in a better mood. <p/> The competition started at 18:30. It went much faster than in previous years, which is commendable, but this is most likely due to the low turnout. <p/> Bikini fitness <p/> Bodybuilding over 95kg <p/> Absolute bodybuilding <p/> Adoni Costo <p/> The whole event ended with the traditional snack around 11 pm. <p/> The bikini category recorded the lowest turnout. I think that the latter is not yet widespread enough in Bosnia and Herzegovina for people to understand it or to want such a category. I hope that it will become more established in the coming years. <p/> The competition itself has also been cast in a bad light by some questionable and controversial refereeing decisions. I hope that this will not happen again in the future, as such behaviour by judges may lead to an even greater decline in the number of competitors and thus in the quality of the competition. <p/> Personally, I came back from the competition with good impressions. My competitor Marko Barić won the first place and thus the gold medal in his category. My competitor Meri Anronić, whom I helped in the last week of preparation before the competition, was also successful. I am only sad that she did not win first place, as she showed much better fitness than the first place winner. But again, I would add, the decisions of some of the judges were rather dubious and suspicious.",Review,train

Immediately afterwards, you could listen to a conversation with Gabrijela Žagar Fereira about the meeting of Slovenians in Stuttgart, which they managed to organise with the help of social networks. <p/> The 54th Slovenian Language, Literature and Culture Seminar concluded today in Ljubljana, bringing together around a hundred participants from all over the world who share a common desire to acquire knowledge in all three areas (language, literature and culture), but the two-week seminar is also a great opportunity for participants to get a close-up taste of life and events in Slovenia. Mojca Delač took to the radio microphone at the Faculty of Arts, which hosted the seminar. <p/> Gabrijela Žagar Fereira founded the Slovenians in Germany group so that she could share her experience with all those who have moved to Germany or have already made it their home. The group has grown rapidly and today has more than 7000 members. They have managed to solve many problems, and now, with the help of this group, they have come together to organise a meeting in a park in Stuttgart, says Gabrijela. A good number of Slovenians from the younger generation attended, which would have been very difficult to do without the help of social networks. <p/> Last week, Dora Žebot, a refugee and long-time journalist for the Slovenian section of the BBC, a London-born Slovenian who was born in Maribor, said goodbye at the age of 96. She was the daughter of the pre-war Deputy Mayor of Maribor, the conscious Slovene Franjo Žebot. Dora Žebot and her husband were among those Slovenian emigrants in London who did much to raise the profile of Slovenia. Her daughter, Alenka Lawrence, also a journalist, likes to tell how she joined her parents at the demonstrations with the banners ""Free Slovenia! Dora Žebot has followed Slovenian and world political events all her life. Many well-known Slovenians, writers, politicians and journalists have always visited her. <p/> Researcher Andreja Bezjak is asking for participation in the project ""Documenting Slovenian folklore among Slovenian emigrants in North America"". From 7 to 28 September 2018, she will continue her project of collecting Slovenian folklore, memories and life narratives of Slovenian emigrants in the USA and Canada. She is still looking for contacts in Toronto, Montreal, Pennsylvania and New York. In particular, he needs members of the older generation who still speak Slovene, which is not a prerequisite, but is desirable. <p/> On Sunday, 15 July, the great Slovenian artist, pianist Dubravka Tomšič Srebotnjak, will perform on the big stage of Teatro Colón in the 'Great International Performers' series.

On 19 July she will also perform in Uruguay, where she will be a soloist with the Montevideo Philharmonic Orchestra, and in Santiago de Chile, where she will give a recital. <p/> On 11 July, a memorial service for Barbara Celje was held at the Cathedral of St Vitus in Prague Castle, in the Chapel of St Wenceslas.

604,"Digital Marketing Essentials and Activities <p/> Today, it's harder than ever to stand out from all the competition. But you've never had as much chance of success as you do today. With all the options available, choosing services and tactics is an even more complex task. Strategically planned, results-oriented activities, a smart digital strategy with the optimal combination and design of solutions, tactics and campaigns, will deliver surprising results, especially for companies that are just starting to approach digital marketing professionally, strategically, comprehensively and purposefully, with thoughtful and modern results-oriented approaches. <p/> Due to the many myths, inaccurate or misleading claims, innovations on the one hand, and the real opportunities in digital marketing on the other, companies, individuals and even ""experts"" are still too often making superficial choices about where to focus their energy and resources. Providers often offer what they know how to do, rather than what customers actually need. That's why in the following lines we take a closer look at the basic activities of digital marketing, and the details that set effective digital strategies apart from the crowd of mediocre ones. <p/> 1. An engaging and responsive mobile-friendly website <p/> Your website has long since ceased to be just a business card. It's your central online presence and your company's first salesperson. No one employee can do it. That's why you need a bespoke website that generates new business and customers under any circumstances. In today's digital reality, more and more of us are accessing and interacting with brands via smartphones and tablets, so it's vital that visitors are able to view your website and content in a unified, personalised way across all devices. The user experience on the site must be just as efficient, equally and quickly transparent, and everything must be in its place, whether the content is accessed on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. Those of you who are still neglecting mobile technology, flexible display methods and customers in the moments when they have their phone in their hand may long regret it, because you are neglecting them in those intimate moments when the deepest connection with your followers, potential customers and readers can be made. <p/> 2. Website optimisation and search marketing for lead generation <p/> Anyone who thinks that SEO no longer exists, or no longer delivers the right results, has a bad sense of humour. Search engine optimisation is alive and well, now more than ever, as long as it is adapted to new SEO methods. It is, however, much more difficult to implement than in the past, thanks to Google's sophisticated, sometimes annoying, search algorithm, which is being refined on a daily basis. Together with on-page optimisation, online advertising on search engines (e.g. Google AdWords) allows us to attract more new customers more easily and more quickly. All digital marketing activities must also be continuously monitored using web analytics tools, data collated, analysed and your website optimisation strategy continuously updated. <p/> 3. Email marketing <p/> It is amazing how many people still turn a blind eye to the usefulness and effectiveness of email marketing. Even though we are already in 2017, sending emails to your target audience has always been one of the more effective tactics to increase traffic and conversions on your website. We also call email marketing the ""evergreen of digital marketing"". In addition to its direct impact on sales, email marketing plays an even more important role in building and nurturing a loyal follower base that is ""fed"" with content, which in turn increases repeat purchases and subsequent conversions. <p/> Just think how many emails you receive in your inbox every day. But do you think there would really be that much if it didn't work? <p/> Of course, our goal and yours is not to fill inboxes all the time, but sending targeted messages to a segmented population (who have given permission) works wonders. The need to automate all these processes also makes it necessary to use tools and integrate email marketing and other databases, tools. For all of you who have not yet integrated email marketing into your business, you have now learned where you have been making a basic mistake all this time. <p/> 4. Using social networks <p/> Today, people find it difficult to trust and are overwhelmed with information, questions, obligations; but we are demanding and informed customers who make decisions and buy emotionally. We strive to have and achieve everything at the click of a button or a click. The reality is not so simple. Our decision-making is also influenced by our relationships with people, brand representatives, their support service, the information given and other subliminal brand messages. <p/> Social networks are a place where we can manage all of this and delight our followers with expected or unexpected attention, replies, interesting content, rewards to reinforce our brand and showcase our values. If we implement all of the above effectively up to this point, our social media activities will only further expand and strengthen our visibility and recognition. <p/> 5. Content marketing as a link <p/> The link between a smart and successful digital marketing strategy is the content strategy and the publishing calendar. Thus, content marketing, blog articles, images, infographics, e-books, videos, reports, etc., represent an increasing share of digital marketing investment. How could they not, when digital content has become the most important means of communication today. There are more and more reasons to plan, organise and produce content that wins the hearts of readers according to a specific publishing calendar. The measure of good content is not the beauty of the copy, but the value of the content that engages and leaves you wanting more. This builds authority and reinforces reader loyalty to the brand. Diverse content is becoming the flagship of digital messaging, giving colour and tone to communication and the selection of new customers. The importance of content is even greater when it comes to B2B marketing and sales. <p/> If you want to succeed and offer your customers something more than the rest, content strategy and segmented communication is one of the key success factors, so think very carefully about how you organise this area.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

611,"Front page / Current / Columns / Column: If fish could talk <p/> 08.02.2021 <p/> COLUMN DZZŽ NOVO MESTO <p/> Last month I discussed children's desire for an animal friend and how sometimes parents recklessly choose an animal to please their child. In the meantime, I also touched on goldfish in passing, which reminded me that fish actually deserve a column of their own. They are animals that are often misunderstood, inadequately treated and poorly cared for. <p/> Although most people think otherwise, fish also feel pain and fear. In fact, they are quite complex creatures that experience the world in much the same way as we do. This means that we need to arrange their environment in a way that keeps them relaxed and healthy. But what kind of environment is suitable for fish? <p/> This question creates an ""Emmental effect"" - more cheese, more holes, i.e. it offers more new questions than answers. Aquaristics is a rather complex and very large field and it is impossible to answer such a question in a few short sentences. Therefore, this article is by no means an aquarist's handbook, but only a cursory attempt to encourage you to take a responsible approach to aquaristics. <p/> It is actually a matter of imitating as closely as possible the environment in which a particular species of fish is found in the wild. So, before setting up a new aquarium, we need to consider the needs of a particular organism or choose a species that we can make comfortable in our aquarium. So what are the characteristics of a 'good' aquarium? <p/> First and foremost, the aquarium must be the right shape and size. Here I can mention goldfish, which are a textbook example of aquatic organisms that are most often found in a totally inappropriate environment. The goldfish, Carassius auratus auratus, originates from China, grows as large as 30-40 cm, and is a schooling fish, which means that we need to stock at least 5-10 specimens in total. It logically follows that these fish are only suitable for large, outdoor ponds and that there are not many that can be suitably housed in an aquarium in an apartment. I should add that they have a very long life span, living for several decades, and they are also very intelligent and can be taught tricks. If they could talk, what would all those poor little goldfish crammed into too small containers have to say? Of course, it is understandable that we do not have unlimited space for huge aquariums at home, and there is nothing wrong with that. In this case, however, we simply have to choose a species of fish that is comfortable in a smaller aquarium. <p/> Water properties are also very important. Water can be hard or soft, basic or acidic. Hard water is water in which a lot of minerals are dissolved. Tap water in Slovenia is often quite hard (have you noticed how quickly limescale builds up in the bathroom?), but a large proportion of ornamental aquarium fish are soft-water fish - in nature they live in waters with few dissolved minerals. If a fish is living in water that is not of a suitable quality (for example, a soft-water fish living in hard water, or water that is not of a good quality due to insufficient filtration), this is stressful for the fish. Prolonged presence of stress hormones leads to failure of internal organs and metabolism. One example of a fish that most people are familiar with, at least in appearance, and which is often stocked in unsuitable aquariums is the Siamese fighting fish, the betta. This type of fish needs very soft, slightly acidic water and lots of the right plants, so water from our taps is not usually suitable for them. Before we introduce organisms, we need to check the parameters of our water and adapt it to the needs of our aquatic sub-tenants, or rather, choose ones that can live in the water we have. <p/> Another very important thing for any healthy aquarium is a biologically stable filter. Filtration in an aquarium is not as simple as most people imagine. It is not just a matter of dirt particles getting stuck in the filter material and then being washed off. Filtration must also, and above all, be biological, which means that the filter and other surfaces in the aquarium are inhabited by beneficial bacteria that break down food debris, fish poo and plant debris, thus improving water quality. This filtration does not happen overnight, of course, and the bacteria need time to multiply sufficiently. From the first day we start the aquarium, it will be at least two weeks or more before it is stable enough for fish to settle in. Changes in the water parameters should be monitored regularly (with tests for nitrite, nitrate, ammonia). The values will first rise and then fall back - at that point the aquarium is established, or as aquarists put it - sciklan. <p/> In addition to the above, the choice of decoration, plants and combinations of organisms that can coexist together is also important. Of course, plastics are largely avoided in favour of natural materials (wood, stone), but which ones and how much depends on the individual fish species. The right plants are also an important part of a healthy aquarium and it is generally recommended to keep the aquarium as overgrown as possible (except, of course, when you have fish that also live in a plant-free environment in the wild). Often, aquariums are decorated with boats, treasure chests, castles and similar kitsch, which, of course, have nothing to do with the fish and their natural environment. <p/> Like all other animals, we have a duty to look after fish and other aquatic organisms in a way that makes them feel good. This is not only a moral but also a legal duty for all animal owners. Unfortunately, our wishes and aesthetics are last on the list of priorities when it comes to aquarium design. If we cannot accept this fact, then we can consider another hobby. Let's ask ourselves what the fish would tell us if they could talk. <p/> Anyone interested in learning more about aquaristics, aquatic organisms, choosing and setting up an aquarium can find a lot of useful information online, for example on the Alfa in betta blog, and in various Facebook groups, such as Aquarstika Slovenia - Bojan Dolenc.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

614,"international protection - restriction of movement of an applicant for international protection - removal procedure - abuse of procedure - objective criteria - implementation of the Directive <p/> Core <p/> The presumption that an applicant has made an application solely to delay his/her return can be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that Article 8 of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Directive is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 is amended accordingly. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> I. The action is allowed and the contested decision No 2142-906/2020-6 (1312-02) of 4 June 2020 is annulled. <p/> II. The application for interim measures is dismissed. <By the contested order, the defendant detained the applicant on the ground that his movements were already restricted as a result of the return procedure under the Law on the entry, stay and departure of aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the removal procedure, and that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant had lodged the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. It decided that the applicant would be detained at the premises of the Aliens Centre in Postojna from 4 June 2020 from 15.20 until the end of the reason, but no longer than until 4 September 2020 at 15.20, with the possibility of an extension of one month. <p/> 2. In the grounds for the decision, the defendant states that the applicant lodged an application for international protection in the Republic of Slovenia on 4 June 2020. On 2 June 2020, the applicant was released from prison. .... The District Court ... imposed on him, inter alia, the ancillary sanction of expulsion of the alien from the country. As it was not possible to remove the applicant immediately from Slovenia, he was placed by decision of 2 June 2020 in the Aliens Centre, where he expressed his wish to apply for international protection on 3 June 2020, and his application was formally accepted on 4 June 2020. At the time of his application, the applicant stated that he had left his country of origin 4 years previously. He has not yet applied for international protection in Slovenia, but he has applied in Italy, where he holds a passport. He has been in Slovenia since October 2019. The applicant said that he was applying now because he had been in prison, and in prison he did not know that he could apply for international protection. Immediately after his entry into Slovenia, he was caught and put in prison. He was in Italy waiting for a decision on his application for international protection, but in the meantime he made a mistake and went to Slovenia, where he went to prison. He is seeking international protection in Slovenia because he is at risk in Pakistan. <p/> 3. According to the defendant, the condition for restriction of movement laid down in Article 84(3)(1) of the International Protection Act ('the IPA-1') is fulfilled. Given that the applicant had previously applied for international protection also in France and Italy, and then went to his country of origin and married there, and came back to Italy and then to Slovenia, the Court finds that by such actions he prevents any State from taking a substantive decision on his alleged problems in his country of origin. The applicant was also the subject of removal proceedings from the Republic of Slovenia, which he formally discontinued by lodging an application for international protection. For the above reason, the defendant rightly concludes that he made the application only with a view to delaying or obstructing the implementation of the removal. Since his arrest by the police on 11 October 2019, he has had the opportunity to apply for international protection, but has not done so. He could have made an application earlier and not only at the time of his detention in the Detention Centre, as he was certainly aware of this possibility in the light of his previous applications. <p/> 4. In the further reasoning of the decision, the defendant explains in detail why it is necessary to restrict the applicant's movements to the premises of the Aliens Centre and not to the asylum centre, where such a restriction of movement could not be sufficiently effective. The purpose of the restriction of movement could not be achieved by a less severe measure, since there are no appropriate mechanisms in the asylum centre to prevent the departure of the asylum seeker from the asylum centre. <p/> 5. The applicant brings the present action on all the grounds laid down in Article 27 of the Administrative Disputes Act (hereinafter 'the ADL-1'). In his application, he submits that he has been consistent in his statements throughout. He had already lodged an application for international protection in Italy on 2 August 2018 and before that in France (4 July 2017). In Pakistan, his entire family is in dispute with his uncle over land left by his grandfather. The uncle has taken this land and is now threatening the complainant and his brother. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to go back as he is afraid of his uncle. At the same time, he wishes he could sell the land and move to Italy or Slovenia with his family. That's why he applied for international protection here as soon as he got out of prison .... He did not lodge his application in Slovenia with the intention of delaying or obstructing his removal from Slovenia. His application is substantive and genuine and is not made to obstruct the proceedings. Furthermore, a measure of restriction of movement to the Aliens Centre may only be ordered where, in a particular case, a measure of restriction of movement to the asylum centre cannot be effectively implemented. The defendant could have ordered a mandatory detention order in the asylum centre, which would have been a proportionate measure. The applicant claims that the Court should allow the action and set aside the contested order and, in the alternative, that the Court should allow the action, set aside the contested order and refer the case back to the defendant for further proceedings. <p/> 6. The applicant also applied for an interim injunction together with the application, requesting the court to suspend the operation of the contested order pending a final decision on that order. The contested order infringes the applicant's right to personal liberty. <7. In its reply to the application, the defendant submits that the contested order is lawful and correct and therefore maintains it and requests that the action be dismissed as unfounded. <p/> Concerning point I of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 8. <In reaching its decision, the defendant relied on Article 84(1)(3) of the MZM-1.  It follows from Article 84, paragraph 3, of the Law on the Protection of the Persons with Disabilities, that the competent authority may order an applicant to be subject to a measure of compulsory detention in the territory of an asylum home where the applicant's movement is restricted as a result of the return procedure pursuant to the Law on the Entry, Stay and Departure of Aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the return procedure or the removal procedure, and where there are grounds to believe that the applicant has made the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, where he/she has had the opportunity to apply for international protection. It follows from the above provision that several conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled in order for this ground for restriction of movement to be established. One of the conditions is that it may be reasonably assumed that the applicant made the application only to delay or impede the execution of the removal, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. The defendant based its presumption that the applicant had made the application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal on the fact that he had not made the application earlier, even though he could have done so. <p/> 11. The provision of Article 84(3)(1) ZMZ-1 implements Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection ('Reception Directive II') in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia. The above-mentioned provision of the ZMZ-1 implements Article 8(3)(d) of the Reception Directive II. It provides that an applicant may be detained where the applicant is detained for the purpose of return proceedings in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2008 on the application of the European Return Procedure (Directive 2008/115/EC). The Member State concerned may, on the basis of objective criteria, including the fact that the applicant has already had the opportunity to initiate the asylum procedure, conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is making the application solely to delay or impede the execution of the return decision. Furthermore, Article 8(3) of the Reception Directive II further provides that the grounds for detention are to be defined in national law. <p/> 12. That provision therefore expressly provides that the presumption that an applicant has made an application solely for the purpose of delaying his or her return may be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that the above-mentioned provision of the Reception Directive II has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Reception Directive II is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 has been amended accordingly (Article 84(1)(3), first indent, ZMZ-1). The ZMZ-1 should lay down criteria by which it could be reasonably concluded whether an applicant has lodged an asylum application for the sole purpose of withholding his/her removal. Such objective criteria should also be laid down in the law in order to respect the basic principles underlying Reception Directive II. Thus, the introductory part of the cited Directive states in point 15 that the detention of applicants should be applied in accordance with the basic principle that a person should not be detained solely because he or she is seeking international protection, in particular in accordance with the international legal obligations of the Member States and Article 31 of the Geneva Convention. An applicant should only be detained in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, as provided for in this Directive, and taking into account the principle of necessity and proportionality as regards both the manner and the purpose of such detention. <p/> 13. Therefore, since Reception Directive II explicitly provides in its introductory part that detention may only be carried out in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, the criteria for presuming that someone has made an application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal must be sufficiently defined in law, and, as already explained, the current MHC-1 does not contain such objective criteria. The mere fact that an applicant lodges an asylum application at the time when removal from the country is being carried out does not in itself mean that he has lodged it solely for the purpose of obstructing removal, having regard to the fact that it is apparent from the data in the Eurodac database, which form part of the administrative file, that the applicant had previously lodged an application for international protection in Italy and France. <p/> 14. The Court further observes that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia has already examined the correctness and lawfulness of the decision in cases X Ips 1/2019 and X Ips 11/2019 concerning Article 84(1)(5), first indent, of the ZMZ-1, which refers to Article 28 of Regulation 604/2013/EU ('the Dublin III Regulation'), and thus to the risk of absconding referred to in Article 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation, which provides that the risk of absconding must be established on the basis of the objective criteria laid down by the law. The Supreme Court, in its judgments in the cases cited above, found that these criteria (despite Article 31(2) of the MZZ-1, which deals with the risk of absconding in a blanket manner) are not present in the MZZ-1, and that there is therefore no legal basis for the imposition of such a measure of restriction of movement. In the present case, the objective criteria for the defendant to be entitled to reasonably assume that the applicant is applying for international protection only to delay or impede the implementation of the return decision are not laid down in the law. The Court therefore concludes that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a movement restriction measure under Article 84 § 84 (3), first indent, of the MLM-1 in the present case either. <15. Since the Court of First Instance considers that, in the present case, there is therefore no ground for restriction of movement under the third indent of Article 84(1) of the ZMZ-1, the Court of First Instance annuls the contested decision on the basis of Article 64(1)(4) of the Causes of Action Act. Since the Court annulled the order on the ground that it had erred in the application of substantive law, it did not rule on all the other pleas relied on by the applicant in the application. <p/> 16. Article 84(6) of the CTMO-1 provides that the court shall, after hearing the applicant orally beforehand, decide on the applicant's application within three working days. It is clear from the draft ZMZ-11 that the hearing is to be held on the grounds of a substantial interference with the applicant's liberty, i.e. in his favour. However, in the present case, where there is no adequate basis for the measure of restriction of movement under Article 84(3), first paragraph, first indent, of the ZMZ-1, a hearing of the applicant would even achieve the opposite purpose. The holding of a main hearing would therefore be an end in itself; at the same time, the principle of the economy of proceedings would be infringed, since the court would have to ensure the applicant's presence, provide him with an interpreter and represent him by proxy in order to hear him, thereby incurring unnecessary procedural costs. Nor was the defendant's right to be heard thereby infringed, since he was served with the application, to which he replied. <p/> On point II of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 17. The Court dismissed the application for interim measures, applying mutatis mutandis Article 36(1)(6) Causa-1, on the ground that, in the light of the decision on the application for interim measures, the applicant had no legal interest in the interim proceedings. In accordance with Article 73(1) of the Causes of Civil Procedure Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment and, since no appeal is possible, the court's judgment (point I of the operative part of the operative part of the judgment) means that the court has given a final decision on the matter, and the applicant therefore no longer has a legal interest in the interim injunction, which is time-bound until the final decision. The final judgment of that judgment in itself terminates the restriction of movement, since the order for restriction of movement has been lifted.",Legal/Regulation,train

618,"EVENING: A conversation with an ethical hacker <p/> 26 January 2015 Gregor Grosman, Večer <p/> Boštjan Špehonja is a hacker by profession, but he doesn't use his knowledge to cause harm, but offers it to companies for the benefit of discovering security holes and flaws. <p/> Hacking is done in agreement with the company, which also sets the rules for what the hacker can do and how far he can go, explains Boštjan Špehonja, who attended Unistar's RoglIT '15 conference as an independent expert. When conducting penetration tests, an ethical hacker avoids doing any harm, stealing data or deliberately disabling services, because we know that there are types of attacks that can temporarily disable a website. <p/> More vulnerabilities every day <p/> The fact that the number of intrusions is increasing does not mean that ethical hackers have more work to do. Špehonja explains that there is another constant here, as companies, both large and small, are not even aware yet of what data loss means in concrete terms. ""There is a big step to be taken here to make companies more aware. There are more vulnerabilities every day, and if an administrator falls asleep, there's no need for anyone to go after that company specifically. There are Chinese, there are Pakistanis, there are Nigerians who automatically scan the internet, public IPs, all day long. As soon as they realise that a particular system is vulnerable, an automation is running in the background to exploit that vulnerability and cause your system to be used for further attacks to mask the real attacker."" <p/> The problem lies in the belief of those in charge at many companies, who often wrongly assume that their data is of no interest to attackers. What is interesting are their computers, which hackers then exploit as bots for further attacks, explains Špehonja, who adds that while security starts with passwords, it is the human factor that he believes should be better educated in computer security. ""Safe use of the Internet seems to be a given. This is why children in school and kindergarten are not given enough emphasis on safe use of the internet, and the trends of online scams and scammers are on the rise,"" he explains, adding that, after all, you can get one email, click on a link, open a little program, and you are already infected and can lose all your data or, in the worst case, even suffer financial damage. <p/> Don't use keys found on the ground <p/> In the case of attacks on large companies, such as the ones we have seen recently, these are well-planned attacks that take months to plan, and the attackers usually send an insider. Often the hackers' work is made easier by the ""human factor"", whether it is misconfigured fire security or users clicking on them, and often hackers leave USB sticks in car parks for example, which are then found and used by employees, even though, as the ethical hacker explains, the ISO 27001 security policy states that sticks found on the ground are not to be inserted into company computers. ""These are all methods that are tested by attackers and sooner or later someone makes a mistake that opens the door to the company,"" concludes Špehonja. <p/> Anonymous well paid from behind the scenes <p/> When asked about the workings of Anonymous, the ethical hacker believes that it is a group that is well paid and run by someone, just like there are various viruses that are written specifically for the Middle East, which after seven years are found to have been funded by certain governments. ""My personal opinion is that the main men are funded by a certain side to carry out certain attacks. Of course, this is also a trend among young people, to be Anonymous and to put a mask on Facebook. It's a subculture that is being exploited. Anonymous has a whole bunch of programmes of its own, but there is also a double-edged sword here. You decide as a teenager to be a member of Anonymous, you use their program, which really gives you some advantages, because they teach you how to ""shekat"" a certain thing, which you would otherwise also get on the Internet, but by doing that you put your computer at risk, because you don't know if that little program was clean and if maybe your computer is already in the process of being prepared for some DDoS attack that they are doing in the background,"" explains Špehonja. <p/> Hackers in movies and in reality <p/> The movie Hacker is currently playing in cinemas.Visualising an intrusion is always a particularly challenging task, often with user interfaces that are either very graphically sophisticated or a simple DOS window with opaque program code or numbers flying by extremely fast. Spehonja explains how far this is from reality by saying that ""those numbers, those codes flying around, are usually laughed at by those of us who are in the field."" The IP 352.612.x.x is nonsense, because there is no such thing as a number greater than 255. ""As far as critical infrastructure is concerned, the degradation of water, transport infrastructure, electricity, etc. I would be careful what to say here, but it is also a possible attack. Of course it is possible, but of course it is more difficult. Such an attack would, of course, take a long time to prepare for, but the theoretical possibilities are there. After all, some people say that everything can be faked. Some people spend all day just writing programs that hack into other programs,"" adds the ethical hacker, who sees the movie scenes as being mostly exaggerated.",Information/Explanation,train

In addition to the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Borut Pahor, important Turkish investors were also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Mitja Mavko, a representative of the Slovenian Compensation Insurance Company and the Director of Spirit Boštjan Skalar. In his opening remarks, the President of the Republic stressed that Turkey and Slovenia have a long-standing friendship and respect, which is also very important for economic cooperation on both sides. He described Turkey's goal of becoming one of the ten strongest economies in the world in the next 10 years as inspiring and admirable. ""Turkey is of strategic importance for Slovenia and we need to strengthen cooperation at all levels. Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia,"" the President said. Addressing more than 80 Turkish investors, President Pahor presented Slovenia as a dynamic, open and export-oriented country and invited potential investors to come to Slovenia. He highlighted Slovenia's human potential and its exceptional geopolitical position as a meeting point between Central and South-Eastern Europe. In this context, he recalled that he and President Gül had agreed at their meeting yesterday on the utmost importance of the Brdo Process initiative for the stability of the Western Balkans. There are many opportunities for strategic investment in Slovenia, President Pahor said, underlining that Slovenia is very interesting for Turkey, as the two countries have well-regulated contractual relations and have concluded all the most important agreements in practically all areas of common interest. Among the most important of these is the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Yesterday afternoon, the President attended the 6th Annual Conference of Ambassadors of the Republic of Turkey, where he gave a short lecture. After the lecture, the President also met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Ali Babacan. Late yesterday afternoon, President Pahor met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During their talks, President Pahor and Mr Erdoğan noted that the effects of the strategic partnership signed two years ago are already visible and committed to further cooperation. Prime Minister Erdoğan welcomed President Pahor's willingness to open an investment conference in Istanbul today to present concrete opportunities for Turkish investors to invest in Slovenian companies, for more vibrant cooperation between the economies of the two countries, and for a possible joint appearance on third markets. The two also discussed some aspects of the Syrian crisis, which has led to over 600,000 refugees fleeing to Turkey in recent months. In this context, Mr Erdoğan outlined his views on stopping the armed conflict in the light of the forthcoming Geneva 2 meeting, as without immediate action the conflict could take on wider regional dimensions. <p/> Search <p/> Contact",News/Reporting,train

644,"Wordsmith - P <p/> packet <p/> The largest unit that can be transmitted over a network at one time. Messages created by an application are split into several parts and compressed into different packets for transmission over the network. Each packet is sent separately and can use different access to the destination. When all the packets have reached their destination, the destination computer reassembles all the packets into the original message. This is the basic function of the packet exchange mode in a network. <p/> packet filtering <p/> A firewall technique that prevents certain packets from accessing the network. Packet filters can be created based on hardware addresses, IP addresses, port numbers or other criteria. For example, a router can be configured to allow only certain computers to access the Internet or to deny its own computers access to certain network servers. Although this feature is usually used only to protect against intrusion of other computers into your network, it can also be used to restrict certain LANs on your private inter-network. <p/> packet switching <p/> This is the process by which messages are broken into packets and sent through a router to facilitate transmission over a wide area network. These chunks (called packets) may take different paths to the addressee and may be sent in a different order than they were created, but the addressee is able to assemble these packets as they were sent. Packet switching allows computers to share a network with each other. If computers were to send messages all at once, they could block other computers from accessing the network for long periods of time. <p/> passive detection <p/> Recording of what happens on the network, which is saved to a file for the administrator to look at. <p/> passive hub <p/> The hub simply makes a physical and electrical connection between all connected stations. Normally such couplers are not live. They are not renewed by the signaller. They are practically no longer in use today. <p/> password history <p/> List of passwords that have been used. <p/> patch <p/> Software that corrects a defect in an existing program or operating system. <p/> Cable connecting a computer or hub/switch to a socket/panel. <p/> patch panel <p/> A place where installation cables are connected. <p/> PC Card <p/> An input/output device made for laptops that allows manufacturers to create network cards, modems and other devices about the size of a credit card. <p/> peer-to-peer network <p/> A network system in which each computer can be a server or a client. Each computer also retains its own security settings that allow it to control access to its resources. Peer-to-peer networking is useful in smaller networks because no administration is required and users can keep their own security settings. In larger peer-to-peer networks, the network is not efficient enough because users need their own user account for each computer and because the access capabilities are less flexible and robust than those used by a server-based network. <p/> peer-to-peer network <p/> It is also a term for a file-sharing service on the Internet. <p/> physical layer <p/> The lowest layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, which defines the type of network itself, how it should be installed and what types of signals it should carry. In the case of a LAN, the physical layer is highly correlated with the data layer, which is just above it, because the data layer contains similar specifications to the physical layer. <p/> ping <p/> A TCP/IP command in a command prompt used to test whether a computer is able to communicate with others on the network. Ping creates an ICMP packet and sends it to the computer specified in the command. The recipient sends it back as an ICMP reply. If the request times out, the host is unreachable. The system using ping then indicates the time between the message sent and the reply received. Seemingly every TCP/IP user contains a version of ping. <p/> Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) <p/> A common phrase referring to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), the standard copper-cabled telephone network used for analogue communications worldwide. <p/> Point-to-Point <p/> Network communication in which two devices have exclusive access to a medium's network. For example, a printer that is connected to only one workstation will use a point-to-point connection. <p/> Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) <p/> A protocol at the data link layer that uses a dial-up line from the user to the ISP's terminal server. In contrast to its predecessor, the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), PPP includes support for multiple network layer protocols, connection quality observation protocols, and protocols for authentication, error detection, security, dynamic IP addressing. PPP is used to connect between only two computers and therefore does not need as many features as local area network protocols, such as address fields for each packet and a media access control (MAC) mechanism. <p/> Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) <p/> A data link layer protocol for remotely connecting a computer to a tunnel over the Internet. The protocol allows a secure virtual private network (VPN) to be created, allowing a user to access a server on a shared network via a secure direct connection over the Internet. The entire data link layer frame generated by the application is encapsulated in an IP datagram. This procedure violates the rules of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, but ensures that the entire PPP frame is encrypted in the IP datagram. <p/> port <p/> A code number that identifies a process running on a computer with a TCP/IP protocol stack. Transport layer protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) specify the number of source and destination ports in the header of each message they generate. The combination of IP address and port number identify a particular application on a particular computer or network. Port numbers up to 1024 are referred to as well-known port numbers, which are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet's numbering authority, to ordinary applications. For example, the TCP port number is a well-known port number for network servers. Numbers greater than 1024 are short-lived port numbers, since they are chosen by clients in random order for each transaction they make with the server. <p/> port <p/> A port is a socket on a computer or other network device for connecting cables to other devices. <p/> Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) <p/> An application layer protocol used to transfer e-mail from an SMTP server to a network client. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is used for traffic between servers and for outgoing mail at the client. <p/> presentation layer <p/> This is the sixth layer (second from the top) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It is responsible for data presentation, data compression, data encryption and the conversion of file graphic commands (e.g. mouse movement) into commands and code table conversion. The computer translates the data generated by its applications from its syntax into a common syntax suitable for transmission over a network. When the data arrives at a particular address, the presentation layer translates this plain syntax into the syntax used by that computer. <p/> promiscuous mode (common mode) <p/> Operational mode is only possible on certain network interfaces that cause the interface to read and process all packets sent over the local network, not just packets addressed to it. Common mode is used by protocol analysers to subsequently analyse general patterns of network traffic. <p/> protocol <p/> Specifies some predefined set of rules that govern how a computer or device communicates and exchanges data on a network. A protocol is actually a language that a computer uses to communicate. The second computer to which the first is connected must use the same language in order for them to communicate. Computers use many different protocols to communicate, which has given the OSI reference model, which defines the layers at which different protocols operate, a higher value. <p/> protocol suite, protocol stack <p/> A set of protocols that interact with each other are used to communicate with other computers with the same protocol stack. Even though each protocol stack is based on the ISO/OSI reference model, it is not necessary that a given protocol stack will have all the layers of the OSI model. For example, on a computer connected to a local area network, the protocol stack consists of application layer protocols, data link layer protocols and a physical layer specification. <p/> Signalling scheme used in the 1000BaseT gigabit version of Ethernet. PAM-5 is one of the elements that enable 1000BaseT to use standard Category 5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable. <p/> Peripheral <p/> Any device that can be connected to a computer to extend its capabilities. <p/> permanent virtual circuit (PVC) <p/> A virtual path through a packet network that is established for an extended period of time by network maintenance personnel at the request of a customer. <p/> physical mesh topology <p/> A network configuration where each device has many connections. These multiple links provide redundant connections. <p/> physical port <p/> An access point for a network device that allows a cable of a specific type to be connected. A port allows a device to connect to another device via a cable. <p/> A network topology that forms a ring shape. Data travels along the ring in one direction and each device on the ring acts as a regenerator, maintaining the signal as it travels. Each device includes a receiver for the incoming signal and a transmitter to send the data to the next device in the ring. The network depends on the capability of the signal travelling around the ring. <p/> physical star topology <p/> Describes a network in which a cable is routed from each network entity to a central device called a star. The star allows all devices to communicate if they are directly connected to it. <p/> physical topology <p/> The physical topology of a network can be a bus, star, ring or full topology. <p/> Ping of Death <p/> ICMP sends a flood of large packets to a remote host. At that point, the host usually restarts or hangs itself. <p/> plenum-rated coating <p/> A coating on coaxial cable that does not produce toxic gas when it burns. <p/> power blackout <p/> A complete loss of power that can last from a few seconds to several hours. <p/> A condition where the power drops below normal for a few seconds and returns to normal <p/> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) <p/> Software for implementing RSA encryption. <p/> print server <p/> Central device that controls and manages networked printers. A print server may be hardware/software or a combination of both. Some print servers are already built into the network printer network interface. <p/> print services <p/> Network services control and manage printing on the network, allowing multi-access and simultaneous access to the printer. <p/> Private Branch Exchange (PBX) <p/> A private telephone network used in an enterprise that shares a number of outside lines between itself. <p/> private key <p/> A technology where the sender and receiver have the same key. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. <p/> private network <p/> The part of the network that lies behind the firewall and is not visible to the Internet. <p/> protocol analyser <p/> A software and hardware tool used to decode protocol messages and try to determine the source of a network error. <p/> proxy server <p/> A firewall technique is used to allow, via a TCP/IP client, access to Internet resources without incurring significant interference from other sides of the network. A proxy server is an application that runs on a computer with an internal IP address, when the client uses an external IP address (i.e. the one given to it by the ISP), so that the internal IP addresses are then invisible to the Internet. The client application is configured by sending Internet service requests within the broker server and the broker server sends these requests to the appropriate Internet server using its external IP addresses. When it receives a response from the Internet server, it sends it back to its client. The intermediary server is dedicated to specific applications only and the client must be configured with the addresses of this server. The administrator can also configure it. <p/> public <p/> Can be used by anyone, of course under certain conditions. <p/> public key <p/> A technology that uses two keys for expedited communication, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to decrypt messages for the recipient. <p/> public network <p/> The part of the network on the outside of the firewall that is open to the public. <p/> Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <p/> In the USA, the term for the public telephone network. However, if we were to use the local term, it is an analogue telephone line. Also known as Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train
648,"Dear Sir or Madam ! Please post this reflection of mine ! The public sector is financed from the budget, which in turn is ""filled"" by the economy. This same economy has gone through so many crises over the last DECADES and more, but has survived them all. If we remember the last crises, when the same ""now striking administration"" was telling us that the wage bill of the companies is what it is, that it cannot be increased, and that we should find our INTERNAL reserves and share this wage bill.... Where and what is now the face of this same administration, which at that time ""taught us to manage"" , now that the FIRST CRISIS has come for THEM and there is no money to take from the state coffers because they are empty, and it cannot or will not tell itself this. This time there is no solidarity !???!!! Apart from the fact that all DU employees have guaranteed jobs, which is far from being the case in the economy, they have, on average, a higher education than the economy, but not more responsibility because they do what is prescribed for them, mostly leisurely work, and they have good working conditions.... and on and on and on, incomparable to the economy. If any of the civil service workers do not like this and that job, they should resign and come to the economy. Here the working conditions will be different, the salaries the same, no promotions according to seniority.... and there are benefits that do not exist in the economy as in DU. Besides, this government should ""audit"" the entire administration, identify MORE employees and send them to the employment service as in the economy and money is saved immediately in the budget as the benefits from the employment service are much smaller. The introduction of computerisation has simplified procedures compared to the previous manual work and the number of employees in DU is increasing. Where is the logic here ? Isn't this already a blatant mockery of the economy ? We would all do well to ""shut up"" and wait for better times for better wages. I don't mean that DU should not be used, it should just be rationalised, because in some sectors there are even 30-40% too many employees in the JU. There is a MASS for JU salaries and finding internal reserves. If someone is a top it can be both in DU and in the economy and why privilege; a worker from the economy to ""work the stock exchange"", but not a JU employee because the JU does not share its money for salaries, but the contributions of the economy. If the civil service is not satisfied with a salary of between 1 000 and 2 000 Euros and would find it impossible to survive if it were reduced by perhaps 100 Euros, they should think of their neighbours, acquaintances, relatives, pensioners, the unemployed.... who have to survive a month on 250 Euros of social assistance or a salary of 450 Euros for a job that these same gentlemen dislike and are ashamed of. We in the economy are not ashamed of doing any work, but they can be SHAMED of being so 'greedy and uncharitable' towards those who earn money on their, not very small, salaries for the work they do. The cheques have to be paid by us 'little ones' too, but with much much smaller incomes. 'Where there is no money, even the army cannot take it'. This should be the guiding principle of the striking civil service !!! And hello strikers, I would say Bogdan Pleša --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.11.2010 Dear ! I cannot imagine that the state is so DIVIDED with various aids and supports to categories of people who are ineligible or no longer in need. Every 20th of the month I watch how this is played out in M.Sobota. Roma people drive their Mercedes, BMWs, Audis ..... to the NLB car park to get help, raise support, and then occupy the pubs and get drunk. I have already pointed this out to the CSD and suggested that they should find out again who is actually entitled to support, but the ladies won't get off their arses and would go to the field to check the reality of the situation. A family that has a car is not a social problem and, in my opinion, is not entitled to support. How 'difficult' it is to find out who owns a vehicle, if we 'pull' from the vehicle registration database all the vehicles registered in a settlement such as Pušča, it is no easier, you just have to have the courage to do your job honestly - a well-paid and surely 'public job' for which civil servants struggle to get paid. But where is the accountability for their work. Do they realise that in doing so they are cutting off the bread of those who actually need help ? The t.z. should also be checked. ""The 'divorced couples' who are separated only because the lady is a single mother, but in reality they continue to live together. Again, someone has not done their job. Is it the municipality, the KS or another centre that knows the real situation, the CSD that gives help and support and who else? If all the 'salary strikers' would rather do their job as they should and at least be a little bit aware of the responsibility for their work, it would be much much better. It is not really possible to identify all the irregularities, because it is mainly the Roma who are 'cunning', but it is a fact that a great deal of money would be left in the state coffers for other, urgent needs. Mr Svetlik, in particular, needs to reflect on this and put things right in THIS area of his own. If he cannot or will not do this, HE SHOULD RESIGN, because incompetent ministers were disliked by Maria Theresa and are unwanted even now. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, but a cut has finally got to be made in this area too. If you analyse the matter well, you will see that I am right, we just have to do our job as well as we can and for which we are paid, even if it is unpleasant. I am writing all this for the sake of all those who actually need help to survive, not for luxury and drunkenness ! LP !!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.12.2010 PUBLIC SECTOR STAFF - what is this, is it true ? I'M THINKING BUT I'M NOT CLEAR ?! The public sector is financed from the budget, which in turn is ""filled"" by the economy. This same economy has gone through so many crises over the last DECADES and more, but has survived them all.

Where to take ? This time there is no solidarity !???!!!

If any of the civil service workers do not like this and that job, they should resign and come to the economy. Here the working conditions will be different, the salaries the same, no promotions according to seniority.... and there are benefits that do not exist in the economy as in the SOEs. Besides, this government should ""audit"" the entire administration, identify MORE employees and send them to the employment service, as in the economy, and money is saved immediately in the budget, as the benefits from the service are much smaller.

649,"Deputies disunited on the bill on the construction of a hydroelectric power plant on the middle Sava <p/> K.E. <p/> The deputy groups did not have united positions in today's first reading of the bill on the method of construction of infrastructure and the conditions of the concession for the exploitation of the energy potential of the middle Sava River, tabled by Ivan Hršak from the DeSUS. In addition to DeSUS, SDS and NSi expressed their support for the bill. <p/> According to Tomaž Lisec of SDS, such a law is a necessary condition if Slovenia wants to talk seriously about energy self-sufficiency and renewable energy sources. The SDS would like to see the law adopted in the current mandate, as the non-operation of hydroelectric power plants is a loss for the budget. <p/> A different view is held in the Left Party, where, according to Violeta Tomić, they agree that the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable sources is not possible without the construction of large hydroelectric power plants. However, they are convinced that the construction on the middle Sava River has not yet taken place solely because the concession contract has not yet been concluded. <p/> The DZ will vote today on whether the proposal is suitable for further consideration.",News/Reporting,train

651,"WHICH MALE OF THE ZODIAC IS THE HARDEST TO GET OVER? <p/> Which zodiac sign is the man born in who is the hardest to get over, depending on the astro sign you were born in? <p/> Even though they're over and you want to treat him like all exes, somehow you can't forget about him. Just one thought of his smile, his joking remarks, the way he pronounced your name is enough to keep you from getting over him completely. Wondering what sign the man you may never get over is born in, depending on the zodiac sign you were born in? <p/> LIBRA GETS OVER LIBRA THE HARDEST <p/> A romantic man born in Libra is your opposite, so strong that you're incredibly attracted to him even if you've ended the relationship. You can relive your great chemistry for years to come and no other man is as attentive as a Libra when it comes to intimate relationships. His graceful Venusian energy will long remain in the memory of the sheep, triggering the warmth that the sheep, although acting all-powerful and stable, constantly craves. <p/> Taurus is the hardest Sagittarius to forget <p/> Astrologically speaking, when Taurus and Sagittarius come together they create an element of tension, but this is precisely the reason why Taurus will not forget the spontaneous, resourceful and kind Sagittarius for a long time to come. Although they are not fundamentally compatible, a Taurus is never bored around a Sagittarius. She can relinquish control around him, which is not easy for her. When she tries to get over him, there's a problem, because she finds that she misses his messiness. <p/> Gemini is the hardest to beat in Capricorn <p/> At first glance, Gemini and Capricorn have nothing in common, but when you look a little deeper, you realise that for the distracted and irresponsible Gemini, the persistent and consistent Capricorn is the perfect match, especially if she wants to put certain areas of her life in order. When they break up, the twin perceives it all as a deep hurt, knowing that no other man will motivate her so self-sacrificingly and persistently to be consistent in her struggles and thus more successful and content. <p/> CANCER HURTS FASTEST OF FISH <p/> Cancer is one of the most sentimental zodiac signs, and after it we rank Pisces. Both signs focus on relationships and together they move into deep emotional perceptions that others may not be able to perceive. When a relationship with a Pisces man ends, it can leave a big hole in her life, as she can't connect with any other man as deeply as she can with a Pisces. <p/> LEVINS HAVE THE HARDEST TIME GETTING OVER AQUARIUS <p/> Leo has the hardest time getting over the free-spirited and resourceful Aquarius. He is her cosmic doppelganger who teaches her how to act independently and how to appreciate all values, especially friendship. Aquarius energy has a strong influence on Leo, complementing and encouraging her in everyday things. When she thinks of him, she misses his wit most of all, which must have made her laugh and smile many times. <p/> VIRGO HARDEST TO WAKE UP TWIN <p/> Virgo and Gemini tend to get on well at first because of their mutual love of intellectual pursuits. Because they stimulate each other mentally and can talk for hours about anything, it is the twin who the Virgo misses the most when she ends the relationship with him, or finds it hard to get over. When he is no longer with her, she starts to miss his sarcastic teasing and incredible curiosity. <p/> LIBRA HARDEST TO GET OVER Taurus <p/> Libra is strongly linked to Taurus because of their shared ruling planet Venus. When the relationship ends, Libra misses Taurus, who has always been stable and determined, and she also misses his stubbornness. Libra will find it hard to get over Taurus, especially those beautiful romantic moments together that were like the most beautiful fairy tale. When Libra is completely free, she often misses the bull's control. <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over, both are ruled by Mars, which means they are incredibly passionate. Scorpio will miss Aries, even though there have been various clashes between them all along. Without Aries, she may be bored. Scorpio will find it hard to find the kind of intense dynamic that she has with Aries with other signs. She misses Aries most when she goes to bed at night. <p/> Sagittarius is the hardest to impress for a Leo <p/> Sagittarius and Leo are enthusiastic, spontaneous and have a desire to live life to the full. Both are independent and always understand the other's need for space. When a Sagittarius ends a relationship with a Leo, what she misses most is his ease and incredible understanding of her way of life. Although Sagittarians find themselves quickly in a new relationship, it will take them longer to get over the Leo, if they ever do get over him completely. <p/> CAPRICORN GETS OVER CANCER THE HARDEST <p/> Capricorn is very serious and needs someone to get her riled up. Cancer is the one who constantly gives her a youthful, innocent and gentle energy that definitely brings out the feminine part of Capricorn. Capricorn misses Cancer the most because it has taught her many things, including how to give herself completely in a love relationship. Cancer is hard to get over because without it, she finds it difficult to find the right emotional balance. <p/> Aquarius finds it hardest to get over Scorpio <p/> Aquarius and Scorpio have almost nothing in common, which is why Scorpio is a great mystical enigma for Aquarius, even when the relationship ends. She misses him mainly because he is able to look at things and life in an impersonal and logical way, because he is uncomplicated and honest. Aquarius makes Scorpio feel the most beautiful and the best, and she misses his sexy compliments and passion, which is so important to her in a relationship. <p/> FISH HURTS A GIRL the hardest <p/> Pisces brings emotional depth to a relationship, so a man born in Virgo offers them stability. Pisces, although a hopeless romantic, misses Virgo for her meticulous, consistent and honest actions. When a relationship ends, the Pisces is very sad that she will no longer enjoy a loving relationship with a Virgo man who is sincere and filled with affection. Pisces also misses the working zeal and sense of the material that Virgo has.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
652,"Chronic wrist pain <p/> Chronic wrist pain occurs gradually and is not usually the result of an acute injury. The tendons and tendon sheaths are most commonly affected due to repetitive strain. The most common of these are inflammations of the tendons of the wrist, specifically tendonitis of the extensor tendon of the thumb (Mb. DeQuervain), cysts of the tendon sheaths or the joint capsule, and bursitis in the wrist region. <p/> Wrist fractures due to circulatory disturbances, chronic ligament tears, wrist instability and wear lesions also occur. Tumour lesions are also a possible cause of pain. <p/> Recognise the symptoms <p/> The most common symptom is chronic pain, mostly related to movement or strain. When unstable, the pain intensifies with certain movements in the wrist. <p/> Alarm to see an orthopaedic surgeon <p/> When you experience wrist pain that lasts for several weeks, it is time to see an orthopaedic surgeon. <p/> Path to diagnosis <p/> A clinical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon gives an orientation on the nature of the problem or the affected wrist structures. The basic examination is an X-ray of the wrist in different projections. To clarify the exact situation, an ultrasound or MRI scan of the wrist is performed. In case of suspected instability with wrist ligament tear, additional information is obtained by contrast-enhanced MRI. <p/> Treatment methods <p/> In the case of an inflammatory cause of wrist pain, immobilisation is recommended for a short period. Physical therapy initially includes anti-inflammatory irradiation with high energy laser (HIL), and super magnetotherapy (SIS). This is followed by individual exercises to stretch and flex the tendons. <p/> Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is also an option for early degenerative processes. <p/> In cases of instability, wrist bone failure due to circulatory disorders or other more complex conditions following injury, more complex surgical interventions may be considered.",Information/Explanation,train

664,"Smoking poses one of the biggest risks to our bodies <p/> 3 June 2019 <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems. <p/> ""Smoking damages the skin and mucous membranes. Smokers age their skin more quickly, their skin sags more quickly, and they lose collagen elasticity. This also causes more people to snore and suffer from other serious health problems,"" said Aleksandra Križaj Dumić, Director of the Križaj Dental and Aesthetic Clinic, which has a tradition of more than 20 years, at a press meeting ahead of World No Smoking Day. <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems - high blood pressure, insufficient oxygen intake, poor blood circulation and brain activity. Airway obstructions can be so severe that people can stop breathing several times a night for a few minutes at a time. For this reason, snoring should be treated seriously and resolved immediately. ""Snoring can also be eliminated with laser therapy. The advantages of this treatment are numerous, but what patients like most is that they have no problems after the laser treatment, they can eat, drink and speak normally, and they can return to work immediately without any problems, as the treatment does not require post-operative recovery,"" outlined Aleksandra Križaj Dumić. Laser surgery is an effective and quick solution if the cause of snoring is a sagging or loose mucous membrane in the soft palate. The NightLase laser therapy includes three visits at the beginning and one annual refresher treatment for non-smokers and two for smokers. Patients breathe easier and snore less at night after the treatment. Laser treatment helps about 80 per cent of carefully selected patients and about 70 per cent of all patients examined. In most patients, snoring time is almost halved. Sleep quality improves as patients take less time to fall asleep and no longer wake up tired. <p/> Before and after laser snoring therapy <p/> A similar procedure is also performed to treat incontinence in gynaecological patients, to increase the tension of the vaginal muscles, to increase the tension of sagging skin on the face and neck, and of the skin in the area of the under-eye area. <p/> Demonstration of laser goat rejuvenation <p/> Smoking therefore also affects the skin.

668,"Strong outburst in the sun ! <p/> The activity of the Sun is of growing importance to humanity as we are increasingly dependent on global connections, the vast majority of which are via satellites. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by a magnetic field. <p/> However, in the event of a major flare, some particles will slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere, which can affect surface infrastructure during so-called geomagnetic storms. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by its magnetic field. However, in stronger eruptions, some particles slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere. What is the risk of this happening ? <p/> (Dr Primož Kajdič -)These outbursts, and if the conditions are right, then some of these particles may indeed enter the Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere, especially near the north and south magnetic poles. Then these particles, because they have very high energy, cause radiation and we then see this as the aurora borealis. The second thing that happens is that the Earth's magnetic field changes dramatically and this is then called a geomagnetic storm. But in general, changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to external solar winds and other phenomena, what we call space weather, are also felt on Earth. They can cause damage to our electrical wiring, our satellites can also burn up, stop working, astronauts' lives could be in danger, and so on. Such phenomena have occurred in the past. Then, with every solar cycle, we move more and more into space, more and more dependent on the technology that is in space. In the future, it will be very important to study these phenomena on the Sun and in the solar wind, because we will be more and more sensitive to them. We will need to find out how we can protect ourselves against them in order to minimise the damage. <p/> One more thing about the Sun itself. <p/> The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. The rest of the mass is mostly found in Jupiter, with only a small fraction shared by all the other celestial bodies in the Solar System. The Sun is a perfectly average G2 star. In size, it is one of the 10% largest stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is made up of around 100 billion stars. The average size of stars in the Milky Way is less than 50% of the size of the Sun. <p/> The present Sun is made up of 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and the rest is all other chemical elements. The Sun is slowly converting hydrogen into helium. This releases various waves which are detected on Earth as heat, light and various radiations. The Sun rotates on its axis. But because it is a big gaseous ball, its parts rotate at different speeds. It makes one revolution every 25.4 days at the equator and one every 36 days at the poles. It has a core in the centre that is 25% of its total diameter. The core rotates uniformly and behaves like a solid body. The surface of the core is under hellish conditions. The core has a surface temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin and a pressure of 250 billion atmospheres. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei produces a huge energy of 386 billion billion kilowatts every second. Thus, every second, 700 million tonnes of hydrogen are transformed into 695 million tonnes of helium. 5 million tonnes per second are gamma rays penetrating through the solar mantle to the photosphere. The photosphere is the surface of the Sun that we can see. As it travels through the sun's mantle, the strength of the radiation is reduced as it returns to the core. Some of the radiation just reaches the edge of the photosphere and flies off the Sun as visible light and thermal radiation. The temperature of the photosphere is 5800 degrees Kelvin. Sometimes we see darker sunspots on the surface, these have a temperature of 3800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots are formed by the influence of the Sun's magnetic field. However, the way they are formed has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Above the photosphere, there is a thin chromosphere. Above this is the extremely thin corona. This extends millions of kilometres into space. It is visible at solar eclipse as a brilliant ring. The temperatures of the gases in it can reach up to a million degrees Kelvin. <p/> The Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and extends far beyond Pluto. At the edge of this field is thought to lie the Oort Cloud of icy celestial bodies, the outermost edge of our Solar System. As well as heat and light, the Sun also emits a faint stream of electrified particles. These are mainly electrons and protons. These are called the solar wind. The Sun radiates them at a steady 450 km/second. Only when there are large outbursts, visible as giant flares or protuberances, does the intensity of the solar wind increase. Sunspots and prominences occur on a fairly regular 11-year cycle. But the solar wind affects the paths of artificial satellites, pushing them further and further off course. It pushes lighter particles out of icy celestial bodies, comets, and forms their tails. In larger outbursts, solar wind particles also hit the Earth's magnetic field. This brings it closer to the surface and the solar wind particles hit particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This creates the coloured aurora borealis, or northern lights. The particles are also dangerous to humans and astronauts must wear protective clothing. In the event of a major outbreak, they must take refuge in specially protected areas of the space station. It would be possible to build a spaceship with a sail that uses the steady pressure of the solar wind for propulsion. <p/> The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, the same age as our Solar System. Since its formation, it has consumed about 50% of the hydrogen. So they predict it will shine as brightly as ever for another 5 billion years. At the end of its lifetime, it will have expanded by half its present size. When it has used up all its hydrogen, it will radically change and swallow all its planets into itself.",Information/Explanation,train
669,"Organise your life <p/> Spring is a time of awakening, renewal and regeneration, of cleaning up old sins and starting new ones. Make new beginnings also in the organisation of your life. <p/> Stress at work, family commitments, the general fast pace of life are not only tiring but can cause anxiety and general restlessness. Sometimes we feel that we will not be able to do even one of them because of the pile of commitments, our minds wandering from one to the other, unable to concentrate at all and thinking about which is more important. <p/> As spring slowly arrives, it is a good time to rethink life's priorities and try to organise our lives better. <p/> One of the world's most renowned systems of organisation and productivity improvement or time management was defined by David Allen in his book Getting Things Done. In the following sections, we guide you through the basics of organisation that will help you to systematise your life's habits and commitments so that you start to enjoy them. <p/> 1. Gather your thoughts <p/> First, it is important to find the best ways to gather all the information and thoughts that otherwise run through your head during the day. You know: smart people write! Don't try to remember all the information, schedules or ideas that pop into your head. Instead, carry a notebook with you at all times, wherever you go, and write down everything that comes to mind. <p/> Process the information. After you have collected your thoughts in your own way, process them. Start at the beginning - identify what is most important and what is what you don't need. Make decisions quickly and don't delay. Be ruthless and get rid of all the ballast, both in terms of stuff and information. Only delay tasks if you know they require more than two minutes of your time. In this case, put each task on a list, archive it, but get on with it as soon as time permits. Plan <p/> 2. Plan <p/> At the beginning of each week, on Monday morning or even on Sunday evening, decide on one to three most important goals and put them in your weekly schedule. These should be major tasks that - when completed - will make you feel proud. Similarly, divide each day into smaller tasks. From a psychological point of view, it is best to do the most important tasks in the morning, as this will take most of the burden off your shoulders when the day is just getting off to a good start. Make your scheduling system as easy to use and understand as possible - there is no need to waste time familiarising yourself with Outlook or other software on your computer. <p/> 3. Focus <p/> We all know that it is difficult to do every task with complete focus and without interruptions. But this is one of the most basic habits you need to learn, as it ensures good time management. Exclude all possible distractions: e-mail, mobile phones and, if necessary, the Internet. <p/> This way of working may not be so easy if you have a distaste for a particular task. In this case, first consider the positive aspects of the task. For example, it may lead to a new project, a promotion to a better job, or you may just learn something new and interesting. Then break the task into mini-tasks, each of which will take you no more than five minutes. Once you've done the first one, we guarantee the others will flow like clockwork. Reward yourself by completing the first three or four mini-tasks - for example, by reading an email or web portal for five minutes. Then get on with the job. <p/> 4. Organise your work and living space <p/> The perception of being stifled by commitments can also be influenced by the messiness of the environment in which we live and work. Spring is a good time to start reorganising our living and working environment and putting all the things that surround us on a daily basis in their place. First, define a system to store similar things together (e.g. bills, documents). Even if some of us work well in functional clutter, it is systematised for the individual, we just have to find a (dis)order that suits us. Then follow the system, give each item a proper place and start keeping all the related items in a real-time storage. <p/> 5. Review <p/> Regularly review both the newly established storage system and your progress in terms of meeting your objectives. Review your notes and draw a line at the end of the week to assess how well you have done in meeting your commitments. This is important to reaffirm success to yourself or to learn from your mistakes in the future. After the review, set yourself tasks and goals for the coming week based on your past shortcomings and the things you failed to tick off the list. Focus on the most important ones or simplify the ones that are not the most urgent. <p/> 6. Find your passion <p/> Do those things that you really enjoy, that - even if they are professional in nature - you enjoy and that you feel you could enjoy for the rest of your life. The fact that finding the perfect job is difficult is an understatement. But it is worth finding, and we recommend that you never give up the search. Think how easy it would be to do the tasks listed above if they were related to an activity or topic that you are passionate about! If you can't turn your passion into a job, make sure you do something about it, at least in your spare time, because that's how you can regain some confidence or motivation. <p/> Finally, it is important to create your own comfortable routine. Routines are considered by many to be boring and can kill the spirit. To a certain extent this is true, but in times when you are overwhelmed it can make your daily efforts and life in general much easier. It is therefore advisable to develop routines in the area of work habits and patterns - if you make it a part of your blood to collect your thoughts, set goals and plan how to achieve them on a weekly and daily basis, your life will be much easier. <p/> We wish you to enter this spring with focus and determination. <p/> Article by Elvira Leka, translated and edited by Katarina Cvikl.",Instruction,train

674,"Trampling on the Constitution instead of taking responsibility <p/> The Information Commissioner has caught the police illegally obtaining data on the readers of online portals. Instead of taking responsibility, the ministry wants to legalise the actions of the police. Even though they are against the Constitution. <p/> If someone is warned that his actions are breaking the law, if he is reasonable, he will stop those actions. The police and the Ministry of the Interior see things slightly differently - instead of stopping illegal activities, they would legalise them. Even if this legalisation is contrary to the Constitution. <p/> But let us take it in turn. In January this year, we published a report by the Information Commissioner on the podcrto.si website, which found repeated illegal behaviour by the police in obtaining data from web portal operators. In the vast majority of cases, the police have requested information on the identity of readers and commenters on online portals from portal operators without a court order. However, the Act on Electronic Commerce on the Market stipulates that the police can only obtain such information with a court order. However, according to the Information Commissioner's findings, in 2012 the police obtained information on readers only four times with a court order. In the remaining 31 cases, it requested it bypassing the courts. <p/> Much of the media did not pay attention to these findings. This is understandable - in 23 cases, the media operating online portals provided the police with the identity of their readers, even though they did not have a court order to do so. In this way, they themselves were complicit in breaking the law. <p/> What is more surprising is the reaction of the police and the Ministry of the Interior, which is the superior authority of the police. Instead of holding the police accountable and punishing the guilty for repeatedly breaking the law, they have responded to the Information Commissioner's findings by creatively interpreting the law, which may, after all, allow them to obtain information bypassing the courts. This is how they brought to light Article 149b of the Criminal Procedure Act. The third paragraph of this article gives the police the possibility to request from operators, only at their written request, information on the owner or user of a particular means of electronic communications traffic which is not published in the subscriber directories. The intention behind the legal latitude is simple: the legislator wanted to make the police's job easier in cases where the police have the telephone number of a suspect but cannot find out his name because the number is not in the telephone directory. However, the police and the Ministry of the Interior have interpreted the provision creatively: operators of online portals could also be considered operators, and therefore they are obliged to provide data even without a court order. <p/> This lifeline of the police was eventually broken by the latter, after a series of correspondence between the Ministries of Justice, Economy and Higher Education, Science and Technology to establish the definition of an operator. It said that the Electronic Communications Act defines an operator as someone who manages a communications network. This, of course, is not what the web portals do. The MoI has now run out of excuses, and so at the end of February it admitted to the Information Commissioner that in almost all cases of data extraction the police had acted illegally. <p/> But the story does not end here. The MoI has decided to legalise the illegal activities of the police. By amending the Criminal Procedure Act (ZKP). The proposed amendment to the CCP, which is currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination, would thus include service providers in the aforementioned Article 149b(3). According to the interpretation of the MoI, this would also require operators of web portals to provide information to the police only upon written request. This would make the hitherto unlawful practice legal. <p/> But there is one problem with this argument - the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. As the Information Commissioner points out, Article 37 of the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of letters and other communications, and only the law may prescribe that, on the basis of a court decision, the protection of the secrecy of letters and other communications and the inviolability of human privacy may be waived for a certain period of time if this is necessary for the initiation or conduct of a criminal proceeding or for the security of the state. Furthermore, in its 1997 decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is not only the content of the communication, i.e. the content of a letter, that is guaranteed, but also the circumstances of the communication, i.e. who communicated with whom and when. Thus, information about who accessed or commented on an internet portal is also constitutionally protected communication data. The police can therefore only obtain it by court order, no matter what law they write. This is because the Constitution, as the supreme law, is above the law. And given the experience of the Yugoslav secret services, it is understandable why the Constitution is so strict about obtaining communications data. <p/> The intentions of the police or the Ministry of the Interior in amending the Criminal Procedure Act are therefore worrying. Not so much from the point of view of the authorities' desire to make it easier to obtain data on the readers of online portals, but because of the intention to blatantly flout constitutional provisions. The latter are the cornerstone of the rule of law, and trampling on them puts us as a society in great danger. <p/> Therefore, if law enforcement authorities wish to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, they should pursue this desire through legal channels. By proposing an amendment to the Constitution. This route is, of course, infinitely more difficult than amending the law - it requires the consent of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. But it is the only permissible one. And it is the only one that would trigger a proper public debate on the proposed amendments. <p/> If the proposed amendment to the CPC were nevertheless adopted, and the police then started to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, in violation of constitutional provisions, we would face another problem. Evidence obtained in this way will not be taken into account by the courts, as it will have been obtained illegally. For example, the actors in the Balkan Warrior case were acquitted because of illegally obtained evidence. In court, the police were unable to explain how they obtained the telephone numbers of the defendants, who were then wiretapped. The numbers were not made public.

675,"When is it time to renovate the roof? <p/> The roof is a key structural element that protects the building from the elements (rain, snow, hail, sun, wind). The quality of the roof has a direct impact on the durability of the building and the living conditions inside, which is particularly important for living in a loft. <Once it no longer meets these requirements, it is time to renovate. But every leak does not mean that the whole roof has to be replaced. What to do if the roof starts leaking? <p/> Reasons to renovate your roof <p/> Making repairs due to inadequate construction or renovation work <p/> Major roof damage due to natural disasters (windstorms, hail, etc.) <p/> Rehabilitation or reconstruction <p/> We can only repair part of the roof covering. However, if the roof is worn out or requires work such as modification of the roof structure to make extensions (to gain additional roof space) or to change the appearance of the roof for aesthetic reasons, reconstruction makes the most sense. <p/> How much will a roof renovation cost <p/> The price of a roof renovation depends primarily on the type of roofing material and its price. Prices for roofing material without installation start at: <p/> €7/m2 for concrete and bitumen roofing, <p/> €8/m2 for brick roofing, <p/> €10/m2 for metal roofing <p/> Installation costs €15-20/m2. If the roofing has to be replaced in its entirety, in addition to the price for the roofing and the installation, we have to take into account the additional works that affect the price of replacing the roofing: dismantling, removal to a landfill, the condition of the wooden structure, the other roof elements (flashings, gutters, vents, etc.). <p/> Example of a roof replacement price calculation <p/> For a 150m2 gable roof replacement (brick tiles), we will charge approximately €30/m2 for materials and installation, i.e. a total of €4500/m2. <p/> If the replacement also includes the installation of a vapour barrier, dismantling and removal of the old roofing material, this means an additional cost of at least €1000. <p/> Don't forget about the building permit <p/> Replacing the roof and roofing is maintenance work and therefore does not require a building permit, as long as it is a structural renovation that does not change the size and shape of the building.

684,"From now on, partnership farming also in Styria <p/> First distribution of organic produce baskets between farmers and consumers on Thursday, 12 May 2011 <p/> From tomorrow, consumers in Maribor will also be able to access organically produced food through the partnership farming system in the form of vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets. The first distribution of vegetable and cereal baskets will start on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at 17:00 in the courtyard of the Biotikva farm in Limbuš near Maribor (Lackova cesta 267, 2341 Limbuš). At the end of May, the participating farmers will further expand their offer of vegetable baskets and will also offer fruit baskets to consumers. <p/> The ECHo association, which initiated and organises this project in Styria and Prekmurje, is pleased with the current response. 7 organic farms have joined the partnership and will provide consumers with weekly vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets, as well as other products from organic production and processing: spreads, juices, jams, bread, eggs, meat and dairy products. 34 consumers have chosen to buy organic food in the context of partner farming. This is the first attempt of this kind of sales between organic farmers and consumers without intermediaries in this part of Slovenia. With this project, the association wants to promote the development of organic farming among farmers and to support organic farmers. <p/> What is partnership farming? <p/> Partnership farming is a new way of linking farmers and consumers in Slovenia. Different models (CSA - Community Supported Agriculture) have proliferated around the world, but they have a common denominator: they promote local, sustainable and ethical consumerism, with a special emphasis on solidarity among small farmers who farm without synthetic fertilisers and sprays. Typically, it is one farmer or a group of farmers who sell their produce to 20 to 30 customers. Before the sowing season, the farmer talks to the consumers about their wishes, clear rules are agreed, then the farmer sows the area and supplies the crops according to organic production technology and regulations. The produce grown on the agreed area is distributed weekly to the consumers. <p/> Once consumers have opted in, they meet the farmer and other consumers each week at an agreed date, time and location to collect their basket. They can also exchange produce and products with each other. In this way, the farmer supplies his consumers every week throughout the year with organic food that is truly fresh and has a very short transport route from the field to the plate. This way, the consumer knows exactly who grows their food, where and how. Consumers receive high quality organic food and the farmer is able to live with dignity as a result of this cooperation.",News/Reporting,train

The remainder of the appeal is dismissed and the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance is upheld in part and unchanged. <The parties are ordered to bear their own costs of the appeal. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the applicant seeking an order that the defendant account to her for the gross amount of EUR 3 505,04 in respect of the underpayment of the salary allowance, pay the prescribed taxes and contributions and then pay to her the net sums, together with statutory default interest on the net sums on the gross basis, as set out in paragraph I/1 of the operative part of the judgment. Dismisses the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings (paragraph I/2 of the operative part of the judgment) and orders the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings in the sum of EUR 729,96 to the defendant within 15 days (paragraph II of the operative part of the judgment). <p/> The applicant timely appeals against the judgment on all grounds of appeal under Article 338(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Gazette of the RS, No 26/99 et seq.) and requests the Court of Appeal to uphold its appeal and to alter the judgment under appeal by granting the application in full and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment is based, according to the applicant, on an incorrect and incomplete finding of fact and on an error of substantive law. In the light of the clear statutory provisions, the applicant should have been paid 100 % of the allowance for the time spent waiting for homeworking. The defendant issued the applicant with an order to wait for work at home because it did not have suitable work for her. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 or the defendant's decision of 25 May 2001, she cannot, in her view, be denied the right to the difference since, during the period at issue, that is to say, from April 2005 to July 2007, the compensation for the time spent waiting for work was governed by the Labour Relations Act (LSA, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 42/2002 et seq.). The decision of 31.1.2003 of the ZPIZ did not, by anything in the operative part of the decision, decide that the compensation was 80 %, but only that it was compensation for the time spent waiting for work from 7.7.2001 onwards in the amount of SIT 71 011,61. The 80 % allowance was decided by the defendant by decision of 25.5.2001, against which decision the applicant had no grounds for appeal, since ZDR-02 was not yet in force and, moreover, that decision was not based on the provisions of the Social Insurance Act or the Social Insurance Act, but on Article 34 of the sectoral collective agreement. <p/> The appeal also challenges the decision on costs. The Court of First Instance held five main hearings, at which it took evidence and heard both parties on two occasions, and it was only after that that it decided that the claim was unfounded and could therefore have ordered that each party should bear its own costs. However, if the applicant had to pay any costs to the defendant, the Court of First Instance could have awarded the defendant only one award for the proceedings under No 3012, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance had reopened the main hearing, and the appellant therefore proposes that the Court of Appeal should make a decision as to the costs of the proceedings in such a way that each party should bear its own costs or that the costs awarded to the defendant should be reduced. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant contested the grounds of appeal as unfounded and requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal and to order the applicant to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal. <p/> The appeal is partly well founded. <p/> The Court of Appeal examined the judgment under appeal within the limits of the grounds of appeal raised, taking into account, on its own motion, the substantive breaches of the provisions of Article 350(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No 26/99 et seq.) 1.points 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11, with the exception of the existence and correctness of the authorisation to proceed before the court of first instance, and points 12 and 14 of the second paragraph of Article 339 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the correct application of substantive law. In that examination, the Court of First Instance found that the Court of First Instance had not committed any of the substantive infringements of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure which the Court of Appeal is required to take into account of its own motion. It also correctly applied the substantive law to the facts correctly and fully established and only the decision on costs was partially erroneous, as will be explained below. <p/> The Court of Appeal fully agrees with the legal and factual grounds of the contested judgment of the Court of First Instance (with the exception of the decision on costs), and therefore does not repeat them and, as regards the grounds of appeal which are of decisive importance pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 360(1) of the ECHR, the Court of First Instance does not rely on them in the present case. <p/> The Court of First Instance correctly found that the applicant was entitled, in view of her ability to work, to a wage allowance for the period of waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-1, Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, No. 1, item 360, as amended). No ... of 4 October 2000, in conjunction with the decision of the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A. No ... of 27 March 2001, she was classified in category III of disability due to the effects of the disease and with the right to assignment or employment in other suitable work of a physically lighter nature from 29 September 2000 onwards. The applicant was awarded compensation by decision of the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A., No ... of 31 January 2003, which provided that the employer was to pay the applicant's salary compensation at its own expense. The Employment Relations Act (ZDR, Official Gazette of the RS, No 42/2002) had indeed entered into force before that decision was issued, but the essential point is that the applicant had already acquired the right before that date, and that decision therefore conferred on her the right to wage compensation for the period of her waiting for assignment to another suitable job as from 7.7.2001, on the basis of the provisions of the ZPIZ-1 and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos 12/92 to 54/98). Pursuant to Article 397 of the ZPIZ-1, beneficiaries of rights on the basis of residual capacity for work established under the regulations applicable until the date laid down in Article 446 of this Law, which is 1 January 2003, shall retain those rights after that date, with the proviso that the cash benefits shall be adjusted as pensions are adjusted. The applicant has always been a category III invalid, but it was only by decision of 26.10.2009 that she was classified as a category I invalid as a result of illness from 9.4.2009 and was granted the right to an invalidity pension from 1.5.2009. The appellant's claims that the Court of First Instance failed to establish the facts in full and erred in the application of the substantive law are therefore unfounded. <p/> The Court of Appeal adds that even an appeal by the applicant against the decision of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 would not alter the fact that the applicant has acquired the right to a benefit under the rules on pension and invalidity insurance and is therefore not entitled to a benefit under the ZDR. The appellant's submissions that the amount of the applicant's allowance was fixed by the defendant by decision of 25 May 2001 are also unfounded, since the amount of the allowance was fixed by a decision of the ZPIZ of 31 January 2003 in the amount of SIT 71 011,61 per month. In accordance with Article 137 of the ZPIZ, in conjunction with Article 48 of the ZPIZ-1, the minimum pension base was taken as the basis on which the salary allowance for the period of waiting for employment or assignment to other suitable work was calculated, at a rate of 80 %, and the allowance thus calculated was adjusted in the same way as the pensions and amounted to SIT 71 011,61 as from 7.7.2001. <p/> On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of First Instance correctly rejected the applicant's claim for payment of the difference between the amount of compensation received for the period of waiting for work, which was 80 % of the basic amount, and 100 % of the amount of compensation under Article 137 of the Labour Code. <p/> The appellant, however, submits that the Court of First Instance erred in its assessment of the defendant's necessary legal costs, which the appellant is liable to reimburse. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance reopened the main hearing, the defendant is entitled, pursuant to Tariff No 3012 of the Law on the Tariff of Lawyers (Law on the Tariff of Lawyers, Official Gazette of the RS 67/2008), to only one hearing fee, and the Court of Appeal therefore reduced the amount of the costs awarded to EUR 513,00, namely one hearing fee of EUR 190,80 and VAT of 20 % on that amount. However, the Court of First Instance had no basis for deciding, as the appeal suggests, that each party should bear its own costs, since the applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings. <p/> In the light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal in part in so far as it related to the decision on the costs of the appeal and reduced the amount awarded to EUR 513,00 (Article 351(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 358(5) of the Civil Procedure Code), dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance in the remaining part (Article 353 of the Civil Procedure Code), without any change in that amount. <p/> The applicant was only partially successful in its appeal and the Court of Appeal therefore decided, pursuant to Article 154(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the same Act, that it should bear its own costs of the appeal. The defendant is ordered to bear its own costs of the response to the appeal, since it did not contribute substantially to the decision (Article 155(1) in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the CPC).",Legal/Regulation,train

700,"""Programmed Ambiance"" shows the relationship between cardboard, ambiance and numerical programming. The numerical structure is the basis of the whole art installation, on its basis the artwork produces itself. The programmed ambience consisted of 2184 drawings on cards, which were embedded in 156 hanging mobiles, the floor was covered by a carpet about 40 m long on which the numerical programme of one of the hanging card series was printed, and a horizontal grid structure that was attached just above the ceiling. The gallery hall was thus divided into three levels. The overall ambience was based on permutations of full and empty space, defined by a grid construction with 286 points - knots that measured out space to vertical mobiles. The numerical program that determined the position of the mobiles was selected on the basis of all possible 11-digit combinations of the characters 0 and 1, with the condition that they are in the ratio 5:6 and that the rows so selected follow each other in the original order, starting with the most uniform combination (1010101010101) until the given space is filled. Odd rows of the programme are read from left to right, even rows vice versa.

Extended individual and team treatment focuses on the child and the whole family. <p/> As of 1 January 2019, a new Act on Integrated Early Treatment of Children with Special Needs came into force. This has transformed the former development clinics into Early Treatment Centres for Children with Special Needs by strengthening the teams with an increase in the number of medical staff and other professionals. The development clinic with an Early Treatment Centre at the Soboga Hospital will provide extended individual and team treatment by a specialist paediatrician, physiotherapist, registered and paramedical nurse, health administrator, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, social worker, special educator, psychologist and other specialists as needed.

The bullet has a harder core and consequently there is less copper coating, Los abandoned this some time ago and has the opposite...Tolerances, weight within normal limits, but on every bullet in the box, there is a matrix imprint at the transition of the radius to the tip, this is yet to be corrected, Los had the same problem and now it is solved, because such a bullet can not go abroad................................................................................. Nothing special in shooting, loading, of course for something more I would use rest, but for ipsc not even...as a type of bullet RN clean ok product. Price of bullets...wins the Moose, bold <p/> And this is the thorough test for you that you were raving about a page back? Ma dej... A 25,000 shus/year man is expected to have a concrete test, not to wash you. <p/> Mozakar has no time or else he won't reach the 25,000 norm this year <p/> Otherwise, a month and a half ago I found about 45 rounds of 147 grain in a package of 124 grain LOS 9mm kugels, FP. So even the LOS big-bore will probably have to learn, if nothing else, how to pack kugels. Price for mortals through official channels-> I don't know if LOS wins. 32€ vs 34€, at Rebec. <p/> Yeah well it says if you read it...conclusions at a glance I don't know what you expect, the point is said I have no intention of bothering with this really...why don't you give it a try yourself <p/> Great no...you'll have to learn a lot too, until then buy Arma bullets.... <p/> No I didn't buy them, if you're interested. I've bought quite a lot of LOS already, and I'm not going to stop because of this mistake. It just happens. You don't have to be a smartass like you to praise one, you probably get a ton of it for free. And especially in the Armaforce thread, when someone asked about those bullets, not the LOS. I get on LOS' nerves sometimes just because of your stupid crap. <p/> Just a quick comparison of one and the other was made, I gave my findings, but if you take that as bragging I can't help you, a hundred people are a hundred wonders <p/> Yeah well, it says here, if you read....you're the one bitching about a thorough test not me.So don't throw your fake tests at me. <p/> But you're not happy with the whole world, come on, be a little positive sometime, what is it man, what do you want to prove... I gave my findings, wrote that I had no intention of dealing with it and suggested that you find out for yourself if it's in your interest... my answer was not to your liking, you gave me a minus, you got it back... here's the way it goes in the new year <p/> The Master made the only sensible comment. The others are well below the level. I thought this was typical of jagras. But I see you are cutting us down. Armaforce made a big mistake by posting the LOS pictures. These are just marketing ploys of modern entrepreneurs. Any publicity is good, even if it is negative. It is naive to think that this was a mistake. If they know how to package the bullets (excellent packaging) then they should know how to present them to the shooters. This work was then done free of charge by Tine. You are asking for a detailed test from Apple. Why would the competition test their bullets at all? You are the top experts here on the pile. And yet you dispute Apple's brief quick findings. I am happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers my questions. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you? <p/> Ah, I told you why ipsc is considered the king of marksmanship...because of the strict adherence to the rules and the immediate DQ at the slightest violation of them...the marksmanship of the individual has nothing to do with it, the shooters who take part in these competitions are all kings, as you rightly pointed out, thank you thank you...they know how to handle their weapons according to the accepted rules, because there is no other way to do it. I know that for someone who hasn't been to these competitions it's completely alien, how else to understand posting an unacceptable video where you have your finger on the trigger when loading and unloading the gun.... Ps the video is under...[adjustable sights for rexs] but it would be better if it wasn't... if you're still wondering what you're hoping for the kings will explain :))) <p/> Apple if you look very well the finger is not on the trigger.. So I don't see anything controversial..look well the finger was not on the trigger But I told you that you are the only ""king"" who is bullshitting about IPSC being oh and all.. If you were shooting a precision shooter this discipline would be the King of Shooting... As for Los...I see that whoever comes to the market with bullets you spit on them and bullshit them with nonsense comments....You could behave more appropriately for your age...You better be respectful to others on the market,because if David behaved like that the picture would be quite different...Sometimes you really throw shit on the forum and you mumble something but it would be better to bite your tongue...So think a little if your behaviour is ""royal""...You'll have to think about that...<p/> (18-01-2017, 12:36)alojz1 Posted: I'm happy for any new manufacturer.

Unfortunately he can't stand that others are trying to launch their bullets on the market... When MiHec started making their bullets it was the same...Only Apple was throwing shit around the forum and acting smart about bullets...as if only Los knows how to make bullets and everyone else is a loser...

Everyone has their favourites. The thing with the Jags is that they are always looking for something new, something better. In short, a bullet that always hits without damaging the roast, and the game falls on the spot. And every new one is the best until it happens..... I also have good experience with both other manufacturers here. If anyone asks for an opinion I always praise them. In my opinion they are better than the much vaunted Barnes TTSX. I myself have been using LOS since the beginning. I recently killed an 80kg pig in the thick of it. Drop on the spot. Hit through the heart. Why would I buy an expensive one when this bullet has everything I need. You just have to hit it. But if I'm shooting at paper, it's hard to find a cheaper and more accurate one. And as long as that's the case, this bullet will be in my gun. You guys can keep switching all you want. <p/> I'm not picking on anyone :-P But if folks don't accept my thinking and can't argue back...that's not my problem. Me? prove it? I have nothing to prove. You are already proving yourself...day by day... Yes, you have made the points...but you haven't made the points...that you wrote about...that David and you are going to ""debunk"". In the end, all that comes out of your side is one big....bla....bla....bla....bla... ...blah. <p/>Ma what a clever comment, please. I don't think you can do it. Sessions can't stand anything but his own opinion....some of the sheeple cheerfully follow his lead. He can be a great shot,when he has a gewehr in his hands and has great results, but when he gives answers,he shoots goats....He usually speaks in terms of LOS is the law, or 25,000 shushes/year, IPSC, etc...etc...and that too many times when he has nothing to do with the topic. Let me know, did anyone force him to test? Well, no. Did he force himself to take the test? Well, he did. Someone who is supposed to have a clue about bowling pins, because he works in a bowling pin company, is expected to make a test according to his ""tongue-twister"", not to make a test like one of the yagers in the pub behind the bar would make it. <p/> 18-01-2017, 17:55 (This post was last modified 18-01-2017, 18:02 by alojz1.) <p/> Have you removed the Master's comment?

It won't stick...what you're doing in the video is pure DQ. The rule is that your finger must be visibly away from the trigger, it's not with you. It has to be VISIBLY extended at the bolt...with a hook like that you get an instant DQ on the ipsc...not to mention where the finger is after the gun is cocked...on the TRIGGER it could only be there when you are in the target sight The rest I don't care about...I don't have the ability to read people's minds, so I just don't comment on who's who... as for the Arma bullets, I wrote what I observed and I don't see anything else flying in there... <p/> (18-01-2017, 17:55)alojz1 Wrote: Did you retract the Master's comment?

718,"What is it, apart from the understaffing and the overburdening, which is also or mainly administrative, that has broken the bottom of the primary health care barrel? <p/> The 2019 General Agreement exacerbates an unsustainable situation <p/> The 2019 General Agreement sets a new (increased) ceiling for registrations in family medicine outpatient clinics, which are already bursting at the seams with no systemic solutions. And this is very bad news indeed. <p/> The General Agreement, whereby the health 'partners' each year redefine the financial pie for the provision of health services and programmes, does not really have a partnership character, because the strength of the professional arguments is repeatedly undermined by the arguments of power, which in the end seem to have a single denominator: politics, which has nothing to do with health care. Controversial issues are always decided by the government. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions has proposed an annex to the General Agreement ... <p/> That is why the Association of Health Institutions of Slovenia has proposed the adoption of annex number one to the general agreement for this year. With regard to the overload in family medicine clinics in primary health care, where doctors in some health centres are announcing the termination of their employment contracts because there is no other solution on the horizon, this association has proposed a solution quite comparable to the conclusions recently adopted by the annual conference of the Fides doctors' and dentists' trade union. The proposed annex thus, rather surprisingly, puts doctors, their unions and the management of health care institutions on the same side. <p/> The proposal was made by the Association in accordance with the agreement on the suspension of strike activities signed by the Fides union and the government - and already in force in the general agreement for the 2017 and 2018 contract years. According to this agreement, primary care doctors can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach the national average of the headache ratios for each specialty, while family medicine doctors and paediatricians can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach a headache ratio of 1895. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions drafted the annex in accordance with the agreement on the temporary suspension of strike action. <p/> ... the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal <p/> Doctors may decide to take such a step if the employer has not exhausted all the human resources and organisational possibilities that would allow the definition of insured persons - tenders for new recruitments, proposal of the need for new specialisations, subcontracting of doctors, including retired ones, redirection of insured persons of full age from a paediatrician to a family doctor ... <p/> However, at yesterday's meeting, the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year. We are now in a situation in Slovenian healthcare where there is virtually no room for manoeuvre - for the time being in family medicine, but similar stories are unfolding in other branches of medicine too. And since this serious, complex problem is being pointed out not only by doctors or nurses and their unions, but now even by the management of health care institutions, this is a sign that the existing system is not, and can no longer be, a guarantee for the sustainable, high-quality, professional, comprehensive and safe operation of health care - a sign to which we urgently need to react and take immediate action to remedy the situation that has arisen. <p/> The proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year was rejected by the ZZZS Board. <p/> The association is convinced that the agreement between the government and the Fides trade union, enshrined in the agreement on the suspension of strike activities, should be respected - and that if the timetable for reaching the target norm had to be changed in this sense, the signatories to the agreement would have to resume negotiations and redraft the agreement. So what next - apart from the announced activities of primary care doctors? <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted. One is to continue with the annex procedure, but this kind of search for a solution is time-consuming and could drag on until the autumn. There is also another way. The new Minister for Health will have to deal with these problems as soon as he is appointed - and it is not impossible that the partners who are agreeing on the content of the general agreement will not be able to come up with a coherent, possibly even new, proposal to alleviate the acute situation we are witnessing at the moment. I can assure you that the association will be cooperative, because it wants to contribute to a reasonable solution - but if we find ourselves in a situation where emotions and other motives prevail, it will be difficult to find a solution,"" said Marjan Pintar, Director of the Association of Health Care Institutions, speaking to Health Portal. <p/> And what is your message to the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabedr? <p/> What do you expect from the new Health Minister Ales Šabedr?

When we have enough, we will compile them in a book, which we will hand over to the Minister as a civil initiative for urgent action in the field of health.",Opinionated News,train

Or you can type in a place like Ljubljana and get Ljubljana treasures, etc... If you want to do more, like see what's going on with individual treasures or even enter your own adventures related to the treasure you're looking for, you have to register for free. If you do this, you will get the geographical coordinates of where the treasure is located and a hint of where exactly it should be. You can stand on it, but if the owner of the treasure doesn't give you a hint that it's buried under your feet, you'll be looking for it in vain. You can, however, pay approx. 20?per year, which gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates in the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. If you find the treasure, you enter the date of its discovery in the treasure's notebook. You can take some things out and put in some of your new things, or at least as much as there was before. Each treasure contains a plastic waterproof box, a label with the location and address, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a notebook or notepad. You can also put anything in the box that is not food, not an animal or non-perishable. Crates can be ""micro"" e.g. a 2 or 3 cm plastic box, medium or very large. The crate can also contain a ""tracer"" or a plastic coin. You need to buy both official ones because the tracking numbers are stamped on the tracker and the coins are destructible and only made by certified producers. The tracker is inscribed separately and its job is to travel from treasure to treasure. You must not take it home for permanent safekeeping, but must put it in another treasure or leave it where it is. If you have moved it, you must be sure to write on the portal in which treasure you have placed it. Some people call this a ""stopwatch"". Vendors also offer official boxes, notebooks, pencils, stickers, etc. You don't need these if you don't want them. You can provide all this yourself. You can get free stickers here: http://www.techblazer.com/geocaching-log-sheets/ for micro for others: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=w ... mApU8vtHzw Make sure the sticker is dry! That's all. Instead of boring walks, you can search for treasures. You can use a garmin or other gps, I just use a phone with gps built in. It's worth installing Google Earth and you'll find your treasure even faster. If anyone has any other questions, just take them on the day. <p/> Reply Written by bucar "" Sat May 05, 2012 12:13 am <p/> Commendable, but one has to be careful here: it's nice if a video post about a treasure is aligned with its owner, especially if the location of the box itself is also shown (spoiler).

738,"VARSTOR, JERNEJ ŠTORGELJ, s.p.from Rečice ob Savinji specialises in robotic welding. They also perform welding by other processes such as MIG welding and TIG welding. <p/> WELDING <p/> Welding is the process of joining two materials to form a single unit by means of heat or mechanical kneading. <p/> In welding, the heat source is an electric arc generated by the welding machine. The joining of materials is based on the temperature generated by the electric arc. This welding process is called arc welding. <p/> WELDING PROCEDURES <p/> MIG/MAG welding <p/> MIG/MAG welding involves the generation of an electric arc by means of a welding source. The arc is formed between the welding wire and the weldment. The arc joins the weldment and the filler material to form a weld joint or weld. <p/> During the actual welding process, the feeding device feeds the wire continuously through the torch to the welding site. Shielding gas is also added via the torch. <p/> MIG welding differs from MAG welding in the use of shielding gas. MIG welding uses an inert gas which does not react chemically with the welding consumable. MAG welding, on the other hand, uses an active gas which reacts chemically with the weld metal. <p/> Typically, the shielding gas contains active carbon dioxide or oxygen, which is why MAG welding is more common than MIG welding. <p/> TIG welding <p/> In TIG welding (Tugsten Inert Gas), an electric arc is created between the non-fusible tungsten electrode and the weld metal. An inert gas is used as a shielding gas which does not react with the weld. The most commonly used shielding gas in TIG welding is argon. <p/> In TIG welding, the addition of material is not always necessary. The joint between two weldments can also be made by welding their edges. If material is added, it must be added manually. For this reason, TIG welding sources are built differently from MIG/MAG sources. <p/> The different TIG methods include DC, AC and pulsed TIG welding. <p/> MANUAL WELDING <p/> Welding processes <p/> Welding processes are divided into several phases according to the degree of automation, namely. <p/> Semi-automatic welding - a specific working step is carried out automatically. One such welding method is MIG/MAG welding, where the welding wire is fed through the torch by a feeding device. <p/> In mechanised welding, some manipulative work is also done by machine, with the welder controlling the welding process. <p/> In automatic welding, the welding hardware performs the entire process independently of the preset programme. <p/> Robotic welding represents a very advanced welding mechanisation and automation. In robotic welding, a control system controls the movement of the torch and the manipulation of the welder. The robot can be programmed for different welding applications, so we are talking about the highest possible level of automation of the welding process. <p/> Robotic welding is most commonly used for products where the surfaces to be joined are curved and where several small welds in different directions are required. The reason for the purchase is not necessarily for mass production of products. Modern technologies allow for the increasing production of smaller batches of products.

745,"Well, come to my house for a visit...my child is currently a meat eater, so I'm almost worried, she's not interested in anything else...she eats sausages out of her sandwich, throws vegetables on the floor for the dogs, leaves potatoes and rice on the plate, and she happily munches on sausages and steak. And she has everything her heart desires at her disposal : <p/> +1 She wants no fruit, no pasta, no potatoes, no vegetables, no fruit ... And his mother eats almost only vegetables and fruit, and his father only starches. <p/> On a neighbouring forum someone was being persuaded not to buy a mix. I quote the part of the text that speaks against buying the mix: <p/> ""...both cavalier and pug breeds have heart problems and that no matter if the dog is a mix or pedigree that you have to know that treatment is expensive, I have a cavalier with pedigree and we have been keeping him alive for 3 and a half years now only with medication, how much did all the visits to the vet, all the medicines cost me, and I don't add it up, but probably about 2000 euros, and probably more, so buying a dog is the cheapest, but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at the age of say 8, 9 years..."" <p/> So why should I buy a dog with a pedigree? Why already? This writing certainly discourages me from doing so. <p/> Maybe you know which tests are mandatory for pugs and cavaliers for breeding? One, several,...? (I really don't know, that's why I'm asking) <p/> but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at say 8, 9 years old, and I know of a case of a non-breeding cavalier who has a grade 4 heart murmur at 4 years old (which mine had at 8 years old). <p/> ALL cavaliers have heart problems. If you buy from a proven breeder, problems will appear at 8,9 years, if not they can appear much earlier. <p/> (it's half a question why a person would want a dog that has heart problems from the start, but ok, to each his own) <p/> @salad Ever since user 007 asked a simple question on the ""neighbouring forum"", in the next 3-4 pages, the ""genealogical automaton"" kicked in and uncontrollably started spewing the same learned phrases, which are TOTALLY not the answer to the question asked, and started to savagely rape the person with its logic, which doesn't allow for a different opinion. Unfortunately, the ""automated slaves"" of the genealogy lobby are also on this forum, and here too they impose their beliefs on the users. <p/>Why? It is just a problematic breed in certain health aspects. Why hide it? I mean, if one paragraph is taken out of context, it's despicable anyway. This dog, if I am not mistaken, is about 9 years old. And it is quite right to warn a person who does not know what he is buying that both breeds can be risky, especially if the parent dogs have not had heart health tests. <p/> And this mix would do nothing to improve health, quite the opposite. And if it has already been used and the dogs are not under control, there is no need for the ""breeder"" to deceive the potential guardians of the calf puppies with silence. Or I suppose it is possible that he has told them, but given the general reaction, I don't think he has. <p/> Are you both saying that the problems should not be talked about? Given that traceability is possible, they can be talked about at all, but not in the case of a mixed breed, which doesn't mean it will be healthy <p/> And to be left in the dark... it is precisely through controlled breeding that things can improve. But without control, without tests, preferably with the first one around the corner, you really can't reduce the incidence of certain defects. Tests are definitely not everything, but they can help with many things, and there is always a risk. We are talking about living beings, not carbon fibre <p>An answer that tells a person what the characteristics and needs of BOTH breeds are and that's enough. But the man has been given a ""lecture"" which he did not commission and is not prepared to pay for. He pointed this out a couple of times and then gave up. <p/> To me, he looked like someone who wanted to buy the cheapest possible gift, and in general he got very comprehensive answers (although he did not expect them to be comprehensive) and even surprisingly he did not just get lessons about not buying animals as gifts. You can only make a conclusion from what is written... what the heck... that's the way it is on the forum... <p/> Yes. Functional illiteracy and/or intolerance of dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just like that on the forum. <p/> There are already too many of those. They were created when standardisation started, which if I'm not mistaken was in the Victorian era. You win ;-) Everyone has their own views on the world, animals etc. You don't have any. <p/> I would like to ask you something else. Maybe somebody lives in Vic. We could get together sometime and go I don't know to PST or the carob. We moved here recently so we don't know any or very few. We always need company:-) <p/> You know what saddens me the most? E.g. this: http://www.pesjanar.si/forum/index.php?topic=151.90 And right on the neighbouring forum, and elsewhere, they support so called ""controlled pedigree breeding"". What is controlled here? And this is not an isolated case, there are many, too many. Are they to be believed? They don't convince me... <p/>These defects are now being diagnosed, but that doesn't mean they weren't there before. <p/> Before, when you asked why you didn't have a dog anymore, they said, ""He was old"", and he was maybe a little over seven years old... One of the examples I have encountered in my life... And what do you say to them? (it was a village mixed breed) I am not saying that mixed breeds are more or less sick, but that you can't conclude from the number of visits to the vet how healthy they are. Because the one above must have died of old age, and yes, when you talk about the breed, there is the possibility of finding out a bit more about the history of the previous breeds, which is unfortunately not possible with mixed breeds, because nobody knows anything, unless they are all from the same village and people know them.... In that case they are usually much more closely related than some pedigree dogs. (villageinbriding) <p/> Hudma, he himself wrote that he was buying a dog as a gift, but he was actually looking for a pug...really gross illiteracy. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with this topic... Do you approve of buying a living creature for someone who has no idea what is in store for him? No one deserves that, not the giver and not the animal. If the recipient is younger, his parents are he he he <p/>salad, are you sad about the ultrasound? Aren't you in favour of the unsupervised? <p/> Yes, because it's clear to me that there are certain things you just don't want to know ....on the neighbouring forum all the ""evidence"" has been carefully deleted, that's how it's done here, I'm afraid. I will quote the following text: <p/> "" I am contacting you because I would like to warn potential buyers of my experience of [name and surname deleted at the request of the author, and the name of the kennel], which has been anything but pleasant. <p/> Around Christmas 2009 my partner and I bought a little bull terrier from her, who was just over 2 months old at the time. After much cajoling to hand over the papers, we went to her a couple of months later to get the pedigree, and then she asked, a little strangely, how much our Oscar was drinking, because one male from that litter had already died because his kidneys had failed because he was licking the salty snow by the roadside (which is, of course, a big stupid thing to do!). While nothing was clear to us at the time, we soon found out why she was asking such strange questions - we took the puppy to the vet, who diagnosed congenital chronic kidney failure and told us that his days were numbered. We informed [name removed] and asked her what she was going to do about it. She offered to buy another dog for a 'symbolic' price, but we refused and asked for a refund. She promised to send a reply by e-mail, but nothing happened for two months. In the meantime we met others who had bought dogs from the same litter and warned them about the disease. It turned out that out of the 6 dogs from the litter, 2 were already dead and 2 had severe kidney damage. I have no information on the other two. When we asked [name deleted] why she had not informed any of us that there might be something wrong with the dogs, she replied that she did not want to panic. Even after we had informed her about Oscar (so 2 puppies were already dead and one was sick), she did not warn anyone. <p/> As she had not emailed anything for two months, we called her and after many calls she did come back. In the meantime, Oskar had already been euthanised. When asked why she had not replied as promised, she said she had not had time. When my partner asked her if she was making a fool of him for not having had 10 minutes in two months to write an e-mail, she told him that if he meant to be rude, she would hang up. When he told her that Oskar was gone, she first asked ""How is he gone?"", but when he explained that we had had him euthanised, she was all amazed, as if she had not known that he was ill, and as if we had had the dog put to sleep just for a bit of a joke. And again she promised to send an e-mail. Today it is 14 days since that call, and I have not heard from her. I understand that puppies have unforeseen health problems, but for her to persistently proclaim herself a great dog lover, then hide the facts and react in this way to the fact that more than half of the litter is seriously ill or already dead, and yet tell no one and persistently avoid contact, to me clearly shows her attitude to animals. <p/> I would therefore caution anyone who may wish to buy a puppy from [name of kennel deleted, at the request of the author] to think carefully about it, because, while everything seems fine on their side, our experience and that of others who have bought puppies from this litter suggests otherwise. "" <p/> Will something be clearer now? This is how it is in the St. Florian Valley....this is what is supported here! <p/> Yes, my sorrow! You can find scum everywhere. And what doesn't convince you? Are you going to lump everything together because of some bad breeders? And purebreds without pedigree convince you, huh? The ones who haven't had a single test. Hehehe, you're the one who should believe the tests you're going to get from a breeder rather than from a home breeder! <p/>What to do with all the xy tests if such breeders are breeding? But nobody dares to comment on that? Why does such a breeder continue to breed? Why is he being advertised where they are the most vocal about supertruper honestly controlled pedigree breeding? Considering the number of ""renegades"" in slo, I doubt I can get a better (healthier) pedigree dog than a mix. And no, I don't trust our breeders. And I don't know what's funny here. <p/> Well, with all the xy tests (mandatory + desirable) that a breeder would show you, you could see that he actually cares about the health of the bitch, the puppies and the breed itself! Because if he didn't, he wouldn't even go to do them. A quasi breeder will never show you xy tests and you don't buy a dog from one! Simpl ko pasulj! <p/> I find your way of thinking funny. Let's say the bitch is having a fight with the neighbour's NO. She has a heart problem for example (when you come to see her she looks pure awesome) and he's a poor bastard who can barely walk and he's only 4 years old. You'd rather take the dog from me, because....... the puppies will be bursting with health because they are mixed-breeds? I can tell you fairy tales, but the one who has done the 5 tests has the proof <p/> Andreja, are you making fun of me???? QUOTE: Greetings, I am in the process of buying a dog, not for me, but I still need some advice. I am deciding to buy a pug, not a purebred, this one is a mix between a pug and a cavalier king charles. I would like to know if this dog is a lot of work, I have read a lot of things on the net, some people say that it is necessary to clean the fold every day, to comb it, that it is a special food, fruit... and that it is a quiet family dog, which is mainly intended for the house, I would like to have some more opinions from the owners who have this type of dog, thank you very much! <p/> I underlined his question, now you tell me where he is asking about my/your/our opinion on giving a dog away. PLEASE? The man is asking about the character traits and idiosyncrasies of a pug and a cavalier. BUT NO???? But is it so difficult to write a couple of answers to a SIMPLE question? <p/> The guy wanted to buy a dog as a gift. That's not how it's done. Regardless, he got the answers to his questions. He just didn't like them and didn't want to see them accordingly. He was told that he would not buy a pug (whose qualities he was interested in) nor a mix, but a cross between the two dogs. For which no one can predict what he will take from which parent (they are very different breeds in character and structure, the only thing they have in common is that they are not large (like crossing a Springer Spaniel with a Mastiff and wanting to know what you will get out). He was told that both breeds were medically demanding. Why? because most of the problems that afflict these two breeds are due to their physique. This problem is not due to standards, but both breeds have had this problem since God knows when - pugs are very old dogs, cavaliers a little less so, but both were around long before x-rays, ultrasounds...Be that as it may, the problems of cavaliers are such that it is difficult to weed them out of breeding, because there are no simple genetic or other tests to detect them before they occur. They do appear quite late in life. Now.... these problems are not hidden and are common knowledge. Anyone who nevertheless chooses to breed will look for parents who have their hearts checked regularly and those who have not had syringomyelia in a noticeable form in their ancestors. This is possible exclusively in pedigrees. Those who want a less risky breed will take a cockerel (which, unfortunately, is not so fancy). So the guy got the answer that a mix of these two breeds would be a risky purchase and that there was a high probability that the recipient would leave a hefty pile of money at the vets. OK? <p/> Hahaha oh how it was also conditioned by the standards (that the characteristics in the offspring are VERY similar from characteristics to looks). Quote from wiki:The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred(Means to breed within a single family or strain, so as to produce particular characteristics in the offspring) with flat-bred breeds. I created a bunch of new problems that nowadays complicate this breed but not only that mostly everything. Not to say that there weren't problems before, but in very minor ways. How many breeds have problems with joints, breathing, massive eyelids to congenital diseases like chronic kidney failure,etc. People this is sick what is happening to dogs and don't give me crap how some xy tests can solve them because they can't. <p/> If a dog is a butcher (anything in this case without a pedigree), it is not a priori immediately healthy because of that (most people don't see a vet because of bad owners, not because of their brilliant health!). <p/> Just because a dog is pedigree doesn't mean it will be healthy all its life. If the breeder is on the spot, i.e. cares about the dogs, he will do all possible tests to avoid doing the vets a disservice. So, if by means of tests (for which you only need to take blood or saliva - once in the life of the dog, because they keep these things and then you can order a new test every month and don't have to get rid of it all at once) you can breed in such a way that you don't get out affected dogs, I don't understand why not. (I partly understand all of you who have non-breeding approaches, because you don't want to admit mistakes (you turn a blind eye, you fool the ostrich...) i.e. you support stepparies and the torture of animals. (There are ""specimens"" among breeders too, but it also depends on what is a ""specimen"" for you.)) <p/> Pidog. I may have hit the antijack road with the mesan in terms of their health. It's just my opinion that they are one of the few dogs (percentage-wise) that are cared for like pedigree dogs of less common breeds (in short, tipitopi or as the law says - if there is something wrong with the dog, vet and not sus). <p/> Well, yes, the history of kcs is much more complicated, but so be it - some breed expert could give more precise information. The problem with the kcs is not so much that they have a short muzzle (nor is it extremely short like, say, a pug) but that the skull is too short in the temple. <p/>Now...the question was yes or no to the deliberate production of dogs. And it's not really a question of yes or no, but how. Because the question of breeding dogs is not so very simple that you can lump everything together. But to say that in general breeds are better/worse than mixes in any trait. Because breeds vary so much from one another, and there are often huge differences between types within a breed. You have a number of breeds whose typical representatives are distinctly vigorous, hardy and long-lived, and you have breeds that have more or less difficulty in this respect. In principle, any breed characterised by an exaggerated trait is more at risk. However, with clever planning and selection, even in these breeds you can get healthy dogs that function perfectly normally. <p/> Usually the biggest problems arise when a breed's trait is to be changed at short notice. Usually, unfortunately, because of a fad of one kind or another. A desire to ""improve"" rather than preserve the breed. What role does the standard play in this? A standard is nothing more than a description of a typical representative of the breed. The problem is that what is written can be interpreted in different ways. It says, for example, the ears are long - and then it starts to select for the longest possible ears. In the standard it says long hair, but they start selecting for dogs with hair that drags on the ground. Apart from the fact that no exaggeration is good in itself, you almost always get a surprise in the package when you go to select for one trait rather than the whole. Usually unpleasant. <p/> Having said the bull terrier - in that breed they have gone to changing the almost normal skull shape to a sheep skull. In a very short time. They have got so many problems in the package that the breed is in serious trouble and those who love the breed and would like to save it will have to think honestly about how to proceed, make a well thought out plan and probably take a big step backwards. The problem almost always arises when too much emphasis is placed on show results when selecting dogs for breeding and when selecting combinations. <p/> Mixes... whichever - but the fact is that even those ""true"" mixes that have had pedigree ancestors going back I don't know how many knees, or never at all, have all the hereditary problems that plague pedigrees. There are not even a few mixed breeds with various hereditary diseases, but until recently there have been a few who have even been diagnosed. <p/>A few years ago we had a lost blind mix, of the 'foxy' variety that has been around in villages here for ages, with no identifiable breed inside..... was diagnosed with two different hereditary eye diseases and a third that was the result of one of the two. In addition, he had chronic digestive and skin problems. But we also had a pretty healthy mix who couldn't hide the Yorkshire in his background, who lived to be just over 20 years old <p/> only he doesn't want a conformation, he wants a breed.... (or a chrysance between two problematic breeds) <p/> I also partly understand all of you who keep barking the same five half-truths endlessly, because you are just not able to comprehend those who think differently. <p/> After reading such and such threads, I realised that there are more and more people buying from breeders...I was sure that this would change over the years, but it has got worse...this forum has also become just a chatterbox, since some people have newly signed up and are just looking for a breeder to fill their free time.... <p/>If a different opinion is so unacceptable, you can ban me, of course. But in doing so you will confirm my point about not accepting dissent. <p/> Put it any way you like, no matter how badly a breed is doing, the non-breeding approximations of that breed are doing even worse.",Forum,train
746,"These foods rebuild your organs! <p/> The organs in the human body are constantly renewing themselves. But to help them do this even better, and to boost their function and health, you can help them with certain foods. <p/> Vegetables help to rebuild the internal organs. (Photo: FreeDigitalPhotos.net) <p/> The liver is an organ that regenerates every 150 days. Old cells are replaced by new ones so that the liver can continue to perform its function. The heart also regenerates, as many studies have shown. This happens about four times during a lifetime. The skin regenerates faster, every 28 days, bones take ten years, the intestines regenerate every few days, etc. We can also help our organs to do even better, to regenerate faster and to stay healthy, by eating more food. Foods such as blueberries, green tea, carnosine (found in pork, lamb and fish) are good for the nervous system. These foods help to regenerate stem cells. Other foods that also have a beneficial effect on organ regeneration, especially liver and stem cell regeneration, are turmeric, celery, parsley, artichokes, royal jelly, coffee, red wine, black grapes, green tea. Foods recommended for faster renewal of insulin-producing beta cells are: black cumin, curcumin, vitamin D - found in fish, eggs, cheese, red meat, avocado, melon, chard, brassicas. Vitamin C is recommended for hormone regeneration. For heart muscle regeneration, the following foods are recommended: red wine, oatmeal, pork, poultry, young cheese, wheat germ. Curcumin is recommended for cartilage repair and for faster recovery from spinal cord injuries, while nettle, fish oil and other foods high in vitamin E are recommended for repairing diseased joints.",Information/Explanation,train

During its existence, it has hosted some of the leading names in high-tech, science and art, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro, Honda Robotics, Stelarc, Victoria Vesna, as well as local artists such as Robertina Šebjanič, Srečo Dragan and Laibach. <p/> The tenth anniversary was also an opportunity to take stock of the work done and to look to the future of the festival, which is one of only three of its kind that the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia recognises as being of high quality and renown, and for this reason also provides financial support for its implementation. In the spirit of the times and the development of both visual culture and technology, the festival's management decided to focus on virtual worlds and 3D environments. <p/> One of the flagship projects this year is the Brain Computer Hackathon, the first event of its kind in Slovenia. In addition, the Tree project, jointly developed by American artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter, is also worth mentioning.

Using 3D environments, haptic interfaces and sound effects, the artists put us in the position of a tree in a tropical rainforest. We can feel how the tree grows in its environment and how it is affected by climatic conditions. The project was presented at the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos and attracted a lot of interest among the influencers gathered there. <p/> Also working with virtual worlds is British artist Nicola Plant, who will be presenting her project Parallax at the festival, which shares the thoughts of individual visitors in a virtual environment with all other visitors by sensing their movements and facial expressions, testing the possibilities of non-verbal communication between people in a world that is increasingly moving towards virtual reality. Borders in the digital environment are also being broken down by Bulgarian new media artist Ivan Petkov, who will present his installation My Country, Your Country, which allows visitors to draw the borders of real or fictional countries on the screen themselves, highlighting the fact that borders are in fact an artificial construct of the human mind and not something natural. <p/> While showcasing global productions, the festival does not neglect local new media artists. This year, among others, Saša Nemec, with the project Inside/Outside, and Boštjan Čadež, with the VR installation PD4, will be presented.",Opinionated News,train

763,"In shopping centres, preferably with separate entrances and exits and with floor signage <p/> Ahead of Monday's opening of shopping centres and activities in them, the NICE has made recommendations for both retailers and shoppers. Measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus will make shopping in large centres a little different from what shoppers were used to before the crisis. Among other things, the NIJZ advises separate entrances and exits and floor signage. <p/> In addition to the standard and general recommendations that apply across the board, such as frequent hand washing and disinfection, cough hygiene, appropriate distances and the like, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) has made additional detailed recommendations ahead of Monday's resumption of activity in shopping centres. These apply not only to shops but also to the many other service providers and activities (repairs, repair services, book and paper shops, watchmakers, jewellers, key-making, etc.) located in these centres. The NIJH recommends that the maximum number of customers in a room should be adapted to the size of the room, taking into account a sufficient personal distance of at least 1.5 metres. In the common corridors of the shopping centre, it is necessary to prevent large numbers of people from loitering, and it is therefore advisable to use floor markings and guide posts with tapes to indicate the direction of movement, so that people do not move in the opposite direction at the same time. Care will also need to be taken to ensure that the stalls and other services available in the common corridors are properly positioned. Where possible, shopping centres should also provide for entry and exit through separate entrances and exits. The implementation of these measures should be supervised by security guards or authorised employees of the shopping centres. Retailers should also ensure that employees and customers are able to wash and disinfect their hands in the business premises, including by means of appropriate disinfectant dispensers. In addition to posters and infographics, warnings should also be given in shopping centres through regular audio messages or digital displays. Common seating and rest areas such as benches, massage chairs and seating in corridors will not be used, nor will common children's play areas. The NIJH also reminded people to ensure effective ventilation, especially with windows wide open, and to avoid air circulation with mechanical ventilation. Shoppers will also need to follow the recommendations before entering and staying in shopping centres: only healthy individuals without signs of respiratory infection should enter, while the elderly and patients with chronic non-communicable diseases at higher risk are advised to take extra protection or consider visiting the shopping centre as a matter of urgency. Hand disinfection before entering and repeatedly while in the building will be mandatory, especially when shopping in different stores, using escalators or lifts (stairs are preferable). They also advise minimising touching of any surfaces and objects, including displays, and going contactless when making payments.",News/Reporting,train

768,"End of Leg 4 of the Volvo Ocean Race <p/> Wednesday 04 Mar 2015 <p/> All six teams have successfully sailed into Auckland, New Zealand. Leg 4 was very interesting. Tactical decisions decided the final placings. Two were crucial. <p/> The importance of the right or wrong tactical decisions had the strongest impact on Team Brunel's final position. They sailed the first part of the leg from Sanya, China very well. Before the Philippines, they decided to sail north, where the winds were expected to be stronger. The tactical decision was the right one and they swung into first place, sailing all the way to the equator. Brunel's skipper, Bouwe Bekking, said after arriving at the finish: ""It's hard for a team that has sailed very well. We only finished in fifth place because of a mistake Andrew Cap and I made. The mistake we made cost us a good place. We were leading all the way to the equator. When we sailed with the wind to the east, things did not go as planned. The weather did not do what we expected. From the first place we had held since 15.2. we dropped to fifth on 22.2. And now we are at the finish line. For the second time in a row in fifth place. I must admit that I am disappointed. In the last few legs we have realised that very strange things can happen in a regatta. The differences between the teams are very small and many things can happen. That is the advantage of sailing on the same boats. It's just part of sailing!"" <p/> MAPFRE was the fastest team to finish Leg 4. The Abu Dhabi team followed and the Chinese boat Dongfeng came third. Team Alvimedica came in fourth ahead of Team Brunel, and the last to cross the finish line was the SCA women's crew.

779,"Hotel Diana: Olga Belec wins in lawsuit between two female directors <p/> Court rejects Jasna Klepec's claim to annul the contract <p/> A ruling by the District Court in Murska Sobota has brought to an end a lawsuit in which Jasna Klepec, the owner of Hotel Diana, had sought to annul the contract by which she and her business partner Željko Jovanović bought a stake in the company from Olga Belec and her son Patrick Belec at the end of 2018. Luka Podjed, a Ljubljana-based lawyer who is defending Belč, says that the court expectedly rejected Klepč's claim and that it was, in his opinion, fundamentally unfounded. ""The court followed our arguments completely and found that there was no payment in cash. It also found that Klepčeva had obtained all the necessary information about the state of the company and the real estate, or had the opportunity to obtain it."" Klepčeva based her claim on allegations that Belčeva had not informed her of all the details of the company's business, including certain liabilities owed to employees, before signing the contract. The contract thus remains valid and, as previously reported, Hotel Diana has since ended up in bankruptcy. In addition to the annulment of the contract, Klepčeva's lawsuit also sought the reimbursement of the purchase price, claiming that it amounted to EUR 80 000 in total, although the contract, which was also notarised, stated an amount of EUR 30 000. <p/> Aleš Cipot <p/> Olga Belec <p/> Klepčeva claimed that, as agreed, on the day of the signing of the contract, 50 thousand euros were handed over to Belčeva in cash, allegedly by Matej Hofinger, a businessman from Velenje, who acted as an intermediary in the transaction, but they did not provide any evidence to convince the judge, Marjetica Škerget Logar, of their claims. Klepčeva says she is disappointed with the court's decision and will appeal it. Olga Belec welcomes the court's decision to the contrary, and believes that the allegations in the claim were fabricated. ""This proves what I have been saying all along, that the sale was transparent. I even went to help the new management for the first two months after the sale. I sold the company in good faith, because the buyers assured me that they would also buy the property, which I did not have enough money to do myself. So I was glad that someone who supposedly could save the company bought it, but if I had known that things would turn out this way, I would never have sold it to them."" As for the allegations of receiving cash, Belčeva reiterates that this never happened. She adds that she herself has thought a lot about how such allegations could have come about: ""I wonder whether Matej Hofinger might not have really received the money from Klepčeva, but gave it to someone else. In any case, the whole affair was about diverting attention to me, because I was State Secretary at the time, while the company was being financially drained.""",News/Reporting,train

781,"News archive <p/> Government issues decree on small-scale renewable energy installations. <p/> On 5 March, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia issued a Regulation on small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration. The Regulation defines the types, size and conditions for the installation and connection of small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration, which do not require a building permit in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of buildings. The Regulation is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 14/2020. <p/> The Regulation is issued on the basis of the provisions of the Energy Act, which establishes the legal basis for the adoption of a by-law to determine the types of simple installations for the production of electricity from RES or CHP that do not require a building permit and are installed on, in or next to an existing building or civil engineering structure built in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of structures, their size and the conditions for their installation and connection. <p/> These subjects were previously regulated in the Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which also contained Chapter IV.a ""Specific features and exceptions in the field of electricity generation"", which provided that the installation of a RES/SPHPP electricity generation installation in accordance with the building regulations was to be considered as investment maintenance work (which did not require a building permit), provided that certain conditions were fulfilled. The new Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which entered into force in April 2016, repealed this Regulation and does not contain any provisions related to such production installations. This means that under the current legislation on the construction of buildings, the installation of such installations generally requires a building permit, which, given the relative complexity of their installation, constitutes an excessive administrative burden and has a disincentive effect on investment in such installations. Taking into account the fact that the Republic of Slovenia has to achieve binding targets for the production of electricity from RES (otherwise it faces high fines), investments in such installations should also be encouraged by removing administrative barriers. As will be explained below, the current building legislation allows for this, but this area also needs to be regulated in more detail in the energy regulations. Among other things, the Building Act stipulates that a building permit is not required for simple structures and maintenance of structures (Art. 5 of the Building Act). What falls into this category is derived from the Regulation on the classification of buildings, which lays down the criteria for classifying simple, non-complex, less complex, complex buildings, other building interventions and maintenance works. Maintenance work, according to point 4 (Installation of installations in, on and adjacent to the installation), includes, inter alia, the installation of new installations and associated installations for the exploitation of RES. However, as this has already been regulated in the abovementioned Energy Infrastructure Regulation, it is necessary to regulate the types of installations in the energy legislation, including power limitations, and the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of the installation and the operation of such installations.

In the first set of problems, the author deals with the uncertainty of the dating of the military fortifications of the claustra system and with the late dating of the prison walls. He briefly attempts to identify the fortifications of the tract, which he sees as a broader defence of Italy than just a sector in the Julian Alps. In the last two sections, he discusses the chronology and typological characteristics of the fortified highland outposts, which take on a purely military character in a certain segment and in certain places, and points to a defence of Italy that extended in depth.",Information/Explanation,train

801,"Last Tuesday, 23 April 2013, Slovenian brands Marta Vodeb, Terra Urbana, Nelizabeta and Urša Zrnec and Pentlja by Goga presented their jewellery collections at the Emporium Gallery. <p/> On a beautiful spring evening, the Gallery prepared a magical event, which was opened on the ground floor by Marta Vodeb. Mannequins walked down the Gallery's imposing staircase to the sound of Slovenian evergreen melodies, dressed in the Girl from the Golden Boat collection in silk, lace and wool and adorned with short sleeves, bows and pearls. The collection is romantic, delicate and nostalgic and worthy of praise. <p/> Upstairs, Terra Urbana brings nature to life. Inspired by the world of butterflies, the Dragonfly Married Butterfly SS2013 collection is a blend of tenderness with strength, tradition with trend and fabrics that are friendly to people and nature. <p/> Upstairs, the evergreens were replaced by thumping electronic music, while the escalators served as the prefect backdrop for both the summer and part of the winter 2013/14 collection by Nelizabeta. The summer collection was inspired by the 1920s, art deco and sports fashion, while the winter collection was inspired by the national costumes of the former Yugoslavia and military uniforms. Not only the clothes, but also the shoes and bags are the work of designer Neli Štrukelj. All the products are made in the Nelizabeta team's home workshop in Sežana, where they combine the experience of the old masters with modern technology and innovation. The summer and autumn/winter collections are most impressive for the coats. <p/> On the ground floor, we also saw Urša Zrnec's glass jewellery and Pentlja by Goga in vibrant neon colours that scream summer. <p/> Petra Draškovič from Galeria Emporium told Fashionista.si that Slovenian designers are becoming more and more visible and marketable in the Gallery. Especially successful are the jewellery collections, which are also sought after by tourists and other visitors from abroad. However, she stressed that a lot also depends on the designer himself and his will to do something for the brand's recognition and promotion. ""At the Gallery we are proud to host Slovenian designers. Our doors are open to everyone, anyone can come to us, show us their collections and we assess whether they are of high enough quality and commercial enough for us to participate. We are very excited about the development of Slovenian fashion."" <p/> The second day of the fashion week was filled with presentations of their collections by Urša Drofenik, Simona Lampe, Maja Štamol, Vladimira Kralj and Miro Misljen in the first part and Matevž Faganel, Sanja Grcić, Nicola De Main, Aleksandra Brlan and Maja Ferme in the evening part. <p/> In the afternoon show, Simona Lampe and Maja Štamol pleasantly surprised with their wearable and sale collections. The evening show was opened by Faganel, who this time went a little out of his comfort zone and surprised with dresses and knitwear combined with leather. He collaborated with Anna Lazovski and Eber Furriers to design the collection. <p/> Sanja Grcić's clean tailoring is also worthy of praise, with her coats in particular catching the eye of the fashion cognoscenti. Sanja, like Urša Jerkič, wore the now famous Nataša Peršuh shirt that the designer sent to the runway at last year's Fashion Week. <p/> Maja Ferme chose to make a subtle critique of society at this year's show, backed up by rock n' roll music, punchy slogans and heavy embellishments on the evening dresses as well as on the jackets and coats.

826,"I would like to know a couple of things about cat acne, if anyone has any more experience. mainly I know about the so called black dots under the chin, which are supposed to be cat acne or fungus? I know it can be done elsewhere on the body. <p/> I have seen the occasional spot on the chin in one of our cats, but now I have a different problem. fergie has these spots just under her nose, just on one side, and on her nose, mostly on the same side. around her nostril, if you can imagine. let me say that she eats quite stump-eating, and a lot of the time her nose helps with things, so it seems to me that this could be the cause of this outbreak around the nostril.... <p/> yesterday I cleaned that area with splivasept and water and it all went away under the snout, the skin was red there, today it's better... it's healing. there's one part on the snout that remains. instead of having a nice coat there, she has a small scab that doesn't come off with washing. of course I don't think to rub it too much, because it's extremely uncomfortable for her if I do that. <p/> I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to proceed? of course I can take her to the vet, that's not a problem... but I understandably try to avoid it if I can, because I don't want to upset the cat if I don't really have to. <p/> In my opinion it's just dirt, and when it dries it can stick so firmly to the skin that it's yikes. I just find it odd that it's so noticeable, because Fergie isn't white around the snot. I suggest just tapping the spot several times in a row with a soaked cotton wool, waiting a little each time, and then gently removing. A one-off treatment will almost certainly not get it all off, so keep repeating it, but preferably not on the same day, so that you forget the maca a little in between. <p/> yes, it's black up there, yes, I looked at it so close I could see it when you put your finger over it, but you can still feel that little spot. <p/> I think it will go slowly, yes, at least it hasn't gone back to where it was before <p/> When I still had temporaries, I used to dab their acne (even in the spot you described, it was usually) with colloidal silver on a cotton wool a couple of times a day...then the scab came off, peeled off and everything was ok underneath. <p/> u yeah, I didn't think of it right away, but it's good stuff! i'll try to get it now <p/> but otherwise it's pretty good! one little thing is still on the top of the snot, the rest looks good. i was actually thinking that there's a chance that they scratched each other and that's what caused the scab and the acne... what do i know. <p/> now I have another problem, because she scratched her ear too fergie doesn't scratch very gently, if she gets scratched she usually scratches it clean to the fullest, so she slaughters herself if she has to <p/> she gets rid of them for a couple of months. And they do it again. And then we repeat the treatment again and it's ok, until next time. They don't bother him, they don't hurt, they don't spread. They always appear on his chin. We haven't had more than 4 months of peace from them since he was caught. He is a special little guy who needs a little more ""maintenance"", he is just worth it.

830,"Ordinary Woman (Written by Danaja Lorenčič) <p/> In the eyes of ten year old, twenty year old and even thirty year old Danaja, I was burned at the stake in my quest to become something special. <p/> Danaja Lorenčič <p/> A few weeks ago, I was invited for coffee by a friend I rarely see. But while talking to her, I immediately got that familiar feeling that reminds me again and again why I love some people so much. Because they don't hide behind a mask of perfection, they don't feel ashamed of their vulnerability, they don't get defensive when they are in need, and they don't resort to cynicism when you touch their wounds during a conversation. <p/> Before we had each had our cup of coffee, she told me that she had been searching for her own identity lately, as she had lost herself in the last few years due to her many roles. She was starting to wonder who she was if she wasn't a mother and a wife who went to work and in her spare time was a musician. It touched me when she confessed that one of her greatest fears was to become an ordinary woman, so she kept up her hobbies, even when she no longer enjoyed them, because she was afraid that without them she would slip into a boring routine and turn into an uninteresting person. How I recognised myself in her words! I don't have any hobbies, because I have turned what I enjoy most into my work (i.e. writing), but I identified with her fear of the ordinary. Suddenly, hundreds of scenes swirled in my head, reminding me of all I had done to escape the image of the ordinary woman I feared almost as much as my own death. <p/> To avoid becoming ordinary, I kept my weight low and for a short time even believed that anorexia made me special. To avoid becoming ordinary, I rejected the idea of a serious relationship for years because I thought that being single was something that only independent, strong women could do. To avoid becoming ordinary, I dreamt for a very, very long time of a singing career that would save me from an ordinary life, paying bills and annoying bosses. To avoid becoming ordinary, I hung out with damaged people who, like me, refused to grow up for a long time. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up my first and only regular job. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up any thought of motherhood by the age of thirty-five. <p/> Of all the things I did to escape from ordinariness, there is only one thing I do not regret - that I gave up a job that did not make me the least bit happy. Which is not to say that I was entirely happy about it afterwards, as I swallowed the bitter experience of precarious work. But I took responsibility for that decision and faced it. Because by giving up a secure job, I was not running away from discomfort, I was throwing myself out of my comfort zone and starting to develop my potential within my discomfort zone. <p/> This made me feel special, and I tried to escape the fate of the ordinary woman in other areas of my life. I decided that I wanted to write for a living and convinced myself that this was only possible if I didn't have a partner to start a family with, as this would certainly hinder me from achieving my goals. I was operating under the mindset: If I want to be special, I have to give up what is typical of most people. <p/> In reality, I was scared of love after the love wrecks that had caused me emotional wounds. I was scared to let go of control of my weight because I thought I would lose control of my life. I was afraid to end destructive relationships with people who hated themselves because I was afraid they would hate me too. And I was terrified of becoming a mother - especially if I gave birth to a baby girl, because I knew that I would be a bad role model for her because of my unprocessed pain, my denial of pleasure, my tendency to abuse myself and to repress my emotions. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which is something of a ritual for me this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. <p/> For me, being special meant creating a life that did not involve complicated emotions, arguments, sharing household responsibilities with a partner and parenthood. <p/> Hearing my friend say that she was afraid of being ordinary made me think about how I had misinterpreted specialness and at the same time had an unjustified fear of being ordinary. Because back then, when I was striving for specialness, I was nowhere near as content and at peace as I am now. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which for me is a kind of obligatory ritual this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. I am no longer obsessed with controlling my weight. I have not become a famous singer or a successful writer. I have not stayed single so that I can create uninterrupted. I do not have many friends, because I have distanced myself from those who used to burden me with their darkness. And I did not give up motherhood so that I did not have to change anything about myself that I was not proud of. <p/> In the eyes of ten-year-old, twenty-year-old and even thirty-year-old Danaja, I was burnt out in my efforts to become something special. But in the eyes of Danaja, who is slowly approaching forty, I see peace. <p/> And that is what I have longed for for years. For an inner peace that I have wrongly called an ordinary life.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
831,"Events -> 2013 -> Parish Pilgrimage to Sladka Gora <p/> This year's pilgrimage route took us to Sladka Gora. <p/> A pilgrimage is a journey to the Lord, a walk on the stairs, increasing with each step the longing to touch the Heart and to rest in the Embrace. The soul is freed from the countless layers that bind and suffocate it, which is why the preparation for the Sacrament of Reconciliation is always so good for it. Ready to meet the Lord, we celebrated Holy Mass in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Mother of God in Sladka Gora, Styria, with a men's choir made up of pilgrims singing. <p/> We were not only moved by the beautiful interior of the church, but also by the address of Pastor Andrew, who invited us to open our hearts to the point where we could ""be here"" with our whole being, soul and body, experiencing and fully accepting all that was placed before us; to forge bonds and friendships with people and with God. After the Holy Mass, the local parish priest gave us a historical outline of the Shrine and the life connected with it. <p/> The garden in front of the church was quite lively as the Oratory was taking place. <p/> We gathered again on the bus that took us to Šmarje pri Jelšah, where a good lunch was waiting for us. <p/> After lunch we went up to Calvary. The Way of Suffering, which leads to the pilgrimage church of St. Roko, is considered to be the most extensive Passion complex in Slovenia. It was built between 1743 and 1753. It leads the pilgrim between the chapels, so that he can always see only his next destination. Looking down into the valley, one sees the town and the unique image of the varied wine-growing landscape, from the border mountains of Styria and Carinthia to Pohorje, Boč and Donat, Macel and Zagorje in Croatia, to Bohorje, Hume and the Savinja Valley. <p/> Entering the Church of St. Roko, we had a new surprise. The massive exterior of the church, built in 1646, is in stark contrast to its richly decorated interior, where shell and net shapes, angel heads and flower branches intertwine. The pilgrimage tradition is still alive at St. Roch. On 15 August, the feast of the patron saint of the parish, Our Lady of the Assumption, and on 16 August, the feast of St. Rocco, several thousand people gather here. St. Rok is part of the pilgrimage triad, Sladka Gora - Tin Tin - St. Rok. The church is very acoustic, which is why concerts are held there. <p/> The first raindrops fell, and the bus took us to the most beautifully landscaped village in Europe, Olimje. <p/> Here we visited the Minorite monastery and learned about its history. <p/> In the Old Pharmacy we admired the frescoes by Anton Lerchinger, which speak of the path to health and happiness. We wandered into a shop with herbal preparations, teas, tinctures and ointments that help maintain health. We were overwhelmed by the image of the Pilgrimage House of St. Joseph and the park for rest and relaxation. We walked through the garden of medicinal plants where ""for every disease there is a flower"". The walking path leads between beds with around 200 specimens of medicinal plants named with Slovenian and Latin names, which grow in our gardens, meadows, marshes and forests, and are used for teas, salves and tinctures. Each plant is also labelled with its medicinal properties. <p/> In Olimje, we couldn't pass by the Chocolate Factory and its delicacies. We were drawn in, our eyes were big and our sweet tooth was irrepressible! <p/> At the end of our pilgrimage, in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Assumption with its black and gold altars, we prayed the fifth Litany of the Mother of God and celebrated the National Day with a cultural programme in the courtyard of the monastery. <p/> On our way home, we passed through Trojany. Here we had a delicious doughnut or ice cream. We were happy and satisfied on our way back home, grateful to Pastor Andrew for leading and organising a wonderful pilgrimage that filled our hearts and souls. <p/> JP <p/> Photos.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

He could have saved the opening set in his favour when he served at 5-4, but Dimitrov had other plans. The Bulgarian stole a set from the Czech by winning four games in a row. Berdych did not make the same mistake in the second and third sets and took the break advantage safely to the end. <p/> ''I lost the opening set because Dimitrov played unbelievable. I was very happy with my serve in the second set, which helped me to finish well,'' explained the Czech. <p/> Tomas Berdych celebrates his second win in Stochholm and 10th of his career <p/> Grigor Dimitrov lost today, but is still in contention for the final in London.

839,"Home - Ski Jumping - News - Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> 17.03.2021 <p/> Ahead of the Ski Jumping World Cup season finale, which will take place at the Goriška Brothers Aerodrome next week, the representatives of OK Planica have summarised their thoughts and views. <p/> Enzo Smrekar, President of SZS and President of OK Planica <p/> After three successful World Championships in Slovenia and after all three World Cup competitions, we are now looking forward to the end of the season with the final in Planica. We are expecting all the teams, a great finish and a top organisation. Unfortunately, there will be no spectators again, hopefully for the last time. What is important is that we are working hard to partially cover the loss from the cancelled race last March. The expectation is that this event will also work with a positive zero and will partly contribute to covering the seasonal shortfall. <p/> I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal sponsors. Without them, it would not have been possible. Thanks also to all the workers and staff who work with great enthusiasm to ensure that our matches are held to a high standard. And of course, thanks to OK Planica, which oversees all of this and takes care of the event itself. I am sure that the media and all the teams will feel welcome, even though the precautions are strict. They are dictated by the profession on the one hand and by the precaution that has marked us this year as one of the top World Cup race organisers where there have never been any infections or cancellations. <p/> As we were wrapping up the World Championships in December, our minds were already somewhat on the World Cup in March. At that time, we imagined that we would now be able to welcome the first live spectators in the valley below Ponce. Unfortunately, even after all these months, and especially after the intense discussions in recent weeks, we can only conclude with sadness that we will not be welcoming spectators this year either, and that the measures that were in place in December are still in force. This means that everyone taking part in this competition will be staying in a so-called snow hut. Two areas will be set up, the so-called green area and the grey area. Protected areas in which the competition will run as smoothly as possible. The media regime will be similar to that in December. It applies both to work in the media centre and in the mixed zone. <p/> We have also worked quite a lot on the idea, which was already alive in December, of spectators watching the Alpine Skiing Competition from vehicles. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this here today either. Not only the large amounts of snow we have received this winter, but also the epidemiological situation in Slovenia and in wider Europe is not yet good enough to make this possible. With our loyal sponsor, Zavarovalnica Triglav, we have once again prepared the so-called virtual fan stand, which will be located at the exit of the Goriška Brothers Airport. There, virtual spectators will be able to tune in to the competition itself via a remote meeting tool. I would already like to invite all interested parties to register on the triglav.si/planica website. There they will then wait for the call to watch the match. <p/> Planica will be different from everything we have already tried in December. These experiences have been very rewarding. The regime will be similar, but we learned a few things then. Despite the stricter requirement in Slovenian law that all participants in sporting events must be tested every 48 hours, we will stick to it. The extra day of competition makes the risk of infection even greater. We do not want this to happen at the start of the season. We want to maintain our reputation as a good, excellent organiser and that is why this decision has been taken. The rules for World Cup ski jumping competitions in the FIS family are slightly different and in some points even stricter than we are used to elsewhere. <p/> At the moment we have 16 teams registered. Approximately 186 people are on the accreditation list. Access to the valley will be restricted from this weekend. Initially there will be a partial restriction, but from Monday onwards the valley will be virtually closed to all outside visitors. Access will be restricted to accredited persons only. <p/> Preventive measures against covid-19 remain in place. Call for distance, wearing FFP2 masks at all times and disinfection! This is absolutely in place. Please adhere to it, everyone. <p/> As a point of interest, if we hosted the games under floodlights in December, the games during the week will be held in the afternoon, but still in daylight conditions. And with TV Slovenia's TV coverage, we will once again provide additional attractive spots, so this time the coverage from Planica will also be something special. I can say that I have a proof copy of the book that will be published on the occasion of this year's Plania competition. I am sure it will be very well received by everyone. The Goriška brothers are fatally linked to Planica and Planica to them. This is one more moment of this year's Planica. <p/> The budget this time is a few euros short of EUR 1.5 million. If we compare this with the classic finals in previous years, it is as much as half as much. We have had to work very hard to turn every euro around and spend it as economically as possible so that the final calculation shows a positive zero. Unfortunately, the absence of spectators has resulted in a loss of approximately 35% of revenue. If we add to this the loss made last March, the situation is not enviable, but it is not unmanageable. We and our team at OK Planica will do our utmost to successfully eliminate this loss. In addition to our loyal sponsors, who have stood by us all these years, I would like to thank the Ministry of Defence, the Slovenian Armed Forces and, of course, the Slovenian Police, who, with their members, always make sure that Planica is as it is, as we are used to it, and I believe that it will be special this time too, although it will be different, because the spectators will not be able to come to the valley below Ponce. <p/> Aljoša Dolhar, Competition Manager <p/> I feel a certain amount of responsibility. This year, from the very beginning, the preparations have been a bit different than usual. We had a specific situation and we had three types of snow on the airfield. We had about 4000 cubic metres of snow left over from the March event, which we stored and then used in December. A lot of natural snow fell on top of that. We estimate the quantity to be around 12 000 cubic metres. In addition, we produced about 5,000 cubic metres of artificial snow. During the winter races, in cooperation with NC Planica, we kept the ski jump and the run-off area tamped, the snow compacted, mixed and, above all, prevented from sliding. On the downhill run, we also kept the ski from December. Only this one had to be cleaned and re-cut. The situation at the moment is such that today we have started removing the spare snow that we had stored in the run-out. We are spreading the snow on the runway with a tamping machine. We have the skis practically ready, so we are just waiting to open them and start using them. We will be ready with the machine work on Friday afternoon. We are planning a big operation on Saturday and Sunday with our team to get everything ready for the test on Tuesday. <p/> Today and tomorrow in Planica there are optional training sessions for the pre-competitors. After tomorrow we will form a team of 20-25 jumpers who will jump next week. On Tuesday at 15:30 we expect the first series of the aerodrome test. The second series is planned for 17:00, so that we can test the visibility and conditions at the same time. As far as the weather forecast is concerned, I have to say that it is quite favourable at the moment. From Tuesday onwards we expect stable weather, with moderate temperatures. At night it will be -5 to -8, which will make our work easier. Daytime temperatures will range from 2 to 8 degrees. The weather will be partly clear to mainly cloudy, which is better than very clear. I hope this forecast is accurate. Wind conditions should also be very stable. The weather is also very good for us at the moment. Who will jump first will be known after tomorrow's practice. <p/> This year in Planica the whole jury of the competition will change, not only the competition director. There is also a change of TD and ATD. We will see what this means on Sunday after the competition. The Technical Delegate will be Ivo Greger from the Czech Republic, who I understand has no experience with flying, but is an experienced TD. His assistant is my assistant on the flights, Thomas Hasselberger from Germany. We have worked well together at all the airshows and I hope that this will make a difference and that we will work harmoniously as a jury.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

851,"I had this operation this week. I wonder if anyone has any experience. How about cycling, after how long did you go back on the bike, I mean on a single, in the woods, not on the asphalt. Thank you lp hema <p/> Obey the doctor's advice. A lot also depends on each individual, some people heal faster, some slower with various complications. Definitely consult a doctor, but it is true that sometimes they exaggerate the time limit until when you should avoid exertion etc...but all this for your prevention... <p/> Thank you. I have a very good doctor and I will listen to him. But I am more of the get back on my feet quickly sort. We'll see. lp, hema <p/> I had this operation too. First I gritted my teeth in pain for two years, went round and round the docs, waited months for check-ups, was prescribed therapy in the acute phase, lost my job because of sick leave, waited for the disability committee to give me an opinion because of my paralysed leg, was hit by trampolines, rolled around the hospitals and received blockades, when finally they took pity on me and operated. Unfortunately, it was too late - the result is the destruction of the sciatic nerve from the spine to the end of the feet.I can't feel my left leg because of paresis, or I have the feeling of a ""deaf"" leg. The muscles have slowly atrophied and there is clearly no strength in the leg. I cannot wear a minica. My fendered foot bothers me a lot on the bike, I have no power, I can't get off on the left side because I fall, on the special I have a spd in the middle of the shoe because there is no power in the foot, and I can push the pedal with my whole foot (thank you Stan for redoing my shoe).Clearly, my kneecaps and leggings are constantly creeping down, because my foot is 5 digits smaller than the right one (the right one). It also bothers me a lot in cross-country skiing and dry running because with this wedge foot I have no push-off and it makes me kneel. I also have a limp, but it is not noticeable when dancing. The doctors immediately warned me that this tends to happen again. Well, it hasn't happened to me yet. Nevertheless, I ride a bicycle. I already had a bike with me in the spa after the operation and it was even recommended. Nevertheless, I ride on rough terrain, and sometimes I fall because I get sucked onto the wrong side and cannot catch my foot. I also find it difficult to carry a 15-kilogram bike, but it goes with a yoke. I also go to marathons (not yet disabled) cycling and running and I do have worse results, but I can do it. Even the sledging punctures haven't knocked me out yet. Even the stitched rags I wear at -12 degrees C can't get to me yet. I have spent a lot of money and time on various chiropractic and electrotherapy treatments to restore the nerve, but the neurologists have put me on solid ground - it's a lifetime. My therapy, my pleasure, is the bicycle. I advise you to do the same. But I hope you don't have any consequences-a destroyed nerve, because then there is no problem at all-get on the bike as soon as possible. <p/> Andreja, thank you, really thank you for these words. No, fortunately I went to a specialist (self-pay) after two months of pain and injections, and he immediately put me on a CT scan in Jesenice, and after 20 days it was my turn for the operation. So, I don't have the same consequences as you. But I know that my leg hasn't worked for a while and it will need to be woken up a bit, but exercises and walks and spa will do. Today is exactly 14 days after the operation and I am more and more hopeful that Franja will not escape me this year. If I may ask you this: Which spa have you been to and how is the bike- where did you put it? Thank you again, you really gave me the mood. LP, hema <p/> I was in Dobrna twice for 14 days each, staying in an old villa opposite the Health Resort. They had a ""rumpr kamra"", where I had my bike, a trekking bike at that time. It was not a treatment but a real relaxing holiday - therapies in the morning, walks in the afternoon, cycling around Paško Kozjak, around Šmartinsko Lake, swimming in the evening, playing cards with my friends.... <p/> Greetings! It's been three months since the operation and I don't have any major problems on the bike, in fact I'm still cycling the easiest, avoiding some hard downhills a bit. I don't have any problems with climbing due to hernia problems (I have them due to the kg gained during 4 months of total inactivity ) hema <p/> With back problems you need to spend a lot of time strengthening the abdominal muscles. And it's also good to keep them as tight as possible while driving. This is where endurance comes into play... <p/> Thank you, Little Mother! I'm working on it, my friend said that if I don't rest (I have to lie down for at least a couple of days, and sit as little as possible), he'll take me back to Jesenice. <p/> Why a second operation? I join Matičko's wishes. <p/> Depression thank you! The first time everything was ok. The second operation is on the other vertebra, or disc-my other leg was hurting, which looked a bit ""strange"" the first time, and has now developed to the point that I had to have ""sub-urgent"" surgery (from MRI to surgery in three days). Lp <p/> hmm; difficulty getting up after sitting; feeling ""electric shakes"" in one leg (along a nerve across the arse); walking, cycling etc. no problems; is that it? - will my aunt's hernia visit me? <p/>Miscolin, it could be something like that. I recommend you see an orthopaedic surgeon, because if it is not too bad you can cure it with exercises and massage. It's good to be examined by a specialist... Just don't wait too long because the operation is not pleasant. I went to an orthopaedic surgeon (in Kranj, he's really a master) because it's too long to wait. If you are interested in more, you can PM me <p/> To join the ""hernia club"" After a day's hiking, I got a low back pain. It wasn't entirely without foreshadowing, I felt a slight draft in my lumbar area right at the start of the tour. After the first long stop I found it a bit hard to get up but decided to continue. After 5 h of cycling I felt neither stiffness nor pain. I thought it was a happy ending. Unfortunately it was not. When I cooled down I was stiff in the lower back and the pain was spreading from the lower back all over my right leg. I was in pain for two weeks. A CT scan showed a herniated L5 disc. I decided to get it sorted as soon as possible so I am now in therapy. There is probably someone else with similar problems. I would be interested to know if anyone has resolved the pain without surgery. Of course, I am most interested in how it works on the bike. Does anyone use cosmodisk active on the bike to prevent back problems ? <p/> Just a layman's thought: maybe a good chiropractor could help you?If the injury is not too serious, of course, they don't do miracles anyway. Marko <p/> My mother was helped a lot by ""stretching"" her spine, if that's what you call it. She bought a special stand with a table on it. You lie down on the table, pin your legs together and turn the table ""upside down"" so that you are lying upside down.... 5-10 min 2x a day. She bought this table from an Austrian company... it's a medical device, so it's tried and tested. The result of using it is that the vertebrae gradually ""stretch"" by about a millimetre, thus relieving the pressure on the nerves. LP <p/> Well, after 4h months of regular exercise, the problems are gone; and the weight is off <p/> I hope for a similar result with both pain and weight <p/> The stretching table as Yogo wrote certainly helps. Otherwise, a beginner's Yoga class (1-2) does wonders. But it depends on your condition. Also, a chiropractor can do more harm if the condition is very bad. Start carefully. I don't doubt it, though, because you've already tasted the pain. <p/> that's it... the price is admittedly reasonable for a ""medical device"" but it's forever... the spine isn't <p/> ...a few days ago on a climbing trip I heard the story of an elderly gentleman who was put in a wheelchair by the doctors a short time later - he was already walking with great difficulty, his trunk movement was very limited, etc. The gentleman was an occasional climber, which he was advised against, like any other harder or extreme sport. His soul would not rest and he went climbing a few times. The catch was that the day after climbing, the movement was much better and the pain was less. He also noticed that the pills/hypnotics and other things ""helped"" him much less than climbing - now he tries to climb as much as possible, so in his old age he also enrolled in a mountaineering course and combines the enjoyable with the very useful for himself! There is something, or a lot, in stretching the spine. I had a lot of problems myself, the doctors couldn't find a solution, I was too young to be advised to have surgery, I was saved by a chiropractor (for a short time). Now I do more sports, I look a little more at my diet and it is much better. For the last two months I have done very little sport because of colds, flu and poisoning, I haven't swum at all, I haven't cycled, I've only climbed a few times... the problems are coming back!!! Stretching, yoga, sports that relax the spine help in my opinion... and it's even more ""fun"" than an operation! (all written here is my experience or the experience of my interlocutors) <p/> In my opinion, besides the stretching of the spine, the fact that playing sports moves the muscles that support the spine is also a big factor here. Marko <p/> I agree! That's my opinion too, but somehow I forgot to mention... <p/> Thanks for all the tips. The stretching table was suggested to me by a yogi a week or so ago and the stuff should be able to help. The problem is that I live in a block of flats and have limited space. Ever since yogo suggested it I have been thinking about what to throw out of the flat to make room for a table. Today I am on my fourth day of therapy and I have to admit that I have gained flexibility and I don't feel pain anymore. <p/> problematiks wrote:I really don't know what the problem is here.Bos did go to visit his mother, didn't he? Marko <p/> He had problems. 2x. The first time I got dirty with one of the exercises from aktivni.si, and when it was over, and the exercises were over, I got cut again. This time worse. I found some other exercises on the net that are a bit of a stretch, a bit for strength, ..., but from the beginning the dogs hurt, but it got better quickly. Now I do them occasionally, and sometimes (not during the exercises) I feel my back, but no problems. I can cycle, walk, ski, but it hurts when I swim or run (I get more discomfort, but I'd better stop) or carry heavier things (say, a bundle of raden in one hand). Lifting is not a problem. The injury occurs between the ages of 25 and 40 in about 90% of the population. The sheath is already hard, but the inside is still soft. Because of weak small spinal muscles, the spine collapses, and a ""bulge"" forms on the disc, which presses on the nerve. These muscles can only be trained with specific exercises, Kegels are very effective, and there are many on the net. I've put these in a pdf, if anyone wants it I'll mail it to them. Maybe it helps someone else, it helped me. http://www.aktivni.si/zdravje/sedite-na ... ani-bombi/",Forum,train
854,"Text taken from the novel Three Reasons, page 220. The computer displays images inaudibly and lights flash on the titanium case. Where the light burns long at night, there are ideas. And that, we know, is wrong, heretical ... and dangerous ... <p/> There are no powerful plots in the novel, and it is nothing like The Da Vinci Code, I say to those who, like the writer, had trouble with that book and barely made it to the end. There is a chronological account of the various events in The Three Reasons. It is more like this. And in fact, in film, if you like, and literature, there are few things as dramatic as real life. Even though we all know life, it still tells us something new and special every day. And it is always more interesting to write about. The novel Three Reasons is a humorous slice of a year in the life of a mother of two Lilliputians, a wife and an interesting young woman. <p/> The story introduces different people through a first-person narrative (Xenia's). The negative Vlasta, the careerist Darja, the smeared Nika and the unhappy Veronika, Xenia's family and a wider circle of acquaintances through whom she paints her unusual images. Unlike many other authors, she takes refuge in reality at critical points, or so I understood her. This is very unusual. The author does not come across as naïve at all, I would rather say fresh and youthful. Despite her experience, she has, in my opinion, almost too much confidence in her environment and in other people. How damn wrong she is, she is yet to find out. Her whole generation will find that out. There can be no doubt about that. She is only distrustful of her partner, who probably of all people loves and respects her the most. That does not surprise me one bit. All the women I know are like that. <p/> Without a single exception. :) <p/> There is humour in Three Reasons, too. Good and beautifully written. We can laugh at Alexandra in many places. I found myself laughing the most when she describes the passionate lovemaking where Xenia and Marko have earned their butts on their heads on the same shelf. They switched positions, there is no doubt about that. Whether it was when her phone fell into a puddle or when she met her boyfriend from the machine. <p/> This is how she describes her weighing and makes fun of the fashion commandments. With the rarely seen self-irony of a woman with a slightly damaged self-esteem, which at the end very smoothly turns into a sympathetic sarcasm: <p/> I stripped naked to make the result as accurate as possible. I went to pee earlier, so that I wouldn't suffer at the expense of a few unnecessary grams. And then the fatal step. The thin plate seemed to be groaning under my weight. I blinked, told myself once again that the result didn't matter because I'd fix it soon anyway, then opened my eyes and looked down. 69 kilos. The dreaded seven was damn close. My stomach clenched, I immediately got down and then stepped on the scales again. Don't ever do that unless you're too skinny! I jumped down like I'd been burnt by nettles and resisted the instinctive urge to try again - maybe the result would be more normal after all, like a cute 62. It was clear that the scale was sensing my torment and deliberately adding salt to my tired bones. <p/> Through self-irony, she also makes a rueful mockery of a world in which Barbies are the ideal of feminine beauty, and things like that. <p/> Those Barbies you can talk to like you can talk to the telly ... :) <p/> 3. <p/> Language is special. It's self-described and not inspired by anyone. It's a little bit like Gosposvetsko polje, it's just more modern and quite unusual. It is apparent that Aleksandra also writes poetry, quite well, in the opinion of those in the know, to put it casually. The language is innovative in describing contemporary things and interspersed with less familiar words for decoration and delicacy. Sometimes even too much, even with paediatric and other medical terms. I did not understand it yet, but I studied medicine. Don't believe me? I really did, only that was a long time ago, when I was in the seventh grade of an eight-year school. Even then I was very talented, although not much appreciated, and only one classmate had any understanding for my studies. I read the medical encyclopaedia, all the entries on A and B. And I had the symptoms of all those diseases. Except for white current, or I didn't know how to recognise it in the first year. So I dropped out of that study. For health reasons, mostly. :) The structure of the text itself is also quite strange. The beginning and the end of the novel are symmetrical, the same words are repeated. The mantra of the three reasons appears throughout the text, which is why it's like a kind of theme or a literary musical theme. There are other structural and stylistic elements, but they are not the most essential for an amateur's experience and understanding of the content. That is why I leave them to the experts, so that they have something to write about. <p/> It is quite a good text. Will it win any prizes? I am thinking. Hardly. Just because it is written by a young woman, it doesn't stand much of a chance. Although ... Still, there's something going on with these awards. Something heretical. Something they're stirring up over there now, bossing and changing. That's good. At least that's what I was thinking on the Rožnik, listening to the cute Combine singing a song. The lyrics were written by Moss, in case you didn't know. That Vojnović gets more votes than Jančar? That is something! For Vojnović, of course. A little less for Jančar. That is heretical and different from what it was. So that the faces in the boxes sometimes get mixed up. That is also the point. To have something fresh for the daily news and not just last year's news. I have not read these two books to this day. I have no time. Except for a little bit in the sublist. If anything, I prefer to read Lainsztek and Mazzini. Or poetry, if I don't have anything more clever to do. <p/> For all these reasons, I hope that Alexandra has a chance with Three Reasons. She could do with some kind of prize, probably more than the aforementioned authors. And no one would be too much of a fool. They wouldn't have anything to bullshit about, at least in my opinion. There are more than three reasons for that, too. And her thirtieth anniversary is coming up soon, because she's in quite a hurry. Already at the age of four ... :) <p/> I would also like to draw attention to a particular atmosphere that emanates from the text. It seems Bulgakovian to me, although I can't explain it very well. There are no communist apparatchiks, and nobody's head is cut off by a tram. But there is something there, if not I would not feel it. Only, I cannot say it very well, because I am just a lover of literature and I am writing my opinion here mainly for you to pick up the book. <p/> That is all it is really about.",Review,train

857,"Sports hall completed <p/> After twenty-five years of work, a new multi-purpose sports hall has been completed in Mengeš, which will be used by schoolchildren in the morning and by associations and other citizens in the afternoon and evening. It will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall cost €4.5 million and Mengeš also obtained a grant for the investment. <p/> Mengeš - The multi-purpose sports hall, located next to the Mengeš Primary School, is almost complete after a year since the foundation stone was laid last June. These days, workers are sanding and varnishing the parquet flooring, while minor landscaping work is being carried out on the external areas. <p/> According to the Director of the Mengeš Municipal Administration, Urban Kolar, a technical inspection will be carried out on Thursday and the hall will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall, together with the outdoor playgrounds and the athletics track with tartan and climbing wall inside, will primarily be used for sports lessons and other leisure activities of the Mengeš Primary School, but other local associations and citizens will also be able to use the hall in the afternoons and evenings. ""I don't think it is a question of whether it will be occupied or not. There is also a lot of interest from associations and individuals from the surrounding municipalities. I think we could easily fill the dates, even if we had another hall,"" says Kolar, who is particularly pleased that the municipal administration has managed to carry out such a large investment without taking out a loan, thanks to the grants they have received. The EcoFund contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility, five hundred thousand were obtained from the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, and a further 65 thousand from the Foundation for Sport.The EcoFund has also contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility. The contract value of the hall is €4.5 million, it was built by Graditelj from Kamnik, with whom Mengeš was very satisfied, and the interior fittings, worth €660 thousand, are being installed by Elan Inventa. <p/> The construction of the new sports hall will free up the current gym of the primary school, which is to be converted into a kitchen and dining room, as well as four additional classrooms. ""With almost nine hundred pupils, Mengeška Primary School is one of the largest in Slovenia. The municipality has already solved the space problem in the past by building extensions, first to the west, then to the east, and now the third phase, the reconstruction of the school gym, is on the cards,"" says Kolar, who adds that the procedures have already started, but it is too early to talk about the amount of the investment, as they need to get the designers' estimates first. The municipality will certainly have to take out a loan for the investment. <p/> The redevelopment of the gymnasium is therefore the final stage in solving the school's space problem, which will ensure that Mengeš has enough classroom capacity for the next few years. However, given that the immigration trend in the municipality is quite high and the population could easily grow from the current 8200 to tens of thousands or more in the next few years, any future space needs of the school will have to be solved by setting up a new primary school or a branch, Kolar believes.",News/Reporting,train
858,"In the media <p/> Book Heroes, Spiritually Responsible vs Spiritually Comfortable <p/> The anthropological-philosophical reflection Heroes begins with a chapter on the development of spiritual thought in the light of dualisms, such as the parallel or intertwined path of material and spiritual science, by the author Dr Lucija Mulej Mlakar. In doing so, she touches on the area of spiritual growth, which should not become a field of contradictions, as is often the case when self-proclaimed ""gurus"" take on the task of the personal growth of their followers, who in turn uncritically imitate them. The spiritual quest has its own psychopathology, which it points out even with fictitious examples such as preoccupation with appearances, calculating, easy and comfortable, or wrong attitudes towards possessions, education, etc. These seemingly clichéd truths for ""spiritual seekers"" are presented in a new and original way in the book. Through chapters on the dimension of time, the history of the heart and the integration of intelligences, the author introduces interesting ideas: time holes and time pockets, concavity and convexity of memory, generational codes or a new look at the traditional philosophy of personal time and personal karma. The ""dark night of the soul"", as she calls the inconsolable suffering, could be illuminated with the help of her guidance and her book Heroes.

859,"How many billions of euros are sticking out of our banking hole? <p/> Have we filled Slovenia's banking hole with too many billions? A billion too much is said to have been spent on the biggest bank alone <p/> If some economists, bankers and even forensic experts are to be believed, Slovenia's banking hole was actually too shallow for all the billions of taxpayers' money that have leaked into it. According to some estimates, a billion euros too much was spent on the rehabilitation of the largest bank alone. And all the mistakes in the bank bail-out are estimated to have cost at least a meagre three billion euros. Despite the European warnings, the banking hole will be open for domestic auditors to dig into. But only on a limited basis, as some documents will not be accessible to the domestic umbrella banks. The average citizen, who could have spent his or her investment in bank recovery on, say, a nice luxury exotic trip, will have to be content with these (limited) findings. <p/> The banking hole has been the subject of years of work by bankers, politicians, criminals and, last but not least, ordinary citizens. How could it not, since the last bailout of the banks in 2013 was so ""fat"" that it simply cannot be ""swallowed"". A good €3 billion cost taxpayers the last bank bailout four years ago. And it is precisely because of concerns and allegations that the whole bail-out was oversized by billions of euros that people want an epilogue to this story. Probably no one in Slovenia is counting on the kind of conclusion that the Icelanders have written in their banking story. This country of just over 300 000 inhabitants has become a model for the Western world in terms of how to prosecute criminal practices in the banking sector, with the imprisonment of 30 bankers and financiers who were responsible for the collapse of three banks in 2008. Time will have to tell how we will conclude the story at home. <p/> Where did the billions go? <p/> In 2013, many people believed that a big taxpayer bailout of the banks was really needed. Every last cent. This is what bankers, not just domestic bankers, but also European bankers, those from the European Central Bank, the central financial institution in the euro area, were convincing citizens. And if Boštjan Jazbec, Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, said at the time that ""Slovenian banks will be among the better capitalised in the euro area after the recapitalisation"", the laity could not doubt it. <p/> What actually happened? At the end of 2012, when speculations started to emerge that Slovenia would have to ask for international help because of the bad debts Slovenian banks had accumulated, the Parliament opened the door wider for the Bank of Slovenia to intervene in ailing banks with an amended Banking Act. Less than a year later, the Bank of Slovenia, together with the Ministry of Finance, ordered asset quality reviews and stress tests for NLB, NKBM and Abanka and, under special conditions, for Banka Celje, Gorenjska banka, Probanka, Factor banka, Unicredit banka ' Slovenija, Hypo Alpe Adria Bank and Raiffeisen banka. The quality review was carried out by Deloitte and EY and the stress tests by Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger. <p/> The estimates showed that the capital shortfall in the banks reviewed in the worst case scenario would be almost €5 billion and that €3 billion would be needed to recapitalise NLB, NKBM and Abanka. We taxpayers have ""paid for"" these, not only with taxpayers' money, but also by expropriating the holders of subordinated bonds and shares in the nationalised banks. Small shareholders - according to the Association of Small Shareholders, some 100,000 shareholders and 2,000 subordinated bondholders with €600 million in assets, some half a million savers in pension, management and insurance companies, as well as many companies and municipalities - protested and sought legal solutions. The Constitutional Court, even after responses from Europe, ruled that parts of the banking legislation that allowed for the forced deletion of qualifying liabilities did not contravene the Constitution and did not interfere with the right to private property. However, it is unconstitutional that the legislation failed to provide effective judicial protection to those affected. The Court therefore ordered the National Assembly to remedy the unconstitutionality within six months and ordered the suspension of the limitation period for claims for damages. <p/> Too much money in the banks <p/> Soon there were rumours that we had put too much money in the banks after all. Already two years ago, an unnamed Bank of Slovenia official told Finance that the data underlying the Bank of Slovenia's actions in the then nationalised banks were allegedly manipulated and the banks overcapitalised. Last year, a criminal investigation was launched in connection with the bank bail-outs, where the Bank of Slovenia, NLB and the auditing firms Ernst & Young and Deloitte came under scrutiny. The proposal for an investigation order published earlier this year, however, brought familiar accusations and arguments that have been coming from expropriated small shareholders and holders of subordinated liabilities since the banks were nationalised and rehabilitated at the end of 2013. The basic dilemma is, insofar as it is possible to understand the complex facts, that the picture of the banking portfolio was still positive in mid-2013, but that, after reassessments after only a few months, a deep banking hole had opened up, which is why, four years ago, we offered the banks a three-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion bail-out. That is to say, that the whole bank bail-out was tailor-made so that the holders of subordinated bonds lost everything in it. And that the capital shortfall in Slovenian banks could perhaps have been estimated much lower at the time. <p/> As reported in the Slovenian media, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Boštjan Jazbec, the former Vice-Governors Stanislava Caprirola and Janez Fabijan, and Tomaž Čemažar of the Central Bank have been accused of abuse of official position. The prosecution's thesis was that they were aware that the reports on the state of the NLB were not made in accordance with the rules and on an acceptable basis, and therefore there was no legal basis for the extraordinary measures at the NLB.<p/> The fact that the size of the banking hole was oversized was confirmed to the DZ Commission of Inquiry by Andrej Hazabent, a former member of the Management Board of the NLB, who estimated that a billion too much money had been invested in the NLB alone.<p/> The Commission of Inquiry was also told that the size of the hole had been oversized. Among other things, he told the commission that NLB's operating profit was falling, ""so it comes from the unwinding of over-provisioning. If the transfer resulted in a loss of €500 million, the rehabilitation of NLB is estimated at €1.6 billion, a billion too much, when €1.1 billion is paid in"", he outlined. <p/> In the middle of last month, however, the newspaper Delo revealed a study by economist Veljko Bolet, who calculated that the banking hole was oversized by several billion euros. <p/>Obstacles from Europe <p/> The answers and facts about the banking hole will therefore have to wait. It remains to be seen whether the real numbers will ever crystallise. The public prosecutors immediately came under pressure for illegal activities in the collection of information in the banks. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), protested last year about what he considered to be the illegal confiscation of information by the ECB. The ECB has also taken the matter to the Constitutional Court over the confiscation of its files in the context of the criminal investigation. The Bank of Slovenia has already lodged a constitutional complaint against the order itself. <p/> A few weeks ago, the European Commission decided to send Slovenia a first warning letter under the infringement procedure in relation to the seizure of ECB information in the context of a criminal investigation into the Bank of Slovenia in July last year. <p/> Meanwhile, the Slovenian government has decided to amend the Banking Act to allow the Court of Auditors to assess the efficiency and regularity of the Bank of Slovenia's operations and the decisions that led to the use of public funds. But to a limited extent. In particular, the State Auditors will not be allowed to audit the implementation of monetary policy, the application and interpretation of law and supervisory practices, and will not be allowed to interfere with the powers exercised by the Bank of Slovenia as an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Nor will the Court of Auditors be able to impose corrective measures on the Bank of Slovenia or to call for the dismissal of the Governor. <p/> The Court of Auditors has already pointed out that in order to give an opinion on the Bank's operations, it needs to see all the documentation, and the Court of Auditors' first president, Tomaž Vesel, has even said that ""it is not appropriate for the Bank of Slovenia or the ECB, of which Sanka Slovenije is a part, to be able to decide which documentation should be reviewed and which should not be reviewed in a directional manner. However, strict restrictions on the timing of the public disclosure of the findings on these documents are understandable"". <p/> Since the amended law granting the Court of Auditors these powers is not due to enter into force until next year, the epilogue on the banking hole will probably have to wait for some time.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

869,"What do you need to know about sunglasses? <p/> Choose sunglasses that look great and protect your eyes at the same time... <p/> The wide range of sunglasses in all styles, prices and characteristics can make it difficult to decide which pair of sunglasses is best for you. Finding a pair of sunglasses you like may be easier if you read now about what to look out for and what types of sunglasses are out there. What should you look for in a pair of sunglasses? Three important things: quality eye protection, comfort and fantastic style. <p/> Put UV protection on the list of characteristics you look for in sunglasses <p/> Your sunglasses should offer protection against ultraviolet radiation, a component of the sun that increases the chance of sun damage. The FDA, the government agency that oversees the manufacture and sale of sunglasses in the US, recommends that you look for sunglasses with lenses that block 99-100% of UVA and UVB radiation. The label should say either UV 400 or 100% UV protection. <p/> Lens materials in sunglasses The difference between the lens materials on sunglasses is quite small. Some surfaces are harder than others, some types are more durable. Three materials are most commonly used for sunglass lenses: - polycarbonate; long-lasting lightweight plastic. - CR-39; a plastic usually used in lenses of a prescribed quality. - Glass; durable or much heavier to wear. <p/> Sunglass lens colour and other layers <p/> UV filter is one of the layers that make up the lenses of sunglasses, but there are many others besides. <p/> Sunglass lens colour The colour of the lenses serves to absorb the light that passes through them. The colour you choose is a matter of personal taste, but you should take into account a few important features related to the colour of the lenses. - The grey colour of the lenses reduces the amount of light and at the same time does not distort the colours. - Brown and amber reduce glare, including the glare created by the blue frequency in the Sun, which can make objects look hazy. Brown and amber lenses distort colours more than grey. - Yellow lenses reduce the blur caused by blue light better than brown, sharpening vision but causing colour distortion. <p/> - Green tints in lenses reduce glare and help filter out some blue light. They offer good contrast between objects. - Pink lenses might be a good choice if you participate in water sports or other outdoor activities, as they offer good contrast between objects on a blue or green background. <p/> Sunglasses with polarised lenses The polarised layer on the lenses reduces the glare that occurs when light is reflected off certain objects such as water, asphalt and other similar surfaces. Polarised lenses are recommended, but the choice is still yours. <p/> Make sure your glasses have scratch protection A thin layer can be applied to the lenses to make them more scratch resistant. Plastic lenses scratch more easily than glass lenses. <p/> Sunglasses with mirrored lenses <p/> Some sunglasses have a mirrored surface on the outside of the lens. Although they are very popular, scratches can appear on them very quickly. <p/> Sunglasses with photochromic lenses Photochromic (or photosensitive) lenses become darker when exposed to UV radiation. The change happens quickly when you swap the darker surroundings for a lighter one. <p/> Sunglasses with an anti-reflective layer An anti-reflective layer reduces the reflection of light hitting the back of the lens, thereby protecting the rays from reflecting into the eyes. <p/> Sunglasses frame shapes <p/> Sunglasses frames are made from plastic, base metals, titanium, aluminium and many other materials. You should try different types of frames to get a feel for their weight and decide which ones suit you best. <p/> Children also need sunglasses When buying sunglasses for children, be aware that children also need protection against UV rays and glare. Forget those little toy sunglasses; buy something that will really protect your child's eyes. <p/> Sunglasses with extra eye protection - The lenses of custom-made sunglasses keep out more light and UV radiation than ordinary lenses. - Wear a hat for more protection against the sun. This will help keep your skin looking young and healthy. Experts say that the less we squint, the fewer wrinkles we have. <p/> Choose sunglasses that suit your style Sunglasses styles change every year, just like any other fashion, but there's such a wide range that no pair of glasses can go out of style. And sunglasses don't have to be expensive to be effective, so you don't need to buy a whole new collection. Designer and specialised sunglasses have a higher price tag than most other glasses, apart from those used for sports, but you can find all kinds of modern eyewear at affordable and accessible prices. It is just important to look out for the UV label. If you already know what frame shape suits you best, go to the store and try on different styles of glasses. If you get permission, you can also take them for a walk outside to see how the glasses actually perform in practice. <p/> News",Instruction,train

Everyone has a few events in their life that they would like to remember, whether it's the confirmation of their children, their marriage to their partner, celebrating their father's birthday, a work party or any other celebration. These events can be remembered through photographs, but even better are videos. Nowadays, almost all small devices can record. These recordings are of course satisfactory, but for events such as weddings or something similar, it is better to have a recording team that is professionally involved. <p/> Recording weddings usually takes place from the morning until late in the evening. Usually two cameramen are present at the wedding to record the event from several angles. Filming starts in the morning, with the two cameramen recording the preparations of the bride and groom, the various customs, the wedding in the church and registry office, the entertainment, the dancing and everything else that goes along with it. Filming weddings is not an easy task, the cameramen try to capture as many events as possible while remaining inconspicuous.

Since it is fat soluble, it is recommended to consume it with some fat. When consumed, it is slowly converted in the body into vitamin A in the liver and also has antioxidant properties. The body converts it as needed, but in children this conversion is not as extensive as in adults, so vitamin A deficiency can occur. It plays an indispensable role in bone growth and building, skin repair, good eyesight, reproduction and is an extremely powerful stimulant of the immune system. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, eye problems, problems with blood formation, diarrhoea, skin diseases, susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Night blindness can develop into severe visual impairment. <p/>Who we recommend it for: <p/> To people who want to maintain good eyesight <p/> Before going on holiday to prepare the skin for sun exposure, and to anyone who wants to keep their tanned complexion a little longer <p/> To people who are deficient in Vitamin A <p/> Beta Carotene for good eyesight <p/> Beta Carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A; it can be converted by the human body into Vitamin A according to need. Vitamin A is a building block of the retina, an essential part of our eyes with an indispensable role in maintaining good vision. Vitamin A also contributes to the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes and healthy skin. <p/> Benefits of vitamin A <p/> As a powerful antioxidant, vitamin A protects the brain from premature deterioration, protects against the effects of UV rays and strengthens the immune system. The need for this vitamin is greatly increased in all intestinal diseases with consequent impaired absorption, chronic diseases and exhaustion. As it also protects the skin well against the sun, it is recommended to take it during sunbathing. <p/> It is recommended to start taking beta-carotenes at least 2-4 weeks before prolonged sun exposure and to continue during the sunbathing period, together with the use of a sunscreen with an appropriate SPF. <p/>Warning: The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. A food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. Keep out of reach of children! Store at temperatures up to 25 oC, protected from moisture and light. <p/>Warning: Smokers and persons working with asbestos should consult a doctor before use. Beta carotene is not a substitute for external UV protection. Prolonged use of high doses of beta carotene may cause staining of the hands and feet, which is perfectly normal and disappears after discontinuation of the supplement.",Promotion of a Product,train

I have opened the key and looked for any cold spots, but everything looks fine. I would be grateful for any advice. Kind regards. <p/> What now, did you or did you not format it? If you have formatted it successfully then use programs ala Recuva, PCInspector FileRecovery, etc. If the explorer sees it (that it has a letter assigned to it e.g. X) then do a chkdsk in the Command Prompt window with the command: chkdsk x: /f If the format didn't go through then let me know what you report! Do you see it in DiskManagement? Give me a picture. Format it with Rufus (choose fast format, of course). Then save the data. Which OS do you have? Try in the second, third usb2.0 port and not the usb3.0 port, etc. <p/> I haven't formatted it because it won't let me. If I press cancel nothing actually happens, but the cloud recommending formatting keeps flashing at 2 second intervals. If I open the ""task manager"" and look at what is going on at that time, all I see is the same application multiplying. This multiplication starts the moment I connect the USB to the computer and ends when I switch it off. Everything I have described is happening to me on Win 7 Ultimate. I have also tried it on XP. There the matter behaves slightly differently. I don't get any warning when I plug in the key. The computer detects the key, but when I try to open it, I get a warning that the key needs to be formatted. I didn't do this in XP, but I'll try it there as you advised. <p/> So, to continue from my last post in this thread. I have tried to format the key with the aforementioned Rufus program on both OSes (Windows 7 Ultimate and XP), but to no avail. I also tried running the key on all possible USB ports as you advised. The case behaves as follows. When I connect the key to my computer and open Rufus, the window from this program starts flashing at 2 second intervals. Nevertheless, it allows me to select ""quick format"". Then I start the formatting and after a good second the message ""FAILED"" appears in the bottom frame of Rufus and in an additional cloud ""Error: Error while partitioning drive"". I tried to save the data with Wondershare's File scavenger. When I started the scan, it displayed ""No relevant data found! Please click Options on the right top and unselect Only scan unused sectors when scanning. Then try to scan again"". I also heeded this warning and repeated the scan. Unfortunately still no success. I also tried CMD's ""chkdsk"" command, but it says ""The type of the file system is RAW. Chkdsk is not available for RAW drives"". <p/> I assume the USB stick size is showing wrong or 0. In this case it is not possible to format in low level format or any other format. All you need is to download the chipgenius program: http://www.usbdev.ru/files/chipgenius/ It reads the USB stick, with a bit of luck tells you which controller it is and where to get the controller reset tool. If not, you can find the tool on the net via vid and pid number. All other attempts to format will be futile and a waste of time. <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> If I try to format a key with File scavenger, it shows me the size of its memory, but next to it it says Unlocated partition. If I insert a healthy key into the computer, it usually says ""Drive F"". <p/> Since the first post, I'm still waiting for an answer as to what DiskManagement sees... But ok, now you've come up with the word RAW yourself, which would be obvious from the DiskManagement image. And usually a right click on that grey box is enough to initialize the whole partition/size of the stick then the quick format and data rescue goes better with all the programs listed.

922,"Ombudsman <p/> ČP <p/> Consistency in responding and length of inspection procedures also at local level remains a problem <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia found that the Inter-municipal Inspectorate of the Joint Municipal Administration - 5G violated the principle of good administration by failing to respond to the petitioner, who had submitted several reports to it, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation on Administrative Operations, and by inexplicably failing to follow up on the petitioner's request for a tailored method of communication. The inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the reply of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which the Ombudsman considers to be an unacceptable length of time. Both the inspection procedure concerning the petitioner's first and second complaint are still pending. <p/> * * * * <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (the Ombudsman) dealt with the petitioner's petition concerning the alleged pollution of her property with various sewage and waste. The petitioner informed the Ombudsman that she addressed her letters and complaints to, inter alia, the Municipality of Škofljica (the Municipality) and the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate and Redarstvo of the Municipalities of Grosuplje, Ig and Škofljica (the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate).The tasks of the Inter-Munial Inspectorate were in the meantime taken over by the Joint Municipal Administration 5G, within which the current Inter-Munial Inspectorate operates. <p/> The Ombudsman has not found any irregularities in the conduct of the Municipality, which received the petitioner's communication for information only and therefore did not respond to it. <p/> According to the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate, it received the petitioner's complaint on 24 June 2019 regarding the pollution of her property with waste water allegedly caused by the owners of neighbouring properties, and an inspection was to be carried out on 22 June 2020, but it has not yet informed the petitioner of its findings pursuant to Article 24 of the Inspection Control Act (ICA). He is expected to do so at the end of the procedure, which leads the Ombudsman to conclude that the inspection procedure has not yet been completed. <p/> In the past year, the petitioner submitted two reports to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate. The first report, concerning construction waste dumped on her property, was received by the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate from the Ljubljana-Vič Police Station on 19 May 2020. The Inter-Municipal Inspectorate referred this report to the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for the Environment and Spatial Planning (IRSOP), which informed the petitioner and the Ombudsman. A second complaint by the petitioner concerning the alteration of nature trails was received by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate on 27 May 2020 and referred to the IRSOP. An inspection has not yet been carried out in this respect. <p/> Taking into account all available documentation, the Ombudsman found that the inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the Inter-municipal Inspectorate's reply to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which we considered to be unacceptably late. We pointed out to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate that, while it is true that, in accordance with Article 4 of the CPC, inspectors are independent in carrying out inspection tasks within the scope of their powers and that inspection procedures are (primarily) procedures in the public interest, this does not in itself justify significant delays such as those experienced in the specific case. We have also clarified that Article 24 of the CPC does not constitute an obstacle to the inspector informing the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage in the light of the principle of good administration, nor does it relieve the inspector of his obligation based on the provision of the first proviso to Article 17(1) of the CPC to inform the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage. The Inspector is not under any obligation under Article 17 of the Administrative Procedure Regulation (APR), according to which the authority is obliged to reply to all correspondence from which it can be inferred that the authority expects a reply and the identity of the sender, unless the content of the correspondence relates to a procedure pending before the authority, the correspondence is vexatious, or the authority has already replied to the sender on a substantially similar issue. The Authority is obliged to reply, in accordance with the second paragraph of that Article, no later than 15 days after receipt of the document, to the address indicated in the letter. On the basis of the reply received from the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, we conclude that the petitioner did not receive such a notification. In addition to the above, the Ombudsman also noted that, although the Inter-municipal Inspectorate had informed the petitioner of its decision to withdraw the notification to the IRSOP, it had not followed her request for an adapted method of communication. After further enquiries by the Ombudsman, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate agreed that, in accordance with the UUP, it should have dealt with the cases as quickly as possible and replied to all correspondence within 15 days. However, in his opinion, this is not always possible, mainly due to the large number of reports received, the work priorities, as well as the prolonged sick leave. He stressed that the risk assessment, the public interest and the nature of the infringement must be taken into account when dealing with reports, the conduct of inspection procedures and the criteria for setting priorities, and was aware that this was not a sufficient justification. As regards the follow-up of the procedure, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate stated that it had been in contact with the petitioner by telephone and that a joint field visit would be carried out as soon as possible in the light of the petitioner's possibilities. <p/> The Ombudsman considered the response of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, assuming the veracity of its allegations, to be adequate, but at the same time expressed doubts that a positive development in the specific case would have taken place even without its intervention. The Ombudsman has been drawing attention to the lengthy nature of inspection procedures at both national and local level for many years, but unfortunately, despite the Ombudsman's repeated appeals, progress cannot be assessed as satisfactory. In any case, the large number of cases handled by the average inspector cannot be ignored, taking into account the already chronic staff shortage in all inspectorates. This does not, of course, in itself justify the lengthy decision-making process in this case and in many others. <p/> In conclusion, the Ombudsman expressed the expectation that, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate would conclude both inspection proceedings within a reasonable time and that it would inform the petitioner of its findings in a manner that would be appropriate for her, at the latest at the end of the proceedings. The Ombudsman considers the present petition to be well-founded and has found a breach of the principle of good administration.",Legal/Regulation,train
923,"The EPAR (European Public Assessment Report) lists VAED as an important potential risk to be monitored and reported. Neither is implemented in Slovenia, because doctors were not informed about it during the training sessions (and afterwards). <p/> VAED (Vaccine associated enhancement of disease) has been a major obstacle in the development of SARS and MERS coronavirus vaccines, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and some other vaccines against infectious agents. <p/> It is an immunological phenomenon, mediated by antibodies or immune cells, which causes a vaccinated person to become ill, often more severely than an unvaccinated person, after coming into contact with a wild virus. <p/> This phenomenon has caused illness and death in laboratory animals in the past. In the late 1970s, the RSV vaccine caused severe illness and even death in vaccinated children. <p/> This immunological phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated by Pfizer-BioNTech because: <p/> a) it did not use the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in preclinical animal studies, but a surrogate virus - with the explanation that it does not have BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3) (EPAR, page 43). The EMA-e reviewer wrote in his report that the use of a surrogate instead of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (in vaccine research) was not even discussed (!!!!). Also, for technical reasons (!!!), the manufacturer did not specify the ratio of neutralising to non-neutralising antibodies - which was also recommended in March 2020 by scientists gathered under the auspices of CEPI, explaining that it is an important 'indicator' of the possibility of VAED in vaccinated people. <p/> b) Phase 2/3 clinical testing was mainly conducted at a time when there was little or no presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the natural environment (the registration study for the provisional authorisation included data from May to the first half of October 2020); therefore, the majority of vaccinated people could not have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, which would have been the only way to test for the possibility of developing VAED in them. The problem of testing the vaccine in the absence of the virus in the natural environment has also been pointed out by scientists in the summer of 2020 <p/> c) From a professional and scientific point of view, given the known problems of the history of coronavirus vaccines, it is therefore only appropriate to include in the registration study (on the basis of which the vaccine received provisional marketing authorisation) data also from the period of increased presence of the virus in the natural environment, i.e. late autumn and winter 2020/2021, when coronavirus infections started to occur again and vaccinees had the opportunity to come into contact with authentic (wild) SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, as noted above, the registration study did not capture this data, but mass vaccination of populations around the world had already begun during the period of re-emergence of the virus. <p/> The EPAR lists VAED as a significant potential risk (page 115). It is stated that the possible occurrence of this complication will continue to be monitored even after the provisional marketing authorisation has been granted. <p/> The Pharmacovigilance (Product Side Effects) Plan states that side effects of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTecha Comirnaty will be tracked through a specific questionnaire, which will also include verification of vaccine ineffectiveness or the occurrence of VAED (page 116). In the section on additional pharmacovigilance activities (page 118, table, study C4591001), it is stated that the occurrence of an imbalance between the vaccinated and the control (unvaccinated) group in the number of cases, especially for the more severe form of the disease, kovid 19, could suggest VAED. The possibility of VAED should be monitored for 2 years after the second dose of vaccine, the EPAR states. <p/>The fact that this is an important immunological phenomenon that may have a detrimental effect on the health of vaccinees is also evident from the peer-reviewed literature. <p/> In March 2020, a group of experts in the field of vaccine and coronavirus immunology gathered under the auspices of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation), also funded by capital and philanthropy, to examine the situation and the opportunities and obstacles to the development of a safe vaccine for coronavirus 19 disease. The problem in developing a vaccine against the 19 metalloid disease was highlighted as the possibility of VAED, in which the vaccine causes a more severe form of the disease if the vaccinated person subsequently becomes infected with a wild virus. They wrote that VAED was first observed in the 1960s in association with an inactivated RSV vaccine. Participants at the meeting recalled a case where the RSV vaccine did not prevent infection and 80% of vaccinated children became so severely ill after contact with wild virus that they required hospital treatment; 2 out of 35 children even died. <p/>It was noted that similar pathology has been described in SARS CoV-1 vaccine candidates (the causative agent of the 2002/2003 SARS pandemic) and that there is concern that similar pathology (particularly in terms of Th2 immunopathology) could occur in humans vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of kovid-19 disease). The possibility of ADE (antibody disease enhancement), another immunological mechanism directly induced by non-neutralising or sub-neutralising antibodies that allow a more efficient entry of the virus into the cells, has also been raised. <p/>They wrote that their findings should guide vaccine manufacturers in the development and testing of vaccine candidates, with the intention of avoiding the risks to humans from the use of vaccines against Covid-19. They also provided very specific guidance on the proper conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and validation of the development of VAEDs. <p/> In April 2020, scientists also discussed and warned in peer-reviewed journals about the possible occurrence of VAED after the use of the vaccine against the disease Kovid-19. They discussed the possibility of disease promotion by both humoral (antibodies - ADE) and cell-mediated (Th2 immunopathology) immunity mechanisms. Prof. Baric, an epidemiologist and expert on coronavirus, thought at the time that Th2 immunopathology would be a bigger problem, as animal models had shown that it was mainly older animals that were at risk; he expressed concern about what this might mean if the vaccine were used in older humans. <p/>We now know that the polio vaccine was first used in the elderly population; and the manufacturer's EPAR shows that the registration study included only 5 people aged 85+ among just over 18,000 vaccinees, and 804 people aged 75+, representing 4.4% of the total vaccinated (page 76, table). Some other scientists were also of the opinion that ADE pathology should not be a major problem and that the reports from China concerning re-infected people were also not suggestive of an ADE problem. <p/> Dr Graham, Executive Director of the Vaccine Development Centre at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), also mentioned the possibility of Th2 immunopathology in particular, and was supported by Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who has worked, among other things, on the development of a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine. Dr Graham expressed concern about Th2 immunopathology, stating that an inappropriate T cell response would stimulate allergy-mediated inflammation and lead to the generation of poorly functional antibodies with consequent formation of immune complexes, leading to complement activation and the damage that could result. <p/> Dr Hotez pointed to the possibility of producing a vaccine on only part of the viral S-protein, i.e. the part that binds to the cellular receptor binding domain (RBD), which could possibly reduce the adverse immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech EPAR shows that the manufacturer also tested the vaccine candidate for the RBD component of the S-protein, which was later abandoned (page 58). Dr Graham, who worked with Moderna on vaccine development, said in April 2020: 'We need to get some answers by next winter to at least be better prepared for the winter of 2021-2022'. Well, the 'vaccine', including Moderna's, had already started to be used en masse 1 year earlier, much earlier than Dr Graham expected to 'get some answers'. <p/> Prof Perlman, an immunologist and microbiologist, said that a special commission had been set up at the WHO to look into the VAED issue. He expected that the commission would be able to report in a few months' time. In April 2020, the WHO and other health experts also stressed that it would take at least a year and a half before the vaccine would be thoroughly tested in both animal models and humans, and only then might it be put into wider, commercial use. In reality, things have been accelerated; within a year of his statement, some 3 billion people have been vaccinated with a poorly tested product called 'vaccine'. <p/> Despite the EMA's warning that VAED is listed as a significant potential risk and that it should be monitored and reported in terms of post-vaccination contracting of the symptoms of metal 19, we doctors were not informed of this during the training sessions on metal 19 vaccines held from December 2020 onwards, we did not receive any (subsequent) notification of this, nor is there a form to report this immunological phenomenon which, as past experience shows, can harm or even endanger the health of those vaccinated. <p/> In April 2020, doctors received an e-mail with an article by Prof Tomažič entitled ""Covid 19: what every doctor should know"". In the article, which is now published on the NIJZ website, on page 7, Prof. Ihan states: ""It is not yet clear what role antibodies play in protecting against the disease. In a few studies, patients with higher antibody production had worse outcomes - this could indicate the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). A similar phenomenon has been described in MERS, where neutralising antibodies (directed against the viral receptor) promoted viral entry into cells. Until we know the mechanisms of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development will be more speculation than science."" <p/> The problem of VAED is therefore also known to vaccine experts in Slovenia. However, it was not brought to our attention during the training sessions on metalloid vaccines, nor were we presented with the problems of the development of past coronavirus vaccines. We have been wondering why this is so for some time. Why VAED is not recorded in Slovenia is also not clear to us. This is, however, prescribed in the EPAR issued by the EMA. Despite the ISZ's appeal to the JAZMP and the NIJZ, nothing has changed in the recording of this phenomenon. <p/> The way in which VAED is checked in the manufacturer's registration study is very unprofessional. Why? Was the manufacturer 'afraid' of a setback in the development of the vaccine, as we have seen with the other two coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS? Why did the EMA agree to the manufacturer using a surrogate virus (VSV - Vesicular Stomatitis Virus with 'embedded information' for the S-protein; EPAR, page 43) in testing the vaccine's efficacy and safety? How is it possible that someone can produce billions of vaccines against a pandemic virus without using it in pre-clinical studies on the action and side-effects of a 'vaccine' against the virus that causes this pandemic? And on the banal excuse that it does not have BSL3? And how is it possible that the regulator (EMA) finds this acceptable? And that, as the EMA rapporteur states, the use of a replacement virus was not even discussed? And how is it possible that this is acceptable to (even our) vaccination experts, some of whom are also doctors? <p/> Vaccine research with a surrogate virus could be at least as dangerous and irresponsible as a car manufacturer testing the brakes with a machine that measures, for example, the optics of bicycles. Both brakes and optics have a common denominator, the car wheel, but we know very well who is responsible for braking. SARS-CoV-2 and vesicular stomatitis virus also have a common denominator, i.e. they are both viruses, and we know very well which of them is responsible for metalloid-19. <p/> We know from domestic and foreign practice that people become ill with signs of caries after vaccination. It started last winter with vaccinees falling ill in DSOs across Europe. After initial denial of this phenomenon, explanations started to emerge later that the elderly had fallen ill because they had been vaccinated at a stage when they were already infected but not yet symptomatic (asymptomatic); that the vaccine takes time to protect the vaccinee; that the vaccine is not 100% effective. We have listened to claims that the vaccine is made in such a way that it cannot cause cystitis because it does not contain the virus. The latter is true, but what has not been said is that the disease can be caused by an immunological mechanism that can be triggered after the vaccinee comes into contact with a wild virus. VAED could also be triggered in vaccinated elderly by subsequent infection with common coronavirus, explained renowned immunologist and microbiologist Prof. Bhakdi. In the spring, when younger people started getting sick after vaccination, the British (alpha) version of the virus joined the list of culprits. We now see that, despite its presence in up to 90% of the samples analysed, the disease is on the decline. <p/> Recently, we have heard that the delta variant is spreading from India to us; and in some places, the idea that unvaccinated people are to blame for the rise in infections is already germinating. However, the official EPAR states that if there is an increase in the number of cases after vaccination, this could indicate the development of VAED or possibly an ineffective vaccine. Is this even being investigated? <p/>We are hearing explanations that people will fall ill with Chlamydia in the autumn and that 'everyone who is admitted to hospital will be because they have not been vaccinated'. What about VAED in the vaccinated, ladies and gentlemen professors? Have you forgotten about it? You have written about this immunological phenomenon, it has been written about and pointed out by many who work on vaccine development, it is written about by the EMA in its EPAR. <p/> The EMA states that side effects, including VAED, should be monitored and recorded. So why is VAED not monitored and recorded in Slovenia? Why does the NIJZ not have data on how many people who were vaccinated against VAE 19 subsequently contracted VAE? Why is it not possible to see what proportion of hospitalised patients who have contracted kovid-19 are vaccinated? All this would give us important information on possible vaccine-induced disease acceleration that needs to be reported further to the EMA regulator. After all, this is about the safety of our people, our patients! <p/> Why is there silence about VAED? Will the post-vaccination metalloid symptoms be attributed to the new delta variant, which is announced to become widespread in our country in August? Will the silent increase in the number of vaccinees falling ill due to VAED possibly justify closing schools or locking people in their homes next autumn and winter? <p/>What will happen to people who were vaccinated in the spring, who are vaccinated now or who will be vaccinated in the autumn? What will happen after they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses in autumn/winter? Given the known immunological phenomenon, it is to be expected that those vaccinated in autumn/winter could contract a coronavirus. Did this already happen last winter, first after the vaccination of the elderly? Will the delta variant be to blame this winter? Will it be epsilon or some other variant that is on the WHO 'watch list'? <p/>Professor Ihan, you have stated in the Delo that if there is more disease among those who have been vaccinated, an additional, third dose of vaccine will be needed. What about VAED, Professor? Was it mentioned (antibody variant) in the April 2020 article? And also the EMA in the EPAR says that increased morbidity in vaccinees could mean that it is VAED, so characteristic of all failed coronavirus vaccines to date. We suggest that we should be vigilant and make a professional and scientific evaluation of the possible occurrence of VAED in vaccinees. Dear Professors Ihan, Beović, Tomažić, Jerala and Štrukelj: with your approach and interpretations, the epidemic will not end; this autumn and winter, for example, there will be a delta strain, and in the future, perhaps some other strain? For how long? Until we inoculate 7 billion people, as we have been hearing the plans since the summer of 2020 (2:20 min)? <p/> Ladies and gentlemen, professors: is this science? Is this medicine with its principle: above all, do no harm? You are telling us that health and life are paramount. You assure us that all measures are solely for the good of the people. So let us collect data on VAED! We all want to offer people a safe vaccine. <p/> Reportedly, vaccine manufacturers have been given permission to disclose data (unblinded) and offer vaccination (crossover) to the unvaccinated in a registration study after six months. There is therefore a strong possibility that at the expected end of the Phase 3 clinical trial in May 2023, there will not be enough people left in the control group (unvaccinated) to make an objective comparison between the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in terms of side effects and therefore VAED. Will we then have an explanation in 2023 that, because of the lack of a control group, the results are only valid for a period of 6 months after the last dose of vaccine? Also, given the high possibility of the control group 'disappearing', it is all the more important that VAED is monitored and recorded now that mass vaccination of the population is taking place. <p/> How are we going to monitor and report on the development of VAED after vaccination in Slovenia, in accordance with the EMA-e guidance, if you have not informed the medical staff or the people who have been vaccinated about the possibility of VAED? You have not even given them informed consent to sign, informing them that there is a possibility that they may fall ill despite vaccination, and possibly even more seriously than those who have not been vaccinated - because this is a phenomenon that has been known about for a long time, and which was discussed by experts at the beginning of the development of coronavirus vaccines. <p/> We all know that monitoring even the smallest side-effects that could be temporally or causally related to vaccination is very important, including VAED. <p/> All the more so when we recall that the manufacturer drew its conclusions on the safety and efficacy of the product based on a mere 170 metalloid cases (0.47%) among the reported 36423 clinical study participants (EPAR, page 89, table). In fact, 0.884% (162/18325) of the unvaccinated group and 0.044% (8/18198) of the vaccinated group became ill. The difference between the incidence of the unvaccinated and vaccinated, expressed in absolute risk, was only 0.84%. 1 person among the vaccinated and 3 among the unvaccinated developed severe form of pertussis; far too small a difference to draw any meaningful conclusions. And some persons were observed for as long as 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (EPAR, page 90, Table 13). This is also why we need to improve reporting systems, follow the EMA-e guidance and inform healthcare workers, DSO caregivers and vaccinees about VAED. <p/>We are doctors. We are not interested in politics, not in pharmaceutical interests. Our record and opinion is not an opinion against, but an opinion and a vote for; for the safety of our people and for the safe medicines they should receive. The product is called a vaccine, but it is a gene therapy. The safety of our patients and our population is important; and for this we doctors are largely responsible. Caution on the one hand and scepticism on the other, and, above all, the mutual exchange of information and open communication, have always been the cornerstones of progress and improvement in the history of science and medicine, for the benefit of people and patients. And that is what we want to see in this situation. <p/> Related Posts <p/> Medicine has clearly been hijacked, subjugated and abused by politics and ""mega"" capital over the last 16 months.

931,"Which foods are good to eat together and which are not <p/> It is often food combinations that complicate the metabolism. If we don't eat the right combinations, even healthy foods don't help us. <p/> 1. Don't eat protein and starch together Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and protein in one meal. Do not combine bread, rice and cereals with fish, eggs, meat, milk and dairy products. The body needs an alkaline base to process starch and acids to process protein. This combination causes bloating, abdominal pain, indigestion, etc. <p/> 2. Eat protein only with vegetables <p/> 3. Eat starch only with vegetables Combine starchy foods such as rice, potatoes and pasta only with vegetables. <p/> 4. Fruit Eat fruit 2 hours before, or after a meal. Fruit is so special in every way that you will gain the most from digesting it on its own. It is important that fruit triggers the fermentation process, which in combination with other foods can interfere with other metabolic processes. Be careful with melons. Melons are faster to digest than other fruits, so be careful when mixing fruits together. <p/> 5. Don't mix starch and sugar Cookies can be really hard to resist, but when you mix starch and sugar in your mouth, enzymes are secreted to break down the starch, and the sugar makes your body acidic. Acidity slows down the breakdown of starch and you are trapped in an unsolvable digestive loop. <p/> 6. Do not combine milk with anything Pasteurisation destroys the enzymes that stimulate digestion. Milk starts to coagulate when it reaches the stomach and this slows down the digestion of other foods. Of course, this applies only to cow's milk. <p/> 7. Avoid sugar The problem of sweets is even greater because most of us already have a portion of protein, starch and carbohydrates in our stomachs. All of this further complicates digestion. In this case, we like to say that some food is stuck in our stomach, which is actually true, because the metabolic methods are mutually exclusive. You may have heard somewhere that it would be better to eat desserts half an hour before a meal. The benefit would be twofold: a large part of your metabolism would have been done by the time you had your main meal, and you would be less hungry and eat less. <p/> vkj",Instruction,train
932,"After Empire <p/> Why is America now generally perceived as a self-righteous, violent warmonger? How has a country that until recently played a vital role in shaping the international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder? Why is America no longer the world's leading example of liberal democracy, international security and economic prosperity? Is the United States, the world's only surviving superpower, in danger of becoming marginal - of finding itself in a world that no longer needs it? <p/>After Empire, a critically acclaimed European bestseller, is a provocative and ultimately sobering look at America's changing role in the international community. Emmanuel Todd shot to fame when, in his first book, La Chute finale, he accurately predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union by analysing the country's fertility rates, infant mortality rates, marriage rates and literacy rates. Now - with the diagnosis that America's supremacy is weakening, which he made on the basis of demographic and economic factors - Todd offers an interesting re-evaluation of American superiority. <p/> Todd shows that at a time when the rest of the world is finding that it can get along without America - more and more countries are becoming educated, democratic and economically stable - America is slowly realising that it cannot get along without the rest of the world. Burdened by a huge domestic and foreign trade deficit, the falling value of the US dollar, the unexpected bankruptcy of several important companies and the fact that it can no longer support itself with its own production, America is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign money. This dependence is steadily eroding its political and economic influence, which is unprecedented in history. <p/> Readers' views <p/> In 2017, it is no longer possible to talk about a unipolar world order. What seemed unbelievable to the superficial observer in 2014 has become a reality. It is no longer possible to take decisions in the Eurasian area without the involvement of Russia or China. But let us go back a step further. The brief war in 2008, when Georgia sought to annex the separatist republic by force, was one of the first harbingers that the balance of power had changed. The Russian army was still clumsy at the time - compared to the annexation of Crimea - but it defeated the Georgian army, equipped and trained by the Americans, in a mere five days. <p/> In 2008, however great an optimist he was, he could not - however much he wished to - say much good about the Russian economy. Today, Russia has become the largest grain exporter, a self-sufficient food producer, and a force that is reviving and revitalising the automotive, aerospace, petrochemical and electronics industries. It has shown that it can no longer be blackmailed economically. <p/> The book 'After Empire' was published in 2006, but its basic idea must have been laid no later than 2005, when we were all still deeply asleep and unaware of the tectonic changes that were about to take place. One could say that the book was visionary, which makes it an extremely interesting read, because how is it possible that the author could have had a hunch in 2005 - when we were calling the Russian army 'old iron' and making fools of its economics - about the direction in which the world was moving? - Matej P. <p/> A look into the book",Opinion/Argumentation,train

From the client's point of view, empty space seems like a waste of money: ""If I paid for it, shouldn't I use it?"" But from the designer's point of view, it plays a key role in good design. For the viewer, it is also very important, as the white space creates a frame and allows the eye to take in all the elements of the design. There is also the question of how profitable this empty space is. If you just think of the adverts for, for example, Apple. Their adverts usually consist of 2-4 elements simply arranged on a page, allowing the right message to come to the fore.

942,"It happened in the school year 2010/11... <p/> School in nature <p/> Wednesday8 June 2011 <p/> Three days of active and varied activities, despite the bad weather. We spend swimming lessons in the indoor or outdoor saltwater pool. So far we have visited the Bay of the Moon, the Strunjan Salt Pans and Portorož, where we have made our first purchases. We have learnt about the flora and fauna of the seaside and the weather phenomena associated with it. Today we will take a bus to Piran, where we will visit the aquarium and other sights of the city. Then we will take a boat trip to see the underwater world and the typical coastline with cliffs. Tomorrow we will have a swimming skills test and in the evening we will be entertained by the talents from Bistrica. We are happy with the accommodation, the food and the staff, and we are thinking of extending our stay until the end of the school year. A sea greeting to all of you who miss us and are thinking of us. 5th grade students and teachers. <p/> With imagination on the move <p/> Monday23 May 2011 <p/> On Monday 23 May 2011, the pupils of the extended stay and I attended the closing event of the national literary competition ""With imagination on the move"" in Vrhnika. The pupils participated in the competition with the story ""The Paradajzovi"", which you can read on the smar-team.org website (grade level). The pupils' story came in an excellent 4th place. The smar-team publishing house will publish the Paradajzovi story in a stand-alone picture book. The pupils were very enthusiastic and promised to take part in the competition again next year. <p/> Young History Researchers' Meeting <p/> Friday20 May 2011 <p/> On Friday, 20 May, Jasmina Vučko and Aleš Duh took part in the National Young History Researchers' Meeting within the framework of ZPMS and defended their research paper entitled ""They made a mark on our school"". Their assignment was based on the topic ""The Role of Women in the Past"". They performed with flying colours and earned a gold award. Congratulations to both of them and may this be an incentive for them to continue their work. Mentors. In the younger category, Jure Vučko took 4th place. In the most challenging event, the 100 m swim and 1000 m run, Jasmina Vučko from our school won. The best competitors (the top five in each category) will compete in the national triathlon championship in Ljubljana on 5 June, where they will also compete in the cycling event. Congratulations to both. <p/> Sports Spas - A day of movement and socialising for all generations <p/> Saturday14 May 2011 <p/> On Saturday 14 May 2011, the school organised an event called ""A day of socialising and movement for all generations. In beautiful sunny weather and a relaxed atmosphere, we started with a hike, then the participants took part in various workshops: sports elementary games, firefighter games with firefighters, eco workshop, healthy school workshop and a stand of the SVIT ecological centre, and the participants also had the opportunity to have their blood pressure measured. The natural environment, exercise, intergenerational socialising are of great importance for a positive life, so we look forward to such informal meetings with pupils, parents, relatives and others in the future. <p/> European Village <p/> Tuesday10 May 2011 <p/> On Tuesday, 10 May 2011, 13 students attended the European Village event in Murska Sobota's Culture Square. Our stand represented Schönbrunn Castle, where we presented interesting facts about our neighbour. The event was interesting both at the event area and at the stands. We invite you to attend the event again next year. There is always something new going on. <p/> Athletic multi-purpose <p/> Friday6 May 2011 <p/> On Friday, 22 April 2011, we held an athletic multi-purpose. The students of the first grade stayed at the school to compete in the triathlon. The pupils of the upper grades went first on a march to Črenšovce, as they competed in the stadium of the local primary school. The sports day started at 8:00 and the athletics part at 9:00. While the teachers prepared the individual stations, the pupils got ready for the sports activity - warmed up and then started the individual disciplines. The students had no major problems, competed fairly and everything went smoothly in terms of organisation, so we all came back happy. The results are posted on the sports education notice board. <p/> Hike along the river Mura <p/> Thursday5 May 2011 <p/> Thursday, 5 May 2011, after a long winter ""sleep"", was again the day for a hike in our joint PK activity. We went on a flat hike with the students along the river Mura all the way to the ford. On the way we observed the untouched nature, the life in the river, talked a lot, laughed and already planned a mountain plan for the new school year. There was no shortage of ideas, including the idea of fishing after the hike around Bukovnik Lake. When we arrived at the ford, we freshened up with a drink, sat for a while, and then a friendly man took us across the river in a ford. The trail led us all the way to the school, where we arrived at 16:30. In total, 7 pupils took part in the walk, the others, unfortunately, found all sorts of excuses or did not even justify their absence. Mountain greetings. <p/> Handball - regional competition <p/> Thursday21 April 2011 <p/> On 21 April 2011, the pupils who make up the school handball team took part in a regional competition held at the St. Jurij ob Ščavnici Primary School. The regional competition was also attended by the Grad Primary School and the parent school. Our competitors did well against the Grad Primary School, but the home school competitors were slightly better. For the second place, the pupils received medals and a trophy. The pupils were satisfied and can't wait for the next competition season. <p/> Final event of the E-KNJIGA project - HAND IN THE FIST <p/> Friday22 April 2011 <p/> (Source: Ministry of Education) <p/> On Friday 22 April 2011, the final event of the E-KNJIGA project was held. The final event of the nationwide project E-BOOK - SHAKE HAND IN THE FIST was held in Ljubljana on 22 April 2011, where representatives of twenty primary schools (132 e-books were produced in the project) were invited to present their e-books, which, according to the expert jury, had produced the best e-books. Our school was one of them, which we were very pleased about. Congratulations and prizes and awards were presented by Dr. Igor Lukšič, Minister of Education and Sport, and Mr. Dominik S. Černjak, representative of the sponsor of the event. <p/> Creative Workshops <p/> Thursday14 April 2011 <p/> ""I had a nice time!"" said the students who took part in the creative workshops on Thursday 14 April 2011 at our school. We also invited pupils from Odranci Primary School. The teachers of our school prepared a varied programme for them, with six workshops to choose from. In the creative workshop, the pupils created, sewed and glued denim (old jeans). It was also interesting to see how skilful the boys were with their sewing machines. In the music workshop, the pupils played Orff instruments and sang. The art and maths workshop was also interesting, with pupils making polyhedra of different shapes and sizes. Of course, they also made sure that the colours matched. In the sports-computing workshop, pupils tried their hand at long jump and took pictures. They then analysed their footage and made a short film (one of which is below), which they presented to us. The pupils who joined the geography workshop learned about the life and customs of the Indians and their way of life. They also made Indian clothes, got covered in war paint and made a model of a tent. In the microscopy workshop, pupils explored the world beyond the eye's view, including how salt concentration affects the functioning of a cell. <p/> Lendava Choir Festival <p/> Tuesday29 March 2011 <p/> On Tuesday 28 March 2011, we took part in the regional meeting of children's and youth choirs in Lendava with two school choirs. 16 choirs took part in the choir competition, 11 children's choirs and 5 youth choirs, a total of 450 young singers. At 14.00 we met the pupils in the music room, where they received their final instructions and got their hair done, and at 14.30 we were on our way to Lendava. Despite the fact that the rehearsal lasted two and a half hours and that we performed with both choirs in the last half of the event, the students did very well, which was confirmed by the audience. We also received positive feedback from the professional accompanist of the event, Ms Manja Gošnik-Vovk. I think that the festival has a positive value for the pupils, because apart from the fact that the pupils participate in front of such a large audience, thus gaining experience in public performance, the most important thing is that they get to meet their friends from other choirs and enjoy their own and other people's singing. (teacher Miha Kavaš) <p/> New price list <p/> Tuesday28 March 2011 <p/> At its 15th regular meeting, held on Monday 28 March 2011, the Council approved the new price list, which will come into force on 1 April 2011. The new price list is also available here (xls attachment). <p/> Formative monitoring and assessment in sport education <p/> Wednesday23 March 2011 <p/> For the second school year, our school is involved in a formative monitoring and assessment project. This time, on 23 March 2011, the lesson of sports education in grade 6 was conducted in front of the head teacher and other external teachers involved in this project. We were able to identify elements of differentiation and individualisation in the lesson, and the pupils monitored and recorded their own performance, moving around and trying to be critical of their own progress. We also followed the principles of physiological efficiency, instructiveness and presented the exercise in a fun way, with different teaching strategies and monitoring of their knowledge. <p/> Spring concert of three schools in Odranci <p/> Monday21 March 2011 <p/> On Monday, 21 March 2011, we took part in the spring concert of school choirs ""Sunny Song"" at the Odranci Primary School with the Children's Choir (OPZ) and the Youth Choir (MPZ). At 15.30 we took a bus to Odranci, where the concert started at 17.00. Choirs from Odranci Primary School and Franceta Prešeren Primary School in Črenšovci took part in the concert. At the end of the event, all the participating choirs sang together the eco anthem ""The World Around the Sun is Spinning"" to close the concert. After the event, the young singers gathered for a well-deserved snack. The pupils found the concert interesting, as they do not often have the opportunity to showcase their singing skills outside the confines of their home school, and at the same time sing together with around 200 singers from all three schools. <p/> Memorial ceremony in Monostru <p/> Saturday19 March 2011 <p/> On Saturday, 19 March, the students of our school, Larisa, Sergeja and Anja, took part in a memorial ceremony in Monostru. The Committee of the Prekmurje Company and Brigade invited us to commemorate the fallen in World War II. A wreath was laid at the Monostert cemetery for the fallen commander of the Prekmurje Company, Alojz Škerjanc - Mirko. The girls presented a short cultural programme. In today's society, where material goods seem to be more and more important and we often unintentionally forget about values such as camaraderie and loyalty to the homeland, our school tries to preserve the memory of past events and the values of the NOB in this way. <p/> Swimming course <p/> March 2011 <p/> 1st and 3rd grade students had a swimming course in Terme Radenci during the week of 14-18 March 2011.

Fairies, goblins and goblins, they have driven you into the cold tunnels. <p/> With our carnival revelry we have chased away winter. On this day, pupils and teachers dressed up, said a few words about the tradition, introduced themselves to each other, ate delicious doughnuts and paraded around the village. After the carnival procession, we all went together to the neighbouring school, the Franceta Prešeren Primary School in Črenšovci, and together, with pleasant music and a short programme, we had fun together and chose the most beautiful and original masks. <p/> Handball competition <p/> March 2011 <p/> On Friday and Monday, the younger pupils played an inter-municipal handball competition. The girls played against Odranci Primary School and were more successful than their opponents. They showed a good game in defence and attack and deservedly won. The pupils played against Odranci and Velika Polana. The opponents were tougher nuts, so they still have some work to do to qualify for the regional competition. Nevertheless, congratulations to all players and thanks to the fans for their fair cheering. <p/> Saturday School <p/> Saturday5 March 2011 <p/> On Saturday 5 March 2011, we organised a Saturday School to promote the talents of our students. The theme of the Saturday School was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the OF and the 20th anniversary of Slovenian independence. Talented pupils from the third form participated. At the Saturday School, the pupils were given a presentation on the NOB in Prekmurje and then watched a film. This was followed by workshops where pupils made flags, visited a soldier from the Second World War, sang partisan songs and wrote a review of the film. The pupils liked the way they learned at the Saturday School and were very creative. <p/> Tech Day - Traditions of our grandfathers and grandmothers <p/> Thursday18 February 2011 <p/> On Thursday 18 February 2011, Year 6 pupils had a Tech Day entitled Traditions of our grandfathers and grandmothers. On this day they joined us and we spent a pleasant morning together. First we watched how our grandmothers used to spin, Mrs. Vučko showed us how to do it live, then they watched a part of the film Uncles Told Me, which was based on the novel of the same name by Miško Kranjc, and then we talked about the customs of the past - corn and seed husking, feather plucking, feasting, feasting, koline, blacksmithing, grazing ... Of course, we also asked our grandparents what it was like at school. You can see our findings on the second floor of the school, where posters are on display. Finally, we learnt all seventeen stanzas of the song Marko jumče (Marko jumps) and danced the folk dance shamarjanko. It was interesting for everyone and the day went by too quickly. <p/> English + sports education = ? <p/> Thursday10 February 2011 <p/> Is it possible to combine these two subjects?! Of course it can. At Prežihovega Voranca Primary School, we did just that last week, on 10 February 2011. We learned Slovenian in the gym, and of course we exercised there too. As the aim of the lesson was to consolidate and test both Slovenian and sports education, the tasks were differentiated (divided by difficulty) and many formative monitoring elements were included. The pupils thus self-assessed or assessed each other to see how far they were in their learning and knowledge journey. In this way, they developed critical thinking and were able to justify their findings on an ongoing basis. In addition to our headmistress and the seventh-graders, the gym also hosted the headmistresses of fifteen schools in the Pomurje region and the head of the ZRSS for Education, OE Murska Sobota, Ms Irena Kumer. The pupils found this connection very interesting and informative, and above all, they found out what they will need to consolidate before the next examination or assessment. This is certainly not the last lesson that has been carried out in this way, as we believe that a modern school should strive for work that is varied, experiential and lifelong. <p/> Golden Knuckle Competition <p/> Thursday3 February 2011 <p/> Three students from our school took part in the Golden Knuckle Competition at the Radenci Secondary School of Catering and Tourism on Thursday, 3 February 2011. The competition was organised by the Slovenian Tourist Board. Marcel Kocon, Larisa Filip and Katja Šemen competed for our school, and in preparation for the competition we had two more reserves, Niki Cigan and Ines Pozderec, both of whom were sick on the day of the competition. The students prepared chicken breast with cheese, matvezah and a simple red cabbage stew. As it was their first time taking part in the competition, they were well versed in the kitchen. They were successful and won a silver spoon or award. The competition was interesting, they learnt a lot of new things and the socialising with their teammates was also enjoyable. <p/> Chemistry Experiments <p/> Tuesday1 February 2011 <p/> On Tuesday 1 February, we started the elective subject Experiments in Chemistry (PEC). This course is open to students in grades 8 and 9. For the first day we prepared the experiment ""Pharaoh's snake"". We divided into three groups and prepared a real competition. <p/> The biggest Pharaoh's serpent was made by me and Jasmina. We were very impressed and took pictures with it. The other pupils were also successful. They came second and third. (Sergeja Lebar and Jasmina Vučko, 9th grade students) <p/> Sports Day in Maribor <p/> Friday28 January 2011 <p/> Today, 28 January 2011, students from our school went ice skating at the Maribor Ice Arena. The route took us from our school to the motorway, which we quickly followed to reach Maribor. There we made a short hike, had a snack and were able to skate for an hour and a half. Of course, we followed the rules that apply to ice skating. The sports day passed quickly and we came back healthy, a bit exhausted and full of impressions of the sports day. <p/> Winter hike to the Beavers <p/> Saturday22 January 2011 <p/> On Saturday we had a real winter hike to the Beavers. The air temperature was quite low and there was a slight breeze, but we were dressed appropriately (jacket, scarf, hat) and the pace of the walk was quickened, so that after a while we were warm enough. Despite the small number of participants (seven students), we enjoyed our time together and completed the route in 2.5 hours. For homework, the pupils have to describe their feelings on a blog. <p/> In future, it is expected that pupils will apologise in advance for their absence. They may excuse their absence before the march via the online diary. Greetings from the march, teacher Alojz. <p/> Happy birthday, Mr. Anton Törnar! <p/> Friday14 January 2011 <p/> Today, 14 January 2010, the Mayor of our municipality, Mr Anton Törnar, met Abraham. The staff of the kindergarten and the school, together with the children and pupils, would also like to congratulate him and wish him every success in his future endeavours. <p/> Visit to Radio Maxi <p/> Thursday13 January 2011 <p/> Today, the students of the elective course Media Education went to visit the premises of Radio Maxi in Ljutomer. We were welcomed by the friendly Vesna, who explained in detail everything about the radio, and she was helped by the equally friendly Bastino. We spoke live, and also tried our hand at recording, with the help of Mr Bojan. Mrs Jasna also explained how to order advertisements or greeting cards. We enjoyed our visit immensely and learned a lot of new things. The photo below was also taken as a souvenir. <p/> Handball competition <p/> Tuesday7 December 2010 <p/> On Tuesday, 7 December 2010, a handball competition for older pupils took place in the Črenšovci Sports Hall. The teams of three schools took part: the Franceta Prešerna Črenšovci Primary School as the organiser, the Odranci Primary School and our school. Our students showed a step forward in handball skills, fighting spirit and team spirit, but unfortunately not enough to win. The first team qualified for the further system of the competition. 1st OŠ ODRANCI 2nd OŠ ČRENŠOVCI 3rd OŠ BISTRICA <p/> A visit from St Nicholas <p/> ""Rituals are necessary ..."" said the Little Prince ... It is a time when one day is different from another, a school lesson that teaches and educates us in a different way. In this lesson, modern forms and methods of teaching are intertwined and the pupils are active. For many years now, we have been visited by the first good man at school, St Nicholas. He presents sweet treats to all of us who spend our daily lives together. This year, St Nicholas had with him a gold and a black book. We were already convinced that he had chased away the hellions ... He stressed that we are all ""more or less hard-working"". And that the good man likes to look through the fingers of those who are trying to be hard-working. He filled the dining room basket even more with fruit, left some sweets in his hat, and shook some chocolate in all our hands... This year, the folklore group ""Jankice"" performed the play ""The Family in the Past and Today"", which we recreated together on a literary template by Niki Cigan.There was no shortage of dancing, childish mischief and family relations, which, as in the past, families today live more or less efficiently on their own. The pupils, especially the youngest ones in the kindergarten, especially experienced the ""angelic playing"" of the violinist teacher Mihe. Without the parklands there is no real St Nicholas tradition, every fairy tale has good and bad characters, but it has to end happily. In hidden corners we have saved this day for those later adult times ... Anka Virag <p/> Football competition <p/> November 2010 <p/> On Wednesday, 3 November 2010, we went to a football competition in Turnišče with the older pupils. The pupils played two matches. They played against DOŠ Dobrovnik in a 2 : 2 draw, and against OŠ Turnišče, unfortunately, they lost 5 : 1. The home team showed more skill and deservedly qualified for the next round. Congratulations to all the players for their effort and fight. (teacher Alojz Krevh) <p/> Comenius project <p/> Tuesday16 November 2010 <p/> Since the beginning of this school year, our school has continued to work in the Comenius project and the students have been very active. Finally, they have helped to improve the environment, including for future generations, by reforesting. Read more about the work of the project here. <p/> Second mountain hike - Atilla's trail <p/> Friday5 November 2010 <p/> On Friday, 5 November 2010, we followed the trail of the Hun King Atilla, also known as ""the whip of God"", who stopped at Kapel on one of his military expeditions. We started at the cemetery car park in Radenci and followed the trail to Kapela. The path is marked with white hearts, here and there is an arrow with the name of the path. We continued towards the church, from where we had a wonderful view of Radgona and the surrounding hills.We continued towards the Valley of Peace, through the forest to the main road. Here we turned right along a longer path and from here we just followed the signs Hlaponci, Radenska pot and back towards Kapeli. We returned via an abandoned ski slope. We walked in beautiful weather, which also affected our mood. We had a great time. <p/> Tromejnik <p/> Thursday30 September 2010 <p/> We went on our first mountain trip, to Tromejnik, on Thursday 30 September 2010 at 13:00. We started in Trdkova, at the beginning of the macadam trail, walked to Tromejnik and then continued along the Austrian side. We returned the same way back. In the beautiful autumn weather, we had a lot of conversations, learned about the benefits of walking in nature, picked chestnuts along the way and had a great experience. The pupils confirmed that they were very happy and that they can't wait for the next hike. <p/> Dance <p/> Friday22 October 2010 <p/> On Friday 22 October 2010, the pupils of Grade 9 organised a dance for all the pupils of our school called Halloween Party, starting at 16:30. We had lots of fun games, competitions, etc. The pupils from 1st to 4th grade left at 18:00, when Helga the witch visited us. We continued dancing with the others. We told each other horror stories, danced; we had a good time. We finished the dance at 19.30. The Year 9 students then cleaned up the gym and went home happy. <p/> Award ceremony for Dorothea Fras <p/> October 2010 <p/> We are pleased to announce that our student, Dorothea Fras, has won first place in the art competition on the theme of Elders and Friendship, thus winning a beautiful prize. You can also see the picture in our publication. Doroteja attended the award ceremony in Ljubljana, where she had the opportunity to meet the Minister Dr Igor Lukšič. Once again, we would like to congratulate Dorothea and her mentor, teacher Karmen Modlic. <p/> Sports Day - Cross Country <p/> Thursday11 October 2010 <p/> On Monday, 11 October 2010, we had an inter-municipal cross country event in Črenšovci. Four schools competed (Prežihovega Voranca Bistrica Primary School, Franceta Prešeren Primary School Črenšovci, Miška Kranjca Primary School Velika Polana and Turnišče Primary School). <p/> We arrived at the school at 8am, where we were met by the teachers. We were given a snack and we went in a column to Črenšovce. We were a bit scared before the run. There were already three other primary schools on the playground of the primary school in Črenšovce. First they gave us a big welcome and a short programme. Then there was a tour of the course for the first class, and then for the others. The course was tiring and wet, so there were a lot of slip-ups. After the first four laps, the results were revealed. The first five classes had a little fun and went to our school. Later on we ran again and there was a prize-giving ceremony for the second and third grades. After the competition we returned to school. They were very tired but happy that we had done so well in the cross-country. You can see the results on the notice board. (Dominik, 6th grade) <p/> Science Day - Forest <p/> Thursday7 October 2010 <p/> On Thursday 7 October 2010, the 4th grade students had a science day on the theme of forest. We went to Bukovnica Lake, which is covered by beautiful beech forests. There we were welcomed by a forester who took us on a forest trail. We learnt about the tree species in the forest, the forest railway, animals in the forest, mushrooms, the swamp and the characteristics of the forest edge and the alder log. <p/> We had an eco-technical day <p/> Tuesday5 October 2010 <p/> On Tuesday 5 October 2010, all the pupils of the school watched a theatre performance of The Tale of the Birch Tree. Under the guidance of storyteller Jane Stržinar and teachers, pupils from 1st to 5th grade created with packaging waste and natural materials. Fairy tale trees were created in the classrooms. The pupils learnt about different tree species and waste management. Some students created their own fairy tale tree to share with the rest of the pupils at the end of the day in the school gym. <p/> Fire drill <p/> Wednesday 13 October 2010 <p/> October is Fire Safety Month and that is why today, Wednesday 13 October 2010, we organised a fire drill at our school to refresh our knowledge on what to do in case of fire. The volunteer firefighters from Bistrita helped us and explained once again what to do in case of fire. We would like to thank them once again and call on them for help. <p/> Science Day <p/> Thursday 7 October 2010 <p/> On Thursday 7 October 2010, the pupils of grades 6, 7, 8 and 9 had a science day entitled ""Animals and plants of our environment"". We walked from the school to the river Mura, where different work stations were organised - one where the pupils learnt about the natural geography, identified trees and plants in the surroundings, determined the diversity of plants in a limited area and measured the temperature in the forest, forest edge and meadow; then compared it. With ornithologist Željko Šalamun, they walked from the Mura River bridge through the forest, learning about trees and other vegetation and listening to birds singing. We also found a crayfish in our river and two frogs; a green regia and a red-legged frog. It was a very educational and interesting day.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train

960,"Funeral vehicles <p/> 01/11/2013 <p/> Andrej Godeša Photo and sources.<p/> Some people go to heaven after death, others at least want to go to outer space <p/> People have always believed in an afterlife. In preparation for their final journey, they once prepared a more or less lavish journey depending on their status in society and the extent of their wealth. Often, so many grave goods were accumulated that a means of transport was used for the final journey, especially if the distance to the resting place was somewhat greater. The tradition has survived almost unchanged to the present day. People plan their final journey using a wide variety of means of transport. <p/> Funeral rituals have of course changed over the millennia, but the essence has remained the same. Human remains had to be buried, burned, immersed or otherwise disposed of. Both out of respect for the dead and the belief that the grave is only a way station on the road to eternity, and for purely practical reasons. By removing the corpse, they prevented beasts from coming near the dwellings, and they removed the source of the unpleasant stench of putrefaction and the risk of spreading infectious diseases. As human society evolved, status symbols soon appeared. Even after death, the high-ranking did not want to give them up, as best evidenced by the building of the pyramids. Rulers were escorted to their final resting place in ornate stretchers, chariots or ships. They were stocked with everything necessary for the mighty to live in the next life. In 323 BC, a funeral chariot with the first simple buffers was used to transport the golden sarcophagus containing the remains of Alexander the Great to Alexandria. Handcarts and horse-drawn carts became the main funerary vehicle for the next few millennia. After the invention of cannons in the 13th century and their gradual increase in size, a variation of this transport became the cannon laffete, a wheeled base for carrying cannons, on which the coffins of military leaders and officers were placed. It was only in the 19th century, with the introduction of the steam engine and the building of railways, that the body of the deceased was occasionally carried by train, while carriages continued to rule the short distances. In some large American cities, special subway cars were built for this purpose, but they did not ""catch on"". Perhaps the world's most famous rail journey was in 1865, when a steam train was used to transport US President Abraham Lincoln on his last journey from Washington, where he was assassinated. The body of the great leader who united Americans divided by the Civil War and abolished slavery was transported by a mourning train through several states to Illinois, where he was buried in a tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Closer to us in time and place is the final journey of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, who was transported by train from Ljubljana, where he died in 1980, across much of Yugoslavia to Belgrade, where he is buried in a tomb at Dedinje. With the invention of the electric motor, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, new possibilities emerged for transporting the coffin from the deceased's home or hospital to the mortuary and on to the church, where a farewell service was held, and then on the final journey to the grave. It took almost half a century before motorised hearses became established, before engines became sufficiently powerful and, above all, reliable and quiet. The first mention of motorised hearses dates back to 1907, when a hearse with a built-in electric motor was introduced in Paris. Two years later, a petrol-engined hearse was built in the USA, but it was not until the 1920s that it became widely used. In the first period, especially during the First World War, the same vehicles were used for transporting the wounded and sick as well as for transporting bodies, but almost everywhere the basic purpose of the vehicle was soon separated by the choice of equipment fitted. In some rural areas of the USA, such combination vehicles were still in use in the second half of the last century. Because of the lower frequency of funeral transport, the vehicle was used as an ambulance to transport the wounded, and for the transport of the dead, the vehicle was decorated with curtains and flowers and other decorations before the journey and the vehicle was done. It was not until 1979 that such combinations were banned by US federal law. Most of the vehicles used for funerals are prestigious makes. This way, the deceased gets to ride in a luxury vehicle at least once (if not for life) after death. Maybe they use prestigious vehicles for this purpose more because of the relatives who would be embarrassed if the coffin was driven in a cheap car. In Europe, the most common funeral vehicles today are those based on Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Opel, Ford and, of course, in some places the legendary Rolls Royce or Daimler, while in the USA Cadillac and Lincoln are the leading models, and in Asia Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan. The production of hearse vehicles usually takes place in two phases. First, the chassis with the engine and the front section with the driving compartment are mass-produced in the factory, then the vehicle is finished by specialised coachbuilders who slightly reinforce the chassis and the brakes and equip the vehicle according to the wishes and fantasies of the final customer, the funeral company. Today, most funeral vehicles are made by converting station wagons from standard vehicles. Given the ""light work"" involved, these vehicles can last for decades with regular maintenance, so that specialist companies replace them more out of prestige than out of necessity. A few main styles of funeral vehicle fitting have become established around the world. These are usually the classical approach, which has survived from the carriages, which were richly upholstered with plush and curtains, or the limousine approach, where the vehicles are fitted with as many ornate glass surfaces as possible, which are inserted between the supporting pillars. In some parts of Asia, funeral vehicles try to emulate as closely as possible the classical forms of Buddhist temples, decorated with ornate, often gilded, decoration. More recently, in the desire for individuality and originality, some funeral companies have started to use more unusual combinations of vehicles for their clients' final journeys. In the UK, keen motorcyclists may choose a motorcycle with a sidecar to carry the coffin or the urn with the ashes on the final journey. They have come up with something similar with a tricycle and trailer. For those who are in a particular hurry to get to heaven (or more likely hell), they have produced a ""hot rod"" vehicle across the puddle with the symbolic number ""666"" on the door. In some parts of the world, boats are still used for funerals. At the turn of the 21st century, another wish of science and technology lovers has come true, and at the same time we have a new funeral vehicle - the space rocket. In the spring of 1997, the Pegasus rocket flew, carrying the ashes of 24 people who wanted to be astronauts, at least after death, and who could afford it, on its journey into space. The modified rocket, with lipstick-sized grills, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit for the next five years until it fell back in spring 2002. Among the ""passengers"" were Gene Roddenberry, screenwriter of the science-fiction film series ""Star Trek"", and Timothy Leary, a psychologist and futurist, best known for his ideas on the therapeutic effects of the drug LSD in the early 1960s. The next flight was the first real space funeral. The ""Lunar Prospector"" probe, which carried not only instruments but also a sample of the famous astronomer's ashes, landed on the Moon. Eugene Shoemaker (discoverer of the comet of the same name), the first man to be buried on the Moon, arrived there in the summer of 1999. In the following years, the death rocket flew several more times and has carried the remains of some 660 people into space to date. Among them are several famous people, such as astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto in the 1930s, James Doohan, better known as Scotty in the ""Star Trek"" film series, and Leroy Gordon Cooper, a member of the first US space expedition (Project Mercury) in the early 1960s.",Information/Explanation,train

982,"safety glasses <p/> hearing protection <p/> work protection <p/> safety helmets <p/> safety helmet with visor <p/> Safety glasses and hearing and head protection - a wide selection <p/> Safety glasses are often one of the basic work protections. Good quality safety glasses protect your eyes from mechanical and chemical damage, so you should go for nothing but the best when choosing safety glasses (similarly for hearing and head protection). Wondering where to buy the best quality safety glasses? The answer is Trgos in Lesce. We specialise in importing and selling top quality workwear, hearing protection and eye and head protection (hard hats and more). <p/> Safety glasses available in different designs <p/> Before choosing the right safety glasses, you should think carefully about the features you expect. Is it important that the goggles are equipped with solar filters? Are you looking for safety glasses with lenses that do not dew? Perhaps you need chlorofibre safety glasses? Do you wear corrective glasses and are interested in safety glasses that can be worn over traditional glasses? Do the glasses also need to have side protection? We have a range of safety glasses suitable for different circumstances, so finding the ideal glasses to protect your vision while you work won't be difficult. Of course, we can help you choose the really best safety glasses for your specific circumstances, but we're also the right place to go if you're interested in hearing protection at work. <p/> Optimum hearing and head protection <p/> In many jobs, hearing protection and head protection with the help of a safety helmet is also very important. Hearing protection can sometimes be provided with good quality earplugs, but there are also circumstances where full hearing protection requires the use of mufflers. Whatever kind of hearing protection you are interested in, you will find the ideal ear or hearing protection here. Probably even more important than hearing and eye protection are safety helmets. Among other things, we offer a safety helmet with a visor made of golden, dark glass. A visor helmet provides complete protection for the entire head. Thus, a visor helmet is an accessory that protects you from many dangers and is therefore definitely worth buying.",Promotion,train

986,"The Rectors' Conference of the four Slovenian public universities met in Maribor at the weekend for its first meeting since the University of Maribor took over the two-year presidency of the informal association. According to the Rector of the University of Maribor, Zdravko Kačič, the meeting focused, among other things, on the establishment of the e-Nakvis information system. <p/> Regarding the implementation of the system, which is experiencing some technical problems, Kačič said that they expect its quality implementation and smooth operation within six months, in line with a positive user experience. <p/> In addition to Kačič, the rectors - Igor Papič from the University of Ljubljana, Klavdija Kutnar from the University of Primorska and Danilo Zavrtanik from the University of Nova Gorica and his colleagues - also discussed the importance of the functioning of key support activities of universities related to the implementation of integrated career orientation for students, graduates and other target groups. <p/>The competent Ministry of Education, Science and Sport was called upon to ensure continued and continuous funding for the operation of university career centres and centres set up to support teaching, as these activities are a necessary part of regular higher education activities. According to Mr Kačič, these are funded on a project basis and are due to expire this year, so it would be advisable to start with permanent funding. <p/> There was also a discussion on legislation concerning universities, in particular the harmonisation of the law on research and development and the amendment to the law on higher education. The fall of the government was not the best thing for them, as they were on the verge of getting the draft laws through the parliamentary procedure. Kačič therefore hopes that they will not have to start all over again with the arrival of a new government. <p/> Papič also regrets that they are back at the point of two years ago, when the legislation was also practically in place, but after the elections the whole thing fell into the water. With a new minister, they have reached a point where a working group has already handed over a draft law on research to the ministry, but now the resignation of the government is putting the whole thing in doubt again. <p/> The rectors of the two Seaside universities are of a similar opinion. Kutnarjeva would like whoever takes office in the new government to accept the bulk of the law already drafted by the profession and send it for further consideration as soon as possible, while Zavrtanik regrets that they behaved somewhat neuralgically at the end of its coordination, since otherwise, with some pragmatic solutions, the law could perhaps have been in parliamentary procedure today. <p/> The Rectors also took note of a promotional video entitled Slovenia. Green. Creative. Smart, and they also addressed an initiative to the public agency Spirit to include in such films promoting the country in the future a presentation of its development potential, represented by the scientific and research work of universities and institutes.",News/Reporting,train
