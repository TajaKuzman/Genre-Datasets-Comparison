30,"Navigation with projection on the windscreen is coming <p/> Garmin has launched a navigation device with head-up technology that projects an image on the windscreen. <p/> 9 July 2013, 08:18 <p/> Garmin's projector will cost around €100 in the US. <p/> Projection onto the glass will no longer be the preserve of luxury cars. Navigation giant Garmin has unveiled a new product they have dubbed simply HUD (head-up display). It's a portable device that lets you control the navigation app on your smartphone. <p/> With the projector mounted under the windscreen, which projects an image onto the glass, the driver can keep track of all the route information in his field of vision and does not have to take his eyes off the road. This allows him to concentrate more on driving, which is safer. <p/> A wealth of data on the windscreen in front of the driver <p/> All the driver needs is the HUD, which he connects to via bluetooth on a smartphone that supports the Garmin Street Pilot app.1 This costs around €20. <p/> Garmin assures that its device offers more information than the standard HUDs in cars. Dan Bartel, Garmin's Vice President of Worldwide Sales, explains that the driver can monitor information on the windscreen, such as current speed and limits, where to turn, how far to the next turn and when they will arrive at their destination. <p/> The HUD also shows drivers which lane they need to take before the next turn and warns them when they are speeding, while automatically adjusting the projection's illumination to the sun, shadows and darkness. <p/> The HUD will be available in the US later this year, but details for Europe are not yet available.",News/Reporting,dev

37,"Hamilton does not want a duel with Rosberg <p/> Lewis Hamilton will do everything he can to avoid an internal showdown with Nico Rosberg later in the season, such as the one we saw at the end of the Bahrain VN race. <p/> ""Nico will be fast in every race,"" said Hamilton ahead of the start of the race weekend in Barcelona, where the first European round of the season will take place. "" In China I was determined that we would not be as close as in Bahrain. It was more like a race in Malaysia. I will continue to work with the same approach as before, because it is working perfectly,"" added the Briton, who has won the last three races of the F1 championship. <p/> Hamilton has proved himself as Mercedes' "" number one "" driver at the last three rounds, but the former world champion points out that Rosberg is far from beaten. "" He's still leading the championship, isn't he? Sport is a psychological game. You can't measure the effect that good results have on other people, but I know they have a positive effect on me,"" said the Briton. <p/> Mercedes has shown a significant advantage over its biggest rivals in the first four races, but Hamilton is confident that Rosberg is not the only challenger for the world title. ""There are still a lot of races to go and we can't predict what will happen. Ferrari has taken a big step forward in China. They are not as fast as us, but the jump from tenth to third is very impressive. Renuault will also improve its engines. We must not fall asleep. We have to keep improving and I'm sure we will,"" Hamilton concluded. <p/> Lauda: Mercedes more impressive than Red Bull <p/> Niki Lauda believes that Mercedes' dominance in the opening stages of the 2014 season is more impressive than the dominance shown by Red Bull at the end of last season. ""This year we have new engines, gearboxes and brakes. Mercedes cars have reached the finish line in the first four races, which is a remarkable result for me. If you have bad engines like last year, it is not difficult to finish nine races in a row like Vettel did,"" said the Mercedes non-executive director, who did not expect the silver medallists to be in such a good position after four races.

38,"On Tuesday, 18.10. , we were visited at the Department of Biology by national and foreign (European Commission) monitors of Life+ projects. The whole SloWolf team gathered and presented the activities and products carried out, and the financial part of the project was also scrutinised. <p/> Visit of the external Life+ monitors from Slovenia and the monitors from the European Commission (photo U.M.) <p/> The monitors also had a closer look at the equipment for collecting non-invasive wolf samples during winter tracking, which is distributed annually among hunters and other volunteers during field work. (photo: U.M.) <p/> In a series of five facilitated workshops held in January and February 2011, we invited representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions representing stakeholders related to wolf conservation in Slovenia to draft a proposal for the Action Plan for Wolf Management in Slovenia. More information about the workshops can be found here. <p/> The hunting season for wolves started in October, following a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. As it takes an enormous amount of work to catch a live wolf, both by researchers and by the hunters who help us (on average over 100 field days for one successful catch), every, otherwise legal, kill of a collared wolf would negate a lot of the effort put in, and would also deprive everyone of the interesting and valuable information that collars provide. <p/> In good light conditions, which allow a reliable shot, the collars are visible - the band is light green (Vojko), brown (Slavc) or light blue (Luka), and all the battery cases are white. The list of hunting families in whose hunting grounds the three wolves equipped so far this year are as follows: LD Bukovje, LD Col, LD Črna jama, LD Divača, LD Dolenja vas, LD Draga, LD Gradišče Košana, LD Hrenovice, LD Javornik Postojna, LD Kozina, LD Kras Dutovlje, LD Loški Potok, LD Materija, LD Nanos, LD Obrov, LD Pivka, LD Planina, LD Podgorje, LD Prestranek, LD Raša Štorje, LD Ribnica, LD Rižana, LD Senožeče, LD Sodražica, LD Tabor Sežana, LD Vojkovo, LD Vreme and LD Vrhe Vrabče (see also maps of wolf movements to date). In addition, members of neighbouring LDs should also pay special attention, as we expect the movement areas of both packs to increase slightly during the winter. The young wolf Luka could also have left his natal pack by this time and headed to another area. <p/> Regular wolf culling has started. Watch out for wolves with collars! <p/> On Friday, 6.5.2011, a wolf was caught near Slavnik in Primorska and fitted with a GPS-GSM telemetry collar. The male wolf weighed 39.5 kg and was about 7 years old. He was named Vojko. He tolerated the training well and retreated to the nearby forests shortly after his release. The results of the biometric measurements are available on the wolf ID card page. <p/> The wolf was caught on the edge of the territory of the ""Slavnik"" pack. A wolf named Brin was also hunted nearby and collared in April 2010, but was subsequently killed half a year later. Genetic analyses and data from the telemetry collar will be sent in the coming days to determine the social status of the wolf Vojko. <p/> TV Slovenia's Education Programme has produced a documentary on wolves in Slovenia entitled ""Wolf"" as part of the series ""Biotopes"". The film also presents the activities taking place within the SloWolf project. TV Slovenia broadcast the film on 30 April 2011 and you can watch it online at this link: <p/> We have prepared an analysis of the effectiveness of wolf culling in reducing damage to domestic animals. In addition to the analysis of the impact of wolf culling on the level of damage in Slovenia, the report also reviews the results of foreign research on the effectiveness of wolf culling in Europe and North America. The report also includes management recommendations on the implementation of wolf culling and the prevention of damage to domestic animals. <p/> Participants in the workshop included representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions (Faculty of Biotechnology (experts in agronomy, forestry, biology and zootechnics), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Nature Conservation Institute, Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, Forest Institute, Dinaricum Association, Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry, Association for Animal Liberation and Animal Rights, Federation of Small Animal Breeders' Associations, Special Purpose Hunting Grounds and the Kolpa Landscape Park), representing interest groups related to wolf conservation in Slovenia. The main purpose of the workshops is to first define, through a participatory approach involving all stakeholders, the threats and challenges to wolf management in Slovenia and coexistence with people. In the following workshops, we will try to find the most effective solutions that will allow both the long-term existence of wolves and the reduction of conflicts and improve coexistence between wolves and people. <p/> In our management planning we will also follow the Guidelines for the Transboundary Management of Large Carnivore Populations in Europe, as wolves in Slovenia are only part of the larger Dinaric-Balkan population and are constantly crossing borders with neighbouring countries, especially Croatia. The first workshop was therefore also attended by representatives of the Croatian Institute for Nature Conservation, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia and the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb. <p/> Representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the Hunting Association of Slovenia, local associations of small stock breeders and associations against animal torture are also expected at the next two workshops on Thursday and Friday (3 and 4 February 2011). <p/> In the January issue of the magazine ""Lovec"" we published an article on the life of the wolf Tina, in which we summarise the 4-year follow-up of the wolf, which was fitted with a telemetry collar in 2007 after she accidentally got caught in a lynx trap. The article is available here: <p/> In order to present the public with as objective a picture as possible and to allow for a more constructive debate, the following link presents the position of the SloWolf project team on the culling of wolves in Slovenia: <p/> Over the course of the four-year project, we will be publishing four issues of a project newsletter, which we have named Wolf Herring. The main purpose of the newsletter is to keep you regularly informed about the results and planned activities of our ""wolf"" project. The content will follow the red thread of the project, which is to ensure the long-term conservation of the wolf population, its prey and habitats, and the coexistence of humans and wolves in Slovenia, in an interesting way. We have printed 700 copies, which we will distribute to libraries and other centres in the wolf range to reach as many readers as possible from the local population in the area.The electronic version of the newsletter can be found here. <p/> Training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb <p/> Within the Life + SloWolf project, the Forest Institute (ZGS), Department of Forest Animals and Hunting, organised a training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species, this time with a focus on large carnivores. <p/> The training was held at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb (VF in ZG), both due to the unpreparedness of the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana to organise such training, and due to the experience of Croatian colleagues who regularly organise such training for their delegates. Due to the large number of delegates and the limited space in the secirnice of the Faculty in Zagreb, the training took place in two groups on 2 and 3 November 2010. The attendance was very good as practically all delegates assessing damage from large carnivores in the ZGS organisational units attended. We were also joined by the Director of ZGS Mr. Jošt Jakša, the Head of the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Marko Jonozovič, the Senior Adviser at the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Miha Marenče and the Head of the LPN Service of ZGS Mr. mag. Janko Mehle and some colleagues from the Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Ljubljana. <p/> The participants of the educational workshop were welcomed at the beginning by the Dean of the Faculty of Biology in Zagreb, and then we went through the comprehensive lectures of Mr. Tomaž Skrbinšek (Department of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Ljubljana), Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak, Dr. Andrea Gudan Kurilj and Dr. Janis Kusak. Dr. Ana Beck (all from the Faculty of Science, Zagreb), upgraded their knowledge in the field of recognition of signs of killing and consumption of prey of large carnivores, premortem and postmortem changes on carcasses, and potentially dangerous diseases that can be transmitted by carcasses of killed animals. Mr Skrbinšek briefed the delegates on the procedures of saliva collection from carcasses of killed animals for DNA identification of wolves, which will start in 2011 in the framework of the SloWolf project. The first part of the training was in the form of lectures, and after lunch we went to the Faculty's dissection room. There, we consolidated the knowledge we had acquired through concrete cases, where we together examined several carcasses of sheep killed by wolves. <p/> Practical part of the training of the ZGS Damage Assessment Officers at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb with the lecturer Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak. (Photo: Rok Černe) <p/> In the early morning hours of 20 October 2010, a wolf ""Brin"", equipped with a GPS telemetry collar, was shot in a pasture in the vicinity of the settlement of Petrinje in the Kozina LD. <p/> The male was caught on 13.4.2010 in the area of Slavnik. During the telemetric monitoring, his pack was moving in the area from the Glinščice Valley near the border with Italy to Čičaria and Učka above Opatija in Croatia. <p/> Juniper was stalked in a pasture when five wolves attacked sheep. The collar was not seen by the captor in low light conditions. The male weighed 40 kg and was in good condition. He was shot as part of a regular wolf cull (12 wolves are scheduled to be cull in Slovenia between the beginning of October 2010 and the end of February 2011). Genetic analyses will be carried out in the coming days to determine whether Brin had the status of the alpha male of the pack. <p/> As part of Action A.4 - Assessment of wolf damage in agriculture, we have produced maps of wolf damage between 2003-2005, between 2007-2009, a map of the potential wolf range in Slovenia in the event of a spatial expansion of the wolf population, and a map showing the areas where wolf attacks on small livestock can be expected, given the current distribution of sheep. The maps are included in the final report of the campaign, which included a review and analysis of wolf damage in Slovenia. The report also includes management recommendations for reducing wolf damage.",News/Reporting,dev

43,"Press releases <p/> Yesterday, Monday, 13 February 2012, in the meeting room of the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, a meeting of the Council for Improving the Safety of Citizens in the Municipality of Velenje was held. The meeting was chaired by the Chairman of the Council, the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje Bojan Kontič. <1. Opening hours of bars in the Municipality of Velenje 2. Accommodation of workers who will work on the TEŠ 6 project 3. Under the first agenda item (Opening hours of restaurants in the municipality of Velenje), the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, Mr Bojan Kontič, presented the dilemmas that arise in connection with extending the opening hours of restaurants, because on the one hand, citizens want peace and quiet at night, and young people want open restaurants where they can have fun. Extended opening hours are, of course, also important for catering businesses for business reasons. According to the Catering Act, the approval of opening hours for catering establishments is the responsibility of the local authority, which can also withdraw or not grant approval at all. <p/> Catering establishments serving food and drink (restaurants, pubs, cafés, patisseries, cafeterias, snack bars and bars), located in buildings with flats or in buildings in a residential area intended for living and ancillary activities, may only operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Operating outside these hours shall be considered as extended opening hours, for which the caterer must obtain the written consent of the local authority. The relevant local authority shall decide on this on the basis of the adopted criteria laid down in the Rules on the criteria for determining the extended opening hours of catering establishments and farms catering in the municipality of Velenje. The Rules lay down the procedures and conditions for obtaining approval for extended opening hours, as well as the procedures and conditions for withdrawing such approval. The Municipal Regulation also obliges caterers to carry out their activities in such a way that they do not disturb the environment. <p/> According to Alenka Rednjak, Head of the Investment and Development Office, the Municipality of Velenje is in the process of amending the municipal regulations to provide that the opinion of the district or local community in whose area the restaurant is located is to be taken into account when issuing a consent for extended opening hours. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič informed the attendees that the Velenje Police Station had submitted two proposals to the Velenje Municipality for the cancellation of the extended opening hours, namely for Bar Max Klub, s.p. (Šaleška cesta 3, Velenje), where the opening hours are Monday to Thursday from 10 pm to 1 am and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 5 am, and for Pit Stop bar (Celjska cesta 2, Velenje), where the bar is open 24 hours. According to the Velenje Police Station, the above-mentioned bars have had to intervene several times due to public order violations, including fights, and occasionally the detention of offenders. <p/> Drago Alenc, Commander of the Velenje Police Station, explained that due to the extended opening hours of the restaurants, problems and violations occur mainly in the vicinity of the Red Hall, where the restaurants are open until 3 or 5 am. Police officers note that after the closure of the Red Hall, guests go to the Pit Stop bar, which is across the road by the petrol station. For the safety of pedestrians on the road, police officers are repeatedly carrying out enhanced traffic controls on this stretch of road, as pedestrians are crossing the road in this part of the carriageway, which is not illuminated and in a place where there is no marked pedestrian crossing. Police officers note that many pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol. The Velenje Police Station considers that the frequent violations, which are mostly recorded at night on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, are a problem for public order, traffic and general safety in this part of the city. <p/> The Director of the Municipal Administration, Andreja Katič, pointed out that the request for more police officers should be re-submitted to the line ministry. <p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that on the basis of the proposal of the Velenje Police Station to cancel the extended opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar, the Velenje Municipality had cancelled the consent for the extended opening hours of the above-mentioned establishments.<p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that the Municipality of Velenje had also cancelled the opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar. The owner of the Pit stop bar appealed against the revocation of the consent and, following the new measures, provided more adequate security for the bar and was granted a new consent for extended opening hours by the municipality. However, Bar Max Klub, s.p., only has consent for extended opening hours at weekends, when concerts are held in the bar. <p/> The mayor pointed out that the municipality had not yet made a final decision on the issue of consents for extended opening hours for the bars in the Red Hall Velenje, as they wanted to find a compromise with the owners of the bars so that they could be open at night and at the same time would not violate the Act on Public Order and the Ordinance on General Order in the Municipality of Velenje. <p/> Under the second item on the agenda (Accommodation of workers to be employed in the TEŠ 6 project), the Director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Unit 6 Project, Mr. Miran Žgajner presented the project, which represents a new chapter in Slovenia's energy supply and is currently Slovenia's largest energy investment. It is a modern, highly efficient unit that will gradually replace the existing units. He stressed that Unit 6 is a replacement and not an additional generating facility, which is being built to provide more environmentally friendly electricity at a competitive price. The construction of Block 6 does not represent an additional encroachment on the site, as it will be built on the existing site. Of course, all the measures required by the Environmental Impact Report will also be implemented during construction. The construction of the 600 MW Block 6 will take until 2014. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič pointed out that the members of the Council, who act as a preventive body in this environment, would like to know in particular the number of workers who will be living in the valley during the construction of the block. In this way, the institutions could also prepare themselves for a larger number of clients. <p/> Mag. Mr Žgajner said that during the most intensive works, there would be between 1,500 and 1,800 workers on site, most of them foreigners. Those responsible for the construction of the unit have further increased security on site, as each worker will now have his or her own photo identification card. This will limit free movement on the site and ensure that workers can be properly identified off-site. In the coming days, Termoelektrarna Šoštanj will also conclude an agreement with PV Invest on mutual cooperation in organising accommodation for workers. <He added that road traffic to the construction site will be routed in such a way as to minimise disruption, and attempts will be made to bring as much material as possible by rail and at night. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič stressed the importance of the good cooperation of the Velenje Police Station and the Velenje Health Centre with those responsible for the Block 6 project. This is also due to the good and timely information provided to the police officers about the mode of transport of the cargo. The police officers ensure the safety of both our citizens and foreigners who come to work here. <p/> The Director of the Velenje Health Centre, Jože Zupančič, is negotiating with those in charge at Alstom about the provision of health services for foreigners coming to work in the valley. He said that the health centre will make sure that an emergency medical team will be available as close as possible to the construction site during the operating hours. A new doctor has also been recruited at the Šoštanj Health Station and will be available to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients. <p/> The Block 6 Project Director concluded by stressing that if the Government of the Republic of Slovenia does not adopt the Act on the State Guarantee for the Loans for Block 6 of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant by tomorrow, 15 February 2012, the Block 6 project may also come to a halt. <p/> Under Other Business, the Director of the Centre for Social Work Velenje, Zlatka Srdoč Majer, presented current information on the Centre's activities. It is encouraging to note that recently there have been fewer incidents of domestic violence and fewer applications for social assistance. However, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the new social organisation will have to wait until the end of March. By then, they expect to have issued all the decisions for 3 140 applicants.",News/Reporting,dev

53,"VIRUSES IN CHILDREN <p/> Winter time and cold temperatures are the perfect opportunity for some viruses to spread quickly. These include viruses that cause gastrointestinal infections. The most common causes of intestinal infections in childhood are rotaviruses. Intestinal infection is manifested by diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, cramps and fever. <p/> CAUSERS <p/> The most common causes of diarrhoea in childhood are viruses, rotaviruses being the most common. Rotavirus infections occur every year, all year round, although more people are usually ill during the cold months. During these months, rotaviruses cause infection mainly in children up to 2 years of age.Entericadenoviruses cause diarrhoea and fever lasting for several days, with or without vomiting, in infants and young children, and may be accompanied by signs of a common cold. Of the bacterial agents, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are the most common, and diarrhoea can also be caused by parasites. <p/> SYMPTOMS <p/> The typical clinical picture of a child with a gastrointestinal tract infection is defecation and vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, headache and muscle pain. The problems last for a day or two. A child with a gastrointestinal infection, vomiting and diarrhoea loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes. Fluid loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. <p/> Signs of dehydration include: thirst, dry mouth, bright red lips, sore eyes, less urination. Then the child may become markedly tired or irritable, breathing is deep and rapid, as is the heart rate. In a dehydrated baby, the large lobe of the head drops, the urine may be darker and smaller in volume, the baby becomes more drowsy or irritable. Such a condition definitely requires immediate medical attention. <p/> TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION <p/> Infection spreads easily between children because even a small number of viruses are enough to make a person infected and ill. Viruses are transmitted by contact with an infected person, by touching toys or surfaces that have viruses on them, or by eating contaminated food or drink. When a child is ill, viruses are shed in high concentrations in the faeces for a few days to 14 days, or longer. During this time, apparently healthy children are infectious to the surrounding area. <p/> TREATMENT <p/> Fluid and electrolyte replacement is very important in gastrointestinal viral infections. The child should drink plenty of fluids (tea, isotonic drinks, soups, etc.) several times a day, in small amounts, and fizzy drinks are discouraged. Various oral rehydration solutions are also available in pharmacies. If the child is breastfed, breastfeeding should be continued. As this is a viral and not a bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, the infection should not be treated with antibiotics. <p/> WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR <p/> A child with an intestinal infection loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhoea. This loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Therefore, insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. A doctor should be seen if the condition does not improve after two days.A doctor's visit is also necessary for dehydration. <p/> PREVENTING TRANSMISSION <p/> Frequent and correct hand washing is very important. In particular after using the toilet or changing nappies, and before preparing food and before eating, hand washing should be regular and thorough. Foods eaten without pre-cooking should be thoroughly cleaned with hygienic water. Children attending kindergarten or school should return to the collective at least 24 hours after the cessation of diarrhoea or vomiting, preferably after three days. <p/> DOES CEPIVO exist? <p/> There is a vaccine against rotavirus infection. It is not given by injection, but is injected into the mouth. Two or three doses are needed, with at least 4 weeks between each dose. It is intended for young children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. There are insufficient data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in older children. Research to date has shown that protection against rotavirus infection by vaccination lasts for at least 2 years.",Information/Explanation,dev
55,"Yesterday's news from the municipality about the dismissal of two vice-mayors is still reverberating around Ravenna. It is likely that the Mayor's decision was also the result of public pressure. One of these was published in Dnevnik 3 days ago, where Mojca gave a detailed description of the situation in the municipality and its staffing, which is very true. Mojca Marot's article is published in full. <p/> In Ravenna, more and more people are dissatisfied with the staffing of the SDS mayor Tomaž Roženo, as they have loudly and clearly pointed out at the recent protests. ""We have had enough of clientelism and nepotism, of immoral and unethical moves by our mayor,"" was one of the slogans at the only protest in Carinthia so far, which took place in Ravenna. After we wrote about the functions and remuneration that vice-mayors receive for their work across Slovenia, and highlighted the outcry from young Social Democrats in Ravne, several people from Carinthia who attended the recent protest drew our attention to this slogan, which was lost in the crowd. <p/> The two vice-mayors are brother-in-law and sister-in-law <p/> In a recent article, we mentioned that many people feel that three vice-mayors in Ravenna are too many for the municipality, given its size and the professionalism of Mayor Tomaž Roženo, and that they are also costing the municipal budget a lot. Rožžen assured us that he does not intend to give up any of them, as he believes they are crucial for consensus in the municipal council. But many consider this statement to be far-fetched. Two of them, Milan Škafar and Vera Krajnc, as Ravenč citizens have pointed out to us, are in any case members of his SDS party and, incidentally, they are also related to each other. Kranjc is said to be the sister of Škafar's wife, which means that they are brother-in-law and sister-in-law, while the third deputy mayor, Peter Oder, who runs the Eurosplet company (the Carinthian Student Service, which he and Rozen founded in 1999), is also a ""mayor's"" cadre. According to the Supervizor website, more than €3.6 million has flowed into this company from various public institutions over the last ten years, but the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption concludes that there have been no irregularities. In any case, the 22-member municipal council of Ružen is made up of 10 SDS party representatives, and if we take into account all those who belong to the so-called coalition, it is clear that Ružen does not need a consensus at all. <p/> Not political framing, but a reward for good work? <p/> ""His actions are immoral and unethical, to say the least, and the main concern of both the mayor and the councillors is that they are appointing people loyal to their political option to key positions, i.e. to management positions in public institutions. Half of their relatives have already got a job this way,"" the people of Ravenč are angry. They are particularly surprised by the reincarnation of the Vice-Mayor Škafar, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his own party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is once again a member of the SDS party's executive committee. Incidentally, shortly after the local elections, passions were already running high on this issue at one of the municipal councils in Ravenna. SD councillor Zlatko Halilovič raised his voice against the appointment of three vice-mayors. ""We don't need three vice-mayors, unless it's political spoils for the SDS party,"" he said at the time, adding that councillors are accountable to all citizens, not just to the SDS party. <p/> SDS monopoly in public institutions <p/> The debate became even more heated when it came to appointing members to the boards of public institutions and companies, where Halilovič was joined by a few other supporters in protesting that they were dominated by SDS members. ""Are you going to change the law of physics so that one being can be in several places at the same time? Nine parties have made it to the council, not just SDS, so it is right to balance things"", Halilovic said at the time, referring to the apparent clientelism. The mayor and Krajnčeva dismissed the accusations, saying that just because someone is related to someone else does not mean that they do not have the right to be elected or delegated to an institution's council, moreover, it is a reward for good work, which was apparently also recognised by the voters. Yet it is strange that 23 of the 53 seats, almost half, on the boards of public institutions and companies are held by SDS members, some of whom have even been appointed to several boards at the same time. Robert Brezovnik and Dušan Dretnik also pointed this out, but were overruled by other members of the Elections and Appointments Commission. Surprisingly, even SDS councillor Enriko Plevnik was self-critical in the debate at the time. He said that ""the list is really strange"", while the Mayor said that the seats were distributed in proportion to the election results. These days, however, many people in Ravenna are very interested in who will occupy the director's chair of the Institute for Sport. The current first man of this institution, Aleksander Kotnik, also a councillor of the SDS in Ravenna, is moving to the helm of the music school. <p/> People are also wondering about the reincarnation of Milan Škafar, the Deputy Mayor, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his SDS party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is again a member of the party's executive committee. <p/> One of the vice-mayors, Peter Oder, who is also a director of Eurosplet, d. o. o., - Koroški Student Services, refused to comment on yesterday's decision. However, he was disturbed by Saturday's article, in which we wrote that, according to the Supervizor website, €3.6 million had been transferred from various public institutions to Eurosplet - Koroški Student Services over the last ten years. In his view, this figure is misleading and casts him and the Mayor in a bad light. ""Of this amount, approximately €2.84 million represents direct earnings of students. However, the recognised costs to Eurosplet over ten years amounted to only €128,000 or €12,800,"" explains Oder. He adds that around two thirds of the income generated by public institutions is generated outside the municipality of Ravne, while the recognised costs of doing business with all public institutions in the municipality average just €4,300 per year.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
56,"17 replies to "" Even in the municipality of Ravenna "" in a domestic way "" "" <p/> What is it with this journalist that she writes things that are two years old, and populist ones at that. The SDS party got 10 councillors and a mayor. The SD party got two councillors, Zares got 3 councillors, the NSI got one, etc... Around the same time, the seats on the committees were also divided up, or the SDS got even fewer than it could have. Check the data available. The most important is the Supervisory Committee, where the opposition has the chair and the majority of members. In this way, things are 'balanced'. Of course, the glass can always be half full or half empty, depending on which eyes are looking at it. It is normal, however, that the opposition always wants to minimise the successes and inflate the weaknesses to the extreme. All credit to the mayor and his team for what they have achieved in the town, and it may not be all good, but it is far from all bad. <p/>It is only the political staffing that bothers me, but I would like to point out that many of these SDS directors have improved things and put things on the right footing, and nobody mentions that. I am not taking sides, but I think that, yes, it is not all black. Many times when I go to the flatlands, where I was born, I find that many people are negative, and they all tell the same stories, and it is quite clear to me that somebody has set them up against the mayor. But perhaps we already know of a candidate for mayor in the forthcoming local elections? ? ? It also bothers me that the freedoms are being used for the benefit of one political party, namely the SD. Its members are always at these protests, and in this case the protests, which I support, are taking on political overtones. People should say what they think, not be persuaded to do so by one political option. <p/> After all, it is the SD, or the young forum, that is behind everything, and they have their noses up in everything good that is done in Ravenna. And what the fuck is that to the demonstrator in front of the municipality from Ravne! Let the others go and demonstrate in front of their municipalities, because in the end Prevale has two vice-mayors. No, it is only Ravne that is under attack. The Young Forum of the Mežiška dolina Valley is, as far as we can understand, the young forum of the whole valley, not just Ravne, and they should do something elsewhere, not just go around Ravne on the orders of their silver uncles from behind the scenes. <p/> Who reads this red Dnevnik ... and just ask yourselves and investigate who paid some money to this Mojca to write such an article (a paid article). Kudos to Mayor Rozen, he has done a lot for the people ... but only those who want to line their pockets are slandering ... a little morgen, you will be waiting ... <p/> I have to speak up. I am an ordinary citizen just observing what is happening in Ravne. I am also interested to see the recordings of the municipal council meetings. I must say that I am VERY SATISFIED with the leadership of our municipality. However, it is obvious that Councillors Halilovič and Vrhovnik are doing everything they can to undermine the work of the mayor and his team. What is the purpose of such action is clear to all. Because they feel that there is not enough publicity at the meetings themselves, they have to take to the streets. That is why I was not surprised to see, in the video footage of the assembly in front of the municipal building, mainly supporters of the pole that has too few members on the municipal council. Therefore, people - do not be fooled into thinking that this assembly was about improving the situation. It was about letting the street allow those who failed in the elections to rise - whether that is good or bad for the citizens. <p/>I see you are all more right-wing up here, I tell you we have a trunk full of your politics and don't dream that only reds are protesting in the street. I for one am for honest politics be it left or right, I have no bad words for Rozen but I don't think he has kept the right deputy mayor. <p/> Aljaž Vrhovnik will be loud? A teenager who rushes to the trough more than a calf to a cow, pretending to be clever about things that logically he has no clue about, because he is simply being a child. I have nothing against young people, but what is too much is too much, and he is running for mayor - and half the stupid journalists quote him. I don't know who is the bigger half-ass. Vrhovnik was lying drunk in front of Presa last weekend, why don't you write about it) <p/> Zlatko Halilovič -&gt; has he raised his voice? Logically, it is more difficult to do anything else. <p/> Blog author: Why don't you publish what is the difference between the annual salary of a councillor and a deputy mayor? Aren't you interested? <p/> And to the left- and right-wing narrow-minded, greetings and a happy and prosperous 2013, in deeds, not in words. <p/> The Governor is supposed to be a representative of young people, but not enough to stand up for young people and their interests. But he is only looking at his own narrow interests, how to make a political career, no matter how much it costs, and who he is going to shit on for it. Shame! It is also a shame what kind of representatives the youth have in our country - they (we) are guilty of this, unfortunately - but why do we give such people a voice?

57,"Jerry is leaving <p/> If you wanted to add symbolism to the script for the end of Andre Jerman's career, you would actually have only two options: win or lose. Unfortunately, fate chose the latter. The best Slovenian downhill skier of all time and still the only winner of a World Cup race on the men's side did not want to take much time to think about the next steps after his recent accident in Kitzbühel. <p/> As if he wanted to get rid of the burden as quickly as possible and push the stone away from his heart, he announced his appearance in front of the seventh force shortly after his return to Tržič. Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision. It was already difficult to come back this year and ' throw myself ' upside down. A period of no real results followed. In Wengen I got a new mark, my knee got stuck. But I did it anyway.

Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy for him. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much.

For a long time, after all, Slovenians were considered to be only technical skiers with a daring excursion into the supervelles slalom. Jerman, on the other hand, made history in downhill, the fastest and for many the royal discipline. He will always be remembered as the first Slovenian winner of a World Cup downhill event. He was not a one-day flyer either, winning twice and finishing second and third, proving his quality and showing his mettle on a variety of terrain. His stability and excellence are also reflected in his breakthrough into the elite seven of the World Cup. He has finished two seasons in a row among the fastest. With a slight time lag, his skiing transformation was followed by his progression in the Super-G, where he never reached the podium, but finished fourth twice. <p/> His pioneering achievements paved the way for his compatriots. Already when he was breaking through, the national team formed a team for the fast disciplines under the leadership of Jože Gazvoda, his father, who was also a skier. After a few flashes from Peter Pena, Gašper Šparovec and before that Ales Brezavšek, ""Jerry"" was the first to prove that it is not an end in itself and that it is worth investing in the ski ranks. The ""speedsters"" were getting bigger and better, and as a result, the technical defector Andrej Šporn, Rok Perko, Alek Glebov, Gašper Markič and finally the promising Boštjan Kline started to make their way to the World Cup. <p/> It started very early, far away from the cameras. At the age of 13, he ended his skiing on the Soriška planina mountain when he collided with a spruce tree and broke both his legs. But it was at that point in his career that his stubbornness and perseverance came to the fore. A year later, he won the traditional Ponochio Cup and went on to show his talent in all age categories. Unfortunately, along with his skiing skills, he then brought a wave of injuries to the competition. The recent fall in Kitzbühel was not his only one at Streif. He paid the price of youthful enthusiasm and perhaps too little respect in his first encounter with the famous slope. He left the Rooster Ridge with damaged knee ligaments. Shortly after his rehabilitation, he broke it again, this time on the Zermatt glacier, and once again his knee was struck. Then, just when it looked like he had fulfilled his injury bonus, he fell again in 2004 and injured his knee for a third time. With all these injuries, the wrist fracture and the shoulder pain after falling off the chairlift are marginal. <p/> More fatal for Jerman was a fall at the start of the 2011/12 season, when he was already contemplating the end of his career after crashing into the guardrail of the Birds of Prey track in Beaver Creek. But he decided to rehab his injured knee and return to the World Cup caravan. He went ahead with his plan, but another fall prevented him from completing it. This time in Kitzbühel. Although it was ""only"" a concussion, and fortunately the ligaments and bones remained intact, it was the last one of his career. <p/> Martin Pavčnik, Siol.net <p/> Biggest successes: 2 World Cup ski race wins (Garmisch 2006/07 and Bormio 2009/10) and two more top 3 finishes.

The railway in philately, art, music, film, etc. published 24 May 2010 This book shows the influence of the railway on the things people do for pleasure and for a short time. Sometimes it is also a way for some people to earn a living and make our lives better. <p/> Chapter 1 gives a brief history of stamps with railway motifs. This is followed by images of stamps from Europe and the rest of the world. The stamps of the former Yugoslavia and Slovenian stamps after 1991 are presented in detail. All the locomotives on the stamps are additionally described, and I have added to the stamps their philatelic and catalogue value. Special mention is made of some of the steam locomotives of the Slovenian Railways (SŽ) and the Ocean locomotive, with an account of important events in Maribor during the construction of the Vienna-Trieste line. The chapter concludes with a selection of some famous steam locomotives of my choice. <p/> Chapter 2, after a brief introduction, presents in detail Honegger's composition Pacific 231. The composition is interesting because its origin is linked to a mistake made by the composer. This is followed by a short presentation of some of the Pacific series locomotives from France and the rest of the world. <p/> The third chapter shows the link between railways and poetry, or rather the influence of railways on the creation of 'railway' poems. The poems selected are Prešeren's On the Railway Road and Župančič's By Train. This is followed by a description of the locomotives that may have pulled the train that Župančič rode through Gorenjska on his way to Paris. Here again, the content of Župančič's poem does not correspond to the situation on the railway at the time of its composition in 1905. <p/> The chapter on railways and painting, after an introduction showing some famous paintings of railways, is dedicated to the pioneer of the expert treatment of the history of railways in Slovenia and the man most responsible for the establishment of the museum collection and the Railway Museum in Ljubljana. This is the academic painter Stane Kumar. It also describes where overconfidence in oneself, underestimating others and ignoring historical and professional facts in the name of artistic freedom can lead. This is exactly what happened to Stane Kumar. <p/> The last chapter describes the Bohinj railway, its history, important buildings, the landscape and people along it, and two famous locomotives from the past. <p/> An appendix explains some of the philatelic and railway terms that appear in the book. The wheel arrangements of steam locomotives from all over the world are thoroughly explained. A schematic of a steam locomotive and a data table of all the locomotives in the book are also added. In addition to the basic data, the table contains detailed information for those who are more familiar with the subject. (From the author's preface.) <p/> Brief introduction of the author.

71,"5 reasons why coworking is a great solution <p/> In Slovenia, we have recently witnessed the rise of so-called coworking offices, which allow young entrepreneurs more flexibility than working in traditional offices, and are also more affordable, which is especially important for young companies. And they have many other advantages! <p/> 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution (Image source: sxc.hu) <p/> Coworking is a great solution for young businesses,... <p/> ... because you can separate work and family more easily. <p/> Many of today's very successful entrepreneurs have started their businesses in their own homes, whether in a dusty basement or in their living room. The fact is that young entrepreneurs start out with very limited funds, so renting their own office space is usually too expensive for them. <p/> This is why renting office space in a so-called coworking office, which is especially suitable for young companies with few team members, comes into play. These offices are much more affordable than traditional offices and allow the entrepreneur to easily separate home and office space. <p/> ... because you can build a real network of friends. <p/> Coworking offices bring together several entrepreneurial teams from very different business areas in one place. By renting office space in a coworking office, you will automatically become a member of the community and you will build a real network of friends. In this way, you will spread the word about your company and make new good friends. <p/> ... because doing business can be much faster and easier. <p/> Doing business in a coworking office is not only interesting and fun, it can also be much faster and easier. Need a programmer, a designer, an accountant? Don't worry, you'll probably find one in the next room, but if you can't find one, ask the other members of the coworking office for their contact numbers and recommendations, as they've probably used the services before. <p/> ... because working in an office is much more comfortable than working in a nearby pub. <p/> Laptops and almost unlimited access to the internet allow many entrepreneurs to work from different locations. One option that many people with space problems use is to work in a café with a cup of coffee or tea. The problem arises if the owners of the café do not approve of this and the entrepreneur has to leave the place... and let's not even waste words on the effectiveness of such work. <p/> You may be comfortable working from home, but your business partners or potential clients will be much more impressed if you meet them in a tidy office instead of in a room that is also your bedroom or kitchen.

84,"Anaemia is a dangerous companion to cancer <p/> General fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, shortness of breath even with slight exertion, palpitations or a pounding sensation in the chest, retention of fluid in the body with the appearance of swelling, poor digestion and circulation all have a common denominator in cancer patients - anaemia. Anaemia, as anaemia may also be called, is not necessarily a consequence of cancer or its treatment, but can also be caused by a number of other, less serious, causes. However, it is often a poor blood count, with a reduced number of red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are responsible for ""transporting"" oxygen around the body to all cells, that can significantly worsen the life of cancer patients. <p/> The problems are particularly evident in blood and haematopoietic cancers, where anaemia ""comes with the territory"" of the disease. In some other cancers, however, anaemia occurs later, as a result of treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or ionising radiation. One form of blood cancer is disseminated plasmacytoma, in which cancerous plasmacytoma cells grow in the red bone marrow of the flat bones, which is also the main site of production of healthy blood cells. ""The cancer cells invade the bone marrow and do not allow the healthy blood cells to develop,"" explains Dr Irena Preložnik Zupan, MD, PhD, a specialist in internal medicine at the Clinical Department of Haematology. <p/> ""When we want to define anaemia more precisely, we usually use the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), we speak of anaemia when the haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L for women and below 130 g/L for men,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. Anaemia is divided into mild, moderate and severe forms. The former is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of between 100 and 120 g/L, the latter is between 80 and 100 g/L, and below 80 g/L is the severe form of anaemia, which usually causes the most problems, especially if it is rapid onset. <p/> ""In all cancer patients, we also check the basic blood count and anaemia is virtually impossible to miss. Often, however, the milder form of anaemia in cancer patients is somewhat neglected, but the patient's well-being and quality of life can be significantly impaired as a result. The patient is already experiencing fatigue, feeling unwell, unable to do everyday things, intimacy with a partner is impaired, unable to participate in family responsibilities, etc. All these symptoms can be present even in mild forms of anaemia,"" she warns. <p/> The causes of anaemia in cancer patients can be divided into three groups: <p/> (1) related to the cancer, where there is significant bone marrow involvement, <p/> (2) due to the treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as surgery, which can lead to blood loss, <p/> (3) and (4) a third group of causes can be associated diseases that the cancer patient has and, of course, also have an additional impact on the anaemia. <p/> ""If the heart is failing, we have poor blood circulation, if the lungs are diseased, there is insufficient oxygen supply, if the kidneys are not functioning well, toxic substances accumulate in the body and the organism is weakened,"" says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> ""Cancer-related fatigue is a common phenomenon - a strange, constant feeling of general, severe tiredness, listlessness and helplessness, which cancer patients themselves attach much more importance to than doctors,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova, explaining the difference between the patient's and the doctor's perception of the problem. ""Also very important are the data showing the reduced success of cancer treatment in anaemic patients and the reduced survival of these patients compared to non-anaemic patients, irrespective of the type of cancer. "" <p/> And how common is anaemia in cancer patients? <p/> ""Based on the large 2001-2002 European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS) study of around 15,000 cancer patients, which looked at the incidence, prevalence and treatment of anaemia, anaemia was present in an average of 40% of patients at the time of enrolment, and in disseminated plasmacytoma, anaemia was present in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis. With cancer treatment, anaemia occurred in a further 30%"", says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> Anaemia in cancer patients can be treated in several ways, depending on the cause. ""If a patient has severe problems due to anaemia, in terms of dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or chest pain (a sign of ischaemic heart disease), we need to intervene with transfusions of concentrated red blood cells, which have an immediate effect. Usually these are patients with a severe degree of anaemia, haemoglobin concentration below 80 g/L. However, problems may occur earlier if the patient has associated heart or lung disease. Transfusion is also needed in patients who are actively bleeding due to cancer or if a previous attempt at erythropoietin treatment has been ineffective. In patients with mild and moderate anaemia, however, we prefer to treat with recombinant erythropoietins. The disadvantage is that it takes time for the haemoglobin concentration to rise, but it certainly avoids many of the disadvantages of transfusion,"" explains Zupanova. <p/> ""Studies are still ongoing to determine at which haemoglobin level it is best to start treating the patient, with what doses of erythropoietin and how often. In our hospital, we treat with erythropoietin when the haemoglobin concentration is below 110 g/L and administer it up to a target haemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L. At higher haemoglobin concentrations, side-effects such as thrombosis and arterial hypertension may occur. This in turn may put the patient at risk. ""Erythropoietins have a number of advantages over transfusions. The latter still pose a low risk of transmitting infections, cause iron to accumulate in the body and increase fluid volume. Immune reactions after transfusion can also be dangerous. The patient should receive a transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes in hospital for observation and appropriate management if problems arise. When treated with erythropoietins, these problems are avoided. The drug is usually in syringes for subcutaneous administration. Patients should be followed up regularly every four weeks to see how well the treatment is working. We are usually successful in patients who need the drug temporarily because of chemotherapy,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. ""If we have a patient with advanced cancer, we mainly opt for transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes, as erythropoietins are ineffective in this case. """,Information/Explanation,dev

It is enough to water it. By irrigating, we are harming the roots to grow deeper into the soil. <p/> An 'underground' sprinkler system that can be set to water the lawn automatically is better. As these sprinklers are below the surface, it is sufficient to water the lawn a few times a week, as the soil retains more moisture than the surface. However, if you do not intend to buy such a system, it is a good idea to check the soil moisture before watering the grass. The best way to do this is to walk on the grass and if you see footprints in the grass, the grass needs watering. You also don't need to water the grass if it has rained for a long time, as the moisture has been retained in the soil. <p/> The best time to water the grass is early in the morning or in the evening, as this reduces the evaporation value. However, experts recommend watering the grass early in the morning (between 5 and 9 am), as evening watering can cause various lawn diseases, as the moisture does not evaporate, creating the perfect conditions for grass diseases to develop. This will keep the soil moist for longer and you will help to save water.",Instruction,dev

149,"The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of the Franciscans of Kamnik, located in a corridor next to the presbytery of the monastery church, is a unique piece of Plečnik's art, full of symbolism. The plans for it were drawn up in 1952 and it was completed in 1954. More... <p/> The monastery chapel was used as a prayer room and for the installation of the Nativity scene and the Holy Sepulchre. The architect was assisted by the local pater Martin Perc. Previously, Plečnik had rebuilt the church in Stranja and planned the baptistery in Nevlje on the orders of Father Perc. Plečnik stripped the plaster from the stonework in the chapel and emphasised the intermediate joints. The stone wall is connected to the lower edge of the plastered surface by a corrugation, which has the function of a seam. On the altar table stands a monolithic tabernacle made of underbaked brick, with stone and brass candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle. Behind the tabernacle is a luminous circular screen. The ceiling is a timber structure made of logs, supported on timber lintels on timber cantilevers. Three chandeliers are fixed on each side of the sloping beams under the logs. This is the theme of the tent, which Plečnik took from the famous mid-19th century German architect and theorist Semper. The walls and ceiling are executed in the architect's characteristic late-period sgraffito technique. Inscriptions, symbols of Christ's martyrdom and geometric borders are included. The window looking into the church has a pair of double polished dark marble mullions on each side. Opposite the altar, a figure of the Crucified is mounted on an alabaster slab in a T-shaped frame. The handle on the door is in the form of a stylised dove. The chapel's furnishings contain a great deal of symbolism. Small metal lights, which some believe resemble military helmets, are arranged around the ceiling. They radiate a short beam of light upwards, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The beams on the ceiling of the altar part suggest the stable or manger of Christ, while the monolithic tabernacle symbolises the rock tomb of Christ. Thus, the cycle of Christ's birth, death and resurrection is symbolically completed. <p/> Dr. Andreja Eržen, historian, Director of the Agency for the Development of Tourism and Entrepreneurship in the Municipality of Kamnik, spoke on camera about the furnishings of the monastery chapel.",Information/Explanation,dev

The translator was obviously translating from a phonetic notation and she obviously understood the Silesian. Which is, on the one hand, perfectly excusable, but it is much less excusable that she did not find these Silesian pirates a little suspicious. It would have been enough for her to type Spartacus pirates into a search engine and she would have immediately found out that they were pirates from Cilicia, and then she would have typed Cilicia into the same search engine and found out where it was.

181,"Still a storm in no man's land <p/> Monday, 10 October, marked the ninety-first year since the Carinthians chose their country in a plebiscite. In the choice between the foreign Austria they knew and the native, Slavic Kingdom of SHS they did not, the former prevailed. Although they had won a country, their homeland was increasingly under threat. The struggle of the Carinthian partisans for their mother tongue, forests and justice has recently been the subject of two recent works by Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke. <p/> The Angel of Forgetting (Engel des Vergessens), a novel by Haderlap, was awarded one of the most important prizes in the German-speaking world, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, and Handke's work Still the Storm (Immer noch Sturm), which was awarded the Austrian Nestroy Theatre Prize for the best play of 2011, had its premiere at the Burgtheater in Vienna at the beginning of October, following its premiere at the Salzburg Gala Games and its premiere at the Thalia Theatre in Hamburg. Between autobiography and historical testimony, Maja Haderlap's novelistic debut tells the story of her ancestors from Lepen near Železná kapla, centring on her grandmother, who survived the torture of the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp (""She saved herself, yes, but if that is why she prefers to live, she doesn't know. ""), and his father, who fled to the partisans at the age of 12 after the Nazi torture that marked his life forever (""I would rather forget everything. ""). The first-person narrator, me, changes as the narrative unfolds from a girl who is still learning basic concepts, like, for example, the partisans, to a woman torn between her home environment and the world, Slovenian and German, the stage and reality and, most importantly, the past and the present. The story thus grows from simple descriptions of the domestic environment, family relationships and children's ideas of the world into a document of time, filled with a historico-political charge, which testifies to the relations between the Slovenian minority and the Austrian majority, to the forgotten, ignored and scorned partisan resistance, and to the shadows that the past casts over the divided Carinthian families of the present. That I always, regardless of age, tells its story in the present tense, in some places causing blurred transitions between the past and the present, but at the same time emphasising being trapped in time and showing how far into the past we have to reach in order to shed light on the present. The Constant Self also drifts into an overly direct autobiography on a few occasions, which, while intimately convincing the reader that the story being told is true, also strips away a bit of objectivity from the overall historical testimony. Otherwise, The Angel of Forgetting goes beyond testimony, and in some places even turns into poetry, a language of powerful images that is the antipode to the simple, clear and pure narrative tone. <p/> The Snows of History Still Storming, arguably Handke's most personal work to date, was to have been put on the stage of Vienna's Burgtheater as a guest performance by Handke's friend Claus Peymann, but a falling out broke out between the director and the playwright, and they broke off their collaboration. Handke then decided to publish the play as a book (by the German publishing house Suhrkamp) and left the direction to the Bulgarian-born director Dimitri Gotscheff (whose production of Aeschylus' The Persians was seen as a guest performance at Cankarjev dom in 2010) for the Salzburg Festival Games. Handke entrusted the Bulgarian director with an understanding of the Slavic soul and the tragedy of losing one's homeland, but he also wanted the director not to leave out much of the text and thus create a multi-hour play comparable to Über die Dörfer (Across the Village), directed by Wim Wenders for the Salzburg Festival in 1982. Gotscheff succeeded in putting on stage one of Handke's most powerful texts, which the author himself called a jaloig about the Carinthian revolt and the history of my family. The text, in which there are no clearly identified persons and their replicas, but also no didascalia, resembles a novel in dialogue rather than a dramatic work, moving between languages (choral German, Carinthian dialect and Slovene) and genres (lyric, epic, drama). The central narrator and observer is himself (an excellent performance by Jens Harzer), surrounded by his (dead) ancestors in the Carinthian foothills of Austria: his grandparents, his mother and her three brothers (Gregor, Valentin, Benjamin) and his sister (Ursula). Jaz's perspective resembles the view from the cradle of an elderly (blue) baby, asking, reporting and commenting, but sometimes it seems as if he is not there at all, or as if the whole action is taking place in his half-sleep. That it is just a nightmare that he doesn't know whether it is happening inside him or outside him, whether he is crawling inside it or being attacked by it (""Not that I leave you alone. Don't leave me alone, be still. You do not leave me alone, no and no. ""). I follows a family tragedy: the deaths of the (forcibly conscripted) Wehrmacht soldiers Benjamin and Valentin, and then the death of the (at first delighted and then disappointed) partisan Ursula (with the partisan name Snežena). The only son who returns to the family is Handke's uncle, the partisan Gregor. Gregor, whom Handke portrayed (though always differently) in several of his works, studied fruit-growing in Maribor and wrote a book on apple varieties, which the family on stage reads as a Bible (in Slovenian), but the product of his uncle Gregor, who was actually killed as a soldier in the Wehrmacht, is also supposed to have a special place in Handke's real life. The stage is completely empty and bare, the costumes do not change, there are hardly any props. There is a void, filled with words of rage and frustration, sadness and suffering. Words about the language the family wanted to save (""To save a language is to save a soul. ""), about the homeland it wanted to preserve (""To lose the homeland once, to lose the homeland forever. ""), and about the history it wanted to write (""History, it has swallowed up my life and our life, the feeling of life. ""). During the four-hour-long speech, green confetti keeps falling on the stage, fast or slow. History snows, slowly covering space, time and performers. <p/> Home, Church, Politics, History, Language and Self Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke build their texts in different narrative tones: she calmly and occasionally confessional, he wildly and preachily. She is drawn to sentiment and he to irony, we sense in her the fusion of words and landscape and in him their incompatibility. But the motifs that merge into the narrative flow remain the same. The house as the point of contact and the most important space for the whole family. Politics, which those who have been most deeply disappointed avoid in the greatest arc. A dream in which the past and the present are intertwined. A Church that has thrown away its own children because they have taken up the fight for the language in which its priests preached before the war. And last but not least, there is the point of contact with me, a person who was born too late to live, yet will never escape. Both writers feel the pain of politics devouring history and history devouring their own children (""They know that their past does not appear in Austrian history books, still less in those of Carinthia, where the history of the country begins with the end of the First World War, pauses and continues with the end of the Second World War. ""The Austrian post-war statehood was founded (among other things) on the resistance of the Carinthian Slovenians, on the blood sacrifice in the local forests and orchards, and then was sucked into the black hole of history. (""A country that does not want us, and it is because of us that it is allowed to exist as a state..."") One of the strongest motifs of both narrators is language - in Handke's case, it is the fear of its loss that is stronger, and the hope for its salvation or at least its recognition (""Our language, our strength. Beyond language, violence erupts. "", ""Language, mine, ours: the hen's ladder will be Jacob's ladder.""), while in Haderlap's case it is a more intimate search for one's own identity (""I hope that later I will find or invent the right language... "", ""Who am I, who do I belong to, why do I write Slovenian and speak German? ""The two narratives, which take place on the periphery of our territory, are not just a matter of province. Just as much as they are a matter for Austria because of its suppressed history, they are also a matter for central Slovenia, which most often does not hear the voices from the periphery. At the Burgtheater in Vienna, a section of the audience gave the production of Still the Storm a standing ovation, and there were shouts of enthusiasm from the boxes. Many audiences attend Maya Haderlap's many Austrian readings. When will the subtle stories from the periphery touch all Slovenian viewers and readers, and when will we begin to see their past as our own? The Slovenian translation of Handke's text (published by Wieser, translated by Brane Čop, reviewed by Florjan Lipuš and Peter Handke) will be available in the second half of November, while Maja Haderlap's novel will be published in Slovenian next summer (by Litera). <p/>Quotes",Review,dev

In this respect, the issue is one of shared causation. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The review is dismissed. <p/> Reasons <p/> The Court of First Instance rules that the defendant must pay the applicant SIT 2 460 020 in damages, with statutory default interest from SIT 36 660 from 1.4.1998 until payment, from SIT 3 360 from 21.7.1998 until payment and from SIT 2 300 000 from 7.3.2003 until payment. It further ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an annuity of SIT 2 000 per month from 1.4.2003 by the 15th day of each month for the preceding month. The Court dismissed the applicant's claim for higher relief. It held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damage suffered by the applicant in the accident of 28.1.1998. It awarded the injured party damages of SIT 900 000 for the physical pain suffered, SIT 200 000 for the fear, SIT 1 000 000 for the mental pain resulting from the impairment of his activity in life and SIT 200 000 for the mental pain resulting from the disfigurement. <p/> The Court of Appeal partially upheld the litigants' appeals and amended the judgment of the Court of First Instance by awarding the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, pecuniary damages of SIT 2 500 000, with default interest from 1 January 2002 to 7 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate less the base rate, and from 8 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in all other respects. It accepted the applicant's plea that the compensation for mental pain and suffering as a result of the injury was too low and awarded her SIT 400 000 for that purpose, while it considered the compensation for the other forms of non-pecuniary damage awarded to the injured party by the Court of First Instance to be appropriate. <p/> The applicant brought an appeal against that judgment on the ground of error of substantive law. The applicant requests the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia to uphold it and to amend the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejects the application, by awarding the applicant, in addition to the pecuniary damages of SIT 2 660 020 already awarded, SIT 2 000 000, with statutory default interest from 14.10.1999 until payment, and statutory default interest on the damages already awarded from 14.10.1999 until 31.12.2001. The applicant submits that, although the lower courts correctly established the factual situation, they subsequently awarded the injured party inadequate compensation for all forms of non-pecuniary damage. In awarding damages for the mental anguish resulting from the impairment of the applicant's activities in life, the Court of First Instance should not have followed uncritically the expert opinion of Dr W. that the applicant's classification as a category III invalid was only 20 % due to the physical injuries sustained in the accident and 80 % due to his medical condition. It was only as a result of the permanent consequences of the injuries sustained on 28.1.1998 that the applicant was classified in category III of invalidity, since he was no longer able to work. He was 48 years old at the time of the incident and will therefore have to endure the mental pain of reduced activity for a very long time. The Courts of First and Second Instance ignored the fact that the accident occurred in 1998 and that the defendant has not yet paid any compensation to the applicant. The decision on the commencement of interest on the pecuniary compensation for non-material damage is also incorrect. Neither the Law on Obligatory Relations (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 29/78-57/89, ZOR) nor any other law provides that interest on compensation for non-material damage is payable to the injured party only from 1 January 2002. In view of the stabilised economic and economic situation in the country, the monetary claim for compensation for non-material damage is payable after the expiry of a period of 14 days from the date on which the defendant received the claim and the documentation. The applicant sent the claim to the defendant on 29.7.1998 and the defendant received it on 30.7.1998, and has therefore been in default of payment since 13.8.1998. According to Article 277 of the Civil Code, a debtor who defaults in the performance of a pecuniary obligation owes interest in addition to the principal. The case-law to date has neglected the function of interest, which consists in the penalty for failure to comply with a monetary obligation in time. Such a decision is contrary to Article 17(1), (12), and Article 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code. <p/> The review was served on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and on the defendant, who did not reply to it. <p/> The audit is not substantiated. <p/> Pursuant to Article 370(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 36/04 - Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, p. 36), the review court and the parties are bound by the factual basis arising from the grounds of the judgments of first and second instance, and therefore, pursuant to Article 371 of the Civil Procedure Act, the review court examined the contested judgment within the limits of the ground raised by the reviser, namely error of substantive law. <p/> The fundamental principles governing the assessment of compensation for non-material damage are the principle of individualisation and the principle of objective conditionality of the amount of financial compensation. The principle of individualisation requires the determination of fair compensation in the light of the intensity (degree) and duration of the physical and mental pain and suffering and distress in the light of all the concrete circumstances of the individual victim. However, in accordance with the principle of the objective conditionality of the amount of pecuniary compensation, the court, in assessing it, must have regard to the importance of the good affected and the purpose of the compensation, and must ensure that it does not give way to tendencies incompatible with its nature and social purpose (Article 200(1) and (2) of the CPA). The Court of Second Instance, by awarding damages for physical pain (SIT 900 000), fear (SIT 200 000), mental pain due to the impairment of life activities (SIT 1 000 000) and mental pain due to disfigurement (SIT 400 000), found that the Court of First Instance had failed to award damages for the following reasons000) correctly met the legal standard of just pecuniary compensation, since the damages awarded are comparable to those awarded for similar harm and take into account all the applicant's individual characteristics, including her age at the time of the harmful event (see the reasons for the judgment of the Court of First Instance on pages 6 to 8 and the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Second Instance on page 3). As regards the mental pain resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the physical injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In that respect, the question of shared causation is one which the courts of the lower instances have resolved correctly in substantive law and in accordance with settled case-law. Since the applicant's current state of health or incapacity for work is also due to health problems which pre-date the harmful event, the defendant cannot be held liable for that part of the damage which is not attributable to the conduct of its insured. (1) <p/> The decision as to the commencement of interest is also substantively correct. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in a legal opinion of principle of 26.6.2002, adopted a position which ties the commencement of statutory default interest on a pecuniary claim for non-pecuniary damage (Articles 179-183 of the Law on Obligations, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 83/01, OZ, or Articles 200-203 of the Civil Code) to the entry into force of the OZ (1.1.2002), provided that an additional condition of delay in performance on the part of the person who caused the damage is also met at the same time. The applicant's legal position, which considers that it is in any event decisive when the insurer received the claim for compensation with the applicant's medical records, referring to the provisions of Articles 12, 17(1), 277 and 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code, is erroneous, since it would lead to unequal treatment of the injured party, contrary to the constitutional principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia) and to the principle of equal protection of the rights of the injured party (Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). <p/> The reality in the field of compensation litigation is that courts generally award compensation several years after a claim has been lodged. This reality means that, in the area of data on damages awarded by the courts, they reflect, among other things, a measure of the time lag between the moment of the decision and the occurrence of the damage. In other words, the amounts of damages awarded, which the Court used for comparison purposes, also took into account the factor of waiting for compensation as an important element. <p/> Since neither the grounds on which the revision was brought nor the grounds which the Court of Review is required to take into account of its own motion are present, the Court of Review dismissed the revision (Article 378 of the Civil Procedure Code). <p/> Footnote (1): The case-law on the issue of shared causation has been settled by a legal opinion adopted at the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia on 15.12.1998, Legal Opinions II/98, page 12.",Legal/Regulation,dev
198,"12.5.2014 <p/> The healing properties of yoghurt <p/> Yoghurt is very healthy as it is full of calcium and protein, and is easier for our bodies to digest than milk. <p/> 1. Yoghurt is an excellent source of calcium and protein. Calcium is needed for healthy bones, so yoghurt should be consumed especially by the young and the elderly. In addition, yoghurt contains twice as much protein as milk, which our bodies need to function properly. <p/> 2. If our digestive system is healthy, it will absorb all the vitamins, minerals and other substances it needs from food. But for the digestive system to function properly, we also need food to keep it healthy. Yoghurt is one of the foods that has the most positive effect on our digestion, so make sure you include it regularly in your diet. <p/> 3. Yoghurt also boosts the immune system as it contains cultures of living organisms. These boost our body's defences, so when we are stressed or it is cold outside, we should eat yoghurt to protect our bodies against illness. <p/> 4. Some people find milk very difficult to digest because of the lactose. Yoghurt contains much less of it and scientists have shown that this makes it easier to digest. So anyone with digestive problems should eat at least one plain yoghurt a day.",Promotion of a Product,dev
203,"How does Daddy come into being? <p/>Fatherhood and motherhood are two emotionally completely incomparable and irreplaceable roles, which no one can replace and which are unique. A wife can never make a husband a father unless he chooses to do so and develops fatherhood himself. <p/> Every adult man carries within him the potential to become a father. What is more, nature has equipped the child with everything he needs to communicate to his father and mother how each of them should take care of him. With its smallness, softness, smiles, shaky cries and amorous glances, it arouses in the adult woman an irresistible impulse to lift the child up in her arms and respond to it, and in the adult man a strong impulse to protect and defend this creature. And this is the very foundation of parenthood. <p/> The mother cannot replace the father and vice versa <p/> The child therefore receives a different kind of validation and a different sense of belonging and uniqueness from the father than from the mother. Which means that even a father who feels well for his children and is tender and motherly with them cannot replace the mother, just as a mother cannot replace the father, however determined, organised, physically active and proud she may be. Therefore, a father cannot learn fatherhood from his mother and vice versa. He has to find out for himself, with each child, how he can be the best father for that particular child at that particular time and in that particular family, what that particular child needs most from him, what he wants to express and what is in him but cannot get out of him. <p/> The father-child relationship <p/> The father-child relationship is established from a very early age and is important for both the child and the father. Children are strongly attached to their father from the very beginning. It is precisely because of the differences in the way the child interacts with each parent that fathers play a completely unique and crucial role in the child's socialisation. Fathers play with their children, stimulating them physically and mentally and guiding them towards new activities. Above all, they protect them! The ability to create a secure home is the cornerstone of fatherhood. <The child associates the father with new experiences, with spontaneity and with challenges. They easily become interested in such a father and a reciprocal relationship develops quickly in such circumstances. During the first three years, the father's sensitivity, cooperation and support during joint play are particularly important in the child's later perception of close relationships. His sensitivity during play gives the child a sense of respect and support, understanding the toddler's needs for exploration and contributing to a feeling of competence. Playing with a father who participates, who notices challenges and who encourages the child to challenge, solve and explore, the child develops a sense of importance, uniqueness, trust and belonging to his father. <p/> Daddy does things differently <p/> However, many times it is very difficult for dads to watch mummy looking after the child, finding herself and him feeling awkward and unable to build such a strong and warm bond with the child. He cannot imitate her, because he can never do something like a mother, because he is not a mother. But he can find his own way around her, which will be just as reassuring and just as interesting for the child. This means that he should learn to change in a way that is most pleasant for him and for the child, that he should calm down in a way that calms him, that he should play and have fun in a way that is also fun for him and that makes him feel that the child is comfortable around him and that he can be proud of his father. Fatherhood develops separately from motherhood, the only common point being the partnership relationship, which, if it is secure and confidential, eases a lot of pain, distress and insecurity because the partners can talk about it. <p/> Mothers, tell your man you need him! <p/> Men are far from immune to babies! They are just as vulnerable as they are. Men cry too, but with silence, withdrawal, ... out of a need to belong. A wife can tell her husband to hold the baby, to swaddle it. She can tell him that she needs him. What is more, she must make sure that she is always relaxed enough to be with the child, which means that she also needs his help to get dressed in peace, to eat her lunch in peace, to take a nap if she is exhausted. <p/> Every normal man and father is proud if he makes his wife happy, if he protects her and if his child loves him. Fathers are proud when they put their child to sleep, when they feel how important, beautiful, clever and interesting they are to the child. Husbands can therefore very well introduce children to their chores, to their world, because the child will be amazed by everything, the keys on the computer, the screwdriver, a piece of wood, a book, everything that Daddy does will be sacred to him. When Daddy shows the child what he is doing, what he is interested in, when the child is able to ""help"" him, it will be a great honour for the child, and the man will experience his chores in a completely different way. <p/> Contact with the child is important <p/> The basis of survival today is contact, emotional attunement. If parents cannot provide this for the child, it is a great deficit for the child. It is very difficult to live with such a deficit in the world, because he or she is not good at relationships. <p/> If the partner is afraid of contact with the child (for example, if he refuses to change the baby because he is afraid he will do something wrong), the child's mother is best helped if she can put a humorous spin on it, e.g. if she dares to confide that this father loves her child as much as she loves him. This is the only way that the baby's mother will be able to relax around the baby's father and the baby and live her motherhood to the full, not in bitterness and anger at the baby's father who ""chose not"" to take care of the baby for his own sake, not because she is so incompetent. <p/> Parenting is learned alongside the child and making mistakes is not necessarily a bad thing <p/> Do not be afraid if you do not know everything at the beginning, if you do not know your way around, if you feel helpless. The child has everything it needs to awaken the right response in the parents. A child's nature is made to ""teach"" parents. You can only become a mother and a father by your child's side from moment to moment, not in advance or with the help of a book. As the child develops, so you develop with him as a father and as a mother. That is why the first condition for this development is precisely physical presence. Even if the mother develops a strong contact with the child, the father will have to develop his contact with the child from the beginning, not from where the mother came from. <p/> It is not at all good for the child to have a mother and father who think that they have to do everything right and that they are doing as it says in the book, not as it is written in the concrete child. There is only so much contact with the child before the parents have to develop new ideas, new words, coaxing, comforting and playfulness around the child. The child likes parents who are distracted and learning on the fly, and it is best for the child if the parents acknowledge this helplessness and confusion and know for each other that they can only manage what is emerging on the fly. A child does not need ideal parents, but parents with whom he or she can observe how they invent, how they create, how they find their way. It is a very good feeling for a child to feel that his parents are developing alongside him, that they are changing alongside him, not that they were perfect to begin with, so it is up to him to adapt to them as quickly as possible. <p/> Talk and cooperate! <p/> It is important for the child that the father is happy, that he has a lot of energy, that he is glowing, that she can feel in his eyes that he is alive. This means that he needs to talk to his wife about his fears and insecurities, so that they can talk together, figure out how to move forward together. The ability to confront feelings, to find new solutions, to be flexible and creative develops most easily where a man and a woman are safe around each other and do not make excuses for each other. Then the child will call out for more and more discoveries and will continually reward both father and mother with its own development. This will make them each feel adequate, creative and content, which in turn will help them to be more connected and trusting towards each other. Then both of them will be able to be more and more sensitive, relaxed and loving around the baby, and their relationship with each other will grow ""unintentionally"". <p/> Fatherhood and motherhood develop most fully where a man and a woman are able to work together. A man can only become a father when he has developed his masculine identity to the point where he feels what the child needs from him as a man. In cases where the father does not decide to become a father and does not enter the family emotionally and actively, and consequently the mother takes over the whole parenting role and tries to emotionally take over and fill the father's role as well, it quickly happens that she also loses contact with the children. Fatherhood is the father's sole responsibility and motherhood the mother's sole responsibility. We cannot destroy each other's parenthood, but we can make each other so bitter that we do not even want to look for a parental role anymore. That is an injustice to the child. Parents deserve to feel fully each other's parenthood, but even more deserve to feel that the child loves them and that they are capable of loving the child too. <p/> So let mothers be mothers and fathers be fathers.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

211,"Fortune Telling - Tricks Revealed <p/> Man has always been curious about what the future holds. In the past - and still today for some primitive peoples - the future was foretold from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, but today we have a variety of divination techniques at our disposal: the horoscope, the crystal ball, palm or coffee grounds divination, numerology, charts, runes and the list goes on and on. Is it just a good trick or does fortune-telling really predict the future? <p/> "" A sucker is born every minute "" <p/> is a statement attributed to P. T. Barnum, an American entertainer and businessman who was famous for his pranks. The Barnum effect, on which fortune-telling is based, is named after him. It is the idea that a person recognises his own personality traits in common or stereotypical descriptions of personality. He even finds the descriptions incredibly true for him! <p/> Divination is often based on claims that cannot be verified or disputed, e.g. "" You have great potential within you .""; "" You have a need to be liked .""; describes characteristics that are typical of a certain age, gender or status e.g. a fortune teller tells an elderly woman that her hearing is probably deteriorating and she will need a hearing aid predicts events that will happen to each of us sooner or later e.g. "" You will soon receive an interesting phone call ."". The word ""sometimes"" is often used in predictions e.g. "" Sometimes you say what you think clearly, but sometimes you bite your tongue to avoid resentment."" <p/> Divination is more convincing when it involves personal information: name, date of birth, date of marriage, etc. It is also important that divination evokes a sense of magic or special energies, e.g. divination using magic crystals. For example, dressing in magical clothes or in a cloak that reflects negative energy adds a special impression of magic. <p/> The use of unusual or repetitive hand movements, steady strokes or sounds serves to bring the divination into a trance state where the individual is even more receptive to what is being said. <p/> When the prediction comes true <p/> The fortune teller has told us what is in store for us, and then we go out into the world with this knowledge. When we expect something to happen, even completely unrelated and coincidental events can be perceived as connected. For example, a fortune teller tells you: "" You are going to have a car accident because of a flat tyre, you better not drive your car for a while. ""Just in case, you really don't get behind the wheel. A week later, your friend tells you that the last time he had a flat tyre, he narrowly avoided a collision. "" The guessing paid off! Good thing I wasn't driving! "", you utter, relieved that you have perceived two coincidental events as connected. <p/> Fortune-telling skills <p/> Good language skills are important for fortune-telling. A fortune teller speaks clearly, fluently and quickly enough that you cannot hear your own thoughts or reach out to him. At times he makes a claim and waits for your response. If you agree with the claim, he will reinforce it in the future. If you disagree, he will take the conversation in a different direction. Sometimes he will only make part of the claim and it is up to you to complete it as you see fit. <p/> A fortune teller must also be a good observer. He or she needs to recognise what you are communicating through your posture and facial expressions, what your clothes and fashion accessories say about you, your status and your lifestyle. Based on these insights, the fortune teller will be able to choose expressions that are even more suited to you. <p/> Fortune-telling is also helpful to the individual <p/> When fortune-telling predicts pleasant events and the successful achievement of goals, it can have a very motivating effect on the individual. He or she will embark on the journey to achieve his or her goals with confidence, working harder and better, as all his or her energy will be directed towards the goal. <p/> Divination can show a person a new way of looking at a problem and new solutions that they would not have thought of on their own. <p/> Is it possible to predict the future? <p/> So far, no divination has accurately predicted the future - so the claims could be scientifically verified. Perhaps in the future, as humanity comes to new knowledge, this will also be possible. But for now, keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket and your hand on your wallet, as the psychologist M. H. Birnbaum wrote.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
221,"Where did the... domestic pasture go... <p/> Who doesn't remember the sweet sixties? A period of optimism, good humour and progress in all fields, every day. I'm thinking from a purely consumerist point of view, post festum of course, because like most of you I wasn't born yet. But with all these revivals and golden memories, I have utopically recalled that time when mass consumption went the other way. <p/> This time the Magdalene is a green square box, clumsily and naively designed for today, but interesting precisely because of this immediacy. The round title has mythological proportions and the black and white symbolic photograph shows nothing of sentimentality but the triumph of technology. However, since the scripture is not intended for design dogmas, I will abbreviate. Titania is the name of the product and it is a handmade macchino per pasta. <p/> My grandmother gave me this metal beast because she knows I like to cook. The seller's internal stamp shows that it was bought on 9 May 1968 in the shop 'La Casalinga' in Gorizia. Although I have never seen either my grandmother or my mother make pasta themselves - with or without a pasta maker - I have made one quite solid pasta from the first one. <p/> The process goes like this. First, the home-made dough is pushed through two rotating rollers, which roll the dough evenly into strips. Repeat the process, if necessary, with a narrower gap between the two rollers, depending on the type of pasta you want. Then pass the strips through the second spout, turn the crank and watch with glowing hearts the culinary miracle - noodles coming out the other side. Ugh, haute cuisine. <p/> Pasta is not exactly Slovenia's national dish and it arrived on the shelves relatively late. As I have gleaned from the web, the Mlinotest pasta factory was built in the late 1950s (proudly made since 1958). Housewives were stretching and drying simple noodles in their backyards long before that, since a product made of flour, eggs and water is a generic phenomenon rather than the alchemist's secret of a lodge of freebooters. <p/> If there is one product from our culinary treasure chest that is anti-potentine, it is the miller. They are made from rolled-out dough that has been baked in a whole piece in a bread oven, usually after baking bread. The baked dough was broken into larger pieces, soaked in water and thickened with whatever gravel was on hand. <p/> Since we don't usually have bread ovens at home, we can fascinate our invited guests with home-made pasta and hum a light Italian canzone as we turn the crank. Or spin a bouquet of evergreen Slovenian songs. Remember, we're in the sixties.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
224,"I propose to the Government of Slovenia that, in the event of any illiquidity or insolvency, it should call in a popular loan of EUR 5 billion at 5% interest per annum. The moratorium on payment is 5 years and then payment of principal and interest in 5 annual instalments. <p/> The above-mentioned People's Loan shall be duly presented in the mass media and in all media in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and citizens shall be called upon to do their utmost to help preserve the financial sovereignty of the country. <p/> All citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and all legal entities with their registered office in the Republic of Slovenia are eligible to contribute. <p/> We know from the past that we have already had similar people's loans (the Skopje earthquake, the Austro-Hungarian road loan, the famous war loans, etc.). <p/> Having said that, I would like to point out that the first way to save the banks is to sell their own assets (redundant offices, business premises, union tourism facilities in spas and by the sea and in the mountains) and to pledge and secure the claims of legal and natural persons (flats, houses, businesses, etc.), and then the state should come to the rescue. It is also necessary to limit the salaries of managers in all state-owned companies and institutions to no more than the salary of the President of the country, the Prime Minister... No one can have more, least of all the quasi-experts. For example, the director of NKBM last year reported an annual income of over 270 000 euros, the bank is in the red, Mr Kramar from Izlak has a 1 million euro bonus for 5 years of management plus salary, and NLB has almost 2 billion bad loans, which it is utopian to believe will ever be repaid. If we are playing such games and delusional thinking, all the measures taken by the government and the savings made by all the employees are meaningless. Or the recently published report by the Court of Auditors that the investment in 2 blocks for 170 prisoners at Dob Prison has risen from EUR 6 million to EUR 87 million. Of course, no one will be held accountable, and we will not show the door to any of the 'experts'. It just happens. As long as we do, we will be in for a dive. Do you remember that the Yugoslav Royal Government fled to London in 1941 with tens of tonnes of the country's gold reserves. Today, of course, I do not mean the government, which is doing its best (a few years too late, unfortunately, because we all dreamt of a success story), but individual entrepreneurs, managers and directors. Where will you go, gentlemen? <p/> When the Austrian lands (of which today's Slovenia was a part) were threatened by the Turkish menace, they took away the bells and the silver and gold mass chalices and ritual utensils from the churches, they burned the mass coats in which the gold and silver threads were knitted, they introduced an anti-Turkish tax. The Tlacian Raj, as well as the local feudal lords, groaned under the weight of the burden imposed on them by the imperial office in Vienna. But we escaped the Turkish threat and the Ottoman yoke, with enormous human and material losses that would be felt for decades and centuries to come. So today, if we come together as we did in 1991, we are able to preserve the financial sovereignty of the R.S.S.R. Look, Greece has received and will receive more than €100 billion in aid (I don't know how it will pay it back, probably never! ). Its richest citizens alone have almost €200 billion invested in foreign banks. No comment is needed here. <p/> For me, the financial sovereignty of our country is not something that I would be prepared to sacrifice for. I am sure that the gentlemen from Brussels will manage our money better than our politicians do. As for the Greeks and their money, they are usually successful businessmen, and they are by no means stupid enough to buy in bulk the bonds of a country that is likely to go bankrupt within a few months. <p/> There are more than enough funds in the accounts of R Slovenia residents to sort things out (at least for now! ) on our own without asking for foreign help. But our citizens also have bank accounts in banks in Austria, Liechtenstein, etc. If everyone contributes as much as they can, the matter is solved. We can also guarantee our citizens the eventual sale of Telekom, Petrol, etc., so that they know that they will get their money back in any case. Bonds could be subscribed for at the counters of banks, post offices, administrative units, etc. This is not quite the same as buying treasury bills and the like. With my proposal, we would be buying our country's financial independence and, therefore, our future. Why have money in a sock or in the bank at 2% interest and know that you have done something good for yourself, your children and the whole country of R Slovenia by paying into the People's Loan. That's how it is. This should be an all-Slovenian action, like the signing of the May Day Declaration or something similar during the Austro-Hungarian period. But as I said, no one in state-owned or majority state-owned companies can have a salary higher than the President of the Republic, the Government, etc. (that's 65 pay grade). If we do not solve this problem too, we will have done nothing. There will always be leeches who will try to suckle at the state teat. I would not discuss the professionalism of these gentlemen, otherwise we would not be where we are, which is nowhere. The way they have run things, they would be any economics graduate who takes up his first job as a trainee. I think that he would have been driven by his profession and the professional challenge, whereas these gentlemen were driven solely by the drive for money. <p/> The Government regularly issues bonds. Any EU citizen or company can open a company here and buy the bonds mentioned in the proposal. So they would be no different from other bonds. This government, which is now ""trying its best"", has only recently blocked the much-needed reforms of the previous government through referendums.... in some cases practically the same laws as it is now proposing. Let's not forget this.... Given the way our politicians view the benefit of the state, in fact, coercive administration by Brussels seems to me to be a better idea by the day. As much damage as our own politicians are doing to us, those in Brussels certainly will not do it.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
225,"16 March 2010 - We have just five years to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is therefore calling for world leaders to adopt a global action plan at the UN Summit in New York this September to accelerate the achievement of these goals. <p/> ""We must not disappoint the millions of people who look to the international community to deliver on its promises in the Millennium Declaration. Let us come together in September to deliver on those promises,"" Ban said in his Keeping the Promise report, released today. <p/> For the Millennium Development Goals Summit on 20-22 September, the report will serve as the basis for intergovernmental agreements on the Summit's outcome document. The report identifies success factors, good practices, highlights gaps, highlights future challenges and makes proposals for action to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs over the last five years. Further complementary reports are expected, including an annex to the Secretary-General's report in April with basic statistics on the implementation of the MDGs. A more detailed report with statistics on the implementation of the Goals will follow in June, followed by an overall assessment of the shortcomings of international cooperation in early September. <p/> ""We have the knowledge and the resources to achieve the Millennium Goals,"" Ban stressed in his report, referring to the goals of the Millennium Declaration of 2000, which aim to end poverty, hunger, disease and significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by 2015. <p/> The report notes that some countries have made great strides in overcoming extreme poverty and hunger, increasing school enrolment and child health, expanding access to safe drinking water, strengthening control of malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and expanding access to HIV treatment (for more information, see Millennium Development Goals: A stocktaking exercise). <p/>These successes are being seen in some of the poorest countries, proving that the MDGs are indeed achievable if we have the right policies, the right level of investment and international support. <p/> Progress has not been the same everywhere, however, and the report predicts that many countries will not reach the goals. The greatest challenges are faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, and countries facing internal unrest. <p/> The report points out that the MDGs are not being missed because the targets are unachievable or there is too little time, but rather because of unfulfilled promises, inadequate funding and a lack of accountability. The result is a failure to provide financial incentives, services, technical support and appropriate partnerships. As a result, progress in poverty eradication has been unacceptably slow, and some of the hard-won successes are being eroded by the food and financial crises. <p/> Good practices <p/> Global action to achieve the MDGs has been underway for almost ten years and a number of good practices have emerged. The most important of these are development plans at national level. Successful countries are pursuing a pragmatic policy mix, focusing on their own development capacities. International development cooperation needs to support more intensively such national development strategies and actions to strengthen their own development capacities. <p/> Of course we need economic growth, but it is not the only condition for progress. Growth must be inclusive and equitable if we are to achieve optimal poverty reduction and real progress towards the MDGs. <p/> Hard-won progress can be undone by economic and other shocks. Countries need forward-looking macroeconomic policies that can promote balanced growth across the board. For example, the Millennium Goals can be achieved through sustained public investment and development strategies designed accordingly, and universal social protection. <p/> The report stresses that financing for the MDGs must start 'at home'. Developing countries must raise and allocate their revenues accordingly, and donor countries must deliver on their promises to increase ODA. Although development aid reached its peak in 2008, countries are still largely failing to deliver on their development aid promises. <p/> Countries pledged around USD 154 billion in ODA at the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and have not kept their promises. They have under-pledged by $35 billion a year and under-pledged by $20 billion for Africa. ""If promises are not kept, the poor suffer and die in even greater numbers,"" the report points out. <p/> The report outlines a number of promising government proposals to ensure adequate funding for the MDGs, including a new financing mechanism for better health systems and a new global approach to food security, which was elaborated at the 2009 G8 meeting in L'Aquila. These proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible if we are to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and lay a solid foundation for the G8 and G20 meetings in Canada in June 2010. <p/> At the same time, innovative financing schemes must continue to be developed and the MDG Summit in September this year must establish a transparent mechanism to promote the delivery of global development aid pledges. Such a mechanism must have its own action plan with timetables, forms of monitoring and enforcement. <p/> UN Secretary-General Ban calls for a new 'compact' that is not just government-led, but inclusive of all stakeholders, developed and developing countries, civil society organisations, private business, philanthropy and multilateral systems. Each of these stakeholders must strive to make the most efficient use of its own resources. They must act effectively and collectively. This September, the Summit will officially take place as a high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. It will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen collective action and partnerships to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. <p/> ""In September, we will come together to build on the achievements of the past years and to address the existing gaps. We have a shared responsibility to shape a better future for generations to come,"" the Secretary-General stressed. ""Achieving the MDGs is only possible by delivering on our promises, with the right policies, financial incentives and sustained action.""",Opinionated News,dev

He made his first radio steps at Radio Brežice, where he was a well-known radio voice for many years, especially for his well-known annual concert show Z lojtrco pod okence. <p/> At the first board meeting of the year, we decided to organise a general assembly, which will take place on Friday 28 January at 7 pm at the Grandvid Hotel on Dolenjska cesta 336 in Ljubljana. In the first part of our meeting we will confirm the Fan Club's organs and agree on this year's activities. Afterwards, the Grandvid Family Hotel staff will provide refreshments. The music will be provided by the Stank Petrich ensemble. The thread will be in the hands of Franc Pestotnik Podokničar. <p/> On Saturday evening, the traditional Rešeto domačih event took place in the well-filled hall of the Ribnica Sports Centre. Several local music groups performed on stage, while ensembles from other parts of Slovenia also enriched the event.

The project aims to make key medical data available for the healthcare of citizens seeking medical assistance in another European country, while respecting the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy. <p/> As European citizens become increasingly mobile, travelling and working abroad more and more, they increasingly need medical assistance abroad. In order to provide quality medical treatment, the doctor abroad also needs the patient's vital health information. Modern information technology has long allowed authorised health professionals to access important health data collected in the patient's home country, based on the patient's consent. This is why many initiatives have been launched in Europe to create the right environment and conditions to make use of such technical possibilities for the benefit of better healthcare for European citizens. <p/> The epSOS project involves 47 partners from 20 European Union (EU) countries and three non-EU countries. The aim of the project is to carry out pilot projects to establish two cross-border services - the transmission of summary patient data and e-prescribing and e-medication. Therefore, the key tasks will be to organise the relevant legal bases in each participating country, to ensure an appropriate organisation of the work and to put in place the technical solutions. The initial phase of the project will test the feasibility and acceptability of the general-technical, organisational and legal coherence of the proposed solutions. The epSOS services, which include patient summaries and e-prescribing/e-dispensing, will be available on a trial basis in some countries already at the end of this year. <p/> Slovenia will test data exchange in 2012, probably first with Austria and Slovakia. <p/> For more information in English on epSOS, please visit the project website www.epsos.eu.",Information/Explanation,dev

Representatives of the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, the Social Welfare Institute of the Republic of Slovenia and individual social work centres presented the National Programme for Social Welfare 2013 - 2020 (NPSV), the process of preparation and the indicative content of the regional implementation plans that will concretise the NPSV for each region, as well as the social situation in the regions. The participants (CSDs, municipalities, NGOs and other providers of social protection services) highlighted the needs of different users. <p/> According to the NPSV, the regional implementation plans should be formulated by the end of this year. However, as the MoLSA intends to finance the expansion of the network of providers at local level from European structural funds, for which the relevant documents need to be prepared earlier, intensive preparation of both the national and all regional implementation plans will take place over the summer and early autumn. <p/> During the consultations, participants agreed that over the summer, the implementers by sector (i.e. CSDs together, municipalities together and NGOs together) will draw up a list of needs and priorities, which will be brought together and considered at the September workshops. <p/>We therefore call on all NGOs working in the field of social protection in each region to send us the below by the end of July 2013: - the needs that should be addressed as a priority in their region by 2016, - define and argue for priority areas within the network of services and programmes where the needs of users in the region remain unmet and the network will need to be expanded, - identify ways and resources to expand the network by 2016 (look at what is already in place, what needs to be upgraded, what needs to be newly established and what financial resources are needed to do so).",Call,dev

257,"London - David Beckham has put together the perfect eleven for the World Cup. Beckham had to say goodbye to the England national team because of injury, but he still accompanied the players to South Africa and kept an eye on the action at the World Cup. He put together what he considered to be the ideal squad for the British media, including players from Uruguay, Ghana, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and England. <p/> London - The English Football Association (FA) has not terminated its cooperation with England's selector Fabio Capello, despite the national team's failure at the World Cup. Capello will therefore retain his role as selector despite the humiliating loss of the England squad to Germany 4-1 in the quarter-finals of the World Cup in South Africa. <p/> London - Two days before England's World Cup elimination, tired English football star Wayne Rooney has booked flights for a weekend holiday on the Caribbean island of Barbados. The British media have picked up the information and are reporting another of their ball-playing scandals. <p/> London - The England national team returned to the UK this morning with their heads bowed. The players, visibly tired and out of sorts, landed at Heatrow Airport at 6.20 am. <p/> The two teams with the most supporters at the World Cup said goodbye to the World Cup in the eighth round, which is also a blow to South Africa's tourism economy. There were more than 50 000 English people here, and only a few fewer Americans, both of whom are very good consumers. This also applies to Slovenians, of whom there were around 1 000. Now the Germans have the biggest fan army, with 13 000 visitors, and some of them will travel to the big quarter-final match against Argentina. <p/> At Frank Lampard's shot, Fabio Capello (pictured) crossed his fingers and celebrated the equaliser, but only moments later he realised that the referee had disallowed the goal. The cajoling didn't help and England never got back into the game. Worse: it was a disaster. <p/> Johannesburg - Journalists from many countries around the world were surprised and horrified when the English Football Association held a press conference lasting just 5 minutes and 12 seconds before the World Cup eighth-final match against the Germans at 16:00 today. <p/> The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, spent a long hour in Parliament yesterday explaining the ""emergency"" budget that will force all the Islanders, from the Queen downwards, to tighten their belts... But then what!

Their faith in their football gods may be restored not only by victory but by the ""destruction"" of the Slovenians in tomorrow's World Cup match. <p/> Rustenburg - Speaking to English journalists, England international Frank Lampard distanced himself from John Terry's remarks against selector Fabio Capello, saying that there was no collective rebellion among the players against the coach. ""Everything is overblown. I am not a rebel and there is no rebellion,"" said the 32-year-old Chelsea player. <p/> England defender John Terry is demanding that Joe Cole plays in the final Group C match against Slovenia, where England desperately need a win to progress. ""Cole and Wayne Rooney are the only two in our squad who can tear down the opposition defence,"" the Chelsea captain said in Rustenburg on Sunday. <p/> Johannesburg - After the match against Algeria, the England national team management is unhappy with some of Capello's decisions and the players have lost confidence. Capello needs to revise his tactics and ""restore hope"" to the players before the Slovenia game. <p/> Cape Town - After the 0-0 draw with Algeria, English football star Wayne Rooney, frustrated by the booing of the fans, kicked a pitch-side camera and, in his first statements, accused the fans of letting the team down. But after a night's sleep, he apologised to them, saying his behaviour was the result of great frustration. <p/> Johannesburg - Germany's Francz Beckenbauer, a legend of world football, was not gentle with England's Fabio Capello and English football in general after the 1-1 World Cup Group C opener between England and the USA - Slovenia are top of the group after their win over Algeria. <p/> Two days before England's first appearance at this year's World Cup, against the USA, England's selector Fabio Capello had already decided which 11 players would take the field first.

262,"News <p/> Archive <p/> Data protection with second-generation deduplication technology <p/> Monday 13 August 2012 <p/> Proper data protection is like an insurance policy. Most of the time it is not cashed in, but it is crucial if problems or damage actually occur. The cost of ""insurance"" in data protection is not only the cost of the equipment and its maintenance, but also the negative impact on business processes if, for example, archiving or restoring data takes too long, if data in remote locations of the company is not adequately protected, or if things are simply not regulated according to the law. <p/> As a direct response to these issues, technologies emerged a few years ago that have had a significant impact on improving archiving processes. In addition to the significant cheapening of hard disks, the development of data deduplication technology has been crucial. While the first generation of this technology brought some benefits to users, it was known even then that most of its potential still lay ahead. HP's deduplication development strategy was launched in 2010 and today the second generation of deduplication delivers improvements in areas such as performance, scalability and data management. StoreOne technology, as it is called, is based on a single deduplication algorithm developed in HP labs and runs on all HP hardware and software data protection solutions. In other words, deduplication technology can be implemented on the HP B6000, HP D2D2500 and HP D2D4000 series of products, and is fully supported by HP Data Protector archive software. A quick look at the main competitor, EMC, quickly reveals that its solutions are based on three mutually incompatible platforms (Data Domain, Avamar, Celerra) (Edison Group report, 2011), which is a stark difference to the single, unified architecture offered by HP.<p>Where does the shoe pinch the hardest when it comes to data protection? <p/> There is a general consensus that the following areas are particularly critical in relation to data protection, and that they weigh on users in one way or another: <p/> Time windows available for archiving <p/> The biggest challenge is to archive more and more data in less and less time. HP is responding to this with what it calls a ""scale-out"" architecture, which allows users to buy only the capacity and performance they really need, rather than having to buy both categories in stock. At the moment, HP's scale-up ends with 768 TB of gross capacity and an archiving speed of around 100 TB/hour. <p/> Data recovery after catastrophic events <p/> It is essential that data is stored in locations that allow it to be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event. There are a number of options for data replication over low bandwidth data links, as only deduplicated data travels between sites. StoreOnce technology allows data deduplication to happen wherever it is desired, either directly at the application or source where the data originates, at the archive server, or directly on the device where the data is stored. Deduplication can, of course, happen before the data is transferred from one location to another, so multiple copies of the same data can be archived in multiple locations at the same time. <p/> Protecting data in remote locations <p/> For companies that operate in multiple locations or even in multiple countries and continents, data is widely dispersed and often not sufficiently protected. With StoreOnce technology, data can be accessed or restored from a central location, no matter where it is. <p/> Data recovery capabilities <p/> Investing in archive solutions means nothing if data cannot be recovered in a reasonable time. Most vendors still focus mainly on archiving capacity, but forget about recovery and usually do not even publish this information to avoid embarrassment. HP's solutions are very much at the forefront here, offering speeds of up to 30 TB/hour, the highest among comparable solutions. <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst (API toolset) is a new enhancement to archive solutions and allows deduplicated data to be moved directly from the archive application between StoreOnce systems, without the need to ""rehydrate"" it first, i.e. bring it back to a baseline state. StoreOnce Catalyst also allows replication of data from one location to multiple locations simultaneously and cascading of data between locations in a deduplicated format (leveraging narrow bandwidth connections). StoreOnce Catalyst technology is also integrated into HP Data Protector 7 software, making it particularly suitable for smaller businesses. <p/> Integration into your environment <p/> StoreOnce technology is widely supported (it is supported by a growing number of market-leading archiving software solutions), so you don't need to change archiving software if you don't want to, for example, when you buy a D2D2500 system. But if that's not a barrier, there are a number of good reasons why you should take a closer look at HP Data Protector. HP Data Protector uses the StoreOnce deduplication algorithm, which makes it easy to transfer deduplicated data to any StoreOnce hardware. <p/> 2. Data Protector supports contextual search of archived data, which means that data with specific content can be recovered, not just data with a specific naming convention (filename). This is made possible by the integrated ""Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL)"" from Autonomy, which has been under HP's umbrella for some time. <p/> What about archiving to tape? <p/> For long-term data archiving, tape drives continue to be offered in a wide variety of configurations, as there is still a significant demand for them in the market. The fact is that long-term archiving to tape is still by far the cheapest option.",Promotion of a Product,dev

At the core of this belief is the mentality that one should fight for one's own happiness or self-interest in life.

Arenas's books have been widely acclaimed in Europe and also in the United States, as Arenas's cry, echoing from Cuba, has shocked and moved many who have had the opportunity to hear the tragic story of a dissident, a defender of all forms of freedom and of different sexual orientations, the story of his life in Castro's Cuba, how he became an unwanted homosexual and a persecuted writer, and last but not least how, after 15 years of hiding, torture and life behind bars, he won his freedom and fled to the United States. <p/> 23.11.2010 <p/> Did you know that the novel We the Living by the American writer Ayn Rand was a real hit in Italy and that the Italians made a film of it in 1942, without copyright clearance? Because of its length, it was broadcast in two separate parts: We the Living (Noi vivi) and Goodbye, Kira (Addio, Kira). The fascist government approved the films because they were anti-communist. But it was immediately clear to the public that the film was as much anti-fascist as it was anti-Communist, people understood that Ayn Rand meant the story to be about the evils of any dictatorship, and they enthusiastically embraced the film as a protest against Mussolini. In mockery of him, they called themselves ""We, the dead"" (Noi morti) and Mussolini's economic policy ""Goodbye, lira"" (Addio, lira). <p/> 02.11.2010 <p/> Last year, we published Small World, a novel by the well-known Swiss writer Martin Suter, in the Bralec collection.

In the 57th minute, Ciriković reduced the deficit with a header, but in the last 15 minutes, Radommer completely outplayed the visitors and scored three times. Tirc equalised in the 78th minute, Cirikovic again for 3:2 in the 88th minute and Vrancic Nik for the final 4:2 in the 93rd minute. Congratulations to the boys and their coach Robert Majdic for the game and the three points. Next Saturday at 15:00 the B team is away at Kodeljev at Slovan and we believe that our boys can again manage to win three points. <p/> In the 10th round of 2. SNL the A team is away to Šampion at Arena Petrol. The Radomlans, who are very modest this year (only 5 points in nine meetings) and occupy the penultimate place in the standings, already competed in the first round and won with 3:0, but the meeting came at the right time again, because the boys would have boosted their confidence with a win after the draw with Krško and the defeat in Šenčur. <p/> And so it happened. Niko Snoj took a quick lead as early as the 4th minute, but the home team even led 2:1 through Škoflek and Čretnik, and from the 27th minute, when Avbelj equalised at 2:2, our team dominated the pitch. Just before the break, Smukavec took the lead with 3:2, Zalaznik scored in the 9th minute, a minute later Snoj scored his second goal to make it 5:2, and the final 6:2 was set in the 78th minute by Vrhunc Luka, who scored practically on the first touch, having entered less than a minute earlier, replacing the third goal scorer, Jernej Smukavec. <p/> Radomlans recorded their seventh win this season and with 22 points they are in second place, three points behind Dob, but they are also by far the most efficient team, as they shot 26 times, which is less than 4 times per game. <p/> Our second league team will face a big challenge on Sunday, 20.10. at 15:00, when last year's first league champion Aluminij comes to Radomlje, with a new coach Robert Pevnik, who was on the bench in Radomlje only four months ago.",Opinionated News,dev

The whole amount has to be raised by 20.5, because Dr. Paley is coming to Milan for other commitments, it is purely his will to operate Rene, he just decided to operate one child, that's how much time he will take. furthermore, one boy is already in the game, if the parents of the other boy have the money before, he will be operated and not Rene. It is now a matter of days and a large sum to raise. Negative comments only minimize the fight to save his leg. This is about a little child, not some old grandfather. It is about a child who still has his whole life ahead of him! <p/> Daniel... above is the phone from the mum, do give her a call to know for sure...

Of course we paid, but ! ! ! ! ! At that amount, we are not even worth a Slovene translation... But at all... "" our "" opinion was translated before it was sent to Boston. But the opinion from Boston made it clear that they did not deliver some of the "" foreign "" reports ! Because they asked for this and that. The child had made those enquiries, and Boston did not know about them. So... Having healthy children is a great treasure. Many parents with healthy children are probably not aware of this. <p/>I hope that everything is really going to be the best for Rene. It's already terrible that he has to go through all this, that such a young child has to go through all this - and his family with him -... But, you know, there's one other thing I remember about Rene's leg: one child I know went to the orthopaedic surgeon from the age of 6 - because one of his legs was shorter. They followed him for quite a number of years after that. They observed, they did some tests. And then once there was another doctor. And he said that he needed surgery on the tibia (shortening of the bone on one leg and that they would see him another time to find out exactly what the operation would be. At the second check-up in about two months. But at the second check-up it was the old doctor again... who just laughed at the opinion of the previous doctor... and said they would wait. Well, now it's been more than 10 years since then and this person doesn't even go for check-ups anymore, and there hasn't been any surgery either. Fortunately, it was not necessary. My mother is horrified at the thought that if the previous doctor had been back for a follow-up, the child might have been operated on.... <p/>I hope you have so much to take away that it is very clear what is really best for Rene. <p/> # 16 <p/> AMelaTalic <p/> 1 <p/> Apr 28, 2014 <p/> Ana: we also had a similar experience when we asked for an MRI, because of the ligaments and other things that are not visible on the X-ray pictures, and the doctor said that when he needed it, he would order it. :( And the ZZZS offered us 25€ to cover the examination in Belgium, which cost 500€ plus transport, accommodation,... <p/> A few years ago we were looking for a second opinion for our child abroad... it wasn't free, we had to pay for everything and when I told the doctor who arranged it all if we could get an opinion in Slovenian, she said if we paid extra. The state should be prepared to pay for such things. It pays for all sorts of nonsense... :( <p/> There is a page on fb for Rene.... (no, I didn't make it)... there will be everything you are interested in in several languages up there all the time. You can like, share, contribute with conversations, support, or just follow what's going on (to avoid misinformation, eh). Link: https: / / www.facebook.com / helpajmoreneu <p/> Hi, I'm AMela, mum from Rene. If you know anyone who would publish the story, I am willing to publish all the exams, especially the last one, in which we are advised amputation as the only treatment option! Also Paley's report, in which 100 guarantees a successful reconstruction of the leg. I cannot influence the opinion of the Health Insurance Fund, just as I cannot influence the opinion of the people, there are all sorts of us, but anyway, as far as I personally know parents with similar problems, none of them has managed to take advantage of it so far! This is yet another ugly innuendo circulating and smearing such campaigns. In any case, I doubt that anyone would publicly expose the results, their child, all their personal data, in order to then go on holiday to Hawaii. Children with special needs need a lot of money on a daily basis. I will give you a trivial example: we have one pair of shoes every 9 months paid for by the National Health Insurance Fund, and that is at an extra cost of 40! We still have the first adapted pair of shoes since birth, and the child is almost two years old! How many pairs of shoes have your children already changed in such a period, slippers, boots, etc.? ? Not to mention children who have more serious problems such as cerebral palsy and so on. If someone guarantees me from the ZZZS that they will pay all the costs of the operation (180.000) + rehabilitation + stay abroad + travel expenses, I sign immediately and I donate all the money that has accumulated so far at the same moment to the association Joyful Feet (children with cerebral palsy), or to some other child who needs an operation and is not covered by the ZZZS. I have a clear conscience, and I hope that others can say the same. I have been deciding to tell my story for a long time, having considered all the possible scenarios that could befall us in the meantime - from rejection, to partial co-financing, even daring to dream that there will be someone who will pay for everything and I will finally be able to breathe easy and take the next step without this financial burden standing around my neck. This is about a child, thank you to all of you who are helping us and who will continue to help us, and if anyone needs any more papers, documents, proof, my contact details, address, telephone, e-mail are posted above, I will send them without any problems. Greetings, AMela <p/> The whole process is described daily by my mum Amela on her fb wall. She also has all the documents, not me. The health service here would only cover an amputation, which is what she was advised. But for the surgery abroad, they are squinting and saying that she will get an answer in (the legally required? ) 60 days. And even that may only be a fraction, a percentage. As for the rest.... the campaign is in full swing, the blog is just my modest contribution to the mosaic. <p/> Give a little more information. There have been quite a few cases recently where parents had the option of covering the costs through the NHIF, but still raised the money and then spent people's contributions on "" their own "". To avoid this, I advise you to calm down a bit and try to publish as many documents as possible (refusals, decisions) so that people will dare to transfer money. If the case is really as you describe it, it is necessary to involve journalists and make the matter public (Tednik, for example). I write in good faith that something will come of it, otherwise nothing will! <p/> But would at least one of those who have 10 million in assets, or 5 million in cash in foreign banks and safe-deposit boxes (eh, Milan) at least donate 10,000 euros in aid? Will it work? It will be easier to croak. I guarantee him that he will die easier!",Forum,dev

The investment consists of the redevelopment of the Cash & Carry store, worth 46,498,883 tolars, and the investment in the store equipment is 19,500,000 tolars. As we have assessed that no significant structural interventions are necessary in the existing building, only the partition walls between the supporting columns have been partially demolished in order to improve the visibility of the store. The Hura! discount store measures 1,035 m2, of which the sales area is 656 m2 and the rest consists of a warehouse, two cold stores, two cloakrooms, toilets, corridors and technical rooms. <p/> 50 parking spaces will be available for customers. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> The following day, 16 December, the Hura! discount store will open its doors in Cerknica at 25 Cesta 4. maja.The investment in the Hura! discount store in Cerknica represents the redevelopment of the Mercator supermarket on the ground floor of the multi-storey building of the UE Cerknica, and its value amounts to 40,411,980 tolars, including equipment. The area of the Hura! discounter is 719 m2, of which 405 m2 is sales area, the rest consists of warehouses, separate changing rooms, toilets for employees, a cleaning room, an office and technical premises. <p/> There are 40 parking spaces in front of the shop. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> Customers will be able to choose from more than 1,100 products from all product groups in both stores, with a larger selection of products in the beverages, basic foods, washing powders and stationery ranges. There will also be products from other product groups, such as packaged fresh meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables, packaged bread and bread products, sweet and savoury products, spices, personal care products, small animals, etc. <p/> Both the Hura! discount in Murska Sobota and the Hura! discount in Cerknica will have two cash registers equipped with a POS system, and customers will be able to pay with cash, debit cards and Mercator vouchers. <p/> The two stores will employ 6 people each, bringing the total number of employees in the Hura! discount chain to 27 since 9 September, when the first Hura! discount store in Ljubljana opened its doors. <p/> With the opening of Hura! discounters, Mercator is following the trends in retail development and, above all, the expectations of customers in the design of sales formats aimed at basic supplies. Market research on attitudes towards hard discounters shows that in all markets where Mercator already operates, a high proportion of customers are in favour of discounters. Based on these findings and the trends in the offer, we have assessed that there is potential for the development of this type of store format. We expect that the expansion of the Hura! discount retail chain in Slovenia in the next few years will lead to a significant market share among discount providers. The guiding principle behind the design of Hura! discounters is to offer customers quality products from lesser-known brands, the main characteristic of which is price competitiveness, while creating as simple, yet comfortable and friendly shopping environment for the customer as possible.",Information/Explanation,dev
322,"Sculpture <p/> 13.03.2014 <p/> by Gregor Šket <p/> A sensual body, full curves, a carefully calculated geometry based on the ellipse. A long nose that hides something strong and big inside. The nostril flirts with infinity without beginning or end. The rear is elegantly muscular and subtly erotic. Technique: sculpture in iron, dimensions: 4453x1657x1273 mm, by Sir William Lyons, Malcom Sayer, William M. Heynes, vintage: 1961-1974. This is what it says on the plaque marking one of their greatest exhibits, a four-wheeled sculpture, the Jaguar XKE, E-Type, in the department of MoMA, New York's Museum of Modern Art. And MoMA only has six cars: a jeep willis, a Smart, a Cistalia 202 GT, a Ferrari Formula 1 641/2, a Volkswagen Beetle and the Jaguar e-type, which was added to the collection in 1996. <p/> But it has been clear since its birth that the e-type is a speciality that is actually much more than just a car. After all, Enzo Ferrari knew it as soon as he saw it. It wasn't easy for him. He must have swallowed his saliva with great difficulty, but sportingly admitted: ""This is the most beautiful car ever made! ""It is hard to imagine how much strength and trampled pride it took for the great Il Commendatore to pay such a flattering tribute to a car that was not from the Apennine Peninsula but from the British Isles. Somehow, he was saying what has always been known anyway: with all due respect to the Germans, only the Apennine Peninsula and the British Isles can make really good supercars. From today's point of view, the irony is that series production of cars in both centres of super-sport has virtually come to a standstill, or at least is in a very difficult situation that smacks of perpetual decline. <p/> A symbol of the 1960s <p/> At the end of the 1950s, following their success at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Jaguar's engineers, developers and designers were tasked with creating an all-new sports two-seater to replace the legendary XK150. In 1957, the E1A prototype was created, but it was only available for factory testing. Three years later, the E2A prototype followed and achieved some racing success. When the carpet was unveiled at a press conference at the Parc des Eaux Vives restaurant in Geneva on 15 March 1961, the gathering was breathless. In front of them stood a piece of automotive art which, for the time, represented the very avant-garde, a glimpse of the future, something unseen, something new... The Jaguar XKE, also known as the e-type. Interestingly, they had no special plans for the newcomer, but rather than sales success, they were counting on racing victories. But it turned out the other way round. Although the XKE was initially intended only for export to the North American market, it was also unexpectedly popular and in demand at home. It also convinced with its relatively affordable price of £2,256 at the time (around £38,000 today, or around €45,000). Of course, it was soon behind the wheel of many movie and sports stars of the 1960s, such as George Best, Brigitte Bardot, Tony Curtis, Steve McQueen, etc. <p/> Designed by an aeronaut <p/> The e-type's design is by designer Malcom Sayer. As an aeronautical engineer, he was of course a master of aerodynamics. And this is probably the main reason why the e-type offered a design that was revolutionary for its time and remarkably modern. At first sight, the car was a sight to behold, with a virtually perfect shape. The side view revealed a cigar-shaped form, dominated by a long bonnet that flowed into a relatively short cabin. From any angle, the E-type reveals the designer's remarkable sense of aesthetics, proportion, right angles and proportions. Its rear end evokes feminine curves, its front end may look like a shark, but in its aggressiveness it exudes something friendly, soft, warm, almost childlike. All accentuated by thoughtful chrome detailing and typical English wheels made of interwoven spokes. Inside, it's a sort of miniature sexy English saloon - leather seats, leather steering wheel, classic switchgear and dashboard gauges. <p/> Three body styles and three series <p/> The E-type was initially available as a two-door coupe, known as FHC (Fixed Head Coupe), and as a convertible, known as OTS (Open Two Seater). A few years later, the 2+2 coupe was launched. The coupe was lengthened by about 20 centimetres and two makeshift rear seats were added to allow four adult passengers to ride in the e-type. At first glance, the 2+2 Coupe does not have the same harmonious lines and angles of the exterior. Connoisseurs say the cabin sticks out too much and, above all, the side lines are not as elegant. <p/> The e-type was initially powered by a 3.8-litre six-cylinder engine, which was replaced by a 4.2-litre unit in 1964. Both engines gave the car superb driveability. The speedometer only stopped at 240 kilometres per hour, and it accelerated to 100 km/h in seven seconds. <p/> It also underwent a few cosmetic changes during the 13 years of series production, during which 70,000 examples were built. In 1968, the Series 2 was launched, distinguished on the outside mainly by slightly different tail lights hidden under the bumpers, and on the inside by different switches on the dashboard. In 1971, the 3 Series was launched, which introduced a 12-cylinder 5.3-litre engine and was also quite different externally. Unfortunately, even at that time, the rule was that cosmetic changes were really a deterioration. The 3 Series E-type no longer had such a friendly bonnet, its front end was no longer classic Jaguar, but had a few Citroën elements. The side line was also spoilt, as the E-type had its front wings opened up too much. In fact, the third series heralded the arrival of the all-new XJ-S, which arrived just a year after the e-type's retirement, but was in no respect even close to its predecessor. <p/> Auto-erotic <p/> The E-type is one of the few cars whose physical presence evokes purely non-automotive emotions. It feels like a sculpture on four wheels. As such, it is, of course, a remarkable example of industrial design and therefore, of course, it has a special place in the history of both motoring and design. There are few examples where these two worlds intertwine, intersect and interact so effectively and, above all, so seamlessly. <p/> That's why, half a century after its birth, it is still one of the most beautiful cars in the world. The Daily Telegraph has listed it as one of the 100 most beautiful cars in the world, and Sports Car International magazine has ranked it number one in a similar list. Right, because the e-type is a cross between a car, eroticism and art...",Promotion of a Product,dev
328,"Insulin <p/> Insulin is a peptide (protein) hormone produced and secreted by the pancreas. It is produced by the so-called ß cells of the pancreas, from which it is secreted into the venous blood, which travels to the liver and then on to the systemic circulation. <p/> Structure of insulin <p/> Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains. Its chemical structure is C 254 H 377 N 65 O 75 S 6. <p/> Action and effects of insulin <p/> Insulin acts on many tissues in the body (liver, fat, muscle). Its primary function is to store energy peaks in the body (mainly to stimulate the synthesis of glycogen from glucose - glycogenesis). The main stimulus for its secretion is an increase in the amount of glucose in the blood. Insulin has a short half-life, so as glucose falls, its concentration in the blood falls rapidly. <p/> Which cells does insulin act on? <p/> Insulin acts on virtually all cells in the body, as insulin receptors are present on all of them.

332,"How is sex marketed? <p/> Adjectives that traditionally market sex well are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and especially tantric <p/> In the early 1990s, massage parlours sprouted up all over our young homeland, where ""professionally trained"" masseuses kneaded the bodies of men, most of them bed-ridden and stressed, eager for invigorating exotic massages: Thai, Chinese and Malay, ordinary and specialised, hand and foot. Was it really in the perfumed, dimly lit rooms that the oldest craft was practiced? The lion's share of the clientele would answer this question with a hand on the Bible, in the words of former US President Bill Clinton: ""We did not have sex with those women. ""The hired girls did, in fact, massage the clients to the best of their unprofessional abilities, and if a part of the client became unexpectedly stiff, they would simply do what was in the job description manually to relieve the client's tension. And that was it. Massage parlours did not, in principle, engage in conventional sexual intercourse, but that does not mean, of course, that what the lay public understands by the technical terms of blow jobs, hand jobs, spankings and whisperings did not take place there. In short, the owners of Slovenian massage parlours behaved in accordance with the political correctness of Western Christian civilisation, which tolerates many things, but not calling it fucking. Or it tolerates the presence of sex in its midst only if you put it in an artistic, installation, authorial, artisanal, institutional, aesthetic, cosmetic or spiritual context. Sex as such is not desirable. Hence the circus around pornography, prostitution and similar phenomena, which are not really about anything in terms of substance. <p/>The adjectives that traditionally market sex well, together with its side-effects, consequences and problems, are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and, in particular, tantric. Tantric sex is a hit. It has infiltrated the terminology of the psychiatric profession, it has taken over the tabloid media, it has possessed dissatisfied housewives who dream of nirvanic continuity and dissatisfied gentlemen who muse at the thought of eight-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour erections, even though they have no idea what they could achieve with their stream limbs in that time. One thinks of His Holiness Guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh, whose revolutionary approach to tantric themes forced him to leave his spiritualised mother India in 1981 and settle in Oregon, USA, with a vast fleet of custom-built Rolls Royces. His Holiness set up a Tantric commune in the middle of Oregon, which traded heavily in enlightenment, and became famous for not granting quantity discounts to even the most wholesale buyers. When names from the music and film show business lined up, many paid obscene sums just to stand in line. And it was only a matter of time before the epicentre of practical Tantric philosophy would move to sunny California, where believer-friendly religions were springing up on a daily basis, and then, like all American fads, it would come pounding down on the old continent and, by extension, Slovenia.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

342,"Request for an interview <p/> Dear Mr President! <p/> When you presented your government programme, you listed among the most important priorities of this government the concern to increase the birth rate and to improve the situation of families, since the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem of our country. <p/> Since 1997, we parents, associated in the Family Initiative, an association for a family-friendly society, have been working towards these very goals, and we were very pleased to see this new direction in Slovenian politics. Over the years we have been working in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience, and have proven ourselves with valid and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, free from emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/>With our expertise and experience, we are ready to help make the legislative changes and reforms needed to create an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parenting role than they do today, and therefore make more and better parenting choices. <p/> We would therefore like to meet with you to discuss your plans to implement the above-mentioned priority of the Government this term and how the Family Initiative could help. This is particularly important at a time when important reforms are being adopted to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy, and we have not found much in the documents on the proposals for these reforms, at least so far, that is tangible on how to tackle the problem of low fertility and on the above-mentioned priority and task of the Government in this mandate. The question also arises as to how these orientations are reflected in the 2006 and 2007 budgets.",Correspondence,dev
344,"Wednesday 13 April 2005 <p/> At the very beginning of the new government's term of office, in anticipation of a change in the attitude of the state towards parents and families, we prepared a comprehensive review of the measures we believe are necessary to make parents in Slovenia feel more comfortable in their parental role and therefore more willing and able to take on this mission. We have sent the document entitled ""For a more vibrant Slovenia"" to all ministries with a major role in family life and to some of the MPs who have asked us to do so. The Ministry of the Environment sent us a written reply, the Ministry of Education invited us for a discussion, and the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs (MoLFSA), in its Directorate for the Family, held several discussions on the subject. At the Ministry of Finance (MoF), we were more or less ignored. The proposed measures were also material for discussion at the meeting to which we were invited by the NSi MEPs. <p/> Wednesday, 27 September 2000 <p/> In the run-up to the elections, we in the Family Initiative took stock of the family policy in the outgoing mandate and presented it to the public at a press conference on 26 September 2000. Some of the media reported on it, but some ignored it completely. We were particularly disappointed by the absence of Radio Slovenia and the failure of TV SLO to report on the event, although the team filmed the whole press conference. <p/> Friday, 01 September 2000 <p/> In May, the President of the Family Initiative was a guest on the TV SLO programme Odmevi on the subject of the draft law on parental care and family benefits. He was also able to speak about the situation of Slovenian families on Odmevi in August. <p/> Friday, 30 June 2000 <p/> After the election of the Bajukov Government, we immediately established contacts with the new State Secretary for Family, Aleksandra Forte, who showed great interest in our proposals and submitted them to the Government. Unfortunately, the then Minister of Finance in the government prevented the adoption of the bill and the government amendments prepared by the MoFSA, causing a delay of several weeks in the consideration of the bill in the DZ. It is perhaps because of this delay that the second reading in the DZ remained only halfway through. <p/> Sunday, 30 April 2000 <p/> In April, in the material for the consideration of this Bill, the Government also presented the results of the recording of the prices of childcare products, which showed that the Family Initiative's prediction that the increased taxation of these products would be fully reflected in their increased cost and would be borne entirely by the parents was absolutely correct.

361,"Ljubljana, 28 November (STA) - The results show that a methodologically adjusted calculation would reduce the internal rate of return of Tesla 6 from 7.59% to 6.91%. Unsubstantiated assumptions allow risks to increase and, if they materialise, the rate could even fall to 5.12 percent, Geert Warringa of CE Delft said today at a presentation of the methodological flaws in the investment programme of Tesh 6. <p/> Such a rate of internal rate of return is far below the nine per cent required by the government in April as a condition for the state guarantee. ""Therefore, the project should not have received state support in the form of a state guarantee,"" pointed out Lidija Živčič of Focus. <p/> The report states that there are some methodological errors in the investment calculations for the construction of the sixth unit of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš 6). Lignite prices are underestimated, lignite consumption is underestimated from 2028 onwards, and CO2 costs are underestimated because process emissions from desulphurisation plants, which will be auctioned after 2020, are not included. <p/> The programme also assumes that the efficiency of lignite extraction will increase, but this assumption is not justified, the report points out. The result would be undervalued lignite prices. Another unjustified assumption, according to the report, is that the peak electricity produced (1000 GWh) will always be in demand on the international market, Warringa noted. <p/> Ms Živčičeva noted that the report also states that the investment programme does not follow the principles of cost-benefit analysis because no realistic alternative for the investment is given. ""The investment programme neither proves that the investment in unit 6 is the best alternative, which should be supported by a state guarantee and the risk should be borne by the state, nor that Teš 6 is the best alternative for energy supply in Slovenia,"" she said. <p/> Piotr Trzaskowski of the CEE Bankwatch Network pointed out that the involvement of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the project is not proof of a reliable economic assessment of the project. He warned that previous Slovenian governments had failed to do their homework and that if the project is granted a state guarantee for the EIB loan, Slovenian taxpayers will pay for their mistakes with their own money. <p/> ""Now that new errors are being revealed in the calculations of the economic bases for Teš 6, the two public European banks have the opportunity to recognise their initial mistake and withdraw from this bad project while they still can. If we add to the errors identified in the report the errors in the procurement of Teš 6, we see that this project has the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the EBRD and the EIB,"" Trzaskowski stressed. <p/> The report was commissioned by the environmental organisations CEE Bankwatch Network and Focus, with financial support from the European Climate Foundation, and prepared by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. <p/> The report will be sent to current and future parliamentarians and government representatives. <p/> The CE Delft report confirms that the Teš 6 project is ""an economically misguided or unjustified investment"", according to Zares Vice President Darja Radić, also a former Minister of the Economy. She recalled that, as a portfolio minister, she had proposed to the government to reject the state guarantee for Teš 6. Among other things, she had stated at the time that the project was economically too risky on key parameters - the price of coal, the price of CO2 credits, the size of the investment and the price of electricity. <p/> As Radićeva also wrote in a press release, the CE Delft report found methodological errors by the investment promoters on the first two parameters: the price of coal and the price of CO2 credits. They conclude that the coal price is underestimated and the cost of CO2 emissions is also underestimated.",News/Reporting,dev

He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads... <p/> To a random chimp like myself, it is easy to believe that the human imagination knows no bounds. Imagine, then, whose skin you would jump into, where you would fly to, if your thoughts did not keep crashing into the walls of reality. It would be nice to be a chicken in a world without a poultry industry, or a mediocre chair, immune to the jaws of a leech and the embrace of neurotically sweaty buttocks... maybe a piece of still-warm, newly born faeces... Imagine how popular they would be with the flies. What we would all be if our minds could defy change and not reflect shadows. The shadows of the moratorium of a postadolescence that persistently doubts. <p/> No doubt, this is the submission of a bookishly moody moth who will fancy that this is what it is today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads. The motif of the ascetic who ventures across a vast, mostly inhospitable landscape to find himself in the isolation of isolation is a frequent one in Australian literature. This motif has, in fact, developed into a national mythology, and has thus helped to shape Australian cultural identity, certainly among the white, immigrant population. Aborigines have an ascetic for lunch, just as Australians have kangaroos. <p/> Anyway, in The Imaginary Life we are placed in ancient times, in the shoes of the witty Roman poet Ovid, who is no ordinary, voluntary ascetic. We know from glimpses of his real life that he was the celebrated author of the Metamorphoses, a poet who knew how to articulate most beautifully the lazy decadence of his time, a man who not only moved in the heartland but was the very heart of Roman high society. And the heart is that missing part of the human toolbox which the then Emperor Augustus forgot when, for reasons unknown to us, he had Ovid exiled to the very edge of the Roman Empire, to an emergency civilised barbarian settlement. The unfortunate poet was left without bread, without games. And for him, the fiction is just beginning. <p/> In the emptiness of the desert landscape, Ovid of Maloof finds himself in profound silence, for Latin is not the barbarians' personal hygiene. The saddened poet is left with no choice but to put on his hair, roll in shit and surrender to the unbearability of silence. At this point, we find ourselves in the framework of a colonial discourse, which is expressed through the absence of a familiar environment, language and, consequently, an unresolved identity. <p/> The author thus focuses on the mental aporias and inner conflicts of the protagonist rather than on a narrative description of his surroundings. Here, however, the novel's multilayered nature gradually comes to the fore, leaving its central motif open to a multitude of interpretations. Is An Imaginary Life a novel about the search for identity and the importance of language in shaping it, a poetic reflection on the nature of life and death, on transcending boundaries in the landscape and in ourselves, on maturing through relationships with others? It leaves the layers of meaning to the horizon of imagination and thinking beyond the anxieties of civilisation. <p/> The cynicism of the cultivated poet Ovid, however, begins to diminish when he encounters the Child, a wild boy from the nearby forest. The little unsocialised hairy creature, who croaks, howls and generally disregards the behavioural patterns of the proudly standing specimens of modern homo sapiens, gradually reveals to him that civilisation is not an incurable disease. The story ends in an embrace of existentialist kitsch and pantheistic idealisations about nature. Flower children will thus be thrilled to read Imaginary Life. Lonely cowboys will be enlightened. Friends of trees will sprout leaves instead of hair. You'll want to ask a praying mantis out on a date.",Review,dev

416,"SLOVNI: Kylie, happy birthday! <p/> 28 May 2014 <p/> We are launching a special section on the Bansi website, featuring both local and foreign celebrities (actors, singers, directors, athletes and others). The feature will be launched by Australian singer, Kylie Minogue, who celebrates her birthday today. <p/> Kylie Minogue was born on 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia. She rose to fame as an actress with her appearance in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. In 1987, she began her active music career in earnest, with her first released song ""Locomotion"" becoming a huge hit. Other tracks on her first album Kylie also became big worldwide hits (you can listen to the album here). <p/> She went on to sign a deal with a group of hugely successful producers, launching her to stardom and worldwide fame. <p/> Locomotion has been sung and danced all over the world. After a career spanning more than 25 years, Kylie is still often singing in concert. In a special classical (orchestral or acoustic) guise, she included it along with 15 others on the album "" The Abbey Road Sessions "". It is an album of her greatest hits, released in 2013, the 25th anniversary of her career. <p/> Kylie is a versatile artist, singer, actress, music video director, songwriter and has had around 6 perfumes released under her name. She is also a huge fashion enthusiast. This photo shows the launch of the book Kylie Fashion, which collects some of her outfits and costumes throughout her 25-year career. The book was published in October 2012. Did you know that Kylie was thinking about becoming a fashion designer when she was in her teens? In an interview, she said that her grandmother taught her how to sew and that fashion means a lot to her. When she started performing, singing and acting on stage completely took over and she was able to successfully integrate her love of fashion into her life. <p/> Kylie was and still is hugely popular throughout her native Australia, Asia, America and of course Europe. She has lived in London since the beginning of her music career, where she is ""literally crazy"", she is extremely popular in France, Spain and is often invited to perform on Italian television. She has already had eleven huge world tours and has performed practically everywhere in the world (Japan, China, Mexico, all over Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.). She has not yet visited Slovenia, although she has many fans here too. What is very interesting about Kylie is that she has never been too shaken by her worldwide fame, e.g. she has lost touch with reality, used illegal substances, been known for some strange affairs, etc. She is always very straightforward in interviews and does not give the impression of being unapproachable or shabby. She is also known for being called "" Cute Kylie "" by her friends, the presenters of the radio shows she regularly appears on, journalists and members of her team. <p/> She also has the characteristic that she "" keeps on recording "". No sooner has she released her "" official studio "" album than she has already released the accompanying singles, which are not included on the album, but her fans quickly find them and these songs also become big hits. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, which she celebrated throughout 2013, she played a total of five concerts in her native Australia (in Melbourne and Sydney) and in the UK (two in London and one in Mancherst), singing her best-known songs for her biggest fans, as well as those that have never been officially released on albums or as singles. The concerts were presented under the title Anti Tour and sold out immediately. <p/>A song that was a huge hit with her fans, yet was never released - Cherry Bomb i from the Anti Tour. <p/> In 2005, in the middle of her big (eighth in a row) Showgirl tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which devastated her immensely. Kylie underwent surgery and chemotherapy in Paris at her request. She recovered successfully from the disease and spoke about it very often in interviews, sometimes even crying during them. She returned to the stage with a major concert on 11 November 2006 in her native Australia (Sydney). <p/> Just in those days (26 May 2014), Kylie released a special single called "" Crystallize "", the proceeds of which go to the French cancer foundation Aprec. Kylie is also very often charitable, especially after her illness. <p/> The first single, "" Into the blue "", is from her latest twelfth studio album. <p/> Kylie's first album also features a duet with Jason Donovan. The song "" Especially for you "", which was a huge hit and is still considered one of the most romantic songs today. In this video, Kylie jokes around a bit and sings the song with Kermit the Frog from the Muppet Show. <p/> Kylie was one of the judges on the third series of The Voice (in 2013), a BBC TV show broadcast in London. It's a show that searches for new musical talent. Before that, she had performed in many countries (her native Australia, Italy, America, France, other British shows and more) in just such shows as ""Talent Search"". In this video from 2007, she is seen singing the song ""I believe in you"" with one of the (future) musical talents on the Star Academy show on French TV. Even today, Kylie does not ignore these invitations to appear on talent search shows and appears regularly. <p/> Her extremely extensive Aphrodite World Tour was the singer's eleventh concert tour, organised in promotion of her eleventh album, Aphrodite (2010). The tour took Kylie to Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and North America. This tour was technically of an extremely high standard, with the entire set of songs acting as a sing-dance-theatre show lasting around two hours. Kylie and her extensive team had around 80 concerts scheduled for the tour. The focus of the tour was Kylie as Aphrodite (goddess of love and beauty). The tour lasted from 19 February 2011 to 14 July 2011, almost day after day, with very few days off in between. A recording of the entire concert is also available online. <p/> Another performance from 2008 in one of the shows looking for new musical talent (Star Academy on French TV). Together with Mathieu, they sang one of her biggest hits "" Love At First Sight "". <p/> Anyone who hears Kyie's name is likely to immediately think of the song Kyie jokingly refers to as "" La, la, la "", the first single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" from her eighth studio album Fever. The song was a hit worldwide and reached number one in more than 40 countries, including the UK, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and many other European countries. It has sold more than 4 million copies. Here we see a presentation of this song from the Brits Awards 2002, where Kylie won the award in the category "" International Female "" (Best Female Artist) in 2002. <p/> Another memorable performance with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". The performance received a lot of positive reviews, but it is from the 2011 MTV EMAs (MTV Europe Music Awards). <p/> Appearance on the X Factor in 2010, which is also one of the UK's shows looking for young musical talent.

Zreče is also a paradise if you appreciate the healing power of thermal water. <p/> Do you enjoy furnishing and decorating your home? Great. The apartment is sold unfurnished. <p/> Everything you will see in the photos below was... <p/> ... just an idea. <p/> I'm sure you have lots of ideas about how to decorate your new apartment. And I'm sure you'll have a few more as you look at the pictures. <p/> When the current owner bought the flat, it was not in the best condition. It was in need of a complete renovation. Two years ago, with creative ideas, a willingness to work and a lot of money, it was transformed from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan.... <p/> A view into the colourful and bright living room. <p/> The 17 square metre living kitchen is spacious and bright (you spend all day in it, by the way). It faces west and has access to the balcony, which is nice and useful at the same time -- you can ventilate the kitchen very quickly. <p/> Having your first coffee in the morning on the balcony, overlooking nature waking up, is an invigorating experience. <p/> From the kitchen, a door leads to the living room, where you can create another spacious bedroom. <p/> From the central corridor there is an entrance to the east-facing bedroom. <p/> You will certainly enjoy the separate toilet and bathroom. <p/> The apartment has had all the plumbing replaced, the walls patched and repointed, laminate flooring laid and brand new fittings fitted. The apartment has been given a new makeover, while retaining its functional layout. The owner would love to move it to the Ljubljana area, where she is moving to, but unfortunately this is not possible. <p/> The two-bedroom apartment is therefore waiting for a new owner who will breathe his own ideas and plans into it and furnish it as he wishes. <p/> If you want to be happy for life,... <p/> ... have a garden, says the Chinese proverb. If the old Eastern sages are right, then you can't go wrong with this apartment. From your balcony, you can admire a garden that can be used for growing garden flowers as well as home-grown vegetables. The gardens also have a tap for watering on hot summer days. <p/> In the basement, you also have a spacious (just over 7 square metres) cellar where you can store everything that won't go into the apartment. <p/> A great base for sports and recreation... <p/> Zreče, a small town in the Savinja Valley, is ideal for those who love nature but want to have all the city's infrastructure at their fingertips (and toes). Just a five-minute walk from your apartment, you'll find a shop, post office, pharmacy, kindergarten and the Zreče Primary School. If you turn on your heel in the opposite direction, you can quickly breathe the fresh air in the nearby forests or relax your mind while walking in the nearby hills. <p/> ... and a paradise for relaxation in the thermal pools of the Zreče thermal spas <p/> The first association with Zreče is tourism, as it is a thermal centre and nearby Rogla is a ski resort with a long tradition. <p/> The Zreče Spa offers a rich wellness programme, including saunas, a fitness centre, a gym and various health therapies. You're sure to enjoy an afternoon swim in one of the spa's eight swimming pools, or perhaps pamper yourself with a Thai massage. <p/> Rogla is the place to be for all those who love the snowy slopes - skiers, tobogganers and boarders, for whom a special slope has been prepared. With its sports stadium for fitness training, Rogla is also well known to local and foreign athletes. <p/> When ideas come to life... <p/> Every beginning is difficult, but when we look back on it after a while, we realise that those were actually the best times.

465,"The Core <p/> If at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance the conveyancer was aware of the legal consequences of entering into the contract of conveyance and had the will to enter into the contract of conveyance, the conveyancer will be deemed to have had the capacity at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance to enter into such a contract. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is modified so that the defendants are obliged to issue to the plaintiff, within 15 days, a land registration deed on the basis of which the plaintiff will be entitled to register the land in respect of the immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. on their co-ownership interests, in order to register the title in his own name, since such a deed would otherwise be superseded by the present judgment, and to reimburse him, within 15 days, the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, amounting to EUR 5 930,52, with interest at the statutory rate of late payment, with effect from the 16th day following the date of receipt of the present decision, in the event of delay. <p/> The defendants are ordered to reimburse to the applicant, within 15 days, EUR 1 572,03 of the costs of the appeal, with interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision until payment. <By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action for the issue of a land registry deed in respect of immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register of D. and No 756 of the Land Register of D. in the applicant's name, finding that the contract of conveyance of 19 September 1994 between the conveyancer, Mrs I.F., and the applicant was null and void. It is void because, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment (she lacked capacity to act). <p/> 2. Against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the applicant appeals on all the grounds set out in Article 388(1) of the Civil Procedure Act, seeking an amendment of the judgment so as to uphold the claim, and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. The appeal challenges the finding of the Court of First Instance that, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs I.F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment. Ms F's capacity to act is presumed and the defendants have not challenged that presumption. The mere existence of the disease of senile dementia is not proof that she did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. Expert B. was of the opinion that there was an 80 % probability that Mrs F.I. did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. On the basis of that expert's opinion, the presumption of the existence of Ms I. F.'s capacity to act is not rebutted. In the light of the circumstances, Mrs I.F.'s capacity was more or less preserved and she is able to express what she wants to do with her assets. <p/> 3. In their reply to the application, the defendants submit that a piecemeal, piecemeal assessment of the evidence cannot lead to the desired result that Ms I.F. had the capacity to act at the time of the signing of the contract of assignment. The Court of First Instance is autonomous in its assessment of the evidence. The emphasis on the bright moments of the handing-over of Mrs I.F. cannot be placed in the timeframe of the conclusion of the handing-over contract, since, apart from the date of conclusion of the handing-over contract, we do not know what state of mind Mrs F.I. was in when she concluded the handing-over contract. Expert B.B. did not conclude that Mrs F. I. was in a lucid phase at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Mrs F.'s will was not entirely free, as it was quite suggestible, but the proceedings have not proceeded in that direction so far because the parties have not claimed that it was. The expert, Mr B.B., did not speculate. He confirmed that his findings were correct, which means that I.F. was incompetent at the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery. The plaintiff did not attend the hearings, which suggests that there was something wrong with the contract from the outset. <p/> 4. The Court of Appeal questioned the correctness of the Court of First Instance's assessment of the evidence and therefore held a main hearing, at which it repeated the evidence of the expert Dr Z. Č. At the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery on 19 September 1994, Mrs F. was of legal age and therefore presumed to have had the capacity to act. It is for the defendant to prove that at the time of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment she lacked capacity, that she did not understand the meaning of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment and that she lacked the capacity to form the will to conclude the contract of entrustment. <p/> On the basis of the expert opinions of Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B.B., the testimony of the witness J.B. and the actions of I.F. after the conclusion of the contract of assignment (her statement at the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994, the conclusion of the lease agreement on 14.12.1994 and the consequences of the dementia from which I.F. suffered), the Court of First Instance concluded that I.F. did not understand the nature of the contract which she had concluded with the claimant on 19.09.1994 and its legal consequences. The Court of Appeal takes a different view of that evidence, in particular because the experts fundamentally misinterpreted the statement made by Mrs F. before the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994 and incorrectly linked that statement to the lease agreement concluded between Mrs F. and the applicant on 14.12.1994. <p/> It is clear from Ms F.'s statement of 12.10.1994 that she was aware that she had already handed over the property to the applicant (I myself wanted D.J. to have everything I had). I want him to have all my property after my death, or rather to have it already now. I.F. was also aware of why she was giving her property to the claimant, because he takes care of her and will continue to take care of her in the future (because he takes care of me, he is very good and I think he will continue to do so in the future). <p/> She also testified that her relatives are not interested in her or that they come to help her when they can and that they cannot come often. It follows from this statement that she wanted the continued assistance which the applicant had provided and had undertaken to provide in the future. <p/> It follows from Mrs F.'s statement that she understood the meaning of the contract of delivery of 19.09.1994, that she was handing over all her property to the applicant, and that she wished to enter into such a contract of delivery, that is to say, to form a business will to enter into such a contract, on the ground that the applicant would take care of her in the future. <p/> The experts' view that it is not logical that, after the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, I.F. and the applicant also concluded a lease contract on 14.12.1994 for an apartment on the first floor of the house is not justified, since at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract the contract of conveyance had not yet been registered in the land register and therefore the applicant had not become the land registry owner of the property conveyed. The conclusion of the lease contract is therefore a logical act, since by concluding it the applicant acquired the legal title to live in the house. When it was suggested to the experts that the conclusion of the lease agreement was logical, they replied that this was a legal view, not a psychiatric one. The court is not persuaded by such an answer of the experts. The logic of the transactions entered into is interpreted in terms of the need to enter into those transactions. Since the plaintiff had not yet acquired the legal title to live in the I.F. house by the mere conclusion of the contract of delivery, and the procedure for obtaining the status of farmer for the plaintiff had been delayed, it is logical and understandable that the plaintiff secured the right to live in the I.F. house by concluding the lease. <p/>Expert Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B. B. thus erred in considering that the subsequent conclusion of the lease contract implies that Mrs I.F. was not aware of the meaning of the contract of handover and that she was not capable of forming the will to enter into the contract of handover. The experts' request that Mrs F. should have stated in her statement of 12 October 1994 that she had already concluded the contract of usufruct is too strict, but in her statement Mrs F. testified to the essential elements of the contract of usufruct, namely that the property was already in the possession of the applicant and that the latter would take care of it in the future. <p/> Since it is clear from Mrs F.'s deposition of 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the importance of the contract of conveyance and that she wished to enter into it, it can be safely concluded that she also had such a wish on 19.09.1994, when she concluded the contract of conveyance. That will or capacity was not affected by her illness, dementia of old age, particularly in the light of the report on her state of health by Dr J.K. of 15.11.1994, in which he responded to enquiries made by the Centre for Social Work concerning the state of I.F.'s health. in which he stated that she was oriented in terms of personality, location and time, and the letter of 22.11.1994 from the nurse responsible for her care, Ms J.B., in which she stated that she had visited Ms I.F. four times since March 1994 and that she considered her to be of sound mind and health for her age. However, at the hearing on 19.11.2007, J.B. testified that she remembered I.F. as a confused, demented person who could no longer look after herself and needed help. When J.B.'s letter of 22.11.1994 was read to her, she stated that she remembered the case well at the time, but today she remembers I.F. as she described her at the hearing. It should be borne in mind that she had visited her 10 times, i.e. that she had continued to visit her even after she had made her statement of 22.11.1994. Her statement at the hearing is therefore not contradicted by the letter of 22.11.1994, it is only the timeframe to which the statement refers that is relevant. It follows from the statement of 22.11.1994 that this statement refers to the time up to the date of the statement, whereas the statement at the hearing on 09.11.2007 refers to the entire memory of her. <p/> Expert B.B. explained that confusion in dementia occurs in intervals of varying length, which means that a person with dementia is not mentally confused between the intervals. He was of the opinion that I.F. did not understand the meaning of the contract of conveyance at the time of the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, which he gave with a probability of 80 %. Such an opinion by Dr B.B. does not, therefore, rebut the presumption that Mrs F. had capacity at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract of 19 September 1994. For that reason, it is also not possible to follow the opinion of the expert Z. Č. T., that at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract I.F. was incapable of understanding the meaning of the handover contract, since both opinions are based on the same assessment of the facts, only that they ultimately assess them differently. <p/> As regards the testimony of the other parties and witnesses, it should be made clear that they gave their testimony as they saw and perceived it when they were in contact with Ms I.F.. However, in view of her illness, age-related dementia, which occurs at intervals, this may have been in a phase of confusion or in a phase of lucidity and therefore cannot affect the assessment of the evidence itself, given that it can be concluded with certainty from her statement before the Social Work Centre on 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the significance of the handover contract and that she had the will to form the basis of such a handover contract of 19.09.1994. <p/> 7. The amendment of the judgment affects the amendment of the decision on costs. The applicant was successful in the proceedings and must therefore reimburse the defendants for the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, which are assessed at a total of EUR 5 930,52 (EUR 3 474,83 for the costs of legal representation and EUR 2 474,83 for the costs of the lawyer).455,69 for fees, expert fees and travel costs), and to reimburse him EUR 1 572,03 in respect of the costs of the appeal (EUR 492,60 in respect of the appeal fee, EUR 407,59 in respect of the costs of drafting the notice of appeal, EUR 331,58 in respect of the costs of attending the main hearing on 14 February 2011 and EUR 340,26 in respect of the costs of the expert). <p/> The defendants shall pay the costs of the proceedings to the applicant within 15 days, with default interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision.",Legal/Regulation,dev
480,"Why did we lose the island? Because politics has defeated the judicial branch of government <p/> Since this year, the island of Bled has also been a symbol of the church's insatiability. It is a symbol of the complot between the church and a part of politics. It is a symbol of the weak authority of the Slovenian courts. This year, the island was finally donated to the church. But the church, as the court also found, got it illegally! <p/> How? Initially, two Slovenian courts, the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, ruled that the island and its commercial real estate belonged to the state, while the church on the island was given to the parish of Bled. But the RCC wanted it all, so the first government of Janez Janša came to its rescue, donating the island and its real estate to the church. The legal proceedings were restarted and came to a tragicomic conclusion. There were two proceedings in which the court should have annulled the gift contract. But the first one fell through because the first judge said that the state should have sued the Archdiocese of Ljubljana as well as the parish of Bled. And when the state sued both in the second, the second judge said that the state should sue only the parish. <p/> Since the ""superminister"" Žiga Turk did not appeal the decision, the real estate on the island became the property of the church and the island became the property of the church. But illegally.

Under his leadership, Zabec has transformed from a small and unknown agency into one that plays a significant role in Slovenia in all its niche markets. <p/> Never tie most of your business to one client - even though it is often easier, it exposes you to dependence on one client and puts your company in a bad position. If you have the option, even find two separate businesses: one B2B and one B2C. And ideally, separate the businesses by more than one country. <p/> 2. Work from the heart <p/> If you don't enjoy what you are doing, quit because you will lack the energy to ""pull"" it forward. <p/> 3. Not every client is worth the energy <p/> Big clients are not always manna from heaven. Appreciate the clients you work and work well with, as the work will be mutually satisfying and get done faster. The surprise follows - such clients are usually even more profitable! <p/> 4. Plan your finances <p/> If you manage your cash flow, you can anticipate problems and investment opportunities in advance. I started out using a simple Excel spreadsheet with expected income and expenditure. It is always possible to get good terms if you say exactly when you will be paid and your clients trust you. <p/> Money earned from the business is not yours! Invest it in the company, not in yourself. So what if you have a low salary - your job is to make the company grow and only later your wallet.

They are smashing coconuts. The most recent and perhaps most noteworthy case is that of Slask Wrocław, which imposed a cruel 14-hour working day on striker Sebin Plak for six months after he refused to sign a new contract with more than half the amount. ""The club's management did everything to destroy me mentally,"" said Plaku. Such behaviour by clubs is common in Poland and these clubs have been given their own name in football circles, the ""Coconut Clubs"". They were named after Daniel ""Kokos"" Kokosinski, who was mistreated, bullied and harassed by Polonia Warsaw FC in 2009. As part of a campaign launched by the Polish Professional Footballers' Union PZP to mark these events, players from the second division club Olimpia Grudziaz gathered in the changing room and shouted 'let's smash the coconut' in one voice, which was then smashed with a hammer a few moments later.

603,"Digital marketing: from basics to success <p/> Basic steps to sales success with digital marketing <p/> Effective digital marketing is a profitable investment in increasing sales. It makes it possible to go big, even for the smallest. It all starts with a good foundation (analysis of the dream, the competition and the right strategy). <p/> Just like you, your customers are also searching for solutions online, regularly using search engines like Google, social networks, reading emails, searching on search engines, clicking on ads, exploring maps, reading free educational content, watching videos, attending online trainings or courses, looking for a phone number or a phone number to call. These are all opportunities that we do not miss when promoting products or services. We attack with the right message, at the right time, that engages, does not come across as intrusive, delivers value, persuades and sells. <p/> The digital consumer lives with digital technology, as guided by digital content creators. Smart solutions, rational inputs, strategic approach create success. You too can actively participate and influence what's happening and shape your tomorrow with an effective website and presence on search engines, social networks, advertising, etc. <p/> A strategic approach and thoughtful, innovative and smart solutions are the recipe for success! <p/> As we all know, without planning, there is no success. This is also true in digital marketing, which is why you need your own digital strategy in the first place. It must anticipate all the planned activities, steps, campaigns, services, solutions, tactics and tools for your success in the digital realm. <p/> Effective digital marketing is perfectly tailored to your business and objectives <p/> Poor understanding of your business or your customers by you or your digital marketing consultant, focusing too much energy on one service and not enough on others, lack of cohesion, poor preparation, ineffective communication, or lack of customer engagement are common reasons for some of the less successful online performances. <p/> The dimension of the success of a digital story is virtually defined in the pre-production and preparation of the project itself, and through the process of educating the client. Only an in-depth, research-analytical approach with strategic orientations is the right recipe for success online in today's crowded digital world. For these purposes, we recommend that before the actual strategy is developed, an in-depth competitive analysis (online) and website analysis is carried out to get complete information on the threats, opportunities and the shortest path to your success. <p/> Every winning strategy has a proven methodology and workflow behind it <p/> A proven methodology with analytical pre-preparation, a strategic approach, knowledge and global experience, WSI know how and continuous training are the keys to our and your competitive advantages and successes in digital marketing. <p/> Our solutions and services are tailored to your needs and designed based on your business dynamics, needs, desires and goals, which we discover and define in the initial, analytical phase.

Probably every one of us has a room in which we relax the best and easiest, and for me it's definitely my living room, which I have furnished to suit my needs. I remember that when I was buying a new living room, I spent an enormous amount of time, because I was quite a demanding buyer. Every man will probably agree that there is nothing better than half-lounging in front of the television in your living room and enjoying watching football, laughing while listening to politicians or simply watching one of the popular science channels. I have the habit of sometimes using my living room for reading, because I like to read a lot. It is also the case in our house that the living room is where we spend most of our time when we are not working, of course. But I am one of those people who does not like to visit my living room, because I am of the opinion that living rooms are in a way too private a place to invite friends into. After all, there is nothing more reassuring to me than being able to lie down in front of the television in my living room in just my underpants. <p/> Living room ideas <p/> Sometimes a friend asks me where I got the idea for my original living room. My living room is custom-made, and most of the time it's a collection of all the best ideas I've got from different furniture catalogues. I have to admit that I like the Scandinavian type of furniture because everything is made of wood, and that's what my living room is. Wooden living rooms are something special for me. It is the wood that gives the living room warmth and makes it feel homely. <p/> Sometimes you can get a good idea in the furniture showrooms themselves. Maybe you should go to a furniture showroom on a Saturday morning and see what kind of living rooms they have on display. Sometimes you will get an incredible amount of ideas.

629,"""Smart working villages"" are now a new trend in Italy. And local authorities are trying to take advantage of the opportunities offered by internet access, which makes teleworking possible for anyone who only needs a computer. <p/> During the pandemic, teleworking has taken off, which means that many people work from home, on weekends or even somewhere on the coast on the other side of the world. Two Italian cities are even offering to pay anyone willing to move in and continue working remotely from a new address, CNN reports. <p/> The municipal authorities in Santi Fiori in Tuscany and Rieti in Lazio are willing to cover half the rent for anyone willing to move to the two cities for a long period of time to work remotely. Rents are already quite low, which makes the offer all the more tempting. But like any other, this one is not without requirements: anyone planning to move here must have a regular job. <p/> Italy - compared to other European countries - has been hit hard by the new coronavirus and the economic and tourism recovery will take several years. But with teleworking, Italians have also started to move to areas and cities that were previously facing out-migration. Smaller, almost deserted towns are now full of life. Italy has thus killed two birds with one stone - as well as revitalising certain areas, there are now fewer people in the larger cities, so the spread of the virus is slowing down, reports CNN. <p/> Santi Fiori, a town near the wine paradise of Val D'Orcia and Siena, is currently home to just 2 500 people. Mayor Federico Balocchi believes that modern technology and teleworking offer the possibility of revitalising his hometown. Rents in Santa Fiora currently range between 300 and 500 euros per month, and the municipality is willing to cover up to 200 euros of rent. This means that prospective tenants could live in the town for two to six months for as little as €100 a month. <p/> There is a choice of apartments in stone houses in the town centre and comfortable villas on the outskirts. The local authorities invite interested parties to visit their website to see all the properties currently available. The town has recently developed a good internet connection and several points where the World Wide Web can be accessed free of charge.

659,"Does algae generation mean the beginning of the end of your aquarium? <p/> Freshwater algae are a threat to aquatic life in aquariums. Algae are extremely tough when it comes to surviving and spreading throughout the aquarium tank, so you will need to be persistent to get rid of this problem. If you don't keep it under control, the aquarium will become a toxic water production system, which will be very harmful to your fish. You can prevent this by getting to know what is happening in your aquarium and what to do about it. With algae, it is best to prevent them from forming in the first place. This can be done by changing the water every week, as algae cannot thrive when there is new water in the aquarium, and by keeping up with other maintenance work. Some species of algae are edible, like much other marine vegetation, and are a food source in many parts of the world. There are hundreds of edible species containing vitamins and minerals. They are also used as fertiliser and food for livestock. In freshwater aquariums, there are quite a few species of algae that survive on nutrients in the water. In some cases, aquarium algae serve as food for aquarium inhabitants such as shrimps and snails, but if their growth is not controlled, they can be a threat to other aquarium life. Brown algae are often found in newly installed aquariums. They also thrive in poorly lit aquariums where phosphate levels are high and nitrogen levels are low. They are slimy and soft algae found on aquarium glass, in the substrate and in decorations. Brown algae will disappear in the presence of strong light, but may still remain in darker areas of the aquarium. In contrast, green algae thrive in aquariums with strong light. They appear as green spots on aquarium plants and on the aquarium glass. Hairy algae and filamentous algae appear as threads in the water. They thrive in aquariums if there is too much iron in the water. They are easily removed by wrapping a stick around them. Filamentous algae grow on the leaves of plants, are found at the tips of the leaves and can reach a length of 30 cm. Hairy algae usually grow at the base of plants, on the substrate and sometimes on the decoration. They are green-grey in colour and grow to about 4 cm. Most aquarists do not bother with this algae as some fish feed on it. However, freshwater shrimps such as Caridina Japonica feed on filamentous algae. A type of algae that enhances the look of an aquarium is the bearded algae. These algae form a carpet, usually covering rocks and plant leaves. They form closer to the light source. They are soft and slippery and grow quickly to a maximum of 3 cm. Bearded algae need a constant light source and are common in aquariums without plants and are quite difficult to remove by hand. By putting algae-eating fish in the water, you are constantly reducing the effect that algae can have on the aquarium. Fish such as Indian minnows, algae-eating foxtails and spotted armadillos are a great help in reducing them. Before introducing them to other fish in the aquarium, make sure they can be kept together in the aquarium, otherwise they will not do a good job of cleaning the algae. In small proportions, algae add colour and vitality to the aquarium. As well as providing food for some of the creatures in the aquarium, they can also provide shelter for small fish. They are also a good indicator of imbalances in the system. Algae show when there are too many nutrients in the water. Too many nutrients indicate that you may be feeding the fish too much and that some plants may be excreting nutrients. Algae can also indicate that you need to pay attention to the aquarium water, as it can be harmful to the fish and plants. The growth of freshwater algae depends on the existing conditions in the aquarium. Algae growth is dependent on three conditions: water, light and nutrients. Controlling these three sources is the main step in preventing them from growing and causing damage. Light can be controlled by placing the aquarium away from sunlight and artificial light should not be used for more than eight hours a day. Artificial light should not be too strong and it is a good idea to install an automatic timer switch. The feeding habits of fish vary from species to species. In order to control phosphate levels, which serve as food for algae, it is important not to overfeed the fish, as this will increase phosphate levels. If the fish have eaten and there are bits of food left in the aquarium, remove them immediately. In addition, regular water changes are important to prevent phosphate and nitrate levels from increasing. Change at least 10 to 15% of the water once a week and scrape off any algae clinging to the glass. Testing the water will also allow you to control algae build-up. Products to help you control algae: <p/> Amtra algenmaster - Works by damaging the algae metabolism and eliminating the formation of algal blooms <p/> Amtra system clean - An important product when changing the water.

But we no longer remember everything ourselves and find it difficult to help. Maths is usually the most difficult subject. And so perhaps maths tuition for primary school is needed. Mathematics is a big problem for many schoolchildren and they may need help from an expert to learn it. Maybe it is just a particular subject that is giving him difficulty, or whatever, and we are not confident enough in our own knowledge to be able to help him. And so we decide to use tutoring, which is usually the best possible solution and the appropriate help in this kind of situation. The great thing about tuition is that the instructor pays individual attention to the child, takes the time to look at what the difficulties are and makes a learning plan so that the material becomes clear and is understood as soon as possible. Whether the child is in primary school, secondary school or perhaps already studying. It is definitely a great way to help your child to get the knowledge they need and are currently lacking. What's also good about tuition is that the instructors identify the needs of the child and also have the right way or approach to teach them the most in a relatively short time. Of course, this is a great opportunity for those whose knowledge is deficient in a particular subject. When a child attends primary school, maths is usually the most pressing problem and, in general, if it is a child who is not good at maths in general, we will look for maths tuition for primary school. If we take on the task ourselves and want to help our child, we will surely find that primary school is not as easy as we once thought. We may not choose the right way of teaching, which would prolong learning, we may not have the right experience, and it is certainly different when someone other than the child's parent teaches the child.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

752,"27.09.2006 I find the title question interesting. Sometimes it seems to me that most people do not even ask it, because we live in a more or less school-taught and almost taken-for-granted belief that we judge things, people, their actions and events on the basis of the facts and by using our own common sense. And, accordingly, many people would probably answer the question posed by the title by saying that it is the authority of the argument that applies to them, not the other way round. But is this true? And how about in law? Are we persuaded by arguments or by the authority of the person who presents them? <p/> With the New Age and the tradition of the Enlightenment, the belief in human reason (ratio) became firmly established in Western society. This was particularly due to the development of the natural sciences, which, with their (apparent) exactitude, in many respects inspired legal thinkers. In particular, the proponents of the rationalist view of natural law, according to which the fundamental principles of law are somehow axiomatically rooted in ordinary human reason, believed that from the (highest) principles of law (e.g. neminem laedere or pacta sunt servanda) the correct solution to any legal problem or question could be found by deductive reasoning. This almost ""mathematical"" conception of law also led to the belief that legal reasoning is done by demonstration, i.e. by illustrative and formal logical demonstration or proof. However, after the more modern natural sciences have disproved the belief that science can be purely exact, and after the relativistic world-view (which is also known from many earlier historical periods, e.g. from the time of ancient Greek sophism) has regained a large measure of its right of homeland in the social sciences and law, faith or trust in the method of legal demonstration has in many respects also been dispelled. In its place, especially in the second half of the last century, the idea of legal argumentation came to dominate the field of legal logic. Although the term 'demonstration' is still used in many places in law and more widely today, it is in fact increasingly used to mean persuasion. Since, as I have written in various places, everything is relative in space and time, so is (i.e. relative) all (legal) evidence. A fact is prima facie evidence of guilt for one person, but not for another. If nothing else, a fact can be shown in a completely different light than it was previously shown in a narrower context, simply by expanding the (temporal, spatial, mental, emotional, etc.) context in which it is observed. <p/> All this is particularly familiar to lawyers. What is pure and indisputable truth to one litigant is pure and indisputable falsehood to the other litigant, the facts being the same but the human interpretations of those facts (and indeed of the legal norms) being different. Of course, sometimes a so-called material fact can be completely indisputable in itself (e.g. the identification of an object, DNA or blood traces) and as such really proves something. But one can expand the context and say that in the process of identifying such a fact (e.g. identification of the murder weapon, the perpetrator or DNA) there was a mistake, or even conscious manipulation, lying, etc. Therefore, any evidence is only valid as such to the extent that it is convincing to those who judge it. Convincingness, however, is to a large extent related to our subjective perception and evaluation of the world around us. In law and in life in general, we are therefore constantly persuading ourselves. If we come across someone with similar values, education, etc. to our own, we will quickly click with them and the need for persuasion will diminish. In the opposite case, i.e. when we encounter a person with a completely different way of thinking and value worldview, even with the most obvious facts and evidence (in our opinion, of course), we will not be able to convince (much less ""prove"") that we are right about something. If you don't believe me, just start talking to people about politics. Put forward a few of your own claims that you think are based on demonstrable facts, preferably relating to denationalisation, redress, assessment of the current or previous government, etc. I think you will quickly come across someone whom you will not be able to convince of your ""facts"" or ""evidence"". <p/> Anyone who has managed to follow my train of thought up to this point (which of course is not necessarily the case) can now easily see that (as Kant might have said) facts are not only something we perceive, but above all something we (co-)create. It is therefore important to be as convincing as possible in relation to others and to ourselves in defining or evaluating facts, that is to say, to be able to argue our views and positions as well as we can. But now let us ask ourselves what I said in the title of this paper. Is it the authority of the argument or the argument from authority that is decisive for us? Are we more persuaded by a good, skilful, illustrative, comprehensible, etc. argument, or are we more persuaded by the authority of the personality of the person who is making the argument? <p/> The answer to the above question is, of course, by no means unambiguous, because the two are intertwined. But nevertheless, if we look a little deeper into the matter, we can quickly see that in life in general we trust the argument from authority to a markedly overwhelming degree. Just think about how many things in life we know enough about to be able to make reliable judgements about statements of fact that are explained to us by someone who knows better. Can we judge for ourselves the arguments put to us by a doctor, perhaps even a surgeon, a physicist, an architect, a builder, an electrician, this or that legal specialist, a historian, etc.? Is it not the case that we simply believe most of these people, trust them? And if we don't, then we find someone who does. And if someone we trusted disappoints us, we look again for someone else we can trust - a new dentist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, lawyer, politician, etc. <p/> All this makes us realise the crucial importance of trusting people, not arguments. Since this is also extremely important for law, I will devote a future column to reflecting on the importance of trust in law, drawing on some of the thoughts presented here. For the moment, let me just say that anyone who thinks that they are guided to a greater extent by the authority of argument in judging things and people and their actions and behaviour is probably mistaken, because in reality we humans are predominantly following the authority of personality. In law, as in ethics, politics, religion and even science, we are in fact usually more persuaded by who than by what (although the two are in fact interdependent). If, for example, we are watching a controversial panel discussion on a topic on which we are more or less unfamiliar (or at least not sufficiently familiar with the relevant facts), then the persuasiveness of the persons presenting the arguments will play a decisive role in our decision as to which arguments are more persuasive. This persuasiveness is a certain emanation, a personal magnetism that people perceive according to their own (subjective) mental, energetic, emotional and other qualities. Of course, we should not overlook that this is a matter of sympathy, which means that we can only ever be represented in authority by someone who is close to us in what they do or represent, i.e. sympathetic in the true sense of the word.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

And if you're so cool that the security guard lets you into the disco, the cool guy in town gives you the items so you can do cool moves.

One month ago, my employer terminated my employment (30 days' notice) for business reasons due to the closure of a branch in Koper. The company still operates in Ljubljana. Until now, I have been sending in my sick notes regularly for each of the past months, but last week I received my employee booklet and a copy of my de-registration certificate in the post, showing that I had been de-registered from the register of employees. They enclosed a letter stating that I should register with the Employment Service within 30 days, enclosing my notice of resignation. <p/> What should I do? <p/> Answer: <p/> According to the Labour Relations Act (LRA), an employee who is dismissed from his/her employment contract for a business reason and is absent from work at the expiry of the notice period due to temporary incapacity for work due to sickness or injury, shall have his/her employment terminated as from the date on which he/she returns to work, or should have returned to work, but at the latest on the expiry of six months after the expiry of the notice period. Since your notice period has not expired, your employer was wrong to unfairly dismiss you. <p/> You are advised to contact our office, where we will do everything possible to resolve your problem. <p/> I had a valid contract of employment from December 2008 until the end of August 2009.

806,"Are you left without pressure in your heating system ? <p/> It has become uncomfortably cold in your home. This may be due to insufficient pressure in your system. In today's article you will find out all the possible causes and solutions. <p/> Insufficient pressure in the heating system is one of the most common causes of poor heating performance, and we receive the most calls from customers about it. <p/> Why is the pressure in your system too low? <p/> There can be several causes of low pressure. The most common causes are: <p/> Venting the system for too long: <p/> For radiators, we recommend venting before each heating season. Learn more about how to properly vent radiators. Often radiators are vented for too long, so only vent them for as long as air is coming out of them. Stop venting when water starts coming out. Venting for too long can cause a loss of pressure in your system. <p/> Safety valve too small: <p/> The safety valve protects your heating system from over-pressurisation. It opens above a certain value and starts to drain the water in your system. If the safety valve is too small, the valve will open too quickly and cause you to lose pressure in your system. This is why it is important to have a company with experience install your mechanical installations, many times boiler rooms are not sized correctly to achieve the lower prices offered on the market. <p/> Definitely the most common reason why the pressure in your system is too low. The expansion tank consists of two chambers separated by an impermeable membrane. One chamber contains the heating water - the other contains the gas, usually nitrogen. If the heating water expands as it is heated, the expansion tank regulates it: It absorbs the excess water and compresses the gas in the second chamber. If the gas pressure is incorrectly set or if the diaphragm is defective, the expansion tank will no longer work properly and the heating system will start to lose water. <p/> Water leaks from heating pipes, fittings, fittings and radiators: <p/> In rare cases, your system will leak water from a burst pipe, a fitting that is not tight enough, a radiator or even a fitting. Often the leak can be identified by puddles of water that appear at the very point where the water is escaping from the system. In the case of a burst pipe, for example, which is located under the plaster, the leak is more difficult to detect. Detection is aided by the use of a thermal imaging camera. <p/> For these reasons, it is even more important to choose a company with experience and references before deciding to install a heating system. This will ensure that you get a boiler room with quality and, of course, correctly sized materials. This will save you a lot of money and nerves :)",Information/Explanation,dev

817,"""The police, with their dedicated work in unenviable conditions, continue to prove that the almost impossible is still possible."" <p/> To commemorate the determined resistance of the militiamen and to protect our own country and our people, we police officers have chosen 27 June as our national day. Police Day is celebrated every year. This year's main ceremony, which commemorated the independence role of Slovenian militiamen, took place today, 27 June 2014, at the Police Academy. <p/> The ceremony was attended by the Police leadership, award recipients and distinguished guests, as well as by the families of fallen police officers who lost their lives in the war for the independence of Slovenia, and by police officers who were wounded at the time. <p/> Today, the Slovenian Police is celebrating more than twenty years of history. ""In all these years we have become a well-organised and efficient institution. But today, unfortunately, without modern equipment, without sufficient staff, in old vehicles and facilities, it is stagnant. /.../ Despite the fact that the police have been driven by the reserve for quite some time now, we have recorded good operational successes in the past period,"" said Stanislav Veniger, Director General of the Police, in his speech. <He added that ""we are living in a time when the demands of global security require us to move more decisively beyond the 'security in your own backyard' mentality. The world is getting smaller and smaller and borders are no longer impermeable. /.../ Fortunately, Slovenia is still considered a country with a high level of security. But security is not a given and it does not come for free. It takes a lot of hard work by dedicated, under-rewarded and stressed police officers. No one entered the police ranks with the idea of getting rich. But the motivation to work, derived solely from a sense of belonging and mission, is slowly losing its power. /.../ The police are certainly an important link in ensuring security, but they are not the only link. I am pleased to see that other authorities, also responsible for security, have begun to play their part more vigorously."" <p/> The Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, also addressed the gathering. He said that today, twenty-three years after independence, we could say that Slovenians are more satisfied with our police than we are with our country in general. ""The police do not have the ups and downs of the state, but they are a bird in the sky. For many years it has enjoyed a high reputation among citizens, providing people with a sense of order, stability and security. Recently, more than before, it must be admitted, there is also a feeling that we are all really equal before the law. <p/> Today, the police are not afraid of anyone, but all those who have robbed the Slovenes and stolen Slovenia from them tremble before them. The police is a stable institution with tradition and quality leadership. As an expert on the state administration, I can say this. /.../ I have to say that one of the things that surprised me most positively was the extremely modern approach to governance and management. I have come to realise that there is, in fact, positive selection in the police in the choice of management staff. /.../ Modern methods of leadership and management, the introduction of good practices, the elimination of bureaucratic matters within the system, the establishment of smart performance indicators. These are all successes of which any organisation can be proud. Therefore, the leadership of the police force deserves a lot of respect and thanks for leading the police in the right direction. But leaders cannot achieve their goals without capable and dedicated colleagues, and the credit for the success of the police goes to every police officer who puts in the effort and achieves the expected results. So congratulations to all of you."" <p/> This year we are celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Europol, and the Ljubljana Mounted Police Station, which we recently celebrated, is celebrating its anniversary. For the 66th year, the Police Orchestra has been delighting us with its delicate sound. Under the baton of Tomaž Kmetič, it once again enriched our ceremony. <p/> At ceremonies held throughout the country these days, meritorious police employees are awarded in their respective police units for their contribution to the promotion of safety culture and for their merits and contribution to the development and strengthening of safety, and individuals from other countries and other organisations are presented with police badges of cooperation. The highest police awards were presented at today's ceremony by the Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, and the Director General of the Police, Stanislav Veniger. <p/> The Golden Police Cooperation Badge was awarded to Josef Erhard of the German Police for excellent cooperation in the field of car crime over many years and to the Slovenian Armed Forces for excellent cooperation over many years, which undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the readiness to carry out the operational tasks of the police. The award was received by the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, Major General Dobran Božič. <p/> The Golden Police Shield was awarded to Martin Poharc from the Celje Police Directorate, Dean Jurič from the Koper Police Directorate and Vojko Rupnik from the Kranj Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with a Bronze Star was awarded to Marjan Anzeljc from the Police Specialities Administration, Simon Velički, Director of the Kranj Police Directorate and Mag. Stanislav Vrečar, Director of the Ljubljana Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with the Silver Star was awarded to Andrej Rupnik from the Office of the Director General of the Police. <p/> The Great Shield of the Police with a gold star was awarded to the Special Police Unit of the General Police Directorate, on whose behalf the award was accepted by its Commander Rado Abutovič, <p/> while the highest award of the Police, a firearm, was awarded to Franc Sablič, Director of the National Forensic Laboratory. <p/> We would like to congratulate all the award winners for their outstanding contribution to the safety of citizens and the reputation of the Slovenian Police. <p/> Today was also the Police Open Day, where we prepared an attractive presentation of the Slovenian Police for all participants and visitors. There was great enthusiasm for the passing parade of mounted police officers and their noble assistants, as well as for the demonstration of helicopter rescue, such as that carried out on many occasions by the crews of the Air Police Unit, who took part in the rescue of people in the recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a police helicopter. <p/> Later, it was possible to see up close what a police helicopter looks like, as well as how a crime scene investigation van is equipped, and what the so-called ""blinda"", which is used to transport protected persons, looks like. We also displayed a mobile police station and a Schengen bus, as well as a speed enforcement vehicle on the motorway, the so-called provido. <p/> The children were particularly interested in the equipment of the police officers of the Special Police Unit. They were fascinated by their helmets, shields and attractive stories from the protection of various public events. <p/> The younger visitors, in particular, were most excited to see the motorcycle police officers and to take photos on their white and blue motorcycles, as well as the police service dog handlers with their trained four-legged friends, and the mascot of Constable Leon.",Opinionated News,dev

852,"About the book and the author(s) <p/> The novel interweaves (through the lens of a fictional writer) three stories derived from three autobiographical accounts: the story of a great archaeologist (Heinrich Schliemann), the story of an adventure novelist (Karl May), and the story of a counter-intelligence chief in an ""unnamed country"", set in the second half of the 20th century. The basic link between the narratives is the writer's reflection on the falsity or truthfulness of autobiographies. <p/> The narrative of the counter-intelligence officer is in prose, the individual parts of the archaeologist's story are in verse (hexameter, elegiac distich), and the story of Karl Mayo is accompanied as a theatrical performance. This mixing of genres is inspired, at least in formal terms, by the novels of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Sterne). The work is thus situated in the tradition of the modern novel in the context of world literature, the beginning of which most literary historians place at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. <p/> The experimentalism of the Enlightenment novel, rediscovered by postmodernism, is realised in In Their Own Words above all as a play with the expressive possibilities of autobiographical writing. (Autobiographicalism is currently, both in Slovenia and worldwide, one of the most topical themes for both creators and researchers of fiction.) In terms of content, the work is open to the outside, but at the same time - through the figure of the writer, as well as through the presence of the implicit reader - it is closely embedded in the Slovenian space. <p/> Katarina Marinčič <p/> Slovenian writer, 1968 <p/> Katarina Marinčič is well known to Slovenian readers, having published three novels, Tereza (1989), Rožni vrt (1992) and Prikrita harmonija (2001), as well as a collection of novellas, O treh (2005). She received the Kresnik Prize (2002) for her novel Prikrita harmonija / Hidden Harmony and the Dnevnik Fable Prize (2007) for her collection O treh / About Three. In 2015, her novel After Their Words earned her a nomination for the K kresnik and the Critics' Sieve Award. <p/> The writer's second - or parallel - profession is also related to literature.

The ceremony was graced by the presence of the following guests: the Mayor of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah Peter Škrlec, the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association Robert Mesarec, the Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Leopold Omerzu, the Deputy Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Franc Lakner, the Sub-Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij v Slovih goricah Fire Brigade.

At the beginning of the parade, we watched the bearer of the national flag, Alojz Žnofl, a junior firefighter of the 2nd level, followed by the firefighter's emblem carried by the juniors of PGD Sveti Jurij, Maja Kukovec and Nuša Najdenik. The parade was then led by. The parade commander was Robert Kukovec, firefighter newspaperman II, vice-commander of the Lenart Firefighters' Association and commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, and his assistants were Uroš Črnčec, junior firefighter newspaperman I and Tilen Kristl, senior firefighter I. <p/> This was followed by the Lenart Fire Brigades Association's Platoon of Honour, which is made up of members from all ten Lenart Fire Brigades Association companies. It was led by Jernej Sinič, Senior Firefighter, and Ivan Divjak was the flag bearer of the Honor Platoon. <p/> The flag echelon followed. The standard bearers' echelon was led by Robert Črnčec, Firefighter's Timekeeper 1st Class, Deputy Commander of the home association. The flag bearer of the home association, Jožek Zaletinger, was at the head, with the youth flag of PGD Sveti Jurij, carried by Karin Najdenik, at his side. This was followed by banner bearers from all ten Lenart Fire Brigade associations and banner bearers from the neighbouring associations of Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. This was followed by the firefighter youth echelon, commanded by Alen Breznik, senior firefighter. Next came the members' echelon, led by Dejan Najdenik, a junior firefighter, 1st level. <p/> This was followed by the echelon of fire engines. At the head was a 1982 FAP vehicle driven by Jože Sinič. This was followed by the AC16/40 special vehicle, driven by Branko Črnčec. Next was the newer Mercedes Atego GVC 16/25, driven by Žan Krajnc. Other vehicles of the Lenart Fire Brigades Association and neighbouring volunteer associations followed. <p/> After the parade, all firefighters and guests gathered for the main ceremony in the tent in front of the entrance to Jura Square. <Before the start of the ceremony, the commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, Robert Kukovec, asked the Mayor of the municipality, Peter Škrlec, for permission to start the event. <p/> In the introduction of the ceremony, the President of the Sveti Jurij Volunteer Fire Brigade in Slovenske gorice, Gregor Nudl, spoke about the activities that led to the new fire truck being among us, about the wishes for a new vehicle. As the acquisition of a new fire truck is a great financial burden, but also a joy and pride for the firefighters and all citizens, the Mayor of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah, Peter Škrlec, also spoke on the occasion of such an important acquisition for our town and praised the efforts of the Jurij firefighters for the modernisation of the fleet and the dedicated performance of volunteer firefighting activities. Of course, all the assembled firefighters and guests were also welcomed by the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association, Robert Mesarec. <p/> This was followed by the official handover of the vehicle, during which the President and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij PGD handed over the keys to the driver and the vehicle's custodian, Andrej Sinič. The new firefighting vehicle was blessed by the local parish priest and dean, Janko Gögner, who wished the users of the vehicle a happy and safe journey and to use it mainly for social purposes and as little as possible for interventions. <p/> The ceremony of taking over the new vehicle was enriched with a short cultural programme by the Jurova Octet and the young accordionist Marko Igrec. <p/> As the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle is unimaginable without financial support, the representatives of the Voluntary Firefighters' Association Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah presented a token of appreciation to all donors and godparents who financially supported the Association in the purchase of the new firefighting vehicle. <p/> We concluded the ceremony with a sincere wish for the Jurij firefighters that despite the new equipment, volunteerism, courage and helping their fellow man remain their values. <p/> After the ceremony, there was a social gathering of all the firemen and firewomen, followed by the entertainment part of the celebration, as our firefighters also provided the appropriate catering, and we were able to warm up our hands and heels to the music of the ensemble Hearty Musicians.",Opinionated News,dev
863,"We have several different materials available for solid or masonry construction. You can choose brickwork with improved thermal insulation properties (thermosheet), lightweight blocks made of aerated concrete or expanded polystyrene formwork, the core of which has to be filled with concrete. Their properties, thermal insulation and method of construction are described below. <p/> All of these materials can be used to achieve a thermal transmittance of the whole external wall composition that meets the criteria of low-energy or passive construction. A wall constructed with a higher thermal conductivity material will need to be faced with a thicker layer of thermal insulation to achieve the same or at least a similar effect as a wall constructed with a lower thermal conductivity material. The materials also differ in the way they are constructed and the time taken for the walls to dry, as well as in how or with which additional elements they can be used to facilitate detailing and prevent thermal bridging. <p/> Thermal bricks in different sizes <p/> Bricks with improved thermal insulation properties are available in different shapes and sizes, and are also chosen by builders because they are a natural material. Goriška Brickworks offers thermal bricks 39, 29 and 25 cm thick. The thermal conductivity of the former is 0.22 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of them is 0.51 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of the second and third bricks is 0.24 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 29 cm thick bricks is 0.72 W/m2K and the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 25 cm thick bricks is 0.83 W/m2K. All of them have in common a linearly offset honeycomb and an increased mass of clay per unit volume of brick compared to conventional bricks, says Gregor Malik of Goriška brickworks. The offset honeycomb helps to allow both cold and heat to travel longer into the building, while the mass of the bricks significantly increases heat accumulation and thus helps to better regulate the temperature in the room. <p/> The brickwork does not differ significantly from conventional brickwork, the only difference is the design of the vertical ties, which is made much easier by the pero-utor system. In this case, the mortar is just shaken into the pocketed core that is formed when one brick is brought closer to the other, explains Malik, adding that it does not matter what weather conditions the building is built in. Every bricklayer knows that a period of cold and frost or a strong summer shower is not the best time for quality construction. In winter, the water in mortar can freeze, causing inappropriate reactions in its bonding with the bricks, so that the bonds are weaker than they would be at the right temperatures. In the summer heat, the mortar dries out too quickly due to the heat and the unmoistened bricks. <p/> For thermal insulation of thermo-brick walls, Goriška Brickworks recommends vapour-permeable insulating materials. 12 cm of stone wool on the thickest brickwork achieves a low-energy standard, while 18 cm of the same insulation achieves a passive standard. A 25 cm wall should be lined with 14 cm of stone wool for a low-energy house or 20 cm of stone wool for a passive house. <p/> For a square metre of wall, we will use 20 39 cm thick bricks, 15 29 cm thick bricks and 12.5 25 cm thick bricks. All earthquake-resistant corner and wall elements and the corresponding halves are also available to the builders. <p/> Special adhesive instead of mortar <p/> Wienerberger Opekarna Ormož offers builders of low-energy and passive houses, among other things, thermal masonry in various thicknesses made of ground bricks, using special adhesive instead of mortar, and system solutions for thermal bridges in the vertical and horizontal bond area and lintels with integrated external blinds boxes to facilitate and improve the quality of the detailing. <p/> The passive standard is already achieved with 30 cm thick thermo-walls, which have a thermal conductivity of 0.14 W/mK and must be lined with 20 cm of insulation material with a thermal conductivity of 0.032 W/mK. The thermal transmittance of such a wall is 0.12 W/m2K, says Boštjan Kosec of the Ormož brickworks, adding that the low-energy standard is achieved by lining 30-centimetre-thick bricks with 15 centimetres of polystyrene insulation. <p/> For external walls, vertical earthquake-resistant ties are also used at about four to six metres and at all corners. Additional elements such as corner blocks for the vertical ties and corner blocks to solve the thermal bridge problem in the area of the vertical tie, a system lintel with a box for external blinds, a ceiling system and semi-prefabricated pre-stressed lintels, and insulation elements to insulate the horizontal ties (wreath bricks, wreath formwork) facilitate the masonry work. <p/> The average weight of a cubic metre of external wall is approximately 1 000 kilograms. The time required for brickwork depends on the size of the bricks. For a cubic metre of wall, 85 conventional bricks, 3.7 hours and 220 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a cubic metre of 30 cm thermo-brick wall, 53 bricks, 3,2 hours and 180 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a wall of the same size made of brushed thermal bricks, the same number of bricks is needed, but only 1.6 hours and the corresponding amount of polyurethane glue. <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks with improved thermal conductivity can be chosen for the basic structure. The thermal conductivity of 350 kg/m3 blocks is 0.100 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of an external wall made of 40 cm thick blocks (50 cm thick blocks are also available on request) is 0.24 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of 300 kg/m3 thermoblocks is 0.086 W/mK and the thermal transmittance of a 40 cm wall is 0.21 W/m2K. Both types of thermoblock already meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency in Buildings Regulations (Pures) without additional thermal insulation, says Nataša Tavčar of Xella porobeton. She says that mortar losses are also important for the thermal insulation performance of a wall, and that they are negligible (less than 4%) in block masonry due to the thin-layer adhesive mortar, which is two to three millimetres thick. <p/> Thin-layer mortar requires precision, which is not difficult if the builder uses the right tools and follows the manufacturer's instructions. It is important that the first course is placed in a mortar that allows the unevenness of the substrate to be eliminated. Thin-set adhesive mortar should be applied with trowels to allow even application. In the following courses, any unevenness that occurs at the joints of the bricks shall be eliminated by the use of a levelling board. Additional elements are available to the builder to facilitate construction and solve thermal bridging problems: type lintels, anti-seismic blocks (for vertical ties) and U- and L-elements (for horizontal and diagonal ties). No additional formwork is needed, which makes construction even faster and ultimately cheaper, Tavčar adds. <p/> The amount of additional insulation depends on how energy-efficient the house is. A single-layer wall meets the Pures requirements for a 35-50 kWh/m2a energy-efficient house. For very good low-energy houses with a consumption below 20 kWh/m2a, an additional 10-14 cm of thermal insulation must be added to the 40 cm brickwork to ensure a thermal transmittance of the wall of 0.16-0.14 W/m2K. The builder can choose mineral thermal insulation boards which, like the blocks, are non-combustible (class A1), vapour permeable, strong, dimensionally stable and easy to shape. For a passive house, the thermal transmittance of the wall must be less than 0.15 W/m2K or, in the case of single-family houses, closer to 0.10 W/m2K. This value is achieved with 40 cm thick blocks and 22 cm of mineral panel insulation. <p/> Despite their large dimensions, porous concrete blocks are relatively easy to work with as they are very light. It takes only 1.71 hours to build a cubic metre of load-bearing wall with 40 cm thick blocks, or 1.92 hours with 30 cm thick blocks. A square metre of wall will take only eight blocks. <p/> Expanded polystyrene cladding <p/> The thermal performance of external walls for low-energy and passive houses can be achieved quite easily with a system consisting of expanded polystyrene elements, the core of which is filled with a concrete core. The certification of the German Passive House Institute confirms the suitability of the system for passive houses, as it allows construction without thermal bridges. The walls are 25 to 40 centimetres thick, the concrete core is 15 to 20 centimetres thick, and the bricks can be bought ready-assembled or assembled themselves using plastic spacers, which also serve as anchors for the reinforcement, says Nataša Jančar of Varčna gradnja. <p/> The thermal conductivity of the brickwork material is 0.029 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of the wall depends on the thickness of the brickwork - from 0.26 to 0.11 W/m2K, and the acoustic insulation is 44 to 54 dB. Each square metre of wall can hold 0.14 to 0.15 cubic metres of concrete, which means that a square metre of wall weighs between 350 and 400 kilograms, depending on the composition of the concrete and the thickness of the concrete core. <p/> Masonry will be faster if the design takes into account that all the dimensions of the building are divisible by 5 (cm), which means less cutting of the masonry, advises Jančarjeva. Otherwise, all that is needed is precision, care and following the instructions. The walls are concreted at half height, which corresponds to a larger or smaller pear of concrete for a normal-sized storey. The advice on concrete granulation is followed, and the walls are supported before concreting and the concrete is poured slowly, in layers. If the instructions are followed, we will pour flat monolithic walls without air pockets and, above all, we will achieve airtight joints with the reinforced concrete slab and the concrete roof, if we have chosen to do so. <p/> The point of the formwork, says Jančar, is that no additional thermal insulation is needed, as the energy efficiency of the house is already influenced by the choice of brickwork. If we buy the thinnest ones, i.e. 25 cm, we will catch Pures by a hair, but if we choose the thickest ones (40 cm), the house will be very energy-efficient, even passive, with the right siting and good external joinery. <p/> For an average sized house, even one storey per day can be built and watered with good organisation. For one square metre, you need four bricks (25 centimetres high and 100 centimetres long). The use of system elements such as lintels, wreath elements and ceiling and roof elements speeds up the construction process. <p/> Easy as rolling a dice <p/> A system similar to the one described above, which is also certified by the German Passive House Institute, also makes construction quick and easy. It consists of foamed polystyrene formwork elements that are simply placed together and the core is filled with concrete. The system allows for the construction of a building without thermal bridges in four different thicknesses, which are fully compatible with each other and can be combined on the same building, says Alen Mladinov from Arhem - PasivnaGradnja.si. The thermal transmittance of a 31 cm thick external wall is 0.17 W/m2K, the thermal transmittance of a 37 cm thick wall is 0.13 W/m2K and a 43 cm thick wall is 0.10 W/m2K. The last two thicknesses are suitable for passive houses, where no additional thermal insulation is required. <p/>All thicknesses are available with elements that have dried clay on the inside, and construction is facilitated by additional elements with metal connectors, elements without thermal bridges for lintels, ceiling connectors, roller shutter housings, balcony housings, circular corners, vault, external overhanging cantilever, etc. The programme for stairs, ceilings and roof insulation is also suitable for this purpose. <p/> The concrete core can be 15, 20 or 26 cm thick, depending on the structural requirements. One of the advantages of the system is that the entire floor can be constructed and concreted as such. The speed of production per cubic metre depends on the thickness of the elements. For normal buildings, it can take as little as ten minutes. In other words: a storey of a residential house can be built in one day, with all the window openings, spandrels and shutter elements, Mladinov says. For one square metre, we will use five elements.",Information/Explanation,dev

He also branded the 2020 presidential election ""fake"" while passing by both countries. <p/> Writing ""From Donald J.

899,"Photovoltaics have regained momentum in Slovenia in recent years, as the construction of solar power plants for self-supply is on the rise. This means that we generate electricity solely for our own needs, and any surplus cannot be sold to distribution. The main principle of a solar power plant is to convert solar energy into electricity, and it does this using solar cells, which are the basic building blocks of photovoltaic modules. <p/> From an ecological point of view, a PV power plant is considered clean and environmentally friendly, as it does not produce any greenhouse or other gas emissions. Solar energy is the third most important source of renewable energy in terms of capacity, after hydro and wind power. More than 100 countries around the world use solar energy. Photovoltaics can be installed on the ground or mounted on the roof or walls of a building. <p/> In a solar power plant, the electromagnetic waves of the Sun are converted into direct current and voltage. The conversion process is completely inaudible, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly, and takes place in diffuse sunlight. Photovoltaics or photovoltaic systems can operate for many years and require little maintenance or intervention after their initial installation, so that after the initial investment costs, the operating costs of a PV power plant are very low compared to existing electricity generation technologies. <p/> What is PV - the PV module at the heart of the PV plant <p/> At the heart of any solar power plant or PV system (even for own use) are the photovoltaic modules, which are the generator of the solar power plant. Of course, the arrays, the mounting structure, the shielding and the metering point are also a necessary part of any solar power plant. <p/> A photovoltaic power plant consists of two sets of basic elements. The first is the photovoltaic modules, which are the heart of the solar power plant and play the role of converting the electromagnetic waves of the sun into direct current and voltage. The second set consists of the power elements, which serve to use the electricity generated for specific purposes. These include: rectifiers, supporting structure, connecting cables, DC and AC couplings, regulators, batteries, switching and protection devices and other installation materials. <p/> A PV module consists of identical solar cells connected in series. Depending on the types of solar cells installed, the PV cells (or modules) can be made of crystalline cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline modules) or amorphous silicon. A module consists of a number of solar cells in series (between 36 and 72 pieces/module), which are sandwiched between a toughened glass surface and a special EVA film. The edges of the so-called sandwich construction are then sealed with aluminium foil and a connection dock is mounted on the back of the module. The whole is then framed in an aluminium frame. <p/> Photovoltaics are virtually maintenance-free and operate extremely reliably. The regular maintenance that is required is to clean the surface of the modules once a year in case of major dust or dirt, and in the case of a stand-alone PV installation at home (for own use), we make sure that the surroundings are maintained and cleaned in case of overgrowth. <p/> Photovoltaic power plant - installation requires thoughtful planning <p/> The basic requirement for the installation of photovoltaics is a sunny, shade-free area. However, many of the challenges regarding the orientation of the building, its position and the pitch of the roof can be solved with module supports. The PV panels shall preferably be mounted on the sunny south side of the roof, or elsewhere if the south side is not possible, at an angle of 32 degrees. Deviating from the optimum angle by, for example, 20 degrees reduces the efficiency by about 5 %, while deviating from the southern direction to the east or west results in a loss of at least 15 %. Therefore, the deviation from the south direction should be as small as possible. The amount of solar radiation depends very much on the broad and narrow location of the building, and a lot on the time of year and the weather. In summer, the solar radiation is at a high angle - around 64 degrees, while in winter it is low - only below 16 degrees. Lower energy reflections, which require a larger solar cell area and a larger roof, must be taken into account, even in locations with lower solar radiation. These disadvantages, together with the intermittency and dependence on climatic conditions, must be taken into account in the design. The fact is that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the efficiency. In warmer places, solar radiation is much stronger, so the results are much more favourable. <p/> Self-use photovoltaics most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water <p/> Self-use photovoltaics, consisting of only a few (two to five) modules, most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water. The amount of electricity produced is quite low and you do not have to deal with the various paperwork that you have to do if you want to feed the energy produced into the grid. <p/> Larger or solar power plants, where the photovoltaics are made up of a larger number of modules, also produce a much larger amount of electricity. In this case, it is most worthwhile to get all the paperwork in order to obtain the right to feed the electricity into the grid. <p/> This option is sure to bring you the most profit, as the price of the green energy produced by a solar power plant is up to three times higher than that of conventional electricity. So if you were to use the energy produced in your household, the profit would be three times less than if you were to feed it into the grid. <p/>Solar energy is unlimited, clean and free. By using solar energy, we are also showing ourselves to be environmentally conscious. Welcome to Sol Navitas.",Information/Explanation,dev

1000,"The debate often brings to the surface first those values that people in the kindergarten, school, organisation think they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to be respected as much as possible by themselves and the organisation. <p/> We know that the values people express publicly can be very different from the values they express in their own actions and behaviour. People's behaviour often seems to 'violate' values that they claim to hold important and sacred. Such ""double morality"" is a commonplace phenomenon, reflecting the disconnect between one's actual values, what one really values and cares about, and how one would like others to see one. <p/> If this phenomenon is so typical of human beings, it is logical that it cannot be avoided when discussing values within an organisation. Such a discussion often brings to the surface, in particular, the values that people feel they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to make themselves and the organisation as attractive and respected as possible. <p/> If the values that are written down do not match those that the organisation and its people express in their actions and behaviour, they cannot have a positive impact on employees and users. <p/> Just as the ""double morality"" of the individual is unattractive, the ""double morality"" of the organisation, or the wide gap between its stated values and what its actions express, is an ideal breeding ground for cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule and other negative phenomena. Written values that are literally at odds with what happens in the organisation cannot possibly have a positive impact on its employees and users. On the contrary, they often become a source of further dissatisfaction. It is therefore all the more important that the debate on the values of the organisation really goes deep, not contenting itself with superficial answers, and that it examines and tests the values it evokes. <p/> For example, if the debate points out that what matters most to employees is ""good relations with users"", it is important to ask whether this is really being implemented in practice. Does the day-to-day behaviour of the organisation and its people really reflect this concern? Do their actions and procedures really reflect this? <p/> In summary, it is useful to talk about, discuss, clarify and define values. But in doing so, organisations should be as careful as possible to avoid the tendency to ""sugarcoat"" the truth, to portray values ""as they should be"" rather than ""as they are"". Otherwise, the debate on values can quickly turn into its opposite, which instead of having positive consequences, encourages cynicism, sarcasm and dissatisfaction, and has a negative impact on employees' motivation, work zeal and morale.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
