1088	"1 Application-level Fault-Tolerance Protocols arXiv : 1611 . 02273v1 [ cs . SE ] 5 Nov 2016 Vincenzo De Florio University of Antwerp , Middelheimlaan 1 , 2020 Antwerp , Belgium Preface 1 INTRODUCTION The central topic of this book is application-level fault-tolerance , that is the methods , architectures , and tools that allow to express a fault-tolerant system in the application software of our computers . Application-level fault-tolerance is a sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on the problems of expressing the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers . This book shows that application-level fault-tolerance is a key ingredient to craft truly dependable computer systems – other approaches , such as hardware fault-tolerance , operating system fault-tolerance , or fault-tolerant middleware , are also important ingredients to achieve resiliency , but they are not enough . Failing to address the application layer means leaving a backdoor open to problems such as design faults , interaction faults , or malicious attacks , whose consequences on the quality of service could be as unfortunate as , e.g. , a physical fault affecting the system platform . In other words , in most cases it is simply not possible to achieve complete coverage against a given set of faults or erroneous conditions without embedding fault-tolerance provisions also in the application layer . In what follows the provisions for application-level fault-tolerance are called application-level fault-tolerance protocols . As a lecturer in this area , I wrote this book as my ideal textbook for a possible course on resilient computing and for my doctoral students in software dependability at the University of Antwerp . Despite this , the main goal of this book is not – only – education . The main mission of this book is first of all spreading the awareness of the necessity of application-level fault-tolerance . Another critical goal is highlighting the role of several important concepts that are often neglected or misunderstood : The fault and the system models , i.e. , the assumptions on top of which our computer services are designed and constructed . Last but not the least of our goals , this book aims to provide a clear view to the state-of-the-art of application-level fault-tolerance , also highlighting in the process a number of lessons learned through hands-on experiences gathered in more than 10 years of work in the area of resilient computing . It is our belief that any person who wants to include dependability among the design goals of their intended software services should have a clear understanding of concepts such as dependability , system models , failure semantics , and fault models and of their influence on their final product's quality of experience . Such information is often scattered among research papers while it is presented here in a unitary Application-level fault-tolerance is defined in what follows as the sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on how to express the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers . Traditionally research in this sub-class was initiated by Brian Randell with his now classical article on which system structure to give our programs in order to be tolerant to faults ( Randell , 1975 ) . The key problem expressed in that paper was that of a cost-effective solution to embed fault-tolerance in the application software . Recovery blocks ( treated in Chapter 4 ) was the proposed solution . Randell was also the first to state the insufficiency of fault-tolerance solutions based exclusively on hardware designs and the need of appropriate structuring techniques such that the incorporation of a set of fault-tolerance provisions in the application software could be performed in a simple , coherent , and well structured way . A first proposal for the embedding recovery blocks in a programming language was proposed shortly afterwards ( Shrivastava , 1978 ) . Leaving the safe path of hardware fault-tolerance brought about new problems and challenges : Hardware redundancy guarantees random component failures , while software replication does not guarantee statistical independence of failures . In other words , a single cause may produce many ( undesirable ) effects . This means that "" in software the redundancy required is not simple replication of programs but redundancy of design "" ( Randell , 1975 ) . An answer to this problem and another important milestone was the conception of N - version programming by Algirdas Aviz ̆ ienis ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , which combines hardware and information redundancy in the attempt to reduce the chance of correlated failures in the software components . At the same time , the very meaning of computing and programming was evolving , again bringing new possibilities but also opening up new problems and challenges : The spread of distributed systems meant also the end of the purely synchronous model for computing and communication ( see for instance ( Jalote , 1994 ) and ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) and Chapter 2 ) ; object orientation made it possible to easily reuse third-party software components , but turned our applications into a chain of links of unknown strength and trustworthiness ( Green , 1997 ) . The logics for assembling the links together is in our applications , hence it is clear that the logics to prevent the break of those links to lead to disaster must also involve the application layer ( Saltzer , Reed , & Clark , 1984 ) . Luckily from the object model there began to stem several variants , such as composition filters , distributed objects , or fragmented objects , that would provide the programmer with powerful tools for fault-tolerance programming in the application layer ( see Chapter 6 for a few examples ) . Other approaches are also being devised , e.g. aspect-oriented programming – though their potential as fault-tolerance language is yet to be confirmed ( see Chapter 8 for a brief introduction ) . Still other approaches are also discussed in this book . A special accent is given to those approaches where the author had first-hand experience with . In one case – the Ariel recovery language – the reader is provided with enough details to even understand how the approach has been crafted . We are now at the verge of yet another change , with ubiquitous computing , service orientation and the novel Web technology promising to serve us as even more powerful solutions to accompany us in the transition towards the Information Society of tomorrow . Such topics would require a book on their own and have not been treated here . Still the problems of application-level fault-tolerance are with us , while to date no ultimate and general-purpose solution has been found out . This book is about this possibly unique case in computer science and engineering of a problem yet unsolved though being formulated more than 30 years ago . Table 1 : A short introduction to application-level fault-tolerance framework and from the viewpoint of the application-level dependable software engineer . Another aspect that makes this book unique from all others in the field is the fact that concepts are described with examples that , in some cases , reach a deep level of detail . This is not the case in all chapters , as it reflects the spectrum of working experiences that the author had during more than a decade of research in this area . Any such spectrum is inherently not uniformly distributed . As a consequence some chapters provide the reader with in-depth knowledge , down to the level of source code examples , while others just introduce the reader into the subject , explain the main concepts , and place the topic in the wider context of methods treated in this book . To increase readability , we isolated some of the most technical texts into quoted sections typed in blue . Furthermore , this book has a privileged viewpoint , which is the one of real-time , concurrent , and embedded system design . This book does not focuses in particular on the design of fault-tolerance provisions for service-oriented applications , such as web services , and does not cover fault-tolerance in the middleware layer . In what follows the background top-level information and the structure of this book are introduced . 2 BACKGROUND AND STRUCTURE No man conceived tool in human history has ever permeated so many aspects of human life as the computer has been doing for the last 60 years . An outstanding aspect of this success story is certainly given by an overwhelming increase in computer performance . Another one , also very evident , is the continuous decrease of costs of computer devices – A 1000 $ PC today provides its user with more performance , memory , and disk space of a million dollar mainframe of the Sixties . Clearly performance and costs are "" foreground figures "" – society at large is well aware of their evolution and of the societal consequences of the corresponding spread of computers . On the other hand this process is also characterized by "" background figures "" , that is , properties that are often overlooked despite their great relevance . Among such properties it is worth mentioning the growth in complexity and the crucial character of the roles nowadays assigned to computers : Human society more and more expects and relies on good quality of complex services supplied by computers . More and more these services become vital , in the sense that lack of timely delivery ever more often can have immediate consequences on capitals , the environment , and even human lives . Strangely though it may appear , the common man is well aware that computers get ever more powerful and less expensive , but does n't seem to be aware or even care about computers being safe and up to their ever more challenging tasks . The turn of the century brought about this problem for the first time – the Millennium Bug , also known as Y2K , reached the masses with striking force , as a tsunami of sudden awareness that "" yes , computers are powerful , but even computers can fail . "" Y2K ultimately did not show up , and the dreaded scenarios of a society simultaneously stripped by its computer services ended up in a few minor accidents . c 2008 Marvel Characters , Figure 1 : Perception of dependability in the Sixties ( TM & Inc. All Rights Reserved . ) But society had had a glimpse to some of the problems that are central to this book : Why do we trust computer services ? Are there modeling , design , development practices , conceptual tools , and concrete methods , to convince me that when I take a computer service , that service will be reliable , safe , secure , available ? In other words , is there a science of computer dependability , such that reliance of computer systems can be measured , hence quantitatively justified ? And , is there an engineering of computer dependability , such that trustworthy computer services can be effectively achieved ? Dependability – the discipline that studies those problems – is introduced in Chapter 1 . This book in particular focuses on fault-tolerance , which is described in Chapter 1 as one of the "" means "" for dependability : Fault-tolerance is one of the four classes of methods and techniques enabling one to provide the ability to deliver a service on which reliance can be placed , and to reach confidence in this ability ( together with fault prevention , fault removal , and fault forecasting ) . Its core objective is "" preserving the delivery of expected services despite the presence of fault-caused errors within the system itself "" ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . The exact meaning of faults and errors is also given in the cited chapter , together with an introduction to fault-tolerance mainly derived from the works of Jean-Claude Laprie ( Laprie , 1992 , 1995 , 1998 , 1985 ) . What is important to remark here is that fault-tolerance acts after faults have manifested themselves in the system : Its main assumption is that faults are inevitable , but they must be tolerated , which is fundamentally different from other approaches where , e.g. , faults are sought to be avoided in the first place . Why focusing on fault-tolerance , why is it so important ? For the same reason referred above as a background figure in the history of the relationship between human society and computers : The growth in complexity . Systems get more and more complex , and there are no effective methods that can provide us with a zero-fault guarantee . The bulk of the research of computer scientists and engineers concentrated on methods to pack conveniently ever more complexity in computer systems . Software in particular has become a point of accumulation of complexity , and the main focus so far has been on how to express and compose complex software modules so as to tackle ever new challenging problems rather than dealing with the inevitable faults introduced by that complexity . Layered design is a classical method to deal with complexity . Software , software fault-tolerance , and application-level software fault-tolerance , are the topics of Chapter 2 . It is explained what does it mean that a program is fault-tolerant and what are the properties expected from a fault-tolerant program . The main objective of Chapter 2 is introducing two sets of design assumptions that shape the way people structure their fault-tolerant software – the system and the fault models . Often misunderstood or underestimated , those models describe • what is expected from the execution environment in order to let our software system function correctly , • and what are the faults that our system is going to consider . Note that a fault-tolerant program shall ( try to ) tolerate only those faults stated in the fault model , and will be as defenseless against all other faults as any non fault-tolerant program . Together with the system specification , the fault and system models represent the foundation on top of which our computer services are built . Not surprisingly enough , weak foundations often result in fragile constructions . To provide evidence to this , the chapter introduces three well-known accidents – the Ariane 5 flight 501 and Mariner-1 disasters and the Therac-25 accidents ( Leveson , 1995 ) . In each case it has been stressed out what went wrong , what were the biggest mistakes , and how a careful understanding of fault models and system models would have helped highlighting the path to avoid catastrophic failures that cost considerable amounts of money and even the lives of innocent people . After this , the chapter focuses on the core topic of this book , application-level software fault-tolerance . Main questions addressed here are : How to express and achieve fault-tolerance in the mission layer ? And , why is application-level software fault-tolerance so important ? The main reason for this is that a computer service is the result of the concurrent execution of several "" virtual "" and physical machines ( see Fig. 2 ) . Some of these machines run a predefined , special-purpose service , meant to serve – unmodified – many different applications . The hardware , the operating system , the network layers , the middleware , a programming language's run-time executive , and so forth , are common names of those machines . A key message in this book is that tolerating the faults in one machine does not protect from faults originating in another one . This includes the application layer . Now , while the machines "" below "" the application provide architectural ( special-purpose ) complexity , the mission layer contributes to computer services with general-purpose complexity , Figure 2 : Computer Services are the result of layered designs . The higher you go , the more specialized is the layer . which is intrinsically less reliable . This and other reasons justifying the need for application-level software fault-tolerance are given in that chapter . The main references here are ( Randell , 1975 ; Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ) . Chapter 2 also introduces what the author considers to be the three main properties of application-level software fault-tolerance : Separation of design concerns , adaptability , and syntactical adequacy ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008b ) . In this context the key questions are : Given a certain fault-tolerance provision , is it able to guarantee an adequate separation of the functional and non-functional design concerns ? Does it tolerate a fixed , predefined set of faulty scenarios , or does it dynamically change that set ? And , is it flexible enough as to host a large number of different strategies , or is it a "" hardwired "" solution tackling a limited set of strategies ? Finally , this chapter defines a few fundamental fault-tolerance services , namely watchdog timers , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing-and-rollback . After having described the context and the "" rules of the game "" , this book discusses the state of the art in application-level fault-tolerance protocols . First , in Chapter 3 , the focus is on so-called single-version and multiple-version software fault-tolerance ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . • Single-version protocols are methods that use a non-distributed , single task provision , running side by side with the functional software , often available in the form of a library and a run-time executive . • Multiple-version protocols are methods that use actively a form of redundancy , as explained in what follows . In particular the chapter discusses recovery blocks and N-version programming . Chapter 3 also features several in-depth case studies deriving from the author's research experiences in the field of resilient computing . In particular the EFTOS fault-tolerance library ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) is introduced as an example of application-level single-version software fault-tolerance approach . In that general framework , the EFTOS tools for exception handling , distributed voting , watchdog timers , fault-tolerant communication , atomic transactions , and data stabilization , are discussed . The reader is also given a detailed description of RAFTNET ( Raftnet , n.d. ) , a fault-tolerance library for data parallel applications . A second large class of application-level fault-tolerance protocols is the focus of Chapter 4 , namely the one that works "" around "" the programming language , that is to say either embedded in the compiler or via language transformations driven by translators . In that chapter it is also discussed the design of a translator supporting language-independent extensions called reflective and refractive variables and linguistic support for adaptively redundant data structures . • Reflective and refractive variables ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007a ) are syntactical structures to express adaptive feedback loops in the application layer . This is useful to resilient computing because a feedback loop can attach error recovery strategies to error detection events . • Redundant variables ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008a ) are a tool that allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of redundancy is not fixed once and for all at design time , but rather it changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . The chapter shows that by a simple translation approach it is possible to provide sophisticated features such as adaptive fault-tolerance to programs written in any programming language . In Chapter 5 te reader gets in touch with methods that work at the level of the language itself : Custom fault-tolerance programming languages . In this approach fault-tolerance is not embedded in the program , nor around the programming language , but provided through the syntactical structures and the run-time executives of fault-tolerance programming languages . Also in this case application-level complexity is enucleated from the source code and shifted to the architecture , where it is much easier and cost-effective to tame . Three classes of approaches are treated – object-oriented languages , functional languages , and hybrid languages . In the latter class special emphasys is given to Oz ( Müller , Müller , & Van Roy , 1995 ) , a multi-paradigm programming language that achieves both transparent distribution and translucent failure handling . A separate chapter is devoted to a large case study in fault-tolerant languages : The so-called recovery language approach ( De Florio , 2000 ; De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2001 ) . In Chapter 6 the concept of recovery language is first introduced in general terms and then proposed through an implementation : the Ariel recovery language and a supporting architecture . That architecture is an evolution of the EFTOS system described in Chapter 3 , and targets distributed applications with non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language such as C , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a predefined set of processing nodes . Ariel and its run-time system provide the user with a fault-tolerance linguistic structure that appears to the user as a sort of second application-level especially conceived and devoted to address the error recovery concerns . This separation is very useful at design time , as it allows to bound design complexity . In Ariel this separation holds also at run-time , because even the executable code for error recovery is separated from the functional code . This means that , in principle , the error recovery code could change dynamically so as to match a different set of internal and environmental conditions . This can be used to avoid "" hardwiring "" a fault model into the application – an important property especially when , e.g. , the service is embedded in a mobile terminal ( De Florio & Blondia , 2005 ) . Chapter 7 discusses fault-tolerance protocols based on aspect-oriented programming ( Kiczales et al. , 1997 ) , a relatively novel structuring technique with the ambition to become the reference solution for system development , the way object-orientation did starting with the Eighties . We must remark how aspects and their currently available implementations have not yet reached a maturity comparable with that of the other techniques discussed in this book . For instance , the chapter remarks how no aspect-oriented fault-tolerance language has been proposed to date and , at least in same cases , the adequacy of aspects as a syntactical structure to host fault-tolerance provisions has been questioned . On the other hand , aspects allow regarding the source code as a flexible web of syntactic fragments that the designer can rearrange with great ease , deriving modified source codes matching particular goals , e.g. performance and , hopefully in the near future , dependability . The chapter explains how aspects allow to separate design concerns , which bounds complexity and enhances maintainability , and presents three programming languages : AspectJ ( Kiczales , 2000 ) , AspectC ++ ( Spinczyk , Lohmann , & Urban , 2005 ) and GluonJ ( GluonJ , n.d. ) . The following chapter , Chapter 8 , deals with failure detection protocols in the application layer . First the concept of failure detection ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) , a fundamental building block to develop fault-tolerant distributed systems , is introduced . Then the relationship between failure detection and system models is highlighted – the key assumptions on which our dependable services are built , which were introduced in Chapter 2 . Then it is introduced a tool for the expression of this class of protocols ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007b ) , based on a library of objects called time-outs ( V. De Florio , 2006 ) . Finally a case study is described in detail : The failure detection protocol employed by the so-called EFTOS DIR net ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) , a distributed "" backbone "" for fault-tolerance management which was introduced in Chapter 3 and that later evolved into the so-called Backbone discussed in Chapter 6 . Hybrid approaches are the focus of Chapter 9 , that is , fault-tolerance protocols that blend two or more methods among those reported in previous chapters . In more detail RεLinda is introduced – a system coupling the recovery language approach of Chapter 6 and generative communication , one of the models introduced in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Deconinck , 2001 ) . After this the recovery language-empowered extensions of two single-version mechanisms previously introduced in Chapter 3 are described , namely a distributed voting mechanism and a watchdog timer ( De Florio , Donatelli , & Dondossola , 2002 ) . The main lessons learned in this case are that the recovery language approach allows to fast-prototype complex strategies by composing a set of building blocks together and by building system-wide , recovery-time coordination strategies with the Ariel language . This allows set up sophisticated fault-tolerance systems while keeping the management of their complexity outside of the user application . Other useful properties achieved in this way are transparency of replication and transparency of location . Chapter 10 provides three examples of approaches used to assess the dependability of application-level provisions . In the first case reliability analysis is used to quantify the benefits of coupling an approach such as recovery languages to a distributed voting mechanism ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Then a tool is used to systematically inject faults onto the adaptively redundant data structure discussed in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008a ) . Monitoring and fault-injection are the topic of the third case , where a hypermedia application to watch and control a dependable service is introduced ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Chapter 11 concludes the book by summarizing the main lessons learned . It also offers a view to the internals of the application-level fault-tolerance provision described in Chapter 6 – the Ariel recovery language . 3 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS Application software development is not an easy task ; writing truly dependable fault-tolerant applications is even more difficult , not only in itself for the additional complexity required by fault-tolerance but often also because of the lack of awareness which is necessary in order to master the complexity of this tricky task . The first and foremost contribution of this book is increasing the awareness of the role and significance of application-level fault-tolerance . This has been reached by highlighting important concepts that are often neglected or misunderstood , as well as introducing the available tools and approaches that can be used to craft high-quality dependable services by working also in the application layer . Secondly , this book summarizes the most widely known approaches to application-level software fault-tolerance . A base of properties in which those approaches can be compared and assessed is defined . Finally , this book features a collection of several research experiences the author had in the field of resilient computing through his participation to several research projects funded by the European Community . This large first-hand experience is reflected into the deep level of detail that is reached in some cases . We hope that the above contributions will prove useful to the readers and intrigue them into entering the interesting arena of resilient computing research and development . Also , too many times the lack of awareness and know-how in resilient computing has brought the designers to supposedly robust systems whose failures had in some cases dreadful consequences on capitals , the environment , and even human lives – as a joke we call them sometimes "" endangeneers "" . We hope that this book may contribute to the spread of that awareness and know-how that should always be part of the education of dependable software engineers . This important requirement is witnessed by several organizations such as the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems Reliability , Safety and Security , technical committee 7 ) , whose mission is "" To promote the economical and efficient realization of programmable industrial systems through education , information exchange , and the elaboration of standards and guidelines "" ( EWICS , n.d. ) , and the ReSIST network of excellence ( ReSIST , n.d. ) , which is developing a resilient computing curriculum recommended to all people involved in teaching dependability-related subjects .

Concepts such as reliability , safety , or security , have been used inconsistently by different communities of researchers : The real-time system community , the secure computing 1 community , and so forth , each had its own "" lingo "" and was referring to concepts such faults , errors and failures without the required formal foundation . This changed in the early Nineties , when Jean-Claude Laprie finally introduced a tentative model for dependable computing . To date , the Laprie model of dependability is the most widespread and accepted formal definition for the terms that play a key role in this book . As a consequence , the rest of this chapter introduces that model . 2 DEPENDABILITY , RESILIENT COMPUTING , AND FAULT-TOLERANCE As just mentioned the central topic of this chapter is dependability , defined in ( Laprie , 1985 ) as the trustworthiness of a computer system such that reliance can justifiably be placed on the service it delivers . In this context , service means the manifestations of a set of external events perceived by the user as the behavior of the system ( Aviz ̆ ienis , Laprie , & Randell , 2004 ) user means another system , e.g. , a human being , or a physical device , or a computer application , interacting with the former one . The concept of dependability as described herein was first introduced by Jean-Claude Laprie ( Laprie , 1985 ) as a contribution to an effort by IFIP Working Group 10.4 ( Dependability and Fault-Tolerance ) aiming at the establishment of a standard framework and terminology for discussing reliable and fault-tolerant systems . The cited paper and other works by Laprie are the main sources for this chapter – in particular ( Laprie , 1992 ) , later revised as ( Laprie , 1995 ) and ( Laprie , 1998 ) . A more recent work in this framework is ( Aviz ̆ ienis , Laprie , Randell , & Landwehr , 2004 ) . Professor Laprie is continuously revising his model , also with the contributions of various teams of researchers in Europe and abroad – let me just cite here the EWICS TC7 ( European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems Reliability , Safety and Security , technical committee 7 ) , whose mission is "" To promote the economical and efficient realization of programmable industrial systems through education , information exchange , and the elaboration of standards and guidelines "" ( EWICS , n.d. ) , and the ReSIST network of excellence ( ReSIST , n.d. ) , boasting a 50-million items resilience knowledge base ( Anderson , Andrews , & Fitzgerald , 2007 ) , which developed a resilient computing curriculum recommended to all involved in teaching dependability-related subjects . Laprie's is the most famous and accepted definition of dependability , but it is certainly not the only one . Not surprisingly , due to the societal relevance of such a topic , dependability has also slightly different definitions ( Motet & Geffroy , 2003 ) . According to Sommervilla ( Sommervilla , 2006 ) , for instance , dependability is "" The extent to which a critical system is trusted by its users "" . This is clearly a definition that focuses more on how the user perceives the system than on how the system actually is trustworthy . It reflects the extent of the user's confidence that the system will operate as users expect and in particular without failures . In other words , dependability is considered by Sommervilla and others as a measure of the quality of experience of a given user and a given service . From this descends that the objective of dependability engineers is not to make services failure-proof , but to let its users believe so ! Paraphrasing Patterson and Hennessy ( Patterson & Hennessy , 1996 ) , if a particular hazard does not occur very frequently , it may not be worth the cost to avoid it . This means that residual faults are not only inevitable , but sometimes even expected . It 's the notion of "" dependability economics "" : Because of the very high costs of dependability achievement , in some cases it may be more cost effective to accept untrustworthy systems and pay for failure costs . This is especially relevant when time-to-market is critical to a product's commercial success . Reaching the market sooner with a sub-optimal product may bring more revenues than doing so with a perfectly reliable product surrounded by early bird competitors that have already captured the interest and trust of the public . In what follows the book shall stick to Laprie's model of dependability . Following such model , a precise and complete characterization of dependability is given 1 . by enumerating its basic properties or attributes , 2 . by explaining which phenomena constitute potential impairments to it , and 3 . by reviewing the scientific disciplines and the techniques that can be adopted as means for improving dependability . Attributes , impairments , and means can be globally represented into one picture as a tree , traditionally called the dependability tree ( Laprie , 1995 ) ( see Fig. 1 ) . 2.1 The Attributes of Dependability As just mentioned , dependability is a general concept that embraces a number of different properties ( Walkerdine , Melville , & Sommerville , 2002 ) . These properties correspond to different viewpoints from which the user perceives the quality of the offered service – in other words , for different users there will be in general different key properties corresponding to a positive assessment of the service : • Availability is the name of the property that addresses the readiness for usage . • Reliability is the property that measures the continuity of service delivery . Figure 1 : The dependability tree • The property expressing the reliance on the non-occurrence of events with catastrophic consequences on the environment is known as safety . • The property that measures the reliance on the non-occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information has been called confidentiality . • The property that measures the reliance on the non-occurrence of improper alterations of information has been called integrity . • The property that expresses the ability to undergo repairs and upgrades has been called maintainability . These properties qualify dependability , and therefore are known as its attributes ( Laprie , 1995 ) . Certain combinations of these attributes received a special name – security ( Jonsson , 1998 ; Bodeaum , 1992 ) , for instance , is defined as the conjoint requirement for integrity , availability , and confidentiality . This section defines a number of important measures of a system's quality of service , including some of the attributes presented in Sect . 2.1 that are most relevant in what follows . 2.1.1 Reliability When we take a plane , or even just a lift , the key property we expect from the computer system behind the service is that it proceed without flaws for the entire duration of the service . Any disruption of the service in the middle of the run would be disastrous . Reliability is the property that measures the continuity of service delivery . In other words , one expects – and hopes ! – that airborne systems be reliable throughout their flights ! More formally , reliability is defined as the conditional probability that the system will perform correctly throughout interval [ t0 , t ] , given that the system was performing correctly at time t0 ( Johnson , 1989 ) . Time t0 is usually omitted and taken as the current time . The general notation for reliability is therefore R ( t ) . The negative counterpart of reliability , unreliability , is defined as Q ( t ) = 1 − R ( t ) , and represents the conditional probability that the system will perform incorrectly during the interval [ t0 , t ] , given that the system was performing correctly at time t0 . Unreliability is also known as the probability of failure . 2.1.2 Mean Time To Failure , Mean Time To Repair , and Mean Time Between Failures If a system is known to fail , it makes sense to ask how long the system can be expected to run without problems . Such figure is called Mean Time to Failure ( MTTF ) . MTTF is defined as the expected time that a system will operate before the occurrence of its first failure . Another important property is Mean Time to Repair ( MTTR ) . MTTR is defined as the average time required for repairing a system . It is often specified by means of a repair rate μ , namely the average number of repairs that occur per time unit . Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) is the average time between any two consecutive failures of a system . This is slightly different from MTTF which regards on a system 's very first failure . The following relation holds : MTBF = MTTF + MTTR . As it is usually true that MTTR is a small fraction of MTTF , it is usually allowed to assume that MTBF ≈ MTTF . 2.1.3 Availability When we need to perform a banking transaction , or when we press the brake pedal while driving our car , or when we take an elevator and press the key corresponding to the floor we need to reach , the key property we expect from the system is that it serve us – it allow us to complete our transaction , or to slow down our car , or simply that the elevator works . What really matters is not how long the system worked so far , but that it works the moment we need it . This property is called availability . Availability is defined as a function of time representing the probability that a service is operating correctly and is available to perform its functions at the instant of time t ( Johnson , 1989 ) . It is usually represented as function A ( t ) . Availability represents a property at a given point in time , whereas reliability concerns time intervals . These two properties are not to be mistaken with each other – a system might exhibit a good degree of availability and yet be rather unreliable , e.g. , when inoperability is pointwise or rather short . Availability can be approximated as the total time that a system has been capable of supplying its intended service divided by the elapsed time that system has been in operation , i.e. , the percentage of time that the system is available to perform its expected functions . The steady-state availability can be proven ( Johnson , 1989 ) to be MTTF · Ass = MTTF + MTTR 2.1.4 Safety Safety is the attribute of dependability that measures a system's ability to operate , normally or not , without damaging that system's environment ( Sommervilla , 2006 ) . So though it might seem a little strange at first , safety does not take into account the correctness of the system . In other words , while e.g. reliability is a functional attribute , this is not the case for safety . With reliability , quality is related to conformance to the functional specifications . With safety , quality is non-functional . A crashed system would exhibit minimal reliability and maximal safety . As remarked by Sommervilla , because of the increasing number of software-based control systems , software safety is being recognized as an important aspect of overall system safety . Systems where the issue of safety is particularly important , to the point that failures may lead to loss of lives or severe environmental damages are called life-critical or mission-critical systems ( Storey , 1996 ) . An example architecture for safety-critical systems is Cardamon ( Corsaro , 2005 ) . 2.1.5 Maintainability Maintainability is a function of time representing the probability that a failed system will be repaired in a time less than or equal to t . Maintainability can be estimated as M ( t ) = 1 − exp − μt , μ being the repair rate , assumed to be constant ( see Sect . 2.1.2 ) . 2.2 Impairments to Dependability Hardware and software systems must conform to certain specifications , i.e. , agreed upon descriptions of the expected system response corresponding to any initial system state and input , as well as the time interval within which the response should occur . This includes a description of the functional behavior of the system – basically , what the system is supposed to do , or in other words , a description of its service – and possibly a description of other , non-functional requirements . Some of these requirements may concern the dependability of the service . In real life , any system is subject to internal or external events that can affect in different ways the quality of its service . These events have been partitioned into three classes by their cause-effect relationship : depending on this , an impairment can be classified as a fault , an error , or a failure . When the delivered service of a system deviates from its specification , the user of the system experiences a failure . Such failure is due to a deviation from the correct state of the system , known as an error . That deviation is due to a given cause , for instance related to the physical state of the system , or to bad system design . This cause is called a fault . A failure of a system could give rise to an event that is perceived as a fault by the user of that system , bringing to a concatenation of cause-and-effects events known as the "" fundamental chain "" ( Laprie , 1985 ) : ... fault ⇒ error ⇒ failure ⇒ fault ⇒ error ⇒ failure ⇒ ... ( symbol "" ⇒ "" can be read as "" brings to "" ) . Attributes defined in Sect . 2.1 can be negatively affected by faults , errors , and failures . For this reason , failures , errors , and faults have been collectively termed as the "" impairments "" of dependability . They are characterized in the following three paragraphs . 2.2.1 Failures Failures System failures occur when the system does not behave as agreed in the system specifications or when the system specification did not properly describe its function . This can happen in many different ways ( Cristian , 1991 ) : omission failures occur when an agreed reply to a well defined request is missing . The request appears to be ignored ; timing failures occur when the service is supplied , though outside the real-time interval agreed upon in the specifications . This may occur when the service is supplied too soon ( early timing failure ) , or too late ( late timing failure , also known as performance failure ) ; response failures happen either when the system supplies an incorrect output ( in which case the failure is said to be a value failure ) , or when the system executes an incorrect state transition ( state transition failure ) ; crash failure is when a system continuously exhibits omission failures until that system is restarted . In particular , a pause-crash failure occurs when the system restarts in the state it had right before its crash , while a halting-crash occurs when the system simply never restarts . When a restarted system re-initialises itself wiping out the state it had before its crash , that system is said to have experienced an amnesia crash . It may also be possible that some part of a system's state is re-initialized while the rest is restored to its value before the occurrence of the crash – this is called a partial-amnesia crash . Defining the above failure classes allows extending a system's specification – that is , the set of its failure-free behaviors – with failure semantics , i.e. , with the failure behavior that system is likely to exhibit upon failures . This is important when programming strategies for recovery after failure ( Cristian , 1991 ) . For instance , if the service supplied by a communication system may delay transmitted messages but never lose or corrupt them , then that system is said to have performance failure semantics . If that system can delay and also lose them , then it is said to have omission / performance failure semantics . In general , if the failure semantics of a system s allows it to exhibit a behavior in the union of two failure classes F and G , then s is said to have F / G failure semantics . In other words , the "" slash "" symbol can be read as the union operator among sets . For any given s it is possible to count the possible failure behaviors in a failure class . Let us call b this function from the set of failure classes to integers . Then , given failure classes F and G , b ( F / G ) = b ( F UG ) = b ( F ) + b ( G ) . Failure semantics can be partially ordered by means of function b : Given any two failure semantics F and G , then F is said to exhibit a weaker ( less restrictive ) failure semantics than G : F < G ≡ b ( F ) > b ( G ) . In particular , it is true that F / G < F. Therefore , the union of all possible failure classes represents the weakest failure semantics possible . If system s exhibits such semantics , s is said to have arbitrary failure semantics , i.e. , s can exhibit any failure behavior , without any restriction . By its definition , arbitrary failure semantics is also weaker than arbitrary value failure semantics . This latter is also known as Byzantine failure semantics ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) . In the case of stateless systems , pause-crash and halting-crash behaviors are subsets of omission failure behaviors ( Cristian , 1991 ) , so omission failure semantics is in this case weaker than pause-crash and halting-crash failure semantics . As clearly stated in ( Cristian , 1991 ) , it is the responsibility of a system designer to ensure that it properly implements a specified failure semantics . For instance , in order to implement a processing service with crash failure semantics , one can use duplication with comparison : Two physically independent processors executing in parallel the same sequence of instructions and comparing their results after the execution of each instruction . As soon as a disagreement occurs , the system is shut down ( Powell , 1997 ) . Another possibility is to use self-checking capabilities . Anyway , given any failure semantics F , it is up to the system designer to decide how to implement it , also depending on the designer's other requirements , e.g. , those concerning Figure 2 : Failure classes . costs and expected performance . In general , the weaker the failure semantics , the more expensive and complex it is its implementation . Moreover , a weak failure semantics imply higher costs in terms of redundancy exhaustion ( see Sect . 3 ) and , often , higher performance penalties . For this reason , the designer may leave the ultimate choice to the user – for instance , the designer of the Motorola C compiler for the PowerPC allows the user to choose between two different modes of compilation – the fastest mode does not guarantee that the state of the system pipeline be restored on return from interrupts ( Sun , 1996 ) . This translates into behaviors belonging to the partial-amnesia crash semantics . The other mode guarantees the non-occurrence of these behaviors at the price of a lower performance for the service supplied by that system – programs compiled with this mode run slower . Failures can also be characterized according to the classification in Fig. 2 ( Laprie , 1995 ) , corresponding to the different viewpoints of • failure domain ( i.e. , whether the failure manifests itself in the time or value domain ) , • failure perception ( i.e. , whether any two users perceive the failure in the same way , in which case the failure is said to be consistent , or differently , in which the failure is said to be inconsistent ) , • and consequences on the environment . In particular a failure is said to be benign when consequences are of the same order as the benefits provided by normal system operation , while it is said catastrophic when consequences are incommensurably more relevant than the benefits of normal operation ( Laprie , 1995 ) . Systems that provide a given failure semantics are often said to exhibit a "" failure mode "" . For instance , systems having arbitrary failure semantics ( in both time and value domains ) are called fail-uncontrolled systems , while those only affected by benign failures are said to be fail-safe systems ; likewise , systems with halt-failure semantics are referred to as fail-halt systems . These terms are also used to express the behavior a system should have when dealing with multiple failures – for instance , a "" fail-op , fail-op , fail-safe "" system is one such that is able to withstand two failures and then behaves as a fail-safe system ( Rushby , 1994 ) ( fail-op stands for "" after failure , the system goes back to operational state "" ) . Finally , it is worth mentioning the fail-time-bounded failure mode , introduced in ( Cuyvers , 1995 ) , which assumes that all errors are detected within a pre-defined , bounded period after the fault has occurred . 2.2.2 Errors An error is the manifestation of a fault ( Johnson , 1989 ) in terms of a deviation from accuracy or correctness of the system state . An error can be either latent , i.e. , when its presence in the system has not been yet perceived , or detected , otherwise . Error latency is the length of time between the occurrence of an error and the appearance of the corresponding failure or its detection . 2.2.3 Faults A fault ( I. Lee & Iyer , 1993 ) is a defect , or an imperfection , or a lack in a system's hardware or software component . It is generically defined as the adjudged or hypothesised cause of an error . Faults can have their origin within the system boundaries ( internal faults ) or outside , i.e. , in the environment ( external faults ) . In particular , an internal fault is said to be active when it produces an error , and dormant ( or latent ) when it does not . A dormant fault becomes an active fault when it is activated by the computation process or the environment . Fault latency is defined as either the length of time between the occurrence of a fault and the appearance of the corresponding error , or the length of time between the occurrence of a fault and its removal . Faults can be classified according to five viewpoints ( Laprie , 1992 , 1995 , 1998 ) – phenomenological cause , nature , phase of creation or occurrence , situation with respect to system boundaries , persistence . Not all combinations can give rise to a fault class – this process only defines 17 fault classes , summarized in Fig. 3 . These classes have been further partitioned into three "" groups "" , known as combined fault classes . The combined fault classes that are more relevant in the rest of the book are now briefly characterized : Physical faults : • Permanent , internal , physical faults . This class concerns those faults that have their origin within hardware components and are continuously active . A typical example is given by the fault corresponding to a worn out component . • Temporary , internal , physical faults ( also known as intermittent faults ) ( Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 1997 ) . These are typically internal , physical defects that become active depending on a particular pointwise condition . • Permanent , external , physical faults . These are faults induced on the system by the physical environment . Figure 3 : Laprie's fault classification scheme . • Temporary , external , physical faults ( also known as transient faults ) ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . These are faults induced by environmental phenomena , e.g. , EMI . Design faults : • Intentional , though not malicious , permanent / temporary design faults . These are basically trade-offs introduced at design time . A typical example is insufficient dimensioning ( underestimations of the size of a given field in a communication protocol1 , and so forth ) . • Accidental , permanent , design faults ( also called systematic faults , or Bohrbugs ) : flawed algorithms that systematically turn into the same errors in the presence of the same input conditions and initial states – for instance , an unchecked divisor that can result in a division-by-zero error . • Accidental , temporary design faults ( known as Heisenbugs , for "" bugs of Heisenberg "" , after their elusive character ) : while systematic faults have an evident , deterministic behavior , these bugs depend on subtle combinations of the system state and environment . Interaction faults : • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , accidental faults . These include operator faults , in which an operator does not correctly perform his or her role in system operation . • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , non-malicious faults : "" neglect , interaction , or incorrect use problems "" ( Sibley , 1998 ) . Examples include poorly chosen passwords and bad system parameter setting . • Temporary , external , operational , human-made , malicious faults . This class includes the so-called malicious replication faults , i.e. , faults that occur when replicated information in a system becomes inconsistent , either because replicates that are supposed to provide identical results no longer do so , or because the aggregate of the data from the various replicates is no longer consistent with system specifications . 2.3 Means for Dependability Developing a dependable service , i.e. , a service on which reliance can be placed justifiably , calls for the combined utilisation of a set of methods and techniques globally referred to as the "" means for dependability "" ( Laprie , 1998 ) : fault prevention aims at preventing the occurrence or introduction of faults . Techniques in this category include , e.g. , quality assurance and design methodologies ; fault-tolerance groups methods and techniques to set up services capable of fulfilling their function in spite of faults ; fault removal aims at reducing the number , incidence , and consequences of faults . Fault removal is composed of three steps : verification , diagnosis and correction . Verification checks whether the system adheres to certain properties – the verification conditions – during the design , development , production or operation phase ; if it does not , the fault ( s ) preventing these conditions to be fulfilled must be diagnosed , and the necessary corrections ( corrective maintenance ) must be made ; fault forecasting investigates how to estimate the present number , the future incidence and the consequences of faults . Fault forecasting is conducted by evaluating the system behavior with respect to fault occurrence or activation . Qualitatively , it aims at identifying , classifying and ordering failure modes or at identifying event combinations leading to undesired effects . Quantitatively , it aims at evaluating ( in terms of probabilities ) some of the attributes of dependability . Of the above mentioned methods , fault-tolerance represents the core tool for the techniques and tools presented in this book . Because of this , it is discussed in more detail in Sect . 2.3.1 . 2.3.1 Fault-Tolerance Fault-tolerance methods come into play the moment a fault enters the system boundaries . Its core objective is "" preserving the delivery of expected services despite the presence of fault-caused errors within the system itself "" ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . Fault-tolerance has its roots in hardware systems , where the assumption of random component failures is substantiated by the physical characteristics of the adopted devices ( Rushby , 1994 ) . According to ( Anderson & Lee , 1981 ) , fault-tolerance can be decomposed into two sub-techniques – error processing and fault treatment . Error processing aims at removing errors from the computational state ( if possible , before failure occurrence ) . It can be based on the following primitives ( Laprie , 1995 ) : Error detection , which focuses on detecting the presence in the system of latent errors before they are activated . This can be done , e.g. , by means of built-in self-tests or by comparison with redundant computations ( Rushby , 1994 ) . Error diagnosis i.e. , assessing the damages caused by the detected errors or by errors propagated before detection . Error recovery consists of methods to replace an erroneous state with an error-free state . This replacement takes one of the following forms : 1 . Compensation , which means reverting the erroneous state into an error-free one exploiting information redundancy available in the erroneous state , predisposed , e.g. , through the adoption of error correcting codes ( Johnson , 1989 ) . 2 . Forward recovery , which finds a new state from which the system can operate ( frequently in degraded mode ) . This method only allows recovering from errors of which the damage can be anticipated 2 – therefore , this method is system dependent ( P. Lee & Anderson , 1990 ) . The main tool for forward error recovery , according to ( Cristian , 1995 ) , is exception handling . 3 . Backward recovery , which substitutes an erroneous state by an error-free state prior to the error occurrence . As a consequence , the method requires that , at different points in time ( known as recovery points ) , the current state of the system be saved in some stable storage means . If a system state saved in a recovery point is error-free , it can be used to restore the system to that state , thus wiping out the effects of transient faults . For the same reason , this technique allows also to recover from errors of which the damage can not or has not been anticipated . The need for backward error recovery tools and techniques stems from their ability to prevent the occurrence of failures originated by transient faults , which are many times more frequent than permanent faults ( Rushby , 1994 ) . The main tools for backward error recovery are based on checkpoint-and-rollback ( Deconinck , 1996 ) and recovery blocks ( Randell , 1975 ) ( see Chapter 3 ) . According to ( Rushby , 1994 ) , an alternative technique with respect to error recovery is fault masking , classically achieved by modular redundancy ( Johnson , 1989 ) : a redundant set of components perform independently on the same input value . Results are voted upon . The basic assumption of this method is again that of random component failures – in other words , to be effective , modular redundancy requires statistical independence , because correlated failures translate in contemporary exhaustion of the available redundancy . Unfortunately a number of experiments ( Eckhardt et al. , 1991 ) and theoretical studies ( Eckhardt & Lee , 1985 ) have shown that often this assumption is incorrect , to the point that even independent faults are able to produce correlated failures . In this context , the concept of design diversity ( or N - version programming ) came up ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . It is discussed in Chapter 3 . Fault treatment aims at preventing faults from being re-activated . It can be based on the following primitives ( Laprie , 1995 ) : Fault diagnosis i.e. , identifying the cause ( s ) of the error ( s ) , in location and nature , i.e. determining the fault classes to which the faults belong . This is different from error diagnosis ; besides , different faults can lead to the same error . Fault passivation i.e. , preventing the re-activation of the fault . This step is not necessary if the error recovery step removes the fault , or if the likelihood of re-activation of the fault is low enough . Reconfiguration updates the structure of the system so that non-failed components fulfill the system function , possibly at a degraded level , even though some other components have failed . 3 FAULT-TOLERANCE , REDUNDANCY , AND COMPLEXITY A well-known result by Shannon ( Shannon , Winer , & Sloane , 1993 ) tells us that , from any unreliable channel , it is possible to set up a more reliable channel by increasing the degree of information redundancy . This means that it is possible to trade off reliability and redundancy of a channel . The author of this book observes that the same can be said for a fault-tolerant system , because fault-tolerance is in general the result of some strategy effectively exploiting some form of redundancy – time , information , and / or hardware redundancy ( Johnson , 1989 ) . This redundancy has a cost penalty attached , though . Addressing a weak failure semantics , able to span many failure behaviors , effectively translates in higher reliability – nevertheless , 1 . it requires large amounts of extra resources , and therefore implies a high cost penalty , and 2 . it consumes large amounts of extra resources , which translates into the rapid exhaustion of the extra resources . For instance , a well-known result by Lamport et al. ( Lamport et al. , 1982 ) sets the minimum level of redundancy required for tolerating Byzantine failures to a value that is greater than the one required for tolerating , e.g. , value failures . Using the simplest of the algorithms described in the cited paper , a 4-modular-redundant ( 4-MR ) system can only withstand any single Byzantine failure , while the same system may exploit its redundancy to withstand up to three crash faults – though no other kind of fault ( Powell , 1997 ) . In other words : After the occurrence of a crash fault , a 4-MR system with strict Byzantine failure semantics has exhausted its redundancy and is no more dependable than a non-redundant system supplying the same service , while the crash failure semantics system is able to survive to the occurrence of that and two other crash faults . On the other hand , the latter system , subject to just one Byzantine fault , would fail regardless its redundancy . Therefore , for any given level of redundancy , trading complexity of failure mode against number and type of faults tolerated may be considered as an important capability for an effective fault-tolerant structure . Dynamic adaptability to different environmental conditions3 may provide a satisfactory answer to this need , especially when the additional complexity does not burden ( and jeopardize ) the application . Ideally , such complexity should be part of a custom architecture and not of the application . On the contrary , the embedding in the application of complex failure semantics , covering many failure modes , implicitly promotes complexity , as it may require the implementation of many recovery mechanisms . This complexity is detrimental to the dependability of the system , as it is in itself a significant source of design faults . Furthermore , the isolation of that complexity outside the user application may allow cost-effective verification , validation and testing . These processes may be unfeasible at application level . The author of this book conjectures that a satisfactory solution to the design problem of the management of the fault-tolerance code ( presented in Chapter 2 ) may translate in an optimal management of the failure semantics ( with respect to the involved penalties ) . The fault-tolerance linguistic structure proposed in Chapter 6 allows solving the above problems by means of its adaptability . 4 CONCLUSION This chapter has introduced the reader to Laprie's model of dependability describing its attributes , impairments , and means . The central topic of this book , fault-tolerance , has also been briefly discussed . The complex relation between the management of fault-tolerance , of redundancy , and of complexity , has been pointed out . In particular , a link has been conjectured between attribute adaptability and the dynamic ability to trade off the complexity of failure mode against number and type of faults being tolerated .

Currently , an IP address consists of four sections separated by periods . Each section contains an 8-bit value , for a total of 32 bits per address . Normally this would allow for more than 4 billion possible IP addresses – a rather acceptable value . Unfortunately , due to a lavish method for assigning IP address space , IP addresses are rapidly running out . A new protocol , IPv6 ( Hinden & Deering , 1995 ) , is going to fix this problem through larger data fields ( 128-bit addresses ) and a more flexible allocation algorithm . 2 In general , program specifications are not complete : there exist input states for which the behavior of the corresponding program P has been left unspecified . No forward recovery technique can be applied to deal with errors resulting from executing P on these input states . On the contrary , if a given specification is complete , that is , if each input state is covered in the set G of all the standard and exceptional specifications for P , and if P is totally correct , i.e. fully consistent with what prescribed in G , then P is said to be robust ( Cristian , 1995 ) . In this case forward recovery can be used as an effective tool for error recovery . 3 The following quote by J. Horning ( Horning , 1998 ) captures very well how relevant may be the role of the environment with respect to achieving the required quality of service : "" What is the most often overlooked risk in software engineering ?

The main objective of this chapter is introducing two sets of design assumptions that shape the way our fault-tolerant software is structured – the system and the fault models . Often misunderstood or underestimated , those models describe • what is expected from the execution environment in order to let our software system function correctly , • and what are the faults that our system is going to consider . Note that a fault-tolerant program shall ( try to ) tolerate only those faults stated in the fault model , and will be as defenseless against all other faults as any non fault-tolerant program . Together with the system specification , the fault and system models represent the foundation on top of which our computer services are built . It is not surprising that weak foundations often result in falling constructions . What is really surprising is that in so many cases little or no attention had been given to those important factors in fault-tolerant software engineering . To give an idea of this , three well-known accidents are described – the Ariane 5 flight 501 and Mariner-1 disasters and the Therac-25 accidents . In each case it is stressed what went wrong , what were the biggest mistakes , and how a careful understanding of fault models and system models would have helped highlighting the path to avoid catastrophic failures that cost considerable amounts of money and even the lives of innocent people . The other important objective of this chapter is introducing the core subject of this book : Software fault-tolerance situated at the level of the application layer . First of all , it is explained why targeting ( also ) the application layer is not an open option but a mandatory design choice for effective fault-tolerant software engineering . Secondly , given the peculiarities of the application layer , three properties to measure the quality of the methods to achieve fault-tolerant application software are introduced : 1 . Separation of design concerns , that is , how good the method is in keeping the functional aspects and the fault-tolerance aspects separated from each other . 2 . Syntactical adequacy , namely how versatile the employed method is in including the wider spectrum of fault-tolerance strategies . 3 . Adaptability : How good the employed fault-tolerance method is in dealing with the inevitable changes characterizing the system and its run-time environment , including the dynamics of faults that manifest themselves at service time . Finally , this chapter also defines a few fundamental fault-tolerance services , namely watchdog timers , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing-and-rollback . 2 WHAT IS A FAULT-TOLERANT PROGRAM ? So what makes a program fault-tolerant ? In order to answer this key question , let us further detail what a service is : In the following a service is considered as a set of manifestations of external events that , if compliant to what agreed upon in a formal specification , can be considered by a watcher as being "" correct "" . This said , a program can be defined as a physical entity , stored for instance as voltage values in a set of memory cells , which is supposed to drive the production of a service . One of the main goals of software engineering is being able to set up of a robust link ( in mathematical terms , a emphhomomorphism / ) between a service's high-level specification and a low-level computer design ( the program ) . More formally , for some functions f and g it is true that Service = f ( program ) , program = g ( specification ) . A first ( obvious ) conclusion is the hard link between the service and its specification : Service = g · f ( specification ) . Building robust versions of f and g is well known as being a difficult , non trivial job . Now let us concentrate on the range of g ( the software set ) . For any two systems a and b , if a relies on b to provide its service , then the expression "" a depends on b "" will be used . We shall represent this through the following notation : a ⇒ b . This relation is called the "" dependence "" among the two systems . Clearly it is true that , for instance , Service ⇒ program , program ⇒ CPU , and CPU ⇒ memory . Trying to develop an exhaustive list of dependent systems may be a long-lasting exercise , and most likely it would end up with an incomplete categorization . Figure 1 provides an arbitrary incomplete expansion of the dependence relation . As evident from that picture , dependences call for Dependability , i.e. , the fundamental property to achieve Dependable services which has been characterized in Chapter 1 . A dependable service is then one that persists even when , for instance , its corresponding program experiences faults – to some agreed upon extent . When designing a fault-tolerant program , two important steps are : Figure 1 : An expansion of the dependence relation . 1 . Defining the System model , which declares the characteristics we expect from the run-time environment – the main system features our program will depend upon at run-time . 2 . Defining the Fault model , which enumerates the erroneous cases that one considers and aims to tolerate . Summarizing , the main three variables that the designer of a fault-tolerant service needs to take into account in order to preserve its functions are : The specification , the system model , and the fault model : Fault-tolerant Service ⇒ ( specification , system model , fault model ) . In the following two sections the system and fault models are characterized . 2.1 Dependable Services : The System Model System Model The system model characterizes the properties of the system components our program depends upon . It could be represented as a tree like the one in Fig. 1 whose leaves are computation , communication and clock sub-systems . These leaves are annotated with statements representing some expected properties of the corresponding sub-systems . 2.1.1 Synchronous System Model . A well-known system model is the synchronous model : In such a system the service depends on "" perfect "" ( ideal ) computation , communication and clock sub-systems . In particular , that model dictates that it is possible to know precisely how long will it take for any task to be fully executed by the available CPUs and for any message to be sent and eventually received through the available communication networks . Moreover , the hardware clocks available on different nodes are perfect – no drift is possible . The main benefit of such a model is that it facilitates considerably the task of the designer and the developer : The system is assumed to be perfectly stable , which means that no disruptions are deemed as likely to occur . This paves the way to the adoption of simple software structures , such as connection-oriented communication : Any two tasks willing to communicate with each other first establish a connection and then synchronously exchange messages through it . This structure is very simple and much more effective than , e.g. , datagram-based communication – where messages are sent asynchronously , and each of them must be routed separately to destination . Clearly opting for the synchronous system model is an optimistic approach , though not always a very realistic one . Writing a program with these assumptions means basically shifting problems to deployment time . This is because whatever violation of the system assumptions becomes a fault . Possible events , such as a late message arrival or a missed deadline , violate the model assumptions and can lead to a failure . Even momentary disruptions e.g. a node becoming unavailable for a small fraction of a second and then back on-line are not compatible with the synchronous system assumption – for instance , they break all the connections between the tasks on that node and those residing elsewhere in the system . This single event becomes a fault that triggers potentially many errors . Tolerating that single fault requires a non trivial error treatment , e.g. re-establishing all the broken connections through some distributed protocol . Of course in some cases it can be possible to build up a system that strictly obeys the synchronous system model . But such a system would require custom , non-standard hardware / software components : For instance , synchronous Ethernet could be used for communication instead of the inherently non-deterministic CSMA / CD Ethernet . These choices clearly have the consequence to strengthen the dependence between service and target platform . Embedded systems are exactly this – a combination of custom hardware and software assembled so as to produce a well defined , special purpose service . In some other cases – for instance , hard real-time systems – the synchronous system model is the only option , as the service specification dictates strict deterministic execution for all processing and communication tasks . 2.1.2 Asynchronous System Model . At the other extreme in the spectrum of possible system models is the asynchronous system model . Its main assumptions are : • No bounds on the relative speed of process execution . • No bounds on message transmission delays . • No hardware clocks are available or otherwise there are no bounds to clock drift . As can be clearly understood this model is quite simple , does not impose special constraint on the hardware platform and ( in a sense ) is more close to reality : It recognizes that non-determinism and asynchrony are common and does not try to deny or fight this matter of fact . This matches many common life execution environments such as the Internet . Unfortunately as Einstein would say this system model is too simple : It was proven that given these assumptions one can not come up with effective solutions to services such as time-based coordination and failure detection ( Fischer , Lynch , & Paterson , 1985 ) . 2.1.3 Partially Synchronous System Model . Given the disadvantages of these two main system models , designers have been trying to devise new models combining the best of both aspects . Partial synchrony models belong to this category . Such models consider that for some systems and some environments there are long period of times where the system is obeying the synchronous hypotheses and physical time bounds are respected . Such periods are followed by brief periods where delays are experienced on processing and communication tasks . One such model is the so-called timed asynchronous system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , which is characterized by the following assumptions : Timed asynchronous system model • All tasks communicate through the network via a datagram service with omission / performance failure semantics ( see Chapter 1 ) . • All services are timed : specifications prescribe not only the outputs and state transitions that should occur in response to inputs , but also the time intervals within which a client task can expect these outputs and transitions to occur . • All tasks ( including those related to the OS and the network ) have crash / performance failure semantics ( again , see Chapter 1 ) . • All tasks have access to a local hardware clock . If more than one node is present , clocks on different nodes have a bounded drift rate . • A "" time-out "" service is available at application-level : Tasks can schedule the execution of events so that they occur at a given future point in time , as measured by their local clock1 . In particular , this model allows a straightforward modeling of system partitioning : As a result of sufficiently many omission or performance communication failures , correct nodes may be temporarily disconnected from the rest of the system during so-called periods of instability ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) . Moreover it is assumed that , at reset , tasks or nodes restart from a well-defined , initial state – partial-amnesia crashes ( defined in Chapter 1 ) are not considered . As clearly explained in the cited paper , the above hypotheses match well current distributed systems based on networked workstations – as such , they represent an effective model on which to build our fault-tolerant services . 2.2 Dependable Services : The Fault Model Another important step when designing a fault-tolerant system is the choice of which erroneous conditions one wants to tackle so as to prevent them to lead to system failures . This set of conditions that our fault-tolerant system is to tolerate is the fault model , F. What is F exactly ? It is a set of events that • may hinder the service distribution , and that • are considered as likely to occur , and that • one aims to tolerate ( that is , prevent them from turning into failures ) . Clearly F is a very important property for any fault-tolerant program , because even the most sophisticated fault-tolerant program p will be defenseless when any other condition than the ones in its fault model takes place . To highlight this fact , programs shall be referred to as functions of F , e.g. one shall write p ( F ) . A special case is given by non fault-tolerant programs , that is , programs with an empty fault model . In this case one shall write p ( ∅ ) . The same applies for the service produced by program p ( F ) . In what follows such a service will be referred to as an F - dependable service . In other words an F - dependable service is one that persists despite the occurrence of faults as described in its fault model F. An important property of F is that , in turn , it is a function of an environment E where the service ( or better , its corresponding program ) is operating . Clearly an F - dependable service may tolerate faults in E ' and may not do so for those in E '' : An airborne service may well experience different events than , e.g. , one meant in an electrical energy primary substation2 ( Unipede , 1995 ) . Obviously the choice of F is an important aspect towards a successful development of a dependable service . Imagine for instance what may happen if our fault model F matches the wrong environment , or if the target environment changes its characteristics ( e.g. a rising of temperature due to a firing ) . One may argue that all the above cases are exceptional , and that most of the time they do not take place . This was maybe the case in the past , when services were stable . Our services now run in a very fluid environment , where the occurrence of changes is the rule , not the exception . As a consequence , software engineering for fault-tolerant systems should allow to consider the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . The author is convinced that any current fault-tolerance provision should adopt such structure for its fault model . Failing to do so leaves the designer with two choices : 1 . Overshooting , i.e. , over-dimensioning the fault-tolerance provisions with respect to the actual threats being experienced , or 2 . undershooting , namely underestimating the threat in view of an economy of resources . Note how those two risks turn into a crucial dilemma to the designer : Wrong choices here can lead to either unpractical , too costly designs , or to cheap but vulnerable provisions : Fault-tolerant codes that are not dependable enough to face successfully the threats actually experienced . In Chapter 4 it is introduced and discussed an example of fault-tolerant software whose fault model dynamically changes tracking the environment . Next section focuses on a few cases where static fault models and wrong system models led to catastrophic consequences . 3 3.1 ( IN ) FAMOUS ACCIDENTS Faulty Fault Models : The Ariane 5 Flight 501 On June 4 , 1996 , the maiden flight of the unmanned Ariane 5 rocket ended in a failure just forty seconds after its lift-off from Kourou , French Guiana . At an altitude of about 3700 meters , the launcher veered off its flight path , broke up and exploded . The rocket was on its first voyage , and it took the European Space Agency ( ESA ) more than a decade of intense development costing $ 7 billion . Designed as a successor to the successful Ariane 4 series , the Ariane 5 was designed to be capable of hurling a cargo of several tons – four identical scientific satellites that were designed to establish precisely how the Earth's magnetic field interacts with solar winds – into orbit each launch , and was intended to give Europe a leading edge in the commercial space business . After the failure , the ESA set up an independent Inquiry Board to identify the causes of the failure . It was their task to determine the causes of the launch failure , investigate whether the qualification tests and acceptance tests were appropriate in relation to the problem encountered and recommend corrective actions . The recommendations of the Board concern mainly around software engineering practices like testing , reviewing and the construction of specifications and requirements . The case of the Ariane 5 is particularly meaningful to what discussed so far , because it provides us with an example of a fault-tolerant design that did not consider the right fault model . This was the ultimate cause of its failure . In the following we discuss what happened and which have been the main mistakes with respect to the discussion so far . The Flight Control System of the Ariane 5 was of a standard design . The attitude of the launcher and its movements in space were measured by an Inertial Reference System ( SRI ) . The SRI had its own internal computer , in which angles and velocities were calculated on the basis of information from a strap-down inertial platform , with laser gyros and accelerometers . The data from the SRI were transmitted through the data-bus to an On-Board Computer ( OBC ) , which executed the flight program and controlled the nozzles of the solid boosters and the so-called Vulcain cryogenic engine , via servovalves and hydraulic actuators . As already mentioned , this system was fault-tolerant : In order to improve its reliability two SRI's were operating in parallel , with identical hardware and software . For the time being the consequences of this particular design choice will not be considered – Chapter 3 will go back to this issue . One SRI was active and one was in hot stand-by – as soon as the OBC detected that the active SRI had failed it immediately switched to the other one , provided that this unit was functioning properly . Likewise the system was equipped with two OBC's , and a number of other units in the Flight Control System were also duplicated . The software used in the Ariane 5 SRI was mostly reused from that of the Ariane 4 SRI . The launcher started to disintegrate about 39 seconds after take-off because of high aerodynamic loads due to an angle of attack of more than 20 degrees that led to separation of the boosters from the main stage , in turn triggering the self-destruct system of the launcher . This angle of attack was caused by full nozzle deflections of the solid boosters and the so-called Vulcain main engine . These nozzle deflections were commanded by the OBC software on the basis of data transmitted by the active Inertial Reference System ( SRI 2 ) . Part of these data at that time did not contain proper flight data , but showed a diagnostic bit pattern of the computer of the SRI 2 , which was interpreted as flight data . The reason why the active SRI 2 did not send correct attitude data was that the unit had declared a failure due to a software exception . The OBC could not switch to the backup SRI 1 because that unit had already ceased to function during the previous data cycle ( 72 millisecond period ) for the same reason as SRI 2 . The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value . The floating point number which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer . This resulted in an Operand Error . The data conversion instructions ( in Ada code ) were not protected from causing an Operand Error , although other conversions of comparable variables in the same place in the code were protected . No reference to justification of this decision was found directly in the source code . Given the large amount of documentation associated with any industrial application , the assumption , although agreed , was essentially obscured , though not deliberately , from any external review . The reason for the three remaining variables , including BH , the one denoting horizontal bias , being unprotected was that further reasoning indicated that they were either physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety , a reasoning which in the case of the variable BH turned out to be faulty . The main reason behind the failure was a software reuse error in the Inertial Reference System ( ISR ) . Specifically , the conversion from horizontal velocity of the rocket ( represented as a 64-bit floating-point number ) with respect to the platform to a 16-bit signed integer resulted in an overflow , as the number was larger than the largest integer storable in a 16-bit unsigned integer , resulting in an overflow exception being thrown . This failure caused complete loss of guidance and attitude information approximately 37 seconds after the start of the main engine ignition sequence . Ariane 5 had been deprived of its basic faculties : Its perception of where it was in the sky and which direction it had to proceed . This loss of information was due to specification and design errors in the ISR , upon which depends the Flight Control Computer ( FCC ) . This software was originally developed and successfully used in the Ariane 4 but was not altered to support the new flight trajectory and increase in horizontal acceleration resulting from the new Vulcain engines . Because of this , the ISR memory banks were quickly overloaded with information that could not be processed and fed to the onboard computers fast enough . The FCC could thus no longer ensure the correct guidance and control and from that instant the launcher was lost . Several are the reasons behind the Ariane 5 failure – in what follows the focus shall go on the one more pertaining to this chapter : Several faults resulting in Operand Errors were included in the Ariane 4 fault model , F. Treating these faults introduced some run-time overhead . To minimize this overhead , some of these faults were not included in the fault model , reduced to a smaller F ' . One of the faults in F but not in F ' triggered the chain of events that ultimately led to the Ariane failure . 3.2 Faulty Specifications : The Mariner 1 . The Mariner Program , a series of ten spacecrafts , was started by NASA on July 22 , 1962 with the launch of Mariner 1 and ended on November 3 , 1973 , with the launch of Mariner 10 . Other spacecraft , based on these , were continued with different names , like Voyager and Viking . Mariner 1 , a 202.8 kg unmanned spacecraft , was sent to Venus for a flyby with several scientific instruments on board , such as a microwave radiometer , an infrared radiometer and a cosmic dust detector . These should investigate Venus and its orbits . The Mariner was made by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) and to be used by NASA . The total costs for this spacecraft were close to $ 14 million . For getting into space , the Mariner 1 was attached to an Atlas-Agena rocket . Such type of rocket had been already used for launching missiles . It used different antennas to be controllable by a ground control unit , but it had its own on-board control system in case of a failing communication . The launch was rescheduled to July 20 , 1962 . That day at Cape Canaveral launch platform the first countdown started , after which a fey delays occurred because of problems in the range safety command system . The countdown was stopped and restarted once before being canceled because of a blown fuse in the range safety circuits . At 23 : 08 local time on July 21 , the countdown began again . Another three holds gave the technicians time to fix minor issues such as power fluctuations in the radio guidance system . At 09 : 21 : 23 UTC , the countdown ended and the spaceship started its launch . Let us call this time as time X. A few minutes later , the range safety officer noticed that the spacecraft was going out of course , and at X + 4 minutes , it was clear that manual correction was necessary . However , the spacecraft did not react as hoped and went more and more off course . A strict deadline at this stage was Figure 2 : The Mariner 1 time X + 300 , corresponding to the separation of the Atlas / Agena rocket . After this time destroying the Mariner1 would not be possible anymore . To prevent serious damage , the range safety officer decided to enforce destroyment at X + 293 seconds . The Mariner 1 radio transponder kept sending signals until X + 357 seconds . The investigation on what went wrong includes many factors . A brief overview is given in what follows . It is sometimes stated that a misspelling in a Fortran program was responsible for the crash of the Mariner 1 . However , this is not true – such bug existed in another system in the Mercury project , which was fixed before being able to do any harm . In fact , the faulty software was used in several missions , but corrected before the resulting inaccurate data resulted in a flight failure . The bug was caused by two main factors : Fortran , which ignores spaces , and a design fault – a small typo , a period instead of a comma , resulting in a line like "" DO 5 K = 1 , 3 "" ( an iterative loop ) being interpreted as "" DO5K = 1.3 "" ( an assignment ) . The actual cause of the crash started with a hardware malfunction of the Atlas antennas . The beacon for measuring the rate of the spacecraft failed to pass signals for four periods ranging from 1.5 to 61 seconds . During the absence of correct data , a smoothed function should guide the spacecraft into the right direction . However , the smooth function had not been implemented , resulting in fast changes in the course direction . To counteract these drastic changes , the course was changed over and over again , with the vehicle going more and more off its intended course . For each flight , a Range Safety Officer made sure that , should the spacecraft go out of a safety zone , it would be destructed before being able to do any harm to people or the environment . After the Range Safety Officer saw that the flight was uncontrollable before being out of reach he ordered to let the Mariner 1 explode , to prevent further damage . This happened only 7 seconds before the separation of the Mariner 1 and the Atlas-Agena rocket , which held the explosives . Why the smooth function had not been implemented ? The error had occurred when an equation was being transcribed by hand in the specification for the guidance program . The writer missed the superscript bar in r ̇ n ( the n-th smoothed value of the time derivative of a radius ) . Without the smoothing function indicated by the bar , the program treated normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious , causing spurious corrections that sent the rocket off course . Because of that the Range Safety Officer had to shut it down . As the method would be used only in case of communication failure , and such failure had not been injected during testing experiments , the simulation did not verify the consequences of the hardware failure and did neither notice the slight but catastrophic difference between the expected and the real function values . It is possible to conclude that the Mariner 1 is a classic example of the consequences of a faulty or misinterpreted specification : As mentioned before , Service = f ( program ) , program = g ( specification ) , and a flawed specification fatally translates in a failed service . 3.3 Faulty Models : The Therac-25 Accidents The Therac-25 accidents have been recognized as "" the most serious computer-related accidents to date "" ( Leveson , 1995 ) . Herein they are briefly discussed to give an idea of the consequences of faulty system and fault models . The Therac-25 was a linac , that is , a medical linear accelerator that uses accelerated electrons to create high-energy beams able to destroy tumors with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue . It was the latest member of a successful family of linacs , including e.g. the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 , built by Atomic Energy Commission Limited ( AECL ) , a Canadian company . Compared to its ancestors , the Therac-25 had a revolutionary design : it was smaller , cheaper and more powerful . In the past AECL had built several successful medical linear accelerators , including the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 . Compared to its ancestors , the Therac-25 had three advantages : It was more compact , cheaper and had more features . The compactness was due to the so-called "" double-pass "" concept used for the Therac-25 . This double-pass design of the accelerator meant that the accelerator itself was much more compact , rendering the total size of the machine much smaller . This was achieved by folding the mechanism that accelerates the electrons ( a little like it is for the French horn among wind instruments ) . The cheaper cost of the Therac-25 came from several factors – it was a dual-mode linacs , that is , it was able to produce both electron and photon beams , which required normally two machines ; also , the Therac-6 and the Therac-20 both had hardware interlocks to ensure safe operation . With the development of the Therac-25 however , AECL decided that such interlocks were an unnecessary burden for the customer , raising the costs without bringing extra benefits . Most of the extra complexity of the Therac-25 , including safety issues , was managed in software . This is a key difference between the new model and its ancestors – in the latter , software played a very limited role and "" merely added convenience to the existing hardware , which was capable of standing alone "" ( Leveson , 1995 ) . Such software was custom built but reused routines of the original Therac-6 and Therac-20 code . The Therac-25 software was developed over a period of several years by a single programmer using the PDP 11 assembly language . Even the system software was not standard but custom built . One could argue that when used to compose a life-critical service such as this , software should come with guarantees about its quality and its fault-tolerant features ; unfortunately this was not the case at the time3 . Not only no fault model or system model document had been produced – the safety analysis carried out by AECL was a fault tree where only hardware faults had been considered ! AECL apparently considered their software as error-free . It is interesting to note the assumptions AECL drew on software , as they could be considered as the three main mistakes in fault-tolerant software development : 1 . Programming errors have been significantly reduced by extensive testing on a simulator . Any residual software error is not included in the analysis . 2 . Program software does not wear out or degrade . 3 . Possible faults belong to the following two classes : Hardware physical faults and transient physical faults induced by alpha particles and electromagnetic noise . The Therac-25 software was very complex . It consisted of four major components : Stored data , a scheduler , a set of critical and non-critical tasks , and interrupt services . It used the interrupt-driven software model , and inter-process communication among concurrent tasks was managed through shared memory access . Analysis revealed that no proper synchronization was put into place to secure accesses to shared memory . This introduced race conditions that would cause some of the later accidents . One of the tasks of the software was to monitor the machine status . In particular the treatment unit had an interlock system designed to remove power in case of a hardware malfunction . The software monitored this interlock system and , when faults got detected , either prevented a treatment from being started or , if the treatment was in progress , it suspended or put in hold the treatment . The software had been developed relying on the availability of said interlock system – in other words , it had to be part of the system model document . Changing the system and reusing the software led to disaster . Indeed hardware interlocks had been the only reason that prevented deadly overdoses to be delivered while using the old members of the Therac family of devices . A proof of this was found later with the Therac-20 . At the University of Chicago , students could exercise radiation therapy with the Therac-20 . In the beginning of each academic year , there were a lot of defected machines . Most of the time , the main problem was blown fuses . After about three weeks , these failures would typically go away . After carefully studying this behavior , it was concluded that due to the random faulty configurations entered by students who did not know the machine , overdose charges took place . Fortunately fuses were in place to prevent any overdose damage . Would these fuses also have been in place in the Therac-25 , many of the accidents could have been avoided4 . 4 SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE Research in fault-tolerance concentrated for many years on hardware fault-tolerance , i.e. , on devising a number of effective and ingenious hardware structures to cope with faults ( Johnson , 1989 ) . For some time this approach was considered as the only one needed in order to reach the requirements of availability and data integrity demanded by nowadays complex computer services . Probably the first researcher who realized that this was far from being true was B. Randell who in 1975 ( Randell , 1975 ) questioned hardware fault-tolerance as the only approach to employ – in the cited paper he states : "" Hardware component failures are only one source of unreliability in computing systems , decreasing in significance as component reliability improves , while software faults have become increasingly prevalent with the steadily increasing size and complexity of software systems . "" Indeed most of the complexity supplied by modern computing services lies in their software rather than in the hardware layer ( Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ; Huang & Kintala , 1995 ; Wiener , 1993 ; Randell , 1975 ) . This state of things could only be reached by exploiting a powerful conceptual tool for managing complexity in a flexible and effective way , i.e. , devising hierarchies of sophisticated abstract machines ( Tanenbaum , 1990 ) . This translates in implementing software with high-level computer languages lying on top of other software strata – middleware , the device drivers layers , the basic services kernel , the operating system , the run-time support of the involved programming languages , and so forth . Partitioning the complexity into stacks of software layers allowed the implementor to focus exclusively on the high-level aspects of their problems , and hence it allowed managing a larger and larger degree of complexity . But though made transparent , still this complexity is part of the overall system being developed . A number of complex algorithms are concurrently executed by the hardware , resulting in the simultaneous progress of many system states – under the hypothesis that no involved abstract machine , nor the actual hardware , be affected by faults . Unfortunately , as in real life faults do occur , the corresponding deviations are likely to jeopardize the system's function , also propagating from one layer to the other , unless appropriate means are taken to avoid in the first place , or to remove , or to tolerate these faults . In particular , faults may also occur in the application layer , that is , in the abstract machine on top of the software hierarchy5 . These faults , possibly having their origin at design time , or during operation , or while interacting with the environment , are not different in the extent of their consequences from those faults originating , e.g. , in the hardware or the operating system . An efficacious argument to bring evidence to the above statement is the case of the so-called "" millennium bug "" , i.e. , the most popular class of design faults that ever emerged in the history of computing technologies , also known as "" the year 2000 problem "" , or as "" Y2K "" . The source of this problem is simple : Most of the software still in use today was developed using a standard where dates are coded in a 6-digit format . According to this standard , two digits were considered as enough to represent the year . Unfortunately this translates into the impossibility to distinguish , e.g. , year 2000 from year 1900 , which by the en of last century was recognized as the possible cause of an unpredictably large number of failures when calculating time elapsed between two calendar dates , as for instance year 1900 was not a leap year while year 2000 is . Choosing the above mentioned standard to represent dates resulted in a hidden , almost forgotten design fault , never considered nor tested by application programmers . As society got closer and closer to the year 2000 , the possible presence of this design fault in our software became a nightmare that seemed to jeopardize all those crucial functions of our society today appointed to programs manipulating calendar dates , such us utilities , transportation , health care , communication , public administration , and so forth . Luckily the expected many and possibly crucial system failures due to this one application-level fault ( Hansen , LaSala , Keene , & Coppola , 1999 ) were not so many and not that crucial , though probably for the first time the whole society became aware of the extent of the relevance of dependability in software . These facts and the above reasoning suggest that , the higher the level of abstraction , the higher the complexity of the algorithms into play and the consequent error proneness of the involved ( real or abstract ) machines . As a conclusion , full tolerance of faults and the complete fulfillment of the dependability design goals of a complex software application call for the adoption of protocols to avoid , remove , or tolerate faults working at all levels , including the application layer . 5 SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE IN THE APPLICATION LAYER The need of software fault-tolerance provisions located in the application layer is supported by studies that showed that the majority of failures experienced by nowadays computer systems are due to software faults , including those located in the application layer ( Lyu , 1998a , 1998b ; Laprie , 1998 ) ; for instance , NRC reported that 81 % of the total number of outages of US switching systems in 1992 were due to software faults ( NRC , 1993 ) . Moreover , nowadays application software systems are increasingly networked and distributed . Such systems , e.g. , client-server applications , are often characterized by a loosely coupled architecture whose global structure is in general more prone to failures6 . Due to the complex and temporal nature of interleaving of messages and computations in distributed software systems , no amount of verification , validation and testing can eliminate all faults in an application and give complete confidence in the availability and data consistency of applications of this kind ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) . Under these assumptions , the only alternative ( and effective ) means for increasing software reliability is that of incorporating in the application software provisions of software fault-tolerance ( Randell , 1975 ) . Another argument that justifies the addition of software fault-tolerance means in the application layer is given by the widespread adoption of object orientation , components and service orientation . Structuring one's software into a web of objects , components and services is a wonderful conceptual tool which allows to quickly compose a service out of reusable components . This has wonderful relapses on many aspects including development and maintenance times and costs , but has also a little drawback : it promotes the composition of software systems from third-party objects the sources of which are unknown to the application developers . In other words , the object , component and service abstractions fostered the capability to deal with higher and higher levels of complexity in software and at the same time eased and therefore encouraged software reuse . As just mentioned , this has very positive impacts though it translates the application in a sort of collection of reused , pre-existing components or objects made by third parties . The reliability of these software entities and hence their impact on the overall reliability of the user application is often unknown , to the point that Grey refers as an "" art "" to the ability to create reliable applications using off-the-shelf software components ( Green , 1997 ) . The case of the Ariane 501 flight and that of the Therac-25 linear accelerator ( see Chapter 2 ) are well-known examples that show how improper reuse of software may produce severe consequences ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . But probably the most convincing reasoning for not excluding the application layer from a fault-tolerance strategy is the so-called "" end-to-end argument "" – a system design principle introduced in ( Saltzer , Reed , & Clark , 1984 ) . Such principle states that , rather often , functions such as reliable file transfer , can be completely and correctly implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the underlying system ( for instance , the communication network ) . This does not mean that everything should be done at the application level – fault-tolerance strategies in the underlying hardware and operating system can have a strong impact on the system's performance . However , an extraordinarily reliable communication system that guarantees that no packet is mistreated ( lost , duplicated , or corrupted , or delivered to the wrong addressee ) does not reduce the burden of the application programmer to ensure reliability : For instance , for reliable file transfer , the application programs that perform the transfer must still supply a file-transfer-specific , end-to-end reliability guarantee . The main message of this chapter can be summarized as follows : Pure hardware-based or operating system-based solutions to fault-tolerance , though often characterized by a higher degree of transparency , are not fully capable of providing complete end-to-end tolerance to faults in the user application . Relying solely on the hardware , the middleware , or the operating system is a mistake : • It develops only partially satisfying solutions . • It requires a large amount of extra resources and costs . • And often it is characterized by poor service portability ( Saltzer et al. , 1984 ; Siewiorek & Swarz , 1992 ) . 6 STRATEGIES , PROBLEMS , AND KEY PROPERTIES The above conclusions justify the strong need for application-level fault-tolerance . As a consequence of this need , several approaches to application-level fault-tolerance have been devised during the last three decades ( see chapters 5 – 8 for an extensive survey ) . Such a long research period hints at the complexity of the design problems underlying Application-level fault-tolerance engineering , which include : 1 . How to incorporate fault-tolerance in the application layer of a computer program . 2 . Which fault-tolerance provisions to support . 3 . How to manage the fault-tolerance code . Problem 1 is also known as the problem of the system structure to software fault-tolerance , which was first proposed by B. Randell in 1975 ( Randell , 1975 ) . It states the need of appropriate structuring techniques such that the incorporation of a set of fault-tolerance provisions in the application software might be performed in a simple , coherent , and well structured way . Indeed , poor solutions to this problem result in a huge degree of code intrusion : in such cases , the application code that addresses the functional requirements and the application code that addresses the fault-tolerance requirements are mixed up into one large and complex application software . • This greatly complicates the task of the developer and demands expertise in both the application and the fault-tolerance domains . Negative repercussions on the development times and costs are to be expected . • The maintenance of the resulting code , both for the functional part and for the fault-tolerance provisions , is more complex , costly , and error prone . • Furthermore , the overall complexity of the software product is increased – which , as mentioned in Chapter 1 , is in itself a source of faults . One can conclude that , with respect to the first problem , an ideal system structure should guarantee an adequate Separation between the functional and the fault-tolerance Concerns ( in what follows this property will be referred to as "" sc "" ) . Moreover , the design choice of which fault-tolerance provisions to support can be conditioned by the adequacy of the syntactical structure at "" hosting "" the various provisions . The well-known quotation by B. L. Whorf efficaciously captures this concept : "" Language shapes the way we think , and determines what we can think about "" : Indeed , as explained in Chapter 1 , a non-optimal answer to Problem 2 may • require a high degree of redundancy , and • rapidly consume large amounts of the available redundancy , which at the same time would increase the costs and reduce the reliability . One can conclude that , devising a syntactical structure offering straightforward support to a large set of fault-tolerance provisions , can be an important aspect of an ideal system structure for application-level fault-tolerance . In the following this property will be called Syntactical Adequacy ( or more briefly "" sa "" ) . Finally , one can observe that another important aspect of any application-level fault-tolerance architecture is the way the fault-tolerance code is managed , at compile time as well as at execution time . If one wants to realize F - dependable systems where the fault model F can change over time , as mentioned in Chapter 2 , then our architecture must allow the fault-tolerance code to be changed as well so as to track the changing fault model . A possible way to do so is for instance to have an architectural component to monitor the observed faults and check whether the current fault model is still valid or not . When this is not the case , the component should extend the fault model and change the fault-tolerance code accordingly , either loading some pre-existing code or synthesizing a new one matching the current threat . In both cases , the architecture must allow disabling the old code and enabling the new one . Adaptability ( or a for brevity ) is defined herein as the ability of an application-level fault-tolerant architecture such that it allows on-line ( dynamic ) or at least off-line management of the fault-tolerance provisions and of their parameters . This would allow letting the fault-tolerance code adapt itself to the current environment or at least allow service portability . Clearly an important requirement for any such solution is that it does not overly increase the complexity of the resulting application – which would be detrimental to dependability . The three properties sc , sa and a will be referred to in what follows as the structural attributes of application-level fault-tolerance . 7 SOME WIDELY USED SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE PROVISIONS In this section the key ideas behind some widely used software fault-tolerance building blocks will be introduced : the watchdog timer , exception handling , transactions , and checkpointing and rollback . Such building blocks will be studied in depth in the rest of the book . 7.1 Watchdog Timers Clov : Wait ! Yes Yes ! I have it ! I set the alarm . Hamm : This is perhaps not one of my bright days , but frankly Clov : You whistle me . I do n't come . The alarm rings . I 'm gone . It does n't ring . I 'm dead . [ Pause . ] Hamm : Is it working ? [ Pause . Impatiently . ] The alarm , is it working ? Clov : Why would ' nt it be working ? Hamm : Because it 's worked too much . Clov : But it 's hardly worked at all . Hamm : [ Angrily . ] Then because it 's worked too little ! ( Samuel Beckett , Endgame . ) Watchdogs are versatile and effective tools in detecting processing errors . The idea is very simple : Let us suppose there is a process p that needs to perform cyclically a critical operation and then releases the locks that keep in a waiting state several concurrent processes . Clearly the pending processes are dependant on p : A single fault affecting p and preventing it to continue would result in blocking indefinitely all the pending processes . Obviously it is very important to make sure that a fault stopping p be timely detected . ( Such first service would then lead to proper error recovery steps , e.g. releasing the locks ) . A watchdog timer is an additional process w that monitors the execution of p by requiring the latter to send w periodically a "" sign of life "" – clearing a shared memory flag or sending a heartbeat message to w . By checking whether the flag has been cleared or the heartbeat has arrived , process w can assess that p , at least in the last period , had been at least able to timely send the sign of life . In more formal terms , using the vocabulary of Chapter 2 , one could say that watchdog timers protect p against crash / performance failures . If w does not receive the expected sign of life , then it is said to "" fire . "" Despite its simplicity , the watchdog calls for important choices at design and configuration time . In particular , • How often should p send the sign of life implies a trade off of performance and failure detection latency . Moreover , quite often the dependency chain between p and w is not simple : For instance , p may rely on a communication system C to deliver a heartbeat message , which complicates the matter at hand considerably ( p ⇒ C , so is it C or p that failed when w fired ? ) Of course also dependency chains such as these are an arbitrary simplification , and C could be more precisely identified as a long cascade of dependent sub-services , whose emergent behavior is that of a communication system , each component of which could be the actual source of a problem ultimately resulting in the firing of w . • How often should w check for the arrival of a sign of life from p implies the adherence to a system model , explicitly defined or otherwise . A synchronous system model corresponds to a hard real-time system assumptions , which would allow for a very "" tight "" watchdog cycle . The farther one goes from that assumption ( the more asynchronous the system model , so to say ) , the larger the chance to introduce unexpected latencies in the execution of both p and w . A consequence of this is that , if one wants to reduce the probability that w erroneously declares p as faulty , then he shall need to compensate for late processing and late messages by widening the watchdog cycle . Of course this implies a larger failure detection latency . Bringing this to the limit , in a fully asynchronous system , the compensation time grows without bound , at the cost of not being able to accomplish any sensible task anymore ! This result was proven in the famous article ( Fischer et al. , 1985 ) , which I usually refer to as "" the FLoP paper "" ( a little kidding with the names of its authors ) . Scientists have found a way to deal with this ostensible conundrum , and the idea is based on using a web of "" extended watchdogs "" – so called failure detectors ( see Chapter 8 . ) • What to do if the watchdog timer fails . Everything has a coverage , and this includes watchdogs , so it is unwise assuming that a watchdog can not fail . Furthermore , the failure can be as simple to deal with as a crash , or as tricky as a Byzantine ( arbitrary ) failure . Failures could be for instance the result of either – a design fault in the algorithm of the watchdog , or – a physical fault , e.g. causing the processing node of the watchdog to get disconnected from the network , or – an attack , e.g. a man-in-the-middle attack or an identity spoofing attack ( Harshini , Sridhar , & Sridhar , 2004 ) . Watchdog timers are often used in software fault-tolerance designs . The problem this book focuses on , as mentioned already , is how to express watchdog timers and their configuration . And again , an important factor in measuring the effectiveness of the available solutions is for us how such solutions perform with respect to the three structural properties of application-level software fault-tolerance , and to sc in particular . The less code intrusion an approach requires , the higher our assessment . This book presents two examples : The EFTOS watchdog timer ( a library and run-time executive requiring full code intrusion , see Chapter 3 ) and the Ariel watchdog timer ( an evolution of the EFTOS watchdog timer that makes use of the Ariel language to enucleate the configuration statements from the source code – thus reducing code intrusion ; see Chapter 6 and Appendix "" The Ariel Internals . "" ) 7.2 Exceptions and Exception Handlers An exception is an event that is triggered at run time due to the interaction with the environment and results in a ( temporary or permanent ) suspension of the current application so to manage the event . Let us consider the following C fragment : void main ( void ) { int a , b , c ; a = function1 ( ) ; b = function2 ( ) ; c = a / b ; / * danger here * / } Clearly instruction a / b is unprotected against a division-by-zero exception : When b is zero the division is undefined and – unless the division instruction is faulty – the CPU does not know how to deal with it . Other examples of exceptions are : • An overflow or underflow condition . • A not-a-number ( NaN ) floating point constant . • Misalignments . • A breakpoint is encountered . • Access to protected or non existing memory areas . • Power failures . • A sub-system failure , e.g. a disk crash while accessing a file . As the CPU has no clue about how to recover from the condition , either the program stops or it tries to deal with it with some code supplied by the programmer precisely for that , that is , to catch the exception and deal with it . The following version of the above code fragment does prevent the exception to occur : void main ( void ) { int a , b , c ; a = function1 ( ) ; b = function2 ( ) ; if ( b ! = 0 ) c = a / b ; / * no more danger here * / else { fprintf ( stderr , "" An exception has been avoided : division-by-zero \ n "" ) ; } } As can be seen from the above mentioned examples , not all the exceptions can be avoided . Hence it is very important that a programming language hosts some mechanisms that allow the user to catch exceptions and properly deal with them . One such language is Java . Java is particularly interesting for not only it allows , but mandates ( with some exception , if you excuse me for the pun ) that the programmer supplies proper code to deal with all the exceptions that can be raised by the sub-services the application depends upon ( Pelliccione , Guelfi , & Muccini , 2007 ) . For example , if one tries to compile an instruction such as this : ImageFile input = new OpenImageFile ( "" edges . png "" ) ; whose purpose is to open an image file and associate its descriptor with a local variable , the Java compiler would report an error complaining the lack of proper instructions to deal with the case that the OpenImageFile method fails due to a java . io . FileNotFoundException . In more detail , the Java compiler would emit a message like "" unreported exception i ; must be caught or declared to be thrown s "" , where i is the exception and s is the lacking statement , and report an unrecoverable error . The only way to compile successfully the above Java fragment is through the following syntax : try { ImageFile input = new OpenImageFile ( "" edges . png "" ) ; } catch ( FileNotFoundException exception ) { System . out . println ( "" Exception : Could n't open file edges . png "" ) ; exception . printStackTrace ( ) ; } whose semantics is : First try to execute the statements in the try block ; if everything goes well , skip the catch statement and go on ; otherwise if the catch block refers the raised exception , execute it . In this case the handling of the exception is a simple printed message and a dump of the program execution stack though method printStackTrace , which reports on where in the control flow graph the execution took place and how it propagated through the system and application modules . Note how a Try-Catch block is a nice syntactical construct to build mechanisms such as Recovery Blocks ( discussed in Chapter 3 ) – that is , the Syntactical Adequacy ( sa ) of Java to host mechanisms such as Recovery Blocks is very high . The general syntax for exception handling in Java is try { ... Instructions possibly raising exceptions ... } catch ( ExceptionType1 exception1 ) { ... Instructions to deal with exception Exception1 ... } catch ( ExceptionType2 exception2 ) { ... Instructions to deal with exception Exception2 ... } ... finally { ... Instructions to be executed in any case at the end of the try block ... } An example follows : try { x = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( argv [ 0 ] )) ; // this instruction // throws FileNotFoundException String s = x . readLine ( ) ; while ( s ! = null ) { System . out . println ( s ) ; // this one throws IOException s = x . readLine ( ) ; // this one throws IOException } } catch ( FileNotFoundException e1 ) { System . out . println ( "" I ca n't open a file . "" ) ; e1 . printStackTrace ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e2 ) { System . out . println ( "" I ca n't read from a file "" ) ; ioe . printStackTrace ( ) ; } finally { x . close ( ) ; // this one throws IOException // and NullPointerException } Java defines a large number of exceptions , divided into two classes : Checked and unchecked exceptions . Checked exceptions are basically recoverable exceptions , which include e.g. those due to input / output failures or network failures . Checked exceptions mandatorily call for a corresponding try ... catch block . Unchecked exceptions are unrecoverable conditions corresponding to the exhaustion of the system assets ( e.g. an out of memory error or a segment violation ) . Java also offers a mechanism to propagate an exception from an invoked module to the invoking one – this is known as "" throwing "" an exception . Java and other systems offer so-called Automated Exception Handling or Error Interception tools , which continuously monitor the execution of programs recording debugging information about exceptions and other conditions . Such tools allow tracking the cause of exceptions taking place in Java programs that run in production , testing or development environments . An example of an exception handling mechanism is given in Chapter 3 . 7.3 Checkpointing and Rollback Checkpointing and Rollback ( CR ) is a widely used fault-tolerance mechanism . The idea is simple : Someone ( the user , or the system , or the programmer ) takes a periodic snapshot of the system state and , if the system fails afterwards , the snapshot is reloaded so as to restore the system to a working and ( hopefully ) correct situation . The fault model of most of the available CR tools is transient ( design and physical ) faults , i.e. , faults that might not show up again when the system re-executes . Checkpointing is also a basic building blocks for more complex fault-tolerance mechanisms , such as Recovery Blocks ( described in Chapter 3 ) , where after rollback a new software version is tried out , or task migration ( supported by language Ariel , see Chapter 6 ) , where the snapshot is loaded on a different processing node of the system . Clearly in the latter case the fault model may be somewhat extended so as to consider permanent faults having their origin in the originating machine ( for instance in its local run-time executives , or compilers , or shared libraries , and so forth ) . CR is also a key requirement to achieve atomic actions ( see Sect . 7.4 ) . CR packages can be divided into three categories : • application-level libraries , such as psncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) , • user commands , e.g. Dynamite ( Iskra et al. , 2000 ) or ckpt ( Zandy , n.d. ) , • operating system mechanisms and patches , e.g. psncC / R ( Meyer , 2003 ) . Another classification is given by the logics for initiating checkpointing , which can be : • Time-based ( "" every t time units do checkpointing "" ) . This is supported e.g. by ckpt and libckpt ( Plank , Beck , Kingsley , & Li , 1995 ) . The latter in particular supports incremental checkpointing ( only the data that changed from last checkpointing needs to be stored . ) • Event based ( e.g. , when the user generates a signal , e.g. with UNIX command "" kill "" ) . An example of this is psncLibCkpt . A special case is ( Shankar , 2005 ) , where the signal can actually terminate the process and create a dump file that can be "" revived "" afterwards ) . • Algorithmic ( that is , when the algorithm enters a given phase , e.g. , the top of a loop ; obviously application-level libraries allow this ) . Also in the case of checkpointing there are several important design and configuration issues : In particular , • How often should the checkpointing occur ? Suppose one has executed a series of checkpointings , c1 , c2 , ... cn , and after the last one and before the next one the system experiences a failure . The normal practice in CR is to reload cn and retry . Are we sure that the corresponding fault occurred between cn − 1 and cn ? In other words , are we sure that the period of checkpointing is large enough to compensate for fault latency and error latency ( see Chapter 1 for their definitions ) ? • Are we sure that the checkpointed state includes the whole of the system state ? The state of the system may include e.g. descriptors of open TCP connections , the state of low-level system variables , the contents of files distributed throughout the network , and so forth . Failing to restore the whole system state may well result in a system failure . • Are we sure the the checkpointed state resides in a safe part of the system ? Are we sure that we will be able to access it , unmodified , when rollback is needed ? In other words , are we making use of a reliable stable storage for checkpointed states ? Recall that everything has a coverage , and this includes stable storage ; so how stable is our stable storage ? See further on for a section on stable storage . CR has been specialized in several different contexts , such as distributed systems , parallel computers , clusters and grid systems ( Schneider , Kohmann , & Bugge , n.d. ) Our focus is on how to express checkpointing and rollback , so mainly in CR libraries and their configuration . As usual the less code intrusion an approach requires , the better its sc . Chapter 3 briefly discusses two CR libraries , PsncLibCkpt and Libckpt . 7.4 Transactions An important building block to fault-tolerance is transactions . A transaction bundles an arbitrary number of instructions of a common programming language together and makes them "" atomic "" , that is indivisible : It is not possible to execute one such bundle partially , it either executes completely or not at all . More formally a transaction must obey the so-called ACID properties : Atomicity : In a transaction involving two or more blocks of instructions , either all of the blocks are committed or none are . Consistency : A transaction either brings the system into a new valid processing state , or , if any failure occurs , returns it to exact state the system was before the transaction was started . Isolation : Running , not yet completed transactions must remain isolated from any other transaction . Durability : Data produced by completed transactions is saved in a stable storage that can survive a system failure or a system restart . A common protocol to guarantee the ACID properties is so-called two-phase commit , described e.g. in ( Moss , 1985 ) . Two important services required by transactions are stable storage and checkpointing and rollback . As mentioned in ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) , transactions act like a sort of firewall for failures and may be considered as effective building blocks for the design of dependable distributed services . Another important feature of transactions is that they mask concurrency , which makes transaction-based systems eligible for being executed on a parallel machine . As it is always the case in fault-tolerant computing , the hypotheses behind transaction processing are characterized by their coverage , that is , a probability of being effectively achieved . A so-called transaction monitor is a sort of Watchdog controlling and checking the execution of transactions . Transactions are common in database management systems , where operations such as database updating must be either fully completed or not at all in order to avoid inconsistencies possibly leading to financial disasters . This explains why transactions are supported by SQL , the Structured Query Language that is the standard database user and programming interface . Transactions require considerable run-time support . One system supporting transactions is OPTIMA ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) , a highly configurable , object-oriented framework that offers support for open multithreaded transactions and guarantees the ACID properties for transactional objects . Written in Java , it provides its users with a procedural interface that allows an application programmer to start , join , commit , and abort transactions . Argus and Arjuna ( discussed in Chapter 5 ) are examples of transactional languages . The C programming language does not provide any support for transactions in its standard library ; for this reason , a custom tool was developed for that within the EFTOS project . Such tool is described in Chapter 3 . 8 CONCLUSION Together with system specifications , two important ingredients to craft correct fault-tolerant systems are the system model and the fault model . After describing those models , it has been shown how relevant their choice can be on the dependability of important services . Configurable communication protocols and services are collections of modules that can be combined into different configurations . This allows designing system that can be customized with respect to the requirements of the system and fault models . This allows to put those models in the foreground and to fine-tune the system towards the application requirements ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) . As a side effect of this , one would obtain a system characterized by less overhead and higher performance . This chapter also reviewed a few famous accidents . What is surprising is that , quite often , the reports summarizing the "" things that went wrong "" all lead to the same conclusions , which have been nicely summarized in ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) : "" In a system with relaxed control over allowable capabilities , a damaged capability can result in the execution of undesirable actions and unexpected interference between components . "" The various approaches to application-level fault-tolerance surveyed in this book provide different system structures to solve the above mentioned problems . Three "" structural attributes "" are used in the next chapters in order to provide a qualitative assessment of those approaches with respect to various application requirements . The structural attributes constitute , in a sense , a base with which to perform this assessment . One of the outcomes of this assessment is that regrettably none of the approaches surveyed in this book is capable to provide the best combination of values of the three structural attributes in every application domain . For specific domains , such as object-oriented distributed applications , satisfactory solutions have been devised at least for sc and sa , while only partial solutions exist , for instance , when dealing with the class of distributed or parallel applications not based on the object model . The above matter of facts has been efficaciously captured by Lyu , who calls this situation "" the software bottleneck "" of system development ( Lyu , 1998b ) : in other words , there is evidence of an urgent need for systematic approaches to assure software reliability within a system ( Lyu , 1998b ) while effectively addressing the above problems . In the cited paper , Lyu remarks how "" developing the required techniques for software reliability engineering is a major challenge to computer engineers , software engineers and engineers of related disciplines "" . This chapter concludes our preliminary discussion on dependability , fault-tolerance and the general properties of application-level provisions for fault-tolerance . From next chapter onward various families of methods for the inclusion of fault-tolerance in our programs will be discussed . References Cristian , F. , & Fetzer , C. ( 1999 , June ) .

"" 4 A full report about the Therac-25 accidents is out of the scope of this book ; the reader may refer e.g. to ( Leveson , 1995 ) for that . 5 In what follows , the application layer is to be intended as the programming and execution context in which a complete , self-contained program that performs a specific function directly for the user is expressed or is running . 6 As Leslie Lamport efficaciously synthesised in his quotation , "" a distributed system is one in which I can not get something done because a machine I 've never heard of is down "" . 2 See page FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLE-VERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES This chapter discusses two large classes of fault-tolerance protocols : • Single-version protocols , that is , methods that use a non-distributed , single task provision , running side by side with the functional software , often available in the form of a library and a run-time executive . • Multiple-version protocols , which are methods that use actively a form of redundancy , as explained in what follows . In particular recovery blocks and N-version programming will be discussed . The two families have been grouped together in this chapter because of the several similarities they share . The chapter also introduces two important structures for software fault-tolerance , namely exception handling and transactions , and proposes several examples of single-version and multiple version tools . 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLE-VERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE A key requirement for the development of fault-tolerant systems is the availability of replicated resources , in hardware or software . A fundamental method employed to attain fault-tolerance is multiple computation , i.e. , N - fold ( N > 1 ) replications in three domains : Time That is , repetition of computations . Space I. e . , the adoption of multiple hardware channels ( also called "" lanes "" ) . Information That is , the adoption of multiple versions of software . Following Aviz ̆ ienis ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , it is possible to characterize at least some of the approaches towards fault-tolerance by means of a notation resembling the one used to classify queuing systems models ( Kleinrock , 1975 ) : nT / mH / pS , the meaning of which is "" n executions , on m hardware channels , of p programs "" . The non-fault-tolerant system , or 1T / 1H / 1S , is called simplex in the cited paper . 2.1 Single-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Libraries of Tools Single-version software fault-tolerance ( SV ) is basically the embedding into the user application of a simplex system of error detection or recovery features , e.g. , atomic actions ( Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) , checkpoint-and-rollback ( Deconinck , 1996 ) , or exception handling ( Cristian , 1995 ) . The adoption of SV in the application layer requires the designer to concentrate in one physical location , namely , the source code of the application , both the specification of what to do in order to carry on some user computation and the strategy such that faults are tolerated when they occur . As a result , the size of the problem addressed is increased . A fortiori , this translates into increasing the size of the user application . This induces loss of transparency , maintainability , and portability while increasing development times and costs . A partial solution to this loss in portability and these higher costs is given by the development of libraries and frameworks created under strict software engineering processes . In the following , three examples of this approach are presented – the EFTOS library and the SwIFT system . Special emphasis is reserved in particular to the first system , for which the author of this book designed a number of contributions . 2.1.1 The EFTOS library . EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) ( the acronym stands for "" embedded , fault-tolerant supercomputing "" ) is the name of ESPRIT-IV project 21012 . The aims of this project were to integrate fault-tolerance into embedded distributed high-performance applications in a flexible and effective way . The EFTOS library has been first implemented on a Parsytec CC system ( Parsytec , 1996b ) , a distributed-memory MIMD supercomputer consisting of processing nodes based on PowerPC 604 microprocessors at 133MHz , dedicated high-speed links , I / O modules , and routers . As part of the project , this library has been then ported to a Microsoft Windows NT / Intel PentiumPro platform and to a TEX / DEC Alpha platform ( TXT , 1997 ; DEC , 1997 ) in order to fulfill the requirements of the EFTOS application partners . The main characteristics of the CC system are the adoption of the thread processing model and of the message passing communication model : communicating threads exchange messages through a proprietary message passing library called EPX ( Parsytec , 1996a ) . The porting of the EFTOS library was achieved by porting EPX on the various target platforms and developing suitable adaptation layers . Through the adoption of the EFTOS library , the target embedded parallel application is plugged into a hierarchical , layered system whose structure and basic components ( depicted in Fig. 1 ) are : • At the base level , a distributed net of "" servers "" whose main task is mimicking possibly missing ( with respect to the POSIX standards ) operating system functionalities , such as remote thread creation ; • One level upward ( detection tool layer ) , a set of parameterizable functions managing error detection , referred to as "" Dtools "" . These basic components are plugged into the embedded application to make it more dependable . EFTOS supplies a number of these Dtools , including : – A watchdog timer thread ( see Sect . 4 ) ; – a trap-handling mechanism ( described in Sect . 5 ) ; – in Sect . 6 , a tool to manage transactions . and an API for incorporating user-defined EFTOS-compliant tools ; • At the third level ( control layer ) , a distributed application called "" DIR net "" ( its name stands for "" detection , isolation , and recovery network "" ) is used to coherently combine the Dtools , to ensure consistent fault-tolerance strategies throughout the system , and to play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the fault-tolerance elements ( Deconinck et al. , 1999 ) . The DIR net can be regarded as a fault-tolerant network of crash-failure detectors , connected to other peripheral error detectors . Each node of the DIR net is "" guarded "" by an < I 'm Alive > thread that requires the local component to send periodically "" heartbeats "" ( signs of life ) . For this reason the algorithm of the DIR net shall be described ( in Chapter 8 , devoted to failure detection protocols . ) A special component of the DIR net , called RINT , manages error recovery by interpreting a custom language called RL – the latter being a sort of ancestor of the programming language described in this book in Chapter 6 ; • At the fourth level ( application layer ) , the Dtools and the components of the DIR net are combined into dependable mechanisms , among which will be described : – In Sect . 3 , a distributed voting mechanism called "" voting farm "" ( De Florio , 1997 ; De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998a , 1998c ) . – In Sect . 7 , a so-called data stabilizing tool . Other tools not described in what follows include e.g. a virtual Stable Memory ( Deconinck , Botti , Cassinari , De Florio , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . • The highest level ( presentation layer ) is given by a hypermedia distributed application based on standard World-Wide Web technology , which monitors the structure and the state of the user application ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . This application is based on a special CGI script ( E. Kim , 1996 ) , called DIR Daemon , which continuously takes its inputs from the DIR net , translates them into HTML ( Berners-Lee & Connolly , 1995 ) , and remotely controls a WWW browser ( Zawinski , 1994 ) so that it renders these HTML data . A description of this application is in Chapter 10 . A system of communication daemons , called Server network in the EFTOS lingo , manages communication among the processing nodes in a way somewhat similar to that used in the Parallel Virtual Machine ( see ( Geist et al. , 1994 ) for more details on this ) . The author of this book contributed to this project designing and developing a number of basic tools , e.g. , its distributed voting system ( described in detail in Sect . 3 ) , the EFTOS monitoring tool ( see Chapter 10 ) , the RL language and its run-time system ( that is , the task responsible for the management of error recovery ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998b , 1998c ) , which will evolve into the ariel language discussed in Chapter 6 ) . Furthermore , he took part in the design and development of various versions of the DIR net ( De Florio , 1998 ) . 2.1.2 The SwIFT System . SwIFT ( Huang , Kintala , Bernstein , & Wang , 1996 ) , whose name stands for Software Implemented Fault-Tolerance , is a system including a set of reusable software components ( watchd , a general-purpose UNIX daemon watchdog timer ; libft , a library of fault-tolerance methods , including single-version implementation of recovery blocks and N - version programming ( see Sect . 2.3 ) ; libckp , i.e. , a user-transparent checkpoint-and-rollback library ; a file replication mechanism called REPL ; and addrejuv , a special "" reactive "" feature of watchd ( Huang , Kintala , Kolettis , & Fulton , 1995 ) that allows for software rejuvenation1 . The system derives from the HATS system ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) developed at AT & T. Both have been successfully used and proved to be efficient and economical means to increase the level of fault-tolerance in a software system where residual faults are present and their toleration is less costly than their full elimination ( Lyu , 1998 ) . A relatively small overhead is introduced in most cases ( Huang & Kintala , 1995 ) . Figure 1 : The structure of the EFTOS library . Light gray has been used for the operating system and the user application , while dark gray layers pertain EFTOS . 2.1.3 Two libraries for Checkpointing and Rollback As mentioned in Chapter 2 , checkpointing and rollback ( CR ) is an important mechanism to achieving software fault-tolerance . The focus here goes on two packages working in the application layer . Library psncLibCkpt . PsncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) is a library for applications written in C. psncLibCkpt has been designed for simplicity – very few changes in the application software allow to add the CR functionality . Such changes are so simple that could be applied automatically , e.g. through the C preprocessor "" # define "" statement . In practice , only the main function needs to be renamed as ckpt target , with no modification on its parameters . Once this is done , the application is ready to catch signals of type "" SIGFREEZE "" and to save a checkpoint as a response . Restarting the application on the last saved checkpoint is quite easy : calling the program with argument "" = recovery "" makes psncLibCkpt load the checkpoint . Configuration is also quite simple and can be done through a configuration file or by editing a header file . The latter case requires compiling the application . Library libckpt . Libckpt ( Plank , Beck , Kingsley , & Li , 1995 ) is another CR library for C applications . It performs several optimizations such as "" main memory checkpointing "" ( a 2-stage pipeline overlapping application execution and flushing of the checkpointed state onto disk ) and state compression . The main reason for our interest in libckpt is its support for so-called "" user-directed checkpointing "" , which means that libckpt makes intense use of the application layer to optimize processing . One of these optimizations is user-driven exclusion of memory blocks from the state to be checkpointed . This allows not to include , e.g. , clean data ( memory yet to be initialized or used ) . Two function calls are available , exclude_bytes ( address , size , usage ) ; include_bytes ( address , size ) ; which allow to adapt the checkpointed state dynamically at run-time . Another application-level mechanism is so-called "" synchronous checkpointing "" : The user can specify , in the application program , points where checkpointing the state would have more sense from an algorithmic point of view . Function checkpoint_here does exactly this . There are also parameters allowing the express a minimum and a maximum amount of time between checkpointings . In the cited articles the authors of libckpt show how the adoption of user-directed checkpointing on the average brought to halving the checkpoint size . Conclusions . Two libraries for checkpointing and rollback , both of them targeting the same class of applications , have been discussed . The first case only manages user commands while the second one allows more control in the Figure 2 : A fault-tolerant program according to a SV system . application layer . Apart from performance issues , one can observe that the second case allows greater control but exhibits lower sc . Such control may be used to achieve adaptive resizing of the checkpointed state , so a slightly better a . 2.2 Conclusions . Figure 2 synthesizes the main characteristics of the SV approach : the functional and the fault-tolerant code are intertwined and the developer has to deal with the two concerns at the same time , even with the help of libraries of fault-tolerance provisions . In other words , SV requires the application developer to be an expert in fault-tolerance as well , because he ( she ) has to integrate in the application a number of fault-tolerance provisions among those available in a set of ready-made basic tools . His ( hers ) is the responsibility for doing it in a coherent , effective , and efficient way . As it has been observed in Chapter 2 , the resulting code is a mixture of functional code and of custom error-management code that does not always offer an acceptable degree of portability and maintainability . The functional and non-functional design concerns are not kept apart with SV , hence one can conclude that ( qualitatively ) SV exhibits poor separation of concerns ( sc ) . This in general has a bad impact on design and maintenance costs . As to syntactical adequacy ( sa ) , one can easily observe how following SV the fault-tolerance provisions are offered to the user through an interface based on a general-purpose language such as C or C ++ . As a consequence , very limited sa can be achieved by SV as a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance . Furthermore , little or no support is provided for off-line and on-line configuration and reconfiguration of the fault-tolerance provisions . Consequently the adaptability ( a ) of this approach is deemed as insufficient . On the other hand , tools in SV libraries and systems give the user the ability to deal with fault-tolerance "" atoms "" without having to worry about their actual implementation and with a good ratio of costs over improvements of the dependability attributes , sometimes introducing a relatively small overhead . Using these toolsets the designer can re-use existing , long tested , sophisticated pieces of software without having each time to "" re-invent the wheel "" . It is also important to remark that , in principle , SV poses no restrictions on the class of applications that may be tackled with it . As a final remark , it is interesting to note how , at least judging from the following recent work ( Liu , Meng , Zhou , & Wu , 2006 ) , it appears that the concept of a reusable "" library "" of fault-tolerance services is re-emerging in the context of service-oriented architectures . 2.3 Multiple-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Structures for Design Diversity This section describes multiple-version software fault-tolerance ( MV ) , an approach that requires N ( N > 1 ) independently designed versions of software . MV systems are therefore xT / yH / N S systems . In MV , a same service or functionality is supplied by N pieces of code that have been designed and developed by different , independent software teams2 . The aim of this approach is to reduce the effects of design faults due to human mistakes committed at design time . The most used configurations are N T / 1H / N S , i.e. , N sequentially applicable alternate programs using the same hardware channel , and 1T / N H / N S , based on the parallel execution of the alternate programs on N , possibly diverse , hardware channels . Two major approaches exist : the first one is known as recovery block ( Randell , 1975 ; Randell & Xu , 1995 ) , and is dealt with in Sect . 2.3 . The second approach is the so-called N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 , 1995 ) . It is described in Sect . 2.3 . The Recovery Block Technique . Recovery Blocks are usually implemented as N T / 1H / N S systems . The technique addresses residual software design faults . It aims at providing fault-tolerant functional components which may be nested within a sequential program . Other versions of the approach , implemented as 1T / N H / N S systems , are suited for parallel or distributed programs ( Scott , Gault , & McAllister , 1985 ; Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . The recovery blocks technique is similar to the hardware fault-tolerance approach known as "" stand-by sparing "" , which is described , e.g. , in ( Johnson , 1989 ) . The approach is summarized in Fig. 3 : on entry to a recovery block , the current state of the system is checkpointed . A primary alternate is executed . When it ends , an acceptance test checks whether the primary alternate successfully accomplished its objectives . If not , a backward recovery step reverts the system state back to its original value and a secondary alternate takes over the task of the primary alternate . When the secondary alternate Figure 3 : The recovery block model with two alternates . The execution environment is charged with the management of the recovery cache and the execution support functions ( used to restore the state of the application when the acceptance test is not passed ) , while the user is responsible for supplying both alternates and the acceptance test . ends , the acceptance test is executed again . The strategy goes on until either an alternate fulfills its tasks or all alternates are executed without success . In such a case , an error routine is executed . Recovery blocks can be nested – in this case the error routine invokes recovery in the enclosing block ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . An exception triggered within an alternate is managed as a failed acceptance test . A possible syntax for recovery blocks is as follows : ensure by else by else by else error acceptance test primary alternate alternate 2 .. alternate N Note how this syntax does not explicitly show the recovery step that should be carried out transparently by a run-time executive . The effectiveness of recovery blocks rests to a great extent on the coverage of the error detection mechanisms adopted , the most crucial component of which is the acceptance test . A failure of the acceptance test is a failure of the whole recovery blocks strategy . For this reason , the acceptance test must be simple , must not introduce huge run-time overheads , must not retain data locally , and so forth . It must be regarded as the ultimate means for detecting errors , though not the exclusive one . Assertions and run-time checks , possibly supported by underlying layers , need to buttress the strategy and reduce the probability of an acceptance test failure . Another possible failure condition for the recovery blocks approach is given by an alternate failing to terminate . This may be detected by a time-out mechanism that could be added to recovery blocks . This addition , obviously , further increases the complexity . The SwIFT library that has been described in Sect . 2.1 implements recovery blocks in the C language as follows : # include <ftmacros.h> ... ENSURE ( acceptance-test ) { primary alternate ; } ELSEBY { alternate 2 ; } ELSEBY { alternate 3 ; } ... ENSURE ; Unfortunately this approach does not cover any of the above mentioned requirements for enhancing the error detection coverage of the acceptance test . This would clearly require a run-time executive that is not part of this strategy . Other solutions , based on enhancing the grammar of pre-existing programming languages such as Pascal ( Shrivastava , 1978 ) and Coral ( Anderson , Barrett , Halliwell , & Moulding , 1985 ) , have some impact on portability . In both cases , code intrusion is not avoided . This translates into difficulties when trying to modify or maintain the application program without interfering "" much "" with the recovery structure , and vice-versa , when trying to modify or maintain the recovery structure without interfering "" much "" with the application program . Hence one can conclude that recovery blocks are characterized by unsatisfactory values of the structural attribute sc . Furthermore , a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance based exclusively on recovery blocks does not satisfy attribute sa3 . Finally , regarding attribute a , one can observe that recovery blocks are a rigid strategy that does not allow off-line configuration nor ( a fortiori ) code adaptability . On the other hand , recovery blocks have been successfully adopted throughout 30 years in many different application fields . It has been successfully validated by a number of statistical experiments and through mathematical modeling ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . Its adoption as the sole fault-tolerance means , while developing complex applications , resulted in some cases ( Anderson et al. , 1985 ) in a failure coverage of over 70 % , with acceptable overheads in memory space and CPU time . A negative aspect in MV system is given by development and maintenance costs , that grow as a monotonic function of x , y , z in any xT / yH / zS system . Development costs may be alleviated by using an approach such as diversity for off-the-shelf products ( Gashi & Popov , 2007 ; Gashi , Popov , & Strigini , 2006 ) . Other researchers have sought cost-effective diversity through the use of different computer architectures , different compilers , or different programming languages ( Meulen & Revilla , 2005 ) . A recent approach is using diversity for security concerns ( Cox et al. , 2006 ) . N-Version Programming . N - Version Programming ( NVP ) systems are built from generic architectures based on redundancy and consensus . Such Figure 4 : The N - Version Software model when N = 3 . The execution environment is charged with the management of the decision algorithm and with the execution support functions . The user is responsible for supplying the N versions . Note how the Decision Algorithm box takes care also of multiplexing its output onto the three hardware channels – also called "" lanes "" . systems usually belong to class 1T / N H / N S , less often to class N T / 1H / N S. NVP is defined by its author ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) as "" the independent generation of N > 1 functionally equivalent programs from the same initial specification . "" These N programs , called versions , are developed for being executed in parallel . This system constitutes a fault-tolerant software unit that depends on a generic decision algorithm to determine a consensus or majority result from the individual outputs of two or more versions of the unit . Such a strategy ( depicted in Fig. 4 ) has been developed under the fundamental conjecture that independent designs translate into random component failures – i.e. , statistical independence . Such a result would guarantee that correlated failures do not translate into immediate exhaustion of the available redundancy , as it would happen , e.g. , using N copies of the same version . Replicating software would also mean replicating any dormant software fault in the source version – see , e.g. , the accidents with the Therac-25 linear accelerator ( Leveson , 1995 ) or the Ariane 5 flight 501 ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . According to Aviz ̆ ienis , independent generation of the versions significantly reduces the probability of correlated failures . A number of experiments ( Eckhardt et al. , 1991 ) and theoretical studies ( Eckhardt & Lee , 1985 ) questioned the correctness of this assumption , though a more recent study involving a large number of independently developed multiple software versions claims otherwise ( Lyu , Huang , Sze , & Cai , 2003 ) . The main differences between recovery blocks and NVP are : • Recovery blocks ( in its original form ) is a sequential strategy whereas NVP allows concurrent execution ; • Recovery blocks require the user to provide a fault-free , application-specific , effective acceptance test , while NVP adopts a generic consensus or majority voting algorithm that can be provided by the execution environment ( EE ) ; • Recovery blocks allow different correct outputs from the alternates , while the general-purpose character of the consensus algorithm of NVP calls for a single correct output4 . The two models collapse when the acceptance test of recovery blocks is done as in NVP , i.e. , when the acceptance test is a consensus on the basis of the outputs of the different alternates . A few hybrid designs derived by coupling the basic ideas of recover blocks and NVP are now briefly discussed . Variations on the Main Theme . N Self-Checking Programming ( Laprie , Arlat , Beounes , & Kanoun , 1995 ) couples recovery blocks with N - version programming : as in N - version programming , N independently produced versions are executed , sequentially or in parallel . Each version is associated to a separate acceptance test , possibly different from the others , which tells whether the version passed the test and also produces a "" rank "" . A selection module then chooses as overall output the one produced by the version with the highest rank . A variant of this technique organized versions in couples and performs comparison between the outputs of their versions as a general-purpose acceptance test . To the best of our knowledge , no application-level support for N Self-Checking Programming has been proposed to date . Consensus recovery blocks ( Vouk , McAllister , Eckhardt , & Kim , 1993 ) targets the chance that the N - version programming scheme fail because it is not possible to find a majority vote among the output of the replicas . When this is the case , instead of declaring failure the outputs are assessed by acceptance tests ( as in recovery blocks ) , which then have the last word in choosing the overall system output or declaring failure . Reliability analysis proves this approach to be better than N - version programming and recovery blocks , though the added complexity may well translate in higher chances of introducing faults in the architecture ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) . Distributed recovery blocks ( K. Kim & Welch , 1989 ) ( DRB ) may be considered as a parallel computing extension of recovery blocks . In DRB there is not a single couple of primary and alternate versions . Instead , several couples are running concurrently on different interconnected processing nodes . Each couple executes the recovery block scheme in parallel . Nodes and couples are organized hierarchically . When the execution of the top-level couple finishes , one queries the result of the acceptance test . If the test is passed by either primary or alternate , then the system declares success . If the test is not passed , instead of declaring failure as in plain recovery blocks , DRB goes on checking the acceptance test at the top-minus-one node . Global failure is only declared if no successful acceptance test can be found when orderly scanning the nodes . A time acceptance test is also used to handle performance failure of the acceptance tests . Again on the Ariane 5 . Chapter 2 briefly reported on the case of the Ariane 5 disaster . As it was mentioned there , the chain of events that brought to the Ariane 5 failure started within the Inertial Reference System ( SRI ) , a component responsible for the measurement of the attitude of the launcher and its movements in space . To enhance the dependability of the system , the SRI was equipped two computers . Such computers were operating in parallel , with identical hardware and software . As described in the mentioned chapter , the SRI software had a number of data conversion instructions . Some of these instructions were "" protected "" ( proper exception handling code had been associated to them ) , while some others were considered "" safe enough "" and were not protected so as to reduce the overhead on performance . One of the unprotected variables experienced an Operand Error . If the Ariane 5 designers had divided the SRI variables into two blocks , and had protected one block on the primary SRI and the other block on the backup SRI , they would have had no increased performance penalty and the failure would not have occurred . 2.3.1 A hybrid case : Data Diversity A special , hybrid case is given by data diversity ( Ammann & Knight , 1988 ) . A data diversity system is a 1T / N H / 1S ( less often a N T / 1H / 1S ) . It can be concisely described as an NVP system in which N equal replicas are used as versions , but each replica receives a different minor perturbation of the input data . Under the hypothesis that the function computed by the replicas is non chaotic , that is , it does not produce very different output values when fed with slightly different inputs , data diversity may be a cost-effective way to fault-tolerance . Clearly in this case the voting mechanism does not run a simple majority voting but some vote fusion algorithm ( Lorczak , Caglayan , & Eckhardt , 1989 ) . A typical application of data diversity is that of real time control programs , where sensor re-sampling or a minor perturbation in the sampled sensor value may be able to prevent a failure . Being substantially an NVP system , data diversity reaches the same values for the structural attributes . The greatest advantage of this technique is that of drastically decreasing design and maintenance costs , because design diversity is avoided . Conclusions . As in recovery blocks , also NVP has been successfully adopted for many years in various application fields , including safety-critical airborne and spaceborne applications . The generic NVP architecture , based on redundancy and consensus , addresses parallel and distributed applications written in any programming paradigm . A generic , parameterizable architecture for real-time systems that supports the NVP strategy straightforwardly is GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) . It is noteworthy to remark that the EE ( also known as N - Version Executive ) is a complex component that needs to manage a number of basic functions , for instance the execution of the decision algorithm , the assurance of input consistency for all versions , the inter-version communication , the version synchronization and the enforcement of timing constraints ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1995 ) . On the other hand , this complexity is not part of the application software – the N versions – and it does not need to be aware of the fault-tolerance strategy . An excellent degree of transparency can be reached , thus guaranteeing a good value for attribute sc . Furthermore , as mentioned in Chapter 2 , costs and times required by a thorough verification , validation , and testing of this architectural complexity may be acceptable , while charging them to each application component is certainly not a cost-effective option . Regarding attribute sa , the same considerations provided when describing recovery blocks hold for NVP : also in this case a single fault-tolerance strategy is followed . For this reason NVP is assessed here as unsatisfactory regarding attribute sa . Off-line adaptability to "" bad "" environments may be reached by increasing the value of N – though this requires developing new versions – a costly activity for both times and costs . Furthermore , the architecture does not allow any dynamic management of the fault-tolerance provisions . One concludes that attribute a is poorly addressed by NVP . In other words , the choices of the designer about the fault model are very difficult to maintain and change . Portability is restricted by the portability of the EE and of each of the N versions . Maintainability actions may also be problematic , as they need to be replicated and validated N times – as well as performed according to the NVP paradigm , so not to impact negatively on statistical independence of failures . Clearly the same considerations apply to recovery blocks as well . In other words , the adoption of multiple-version software fault-tolerance provisions always implies a penalty on maintainability and portability . Limited NVP support has been developed for "" conventional "" programming languages such as C. For instance , libft ( see Sect . 2.1 ) implements NVP as follows : # include <ftmacros.h> ... NVP Figure 5 : A fault-tolerant program according to a MV system . VERSION { block 1 ; SENDVOTE ( v_pointer , v_size ) ; } VERSION { block 2 ; SENDVOTE ( v_pointer , v_size ) ; } ... ENDVERSION ( timeout , v_size ) ; if ( ! agreeon ( v_pointer )) error_handler ; ENDNVP ; Note that this particular implementation extinguishes the potential transparency that in general characterizes NVP , as it requires some non-functional code to be included . This translates into an unsatisfactory value for attribute sc . Note also that the execution of each block is in this case carried out sequentially . It is important to remark how the adoption of NVP as a system structure for application-level software fault-tolerance requires a substantial increase in development and maintenance costs : both 1T / N H / N S and N T / 1H / N S systems have a cost function growing with the square of N. The author of the NVP strategy remarks how such costs are paid back by the gain in trustworthiness . This is certainly true when dealing with systems possibly subjected to catastrophic failures – let us recall once more the case of the Ariane 5 flight 501 ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . Nevertheless , the risks related to the chances of rapid exhaustion of redundancy due to a burst of correlated failures caused by a single or few design faults ( Motet & Geffroy , 2003 ) justify and call for the adoption of other fault-tolerance provisions within and around the NVP unit in order to deal with the case of a failed NVP unit . Figure 5 synthesizes the main characteristics of the MV approach : several replicas of ( portions of ) the functional code are produced and managed by a control component . In recovery blocks this component is often coded side by side with the functional code while in NVP this is usually a custom hardware box . 3 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Voting Farm In this section the EFTOS voting farm – a library of functions written in the C programming language and implementing a distributed software voting mechanism – is described : This tool could be used to implement NVP systems in the application software . It has developed in the framework of project EFTOS , which was introduced in Sect . 2.1.1 . The Voting Farm was designed to be used either as a stand-alone tool for fault masking or as a basic block in a more complex fault tolerance structure set up within the EFTOS fault tolerance framework . In what follows the design and structure of the stand-alone voting farm are described as a means to orchestrate redundant resources with fault transparency as primary goal . It is also described how the user can exploit said tool to straightforwardly set up systems consisting of redundant modules and based on voters . An example of such system is given by so-called "" restoring organs . "" 3.1 Basic Structure and Features of the EFTOS Voting Farm A well-known approach to achieve fault masking and therefore to hide the occurrence of faults is the so-called N-modular redundancy technique ( NMR ) , valid both on hardware and at software level . To overcome the shortcoming of having one voter , whose failure leads to the failure of the whole system even when each and every other module is still running correctly , it is possible to use N replicas of the voter and to provide N copies of the inputs to each replica , as described in Fig. 6 . This approach exhibits among others the following properties : 1 . Depending on the voting technique adopted in the voter , the occurrence of a limited number of faults in the inputs to the voters may be masked to the subsequent modules ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) ; for instance , by using majority voting , up to ceil ( N / 2 ) − 1 faults can be made transparent . 2 . If one considers a pipeline of such systems , then a failing voter in one stage of the pipeline can be simply regarded as a corrupted input for the next stage , where it will be restored . The resulting system is easily recognizable to be more robust than plain NMR , as it exhibits no single-point-of-failure . Dependability analysis confirms intuition . Property 2 . in particular explains why such systems are also known as "" restoring organs "" ( Johnson , 1989 ) . Figure 6 : A restoring organ , i.e. , an N-modular redundant system with N voters , when N = 3 . From the point of view of software engineering , this system though has two major drawbacks : • Each module in the NMR must be aware of and responsible for interacting with the whole set of voters ; • The complexity of these interactions , which is a function increasing with the square of N , the cardinality of the voting farm , burdens each module in the NMR . Within EFTOS the two above flaws were recognized as serious impairments to our design goals , which included replication transparency , ease of use , and flexibility ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998a ) . In order to reach the full set of our requirements , the design of the system was slightly modified as described in Fig. 7 : In this new picture each module only has to interact with and be aware of one voter , regardless the value of N. Moreover , the complexity of such a task is fully shifted to the voter , i.e. , it is transparent to the user . The basic component of our tool is therefore the voter ( see Fig. 8 ) which is defined as follows : A voter is a local software module connected to one user module and to a farm of fully interconnected fellows . Attribute "" local "" Figure 7 : Structure of the EFTOS voting farm mechanism for a NMR system with N = 3 ( the well-known triple modular redundancy system , or TMR ) . Figure 8 : A user module and its voter . The latter is the only member of the farm of which the user module should be aware of : from the user point of view , messages will only flow between these two ends . This has been designed so as to minimize the burden of the user module and to keep it free to continue undisturbed as much as possible . means that both user module and voter run on the same processing node . As a consequence of the above definition , the user module has no other interlocutor than its voter , whose tasks are completely transparent to the user module . It is therefore possible to model the whole system as a simple client-server application : On each user module the same client protocol applies ( see Sect . 3.1.1 ) while the same server protocol is executed on every instance of the voter ( see Sect . 3.1.3 ) . 3.1.1 Client-Side of the Voting Farm : the User Module Table 3 gives an example of the client-side protocol to be executed on each processing node of the system in which a user module runs : a well-defined , ordered list of actions has to take place so that the voting farm be coherently declared and defined , described , activated , controlled , and queried : In particular , describing a farm stands for creating a static map of the allocation of its components ; activating a farm substantially means spawning the local voter ( Sect . 3.1.3 will shed more light on this ) ; controlling a farm means requesting its service by means of control and data messages ; finally , a voting farm can also be queried about its state , the current voted value , etc. As already mentioned , the above steps have to be carried out in the same way on each user module : this coherency is transparently supported in Single-Process , Multiple-Data ( SPMD ) architectures . This is the case , for instance , of Parsytec EPX ( Embedded Parallel eXtensions to UNIX , see , e.g. , ( Parsytec , 1996a , 1996b )) whose "" initial load mechanism "" transparently runs the same executable image of the user application on each processing node of the user partition . This protocol is available to the user as a class-like fault-tolerant library of functions dealing with opaque objects referenced through pointers . A tight resemblance with the FILE set of functions of the standard C programming language library ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) has been sought so to shorten as much as possible the user's learning time – the API and usage of Voting Farm closely resemble those of FILE ( see Table 1 ) . phase declaration opening control closings FILE class FILE * f ; f = fopen ( . .. ) ; fwrite ( f , ... ) ; fclose ( f ) ; VotingFarm t class VotingFarm t * vf ; vf = VF open ( ... ) ; VF control ( vf , ... ) ; VF close ( vf ) ; Table 1 : The C language standard class for managing file is compared with the VF class . The tight resemblance has been sought in order to shorten as much as possible the user's learning time . The Voting Farm has been developed using the CWEB system of structured documentation ( De Florio , 1997 ) – an invaluable tool both at design and at development time ( Knuth , 1984 ) . 3.1.2 System and Fault Models A fault and system model document allows to bring to the foreground all the assumptions and dependencies that were used while designing a service . This is done so that when porting that service to a new platform all those underlying dependencies and assumptions do not slip the attention of the designer – see Chapter 2 for possible consequences of such a mistake . The EFTOS target platform was a dedicated system with a custom , dedicated communication network . Accordingly , the adopted system model was that of partially synchronous systems . This assumption is in this case a realistic one , at least for parallel environments like that of the Parsytec EPX , which was equipped with a fast and dedicated communication subsystem , such that processors did not have to compete "" too much "" for the network . Such subsytem also offered a reliable communication means and allowed to transparently tolerate faults like , e.g. , the break of a link , or a router's failure . The internal algorithms of the Voting Farm are assumed to have fail / stop behavior . Upper bounds are known for communication delays . A means to send and to receive messages across communication links is assumed to be available . Let us call these functions Send and Receive . Furthermore , the following semantics is assumed for those functions : Send blocks the caller until the communication system has fully delivered the specified message to the specified ( single ) recipient , while Receive blocks the caller until the communication system has fully transported a message directed to the caller , or until a user-specified timeout has expired . The Voting Farm can deal with the following classes of faults ( Laprie , 1995 ) : • physical as well as human-made , • accidental as well as intentional , • development as well as operational , • internal and external faults , • permanent and temporary , as long as the corresponding failure domain consists only of value failures . Timing errors are also considered , though the delay must not be larger than some bounded value ( which is assumed to be the case in the system model ) . The tool is only capable of dealing with one fault at a time – the tool is ready to deal with other new faults only after having recovered from the present one . Consistent value errors are tolerated . Under this assumption , arbitrary in-code value errors may occur . As a final remark , let us recall what mentioned in Chapter 2 : software engineering for fault-tolerant systems should allow considering the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . The EFTOS Voting Farm allows to do so : If a service using the voting farm is moved to a new environment , for instance one characterized by a higher frequency of faults affecting the voters , the designer has just to choose a new value for N , the number of voters . Nothing changes in the application layer except that value . Of course this is an example of off-line adaptation , as it requires recompiling the service programs . In Chapter 4 an example of a tool will be described , which tracks the environment adjusting its fault model accordingly . 3.1.3 Server-Side of the Voting Farm : the Voter The local voter thread represents the server-side of the voting farm . After the set up of the static description of the farm ( Table 3 , Step 3 ) in the form of an ordered list of processing node identifiers ( positive integer numbers ) , the server-side of our application is launched by the user by means of the VF run function . This turns the static representation of a farm into an "" alive "" ( running ) object , the voter thread . This latter connects to its user module via inter-process communication provisions ( so called "" local links "" ) and to the rest of the farm via synchronous , blocking channels ( "" virtual links "" ) . Once the connection is established , and in the absence of faults , the voter reacts to the arrival of the user messages as a finite-state automaton : In particular , the arrival of input messages triggers a number of broadcasts among the voters – as shown in Fig. 9 – which are managed through the distributed algorithm described in Table 2 . When faults occur and affect up to M < N voters , no arrival for more than ∆ t time units is interpreted as an error . As a consequence , variable input messages is incremented as if a message had arrived , and its faulty state is recorded . By doing so one can tolerate up to M < N errors at the cost of M ∆ t time units . Note that even though this algorithm tolerates up to N − 1 faults , the voting algorithm may be intrinsically able to cope with much less than that : for instance , majority voting fails in the presence of faults affecting ceil ( N / 2 ) or more voters . As another example , algorithms computing a weighted average of the input values consider all items whose "" faulty bit "" is set as zero-weight values , automatically discarding them from the average . This of course may also lead to imprecise results as the number of faults gets larger . Besides the input value , which represents a request for voting , the user module may send to its voter a number of other requests – some of these are used in Table 3 , Step 5 . In particular , the user can choose to adopt a voting algorithm among the following ones : • Formalized majority voting technique , • Generalized median voting technique , Figure 9 : The "" local "" input value has to be broadcast to N − 1 fellows , and N − 1 "" remote "" input values have to be collected from each of the fellows . The voting algorithm takes place as soon as a complete set of values is available . 1 / * each voter gets a unique voter id in { 1 , ... , N } * / voter id = who-am-i ; 2 / * all messages are first supposed to be valid * / For all i : validi = TRUE ; 3 / * keep track of the number of received input messages * / i = input messages = 0 ; 4 do { 5 / * wait for an incoming message or a timeout * / Wait Msg With Timeout ( ∆ t ) ; 6 / * u points to the user module's input * / if ( Sender == USER ) u = i ; 7 / * read it * / if ( ¬ Timeout ) msgi = Receive ; 8 / * or invalidate its entry * / else validi = FALSE ; 9 / * count it * / i = input messages = input messages + 1 ; 10 if ( voter id == input messages ) Broadcast ( msgu ) ; 11 } while ( input messages ¬ = N ) ; Table 2 : The distributed algorithm needed to regulate the right to broadcast among the N voters . Each voter waits for a message for a time which is at most ∆ t , then it assumes a fault affected either a user module or its voter . Function Broadcast sends its argument to all voters whose id is different from voter id . It is managed via a special sending thread so to circumvent the case of a possibly deadlock-prone Send . • Formalized plurality voting technique , • Weighted averaging technique , • Consensus , the first four items being the voting techniques that were generalized in ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) to "" arbitrary N-version systems with arbitrary output types using a metric space framework . "" To use these algorithms , a metric function can be supplied by the user when he or she "" opens "" the farm ( Table 3 , Step 2 , function objcmp ) : this is exactly the same approach used in opaque C functions like e.g. , bsearch or qsort ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) . A default metric function is also available . Note how the fault model assumption : "" arbitrary in-code value errors may occur "" is due to the fact that the adopted metric approach is not able to deal with non-code values . The choice of the algorithm , as well as other control choices are managed via function VF control , which takes as argument a voting farm pointer plus a variable number of control argument – in Table 3 , Step 5 , these arguments are an input message , a virtual link for the output vote , an algorithm identifier , plus an argument for that algorithm . Other requests include the setting of some algorithmic parameters and the removal of the voting farm ( function VF close ) . The voters' replies to the incoming requests are straightforward . In particular , a VF DONE message is sent to the user module when a broadcast has been performed ; for the sake of avoiding deadlocks , one can only close a farm after the VF DONE message has been sent . Any failed attempt causes the voter to send a VF REFUSED message . The same refusing message is sent when the user tries to initiate a new voting session sooner than the conclusion of the previous session . Note how function VF get ( Table 3 , Step 6 ) simply sets the caller in a waiting state from which it exits either on a message arrival or on the expiration of a time-out . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 / * declaration * / VotingFarm t * vf ; / * definition * / vf = VF open ( objcmp ) ; / * description * / For all i in { 1 , ... , N } : VF add ( vf , nodei , identi ) ; / * activation * / VF run ( vf ) ; / * control * / VF control ( vf , VF input ( obj , sizeof ( VFobj t )) , VF output ( link ) , VF algorithm ( VFA WEIGHTED AVERAGE ) , VF scaling factor ( 1 . 0 )) ; / * query * / do { } while ( VF error == VF NONE and VF get ( vf ) == VF REFUSED ) ; / * deactivation * / VF close ( vf ) ; Table 3 : An example of usage of the voting farm . 3.1.4 Voting Farm : An Example This section introduces and discusses a program simulating a NMR ( N modular redundant ) restoring organ which makes use of the Voting Farm class .

A special version has been developed for the latter , which adopts the mailbox paradigm as opposed to message passing via virtual links . In this latter version , the tool has been used in a software fault tolerance implementation of a stable memory system for the high-voltage substation controller of ENEL , the main Italian electricity supplier ( Deconinck et al. , 1998 ) . This stable memory system is based on a combination of temporal and spatial redundancy to tolerate both transient and permanent faults , and uses two voting farms , one with consensus and the other with majority voting . 80 60 Figure 10 : The interaction between Watchdog Timer , DIR net and the application . The dotted line represents control flow , the full line stands for data flow . The Voting Farm can be used as a stand-alone tool , as seen so far ; but it can also be used as a tool to compose more complex dependable mechanisms within a wider framework . Chapter 9 shall describe how to use our tool with the so-called "" recovery language approach "" , a linguistic framework and an architecture for dependable automation services . As a conclusion the Voting Farm is characterized by limited support for sc and bad sa ( as it only targets a single provision ) . As for aone may observe how , despite that tool exhibits no support for adaptability in the form described in this section , this aspect could be enhanced by using an hybrid approach such as the one described in Chapter 9 . 4 The EFTOS Tools : The Watchdog Timer This section describes the EFTOS watchdog timer . It consists of a single thread . This thread does the timing and checking of user-driven timestamps , and informs a DIR Agent thread if a performance failure is detected . This concept is depicted in Fig. 10 . The whole set up of Fig. 10 is built by executing the single StartWD function when the two major system component for EFTOS , the so-called DIR net and Server net , are both used and when the Watchdog thread was pre-configured through the server net ( details on how to do this have been omitted ) . Note that after this step any future interaction with the WatchDog Timer , done via watchdap , is characterized by a satisfactory level of transparency : The user needs not to concern about low level details such as protocols and interface ; he or she has just to control the process through a high-level application-program interface . This user-transparency can no longer be sustained if neither DIR net nor Server net are used . In this case it is the responsibility of the user to deploy the watchdog through function StartWDnd and to let it start watching by issuing function WDStart . In both cases the user interfaces its watchdog through the same function , the already mentioned watchdap . As can be seen from Fig. 10 , an active watchdog connects to a so-called DIR agent and notifies it of all performance failures experienced by its watched task . When no DIR net is used , this message must nevertheless be sent to some other task . The following short source code illustrates the usage of the EFTOS watchdog : // A worker performs some work receiving input and sending output // through a communication link called ioLink // // To protect the worker , a watchdog timer is started ( in this case // by the worker itself ) . Within the processing loop , the watcher // sends n heartbeat signal to the watchdog through function watchdapp // int worker ( LinkCB ̇ t * ioLink ) { // declare the communication link with the watchdog 10 LinkCB ̇ t * AWDLink ; // declare the communication link with the EFTOS server net LinkCB ̇ t * mylink2server ; // input and output buffers char input [ 1024 ] , output [ 1024 ] ; int size , error ; 20 // Connects ( or spawns ) the EFTOS Server net mylink2server = ConnectServer ( ) ; if (( AWDLink = StartWD ( link2server , ... various parameters ... , ... cycle times ... , & error )) == NULL ) fprintf ( stderr , "" Failed to initialise the WD , error : % d "" , error ) ; // main processing loop : get input data ... 30 while (( size = RecvLink ( ioLink , ( byte * ) input , sizeof ( input ))) ! = 0 ) { // ... process data ... process ( input , output ) ; // ... forward output ... SendLink ( ioLink , ( byte * ) output , strlen ( output ) + 1 ) ; // ... and say "" I 'm OK "" if ( watchdap ( AWDLink , TIMESTAMP , 0 ) ! = 0 ) 40 fprintf ( stderr , "" Error re-initialising the watchdog "" ) ; } } For more details on programming and configuring the EFTOS watchdog timer the reader may refer to ( Team , 1998 ) . The system model of the EFTOS Watchdog Timer is the same specified for the whole EFTOS framework : A fully synchronous system – an assumption allowed by the embedded character of the EFTOS target services and platforms . The fault model includes accidental , permanent or temporary design faults , and temporary , external , physical faults . As a final statement let us remark how , as for the structural properties , what has been said for the Voting Farm also applies to the EFTOS watchdog timer : limited support for sc , bad sa due to the single design concern , and no adaptability unless coupled with other approaches and tools . One such hybrid approach is described in Chapter 9 . The EFTOS watchdog timer was developed by Wim Rosseel at the University of Leuven . 5 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Trap Handler Programming languages such as C constitute powerful tools to craft efficient system services , but are streamlined "" by construction "" for run-time efficiency . As a consequence , their run-time executive is very simple : They lack mechanisms for bound checking in arrays , are very permissive with data type conversions , and allow all type of "" dirty tricks "" with pointers . A fortiori , the C language does not provide any support for exception handling . Within project EFTOS a so-called Trap Handler was designed and developed . This tool is basically a library and a run-time executive to manage exceptions taking place in programs written in the C programming language on Parsytec supercomputers based on PowerPC processors . The library was developed Stephan Graeber at DLR ( the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt ) with the Parsytec EPX message passing library . In the following this tool is described . 5.1 The EFTOS Trap Handling Tool As mentioned in Chapter 2 , exception ( or trap ) handling is an important feature to design software fault-tolerant systems . When the processor e.g. tries to access memory that is not allocated or executes illegal instructions then a trap is generated , which causes the processor to jump to a specialized routine called trap handler . As other operating systems , also EPX provides a standard trap handling function which simply stops processing and writes a core dump file . The EFTOS framework provides two ways to alter this behavior : 1 . The Trap Handling Tool connects to a third party ( by default , the EFTOS DIR net ) and creates a "" fault notification stream "" : Caught exceptions are forwarded to a remote handler . A generalization of this strategy is used in Oz ( see Chapter 5 ) and Ariel ( in Chapter 6 ) and , in service-oriented architectures , in the system reported in ( Ardissono , Furnari , Goy , Petrone , & Segnan , 2006 ) . 2 . The programmer defines which exception to catch and how to handle them with the functions of the Trap Handling library . This is semantically equivalent to , e.g. , Java exceptions , but very different from the syntactical point of view . This is because the handling is done with the programming language , as opposed to in . 5.2 Algorithm of the Trap Handling Tool . The first action of StartTrapTool is to give the server network the command to create remotely a thread on a specified node with the code of the TrapTool . After that , it connects to the newly spawn trap tool and exchanges some additional information with it . After this state has been set up properly , it installs a new trap handler for the current thread . The Trap handling Tool itself first gets the connection to the StartTrapTool function and receives the additional information from there . After that it connects to the appropriate DIR agent , and waits for incoming messages for the rest of its execution time . If a trap message arises from the trap handler , the DIR net is informed and the necessary information about the trap that occurred is passed to the responsible DIR agent . The DIR net is also able to send messages to the Trap Handling Tool to enact user-defined exception handling procedures . The trap handler itself is only responsible for passing the message of a fault to the Trap Tool and to set the processor in a sleeping mode . The processor will resume only when proper actions to handle the exception are scheduled for execution . 5.2.1 Structure of user trap handling The concept of user-defined trap handlers is based on a stack of functions . The first element in the stack is the default EPX trap handler . New user-defined handlers are orderly pushed onto the stack . When an exception is caught , the stack is visited from top to bottom calling each visited function . When a function successfully handles the exception the Trap Handler stops this procedure , otherwise the stack reaches its bottom and EPX performs termination and memory dump . A user defined trap handler can handle either one or more classes of traps . Traps are processor-dependent , e.g. the PowerPC defines among others the following classes : 1 . DSI exception : A data memory access can not be performed because of a memory protection violation , or because the instruction is not supported for the type of memory addressed . 2 . ISI exception : An instruction fetch can not be performed . Reasons may be that an attempt is made to fetch an instruction from a non-execute segment , or that a page fault occurred when translating the effective address , or that the fetch access violates memory protection . 3 . Alignment exception : processor can not perform a memory access because of an incorrect alignment of the requested address . 4 . Program exception : This may have several reasons . E.g. the execution of an instruction is attempted with an illegal opcode . The user-defined trap handler should be defined as a function with the following prototype : int MyTrapHandler ( int TrapNo ) With TrapNo this function gets the trap number , that is the exception code corresponding to the exception that was actually caught by the system . This corresponds to the exception code returned by Java in the catch statements . The user defined trap handler function should return 1 if the trap was handled and the system has to be recovered , otherwise the function should return 0 . If a trap occurs , in some cases the whole node has to be rebooted . In such cases a user defined trap handler can be used for instance to store state information on another node , so as to restart execution from there or on the same node after reboot . Obviously this procedure only covers transient faults . In other cases the fault shall represent itself and cause the occurrence of the same failure again . With the function NewTrapHandler the user can push a trap handling function on top of the handling functions stack . When the function is called for the first time , a stack manager is installed as internal trap handler and the stack of functions is initialized . With function ReleaseTrapHandler the user can remove the function at the top of the stack . To remove all functions and bring the stack to its initialization state with just the original EPX trap handler , the user can invoke function SetDefaultTrapHandler . As can be clearly seen , the EFTOS Trap Handler is not as easy and intuitive as e.g. the exception handling mechanism used in Java : As mentioned already , syntactical adequacy ( sa , defined in Chapter 2 ) has a strong link with complexity . The other side of the coin is given by efficiency : The EFTOS trap handling tool is characterized by a very limited overhead and consumes quite few system resources . The following short source code illustrates the usage of user defined trap handlers : // Function MyTraphandler returns 1 if an exception // is caught and processed , and 0 otherwise . // int MyTrapHandler ( int TrapNo ) { switch ( TrapNo ) { // this is the equivalent of the Java catch statement . // NK TRA DFETCH means in EPX '' data access exception '' case NK TRAP DFETCH : 10 // what follows is the handling of the data access exception ... return 1 ; // other cases may follow here .. . * / default : return 0 ; } } 20 void main ( void ) { // some work is done here ... // right before an operation that may result in a data exception NewTrapHandler ( & MyTrapHandler ) ; 30 // here there is an operation that may result in a data exception ... // the default handler is finally restored ReleaseTrapHandler ( ) ; } 5.2.2 System and Fault Models of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool The system model of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool is the same specified for the whole EFTOS framework : A fully synchronous system – an assumption allowed by the embedded character of the EFTOS target services and platforms . Target faults are clearly exceptions and system errors such as the one presented in Chapter 2 . The fault model includes temporary design faults , and temporary external physical faults . 5.2.3 Conclusions A single-version software fault-tolerance tool has been introduced , addressing exception handling and fault information forward . Developed in the framework of the EFTOS project , the tool is characterized by limited support for sc , bad sa due to its single design concern , and no adaptability . 6 The EFTOS Tools : Atomic Actions The main goal of the functions described in what follows is to provide a mechanism for atomic transactions : The actions checked by these functions either end properly or are not executed at all . A description of transactions can be found in Chapter 2 . 6.1 The EFTOS Atomic Action Tool As explained in Chapter 2 , an atomic action or transaction may be defined as the activity of a set of components where no information flows between that set and the rest of the system during that activity , and the activity is either fully completed or not at all ( Anderson & Lee , 1981 ) . To guarantee this property an atomic action needs to be able to checkpoint its state before the beginning of the action and roll back in case of failure . In literature several protocols for atomic commitment have been proposed ( Babaoglu , Toueg , & Mullender , 1993 ; Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) . As mentioned already , probably the best known and the simplest protocol is the two phase commit protocol ( 2PC ) ( Lampson , 1981 ) . The 2PC protocol although very simple has as the big drawback that it may block . For example , if the coordinator fails while all the cohorts are waiting to receive a decision message , then none of these processes will be able to terminate . The cohorts need to wait until the coordinator is recovered before being able to decide on the outcome of the action . It is clear that such behavior is unacceptable . Next to the blocking aspect of several protocols , often the assumption is made that no faults can occur in the communication layer . Clearly this assumption has a coverage , which means one needs accomodate for the cases where it proves to be not valid . The tool described herein takes these aspects into account . Let us begin by introducing our assumptions : Atomic Action Algorithm : ( save the status ) ( Synchronize ) Check an assertion Set the timer t_i , Broadcast the result of the assertion to the other partners { while the deadline has not passed for all partners send result within time if sending timed out change state to abort and inform everyone hereof } Receive the result from all partners { while not received all results and deadline t_i has not passed receive if deadline t_i passed abort and inform everyone } If at least one result was abort then abort Wait ( t_2 ) for potential stray messages if result is abort do recovery Table 4 : A pseudo code sketch of the algorithm of the Atomic Action tools . 6.1.1 System Model Assumptions . As already remarked , any algorithm is valid under specific assumptions . In the case of the EFTOS Atomic Action Tool a partially synchronous model of computation is assumed : although not limited as in the synchronous model , an upper bound on message delays is assumed to be known . At any time a process may be either operational or non-operational . A process is considered to be operational when it follows exactly the actions specified by the program it is executing . Any operational process may end up in a non-operational state due to a failure . In a non-operational state any information related to that process is considered to be lost , unless it was stored into some stable storage . A non-operational process may be returned to an operational state after executing some recovery protocol . During this recovery protocol the information saved in stable memory is used to restore the process . Each processor has its local clock , which does not run synchronous with the neighboring processors . Each local clock however is only used to measure time intervals , so a global time is not a necessary assumption ( Lamport , 1978 ) . The target design platforms require a bounded termination time and a low amount of communication , as communication negatively affect the communication vs. processing ratio . Therefore a reasonably simple and lightweight algorithm has been designed . It has as main constraint that all tasks should be loosely synchronized before making use of the algorithm . The Algorithm . Figure 4 provides the reader with a pseudo code overview of the algorithm . The algorithm has a fairly simple structure as can be seen at first glance . Some pre-processing steps like saving state information and loosely synchronizing should be considered . Hereafter the algorithm will start by checking an assertion which decides on the local status . After the local status has been decided a timer t1 , conditional for the successful completion of the action , is set . As a next step the local status information is propagated to the other partners in the action and the algorithm starts waiting for the status information to be received from the other partners . All expected messages should be received within the time-out t1 to be able to result in a successful action . Once all status messages are received , a decision is made on success or failure of the action . The decision propagation however is delayed for some more time t2 , so that possible failure messages can be received . This will be further elaborated in the next section where some failure cases are discussed . By means of these multiple time-outs ( t1 , t2 ) the algorithm can guarantee successful functioning under the specified restrictions . Failure Mode . Both process and communication failures are considered . For process failures , it may be clear that the time-out ( t1 ) will trigger a transition to the ABORT state ( see Fig. 11 ) . For communication , due to the synchronous nature hereof on the design platforms , failures can be compared to process failures . This is clear in case of blocking . In such a case either one partner never joined in the communication or both partners tried to send or receive over the same communication link . Otherwise the link communication might also truly fail . This case can be considered as a failure of the two partners in communication . This assumption is valid because the only thing the processes are aware of is the fact that their communication with another process failed . In Fig. 12 some failure cases are illustrated . In the first case it is considered a process failure . The failure of this process will lead to a condition in which insufficient inputs have been received for a successful decision phase . This will lead to a time-out that will automatically trigger the ABORT behavior of the action . In the second case it is assumed that some communication fails . This will lead to the situation where some partners will decide to ABORT as they have not received sufficient inputs , while others will Figure 11 : The behavior in case of a not responding partner . C ? stands for potential commit . A ? stands for potential abort , A ! is an agreed abort . T ? is a potential time-out in communication . t1 is the primary time-out the action should respect , t2 is the secondary timeout used to receive stray messages . decide to COMMIT in the first step . The transition to ABORT however , due to insufficient input , will trigger the propagation of the ABORT message to all other partners . Upon receipt of this message all partners will still change their status to ABORT . 6.1.2 The Implementation The status of the action is decided upon by assertions provided by the user . The implementation has two working modes . In one mode only the local status is changed , unless there is a transition from COMMIT to ABORT at which point this new state is propagated to all partners in the action . In the second mode the distributed state decision is made . This is the mode illustrated in Fig. 13 . Notice that the communication time-out is realized by means of a return message that should be received within time T. In Fig. 14 the state graph of the used algorithm is shown . AA End in this graph is the intermediate state complying with the first mode of the algorithm . From this graph it is clear that any error will result in a transition to the ABORT state . 6.1.3 Functionality The whole mechanism basically is based on two levels of control ( see Fig. 15 . The first level embraces the local state . This is achieved by direct interaction with a local Atomic Action thread . The second level embraces a global state . This global state is maintained by the Atomic Action threads themselves , using the knowledge of the requirements to limit the communications . The communication limitation is achieved for in-block checks , where the global state will only be adapted if a request comes to change to local state to Figure 12 : The behavior in case of a communication fails ( time-out ) . "" abort "" . A final check always leads to a proprietary decision among all local states and the current global state . This leads to communication from every partner to every other partner , thus having a quadratic complexity . More details about the EFTOS Atomic Action tool is available in ( Team , 1998 ) and ( Rosseel , De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . 6.2 Conclusion A single-version software fault-tolerance provisions for managing atomic actions has been briefly sketched . As most of the EFTOS tools , it is characterized by limited support for SC , bad SA and no adaptability . 7 The TIRAN Data Stabilizing Software Tool An application-level tool is described , which implements a software system for stabilizing data values , capable of tolerating both permanent faults in memory and transient faults affecting computation , input and memory devices by means of a strategy coupling temporal and spatial redundancy . The tool maximizes data integrity allowing a new value to enter the system only after a user-parameterizable stabilization procedure has been successfully passed . Designed and developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN ( the follow-up of project EFTOS , described in more detail in Chapter 6 ) , the tool can be used in stand-alone mode but can also be coupled with other dependable mechanisms developed within that project . Its use had been suggested by ENEL , the main Italian electricity supplier , in order to replace a hardware stable storage device adopted in their highvoltage sub-stations . Figure 13 : The message passing scheme in fault free case for the EFTOS implementation . The application starts the AA thread which will spawn a sender thread on its own . This is illustrated in the beginning of the time-scale . At this point node I also will save some status information to a stable storage entity . Once a distributed decision is to be achieved messages are exchanged according to the algorithm . Upon the agreed decision of ABORT , the first node will restore its saved status . The central zone between node 0 and node i illustrates execution locked time , the black rectangle illustrates the beginning of the user-function the unfilled rectangle illustrates the returning of the user-function . Figure 14 : This is a state-graph of the implementation . AACommit is the intermediate COMMIT state , AA END is an intermediate ABORT state and AA Abort is the ABORT state . AA Commit is the start state for the algorithm . Figure 15 : The Atomic Action embraces two levels of control , local within the Atomic Action thread and global in agreement with the other Atomic Action threads . 7.1 Introduction In this text the design and the implementation of a data stabilizing software system are introduced . Such system is a fault-tolerant software component that allows validating input and output data by means of a stabilization procedure . Such data stabilizing system has been developed with the explicit goal of taking over a pre-existing stable storage hardware device used at ENEL S.p.A. – the main Italian electricity supplier , the third largest world-wide – - within a program for substation automation of their high voltage sub-stations . The mentioned hardware device is able to tolerate the typical faults of a highly disturbed environment subject to electro-magnetic interference : transient faults affecting memory modules and the processing devices , often resulting in bit flips or even in system crashes . This hardware component was mainly used within control applications with a cyclic behavior only dependent on their state ( that is , Moore automata ) . Typically these applications : • Read their current state from stable storage , • produce with it an output that , once validated , is propagated to the field , • then they read their input from the field and compute a tentative future state and future output . The whole cycle is repeated a number of times in order to validate the future state . When this temporal redundancy scheme succeeds , the tentative state is declared as a valid next state and the stable storage is updated accordingly . The cyclic execution is paced by an external periodic signal which resets the CPU and re-fetches the application code from an EPROM . External memory is not affected by this step . This policy and the nature of faults ( frequency , duration and so forth ) allow confining possible impairment affecting the internal state of the application within one cycle . Developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN , a prototypic version of this data stabilizing tool has been successfully integrated in a test-bed control application at ENEL , whose cyclic behavior is regulated by a periodic restart device – the only custom , dedicated component of that architecture . Initially developed on a Parsytec CC system equipped with 4 processing nodes , the tool has been then ported to a number of runtime systems ; at ENEL , the tool is currently running under the TEX nanokernel ( DEC , 1997 ; TXT , 1997 ) and VxWorks on several hardware boards , each based on the DEC Alpha processor . Preliminary results on these systems show that the tool is capable to fulfill its dependability and data integrity requirements , adapting itself to a number of different simulated disturbed environments thanks to its flexibility . In what follows an analysis of the requirements to the Data Stabilizing System tool is carried out . Basic functionalities of the tool are then summarized . The two "" basic blocks "" of our tool , namely a manager of redundant memories and a data stabilizer , are then introduced . Finally some conclusions are drawn , summarizing the lessons learned while developing our Data Stabilizing Software Tool . 7.2 Requirements for the Data Stabilizer In an electrical power network , automation is a fundamental requirement for the subsystems concerning production , transport and distribution of energy . In many sites of such a network , remotely controlled automation systems play an important role towards reaching a more efficient and cost-effective management of the networks . While considering the option to install high performance computing nodes as controllers into such environments , the question of a software solution for a data stabilizer arose . The goal of a data stabilizer is to protect data in memory from permanent faults affecting memory devices and from transient faults affecting data of systems running in disturbed environments , as they typically arise by electro-magnetic interference , and to validate these data by means of a stabilization procedure based on the joint exploitation of temporal and spatial redundancy . When controlling high voltage , an important source of faults is electricity itself – because all switching actions in the field cause electrical disturbances , which enter the control computers via their I / O devices , often overcoming the filtering barriers . Furthermore , electro-magnetic interference causes disturbs in the controllers . Clearly , due to the very nature of this class of environments , such faults can not be avoided ; on the other hand , they should not impair the expected behavior of the computing systems that control the automation system . In order to overcome the effects of transient faults , temporal redundancy is employed . This means that all computation is repeated several times ( a concept also known as "" redoing "" and introduced in Chapter 5 ) , assuming that due to the nature ( frequency , amplitude , and duration ) of the disturbances , not all of the cyclic replications are affected . As in other redundancy schemes , a final decision is taken via a voting between the different redundant results . Clearly this calls for a memory component that be more resilient to transient faults with respect to conventional memory devices . In traditional applications often a special hardware device , called stable storage device , is used for this . The idea was to replace this special hardware with a software solution , which offers on the one hand more flexibility , while on the other hand it provides the same fault tolerance functionality . The following requirements were deduced from this : 1 . The data stabilizer has to be implemented in conventional memory available on the hardware platform running the control application . Typical control applications show a cyclic behavior , which is represented in the following steps : ( a ) Read sensor data , ( b ) calculate control laws based on new sensor data and status variables , ( c ) update status variables , ( d ) and output actuator data . The data stabilizer has to interface with such kind of applications . 2 . The Data Stabilizing System has to tolerate any transient faults affecting the elaboration or the inputs . Furthermore , it has to tolerate permanent and transient faults affecting the memory itself . 3 . The Data Stabilizing System has to store and to stabilize status data , i.e. if input data to the Data Stabilizing System have been confirmed a number of times , they should be considered as stable . 4 . Because of this stabilization the Data Stabilizing System has to provide a high data integrity , i.e. only correct output should be released . A few further requirements were added , namely : 1 . The Data Stabilizing System has to minimize the number of custom , dedicated , hardware components in the system : In particular , the system has to work with conventional memory chips . 2 . The system has to make use of the inherently available redundancy of a parallel or distributed system . 3 . Its design goal must include maximizing flexibility and re-usability , so as to favor the adoption of the system in a wide application field , which , in the case of ENEL , ranges from energy production and transport to energy distribution . 4 . The Data Stabilizing System has to eliminate the use of mechanisms possibly affecting the deterministic behavior , for instance by not using dynamic memory allocation during the critical phases of real-time applications . 5 . A major focus of the system is on service portability ( see Chapter 2 ) in order to have minimal dependencies with specific hardware platforms or specific operating systems . 6 . The system has to be scalable , at least from 1 to 8 processors . In the following the functionality of the Data Stabilizing System is deduced from the requirements stated in the last paragraph . First one needs to clarify the concept of data stabilization . Let us assume one wants to develop a controller with a short cycle time with respect to the dynamics of the input and the output data . Disturbances from temporal faults can influence either the input or the output data . These temporal effects , in particular on the output data , must be eliminated . For this reason , the controller is run several times with the same input data . Let us furthermore assume that , in the absence of faults , the same output data are produced . This allows the output of the controller from several runs to be compared . If the output does not change in a number of consecutive cycles , the output is staid to be stable . The described process of repeated runs of the controller and comparison of the results is called stabilization . The described procedure of cyclic repetition of a process is the basis of temporal redundancy ( that is , redoing ) . In order to detect and overcome transient faults , even if their characteristics such as distribution of frequency and duration are not known , temporal redundancy can be applied . If the computation time for a process is outspoken longer than the expected duration of a transient fault , and the frequency of the disturbances is low enough , it is assumed that in several repetitive computations of the same data only one fault may show up . So if the algorithm performs the same computation several times , there will be a period of some consecutive , not impaired results . The number Ntime of consecutive equal data inputs to the Data Stabilizing System is the level of temporal redundancy . It is the minimum number of cycles the Data Stabilizing System has to execute until a new input can be assumed to be stable . Another strong requirement of our design is that of maximizing data integrity . To reach this goal , the Data Stabilizing System tool adopts a strategy , to be described later on , aiming at ensuring that data are only allowed to be stored in the Data Stabilizing System the moment they have been certified as being "" stable "" . On a read request from a given memory location , the Data Stabilizing System will then return the last stabilized data , while a write into Data Stabilizing System will actually take place only when the strategy guarantees that data that are going to be written are stable . Another important requirement is that permanent faults affecting the system should not destroy the data . A standard method for increasing the reliability of memory is replication of data in redundant memories : a "" write "" is then translated into writing into each of a set of redundant memories , with voting of the data when reading out . An approach like the one described in Chapter 4 , that is , redundant variables , was not available yet and therefore it was not used in this case . No additional hardware is required for this , as the writings are done in the memories of the processing nodes of the target , distributed memory platform . Using the principles of spatial redundancy , the same data are replicated in different memory areas – let us call them banks . The spatial redundancy factor Nspat is the number of replicas stored in the Data Stabilizing System . Changing this parameter the user is allowed to trade off dependability with performance and resource consumption . In order to fulfill the above mentioned requirements the Data Stabilizing System implements a strategy based on two buffers , one for reading the last stabilized data , and the other for receiving the new data . These two buffers are called the memory banks . • The bank used for the output of the stabilized data is called the current bank . • The other bank , called future bank , receives the Ntime input data for the Data Stabilizing System one after the other and checks whether the results are stable . If the results are stable the role of the banks is switched , so that the future bank becomes the new current bank and the output data are fetched from there . During the design and implementation phases of the Data Stabilizing System tool , the idea arose to isolate the spatial redundancy from the tool to build a custom tool especially devoted to the distributed memory approach – the Distributed Memory Tool . It showed that this approach simplifies the design and the implementation of the Data Stabilizing System tool . 7.2.1 The Distributed Memory Tool The Distributed Memory Tool is the sub-system responsible for the management of the spatial redundancy scheme for the Data Stabilizing System . Let us call a local user context either a thread or a process , which the user application sees as one task with its own local environment . Assume that the user application consists of several such local user contexts , which are distributed among several nodes of a multiprocessor system . The basic component of the distributed memory tool is the local handler , which is defined as follows : A local memory handler is a local software module connected to one local user context and to a set of fully interconnected fellows . The attribute "" local "" means that both user context and memory handler run on the same processing node and they represent the whole tool from the viewpoint of the processing node . As a consequence of this definition , the local user context regards the local memory handler as the only interface to the distributed memory tool . The local memory handler and the attached user module are connected via an IPC mechanism based on shared memory , referred to in the following as a "" local link "" and borrowed from the EPX terminology5 . Commands to the distributed memory or messages from the memory will only flow between local user context and local memory handler . The tasks of the local memory handler are completely transparent to the user module . The same design concepts used for the EFTOS Voting Farm and described in Sect . 3 have been used here . Figure 16 : The local memory handler with its memory banks . The associated partitions are represented in a hatched way . 7.2.2 The Local Memory Handler and Its Tasks As mentioned in the previous section , the local memory handler ( see Fig. 16 ) is responsible for the management of two banks of memory , i.e. , the current bank , that is , the bank where all read access take place , and the future bank , which is the bank for all writing actions . Each bank is cut into Nspat partitions , where each handler is responsible for exactly one partition . This partition can be seen as the part of the redundant memory attached to the local user context , which is assigned to the local handler . This partition is referred to as the one associated to the user module . If a user module ( i.e. a local user context ) initiates to write data into its partition , this is done via a command to the local memory handler , which is sent via the connecting local link . The local handler then stores the data into the associated partition , and distributes them to the other local memory handlers residing on the other nodes . With this method the data are distributed as soon as they are received from the application . For reading from the local memory handler there are several concurrent commands available . The common way is to request voted data from the local memory handler . In this case , one local handler receives a request for voted data from the attached user module . It then informs all other handlers and requests a voting service to vote among the replicas of the partition associated to the requesting user module . The result of the voting is provided to the calling user module as result of the read action . The kind of voting is user definable among those treated in ( Lorczak et al. , 1989 ) . If a voting task fails , a time-out system allows regarding such an event as the delivery of a dummy vote . If the user application has a cyclic behavior , such that the user modules on the different nodes all execute the same cycle , and under the hypothesis of each node serving exclusively the same set of tasks , then under the hypothesis Figure 17 : Structure of the Distributed Memory Tool . The associated partitions are represented hatched . State 1 2 3 4 Flag A 0 0 1 1 Flag B 0 1 0 1 Current A B B A Future B A A B Table 5 : Coding of the current and future bank flags of a synchronous system model it is possible to assume that the requests for reading may be processed more or less simultaneously on all nodes . In this case , this information can be used to synchronize the nodes via the set of local memory handlers and some data transfer between the nodes can be run in an optimized way . Clearly the Distributed Memory Tool is not aware of the logics pertaining to the stabilization mechanism , hence it is a task of the user application to inform the local memory handler about when to switch the banks ( in the next section it is shown how the temporal redundancy tasks take care of this ) . Normally this can be done once per cycle . The switching can also be connected with a checking phase , testing whether the current banks are equal on all nodes by means of an equality voting . Clearly , both determining the role of each bank and switching these roles are crucial points for the whole strategy . In particular , these actions need to be atomic . A fast and effective way to reach this property is the use of two binary flags – one per bank – whose contents concurrently determines the roles of the banks . These flags have been protected by storing them in the bank themselves . Table 5 shows how the coding of the flags in both banks is done . The idea is that , for changing from one state to another , just one write action is needed in the future bank . The current bank can therefore be regarded as being a readonly memory bank . As an example if the actual state is state 2 , and one wants to switch the banks , then it suffices to change the flag in the future bank , which is bank A. Changing Flag A from 0 to 1 brings the system to state 4 . 7.2.3 Application-program Interface and Client side Using function calls the user module is able to initialize the tool , to setup the net of local handlers , and to activate the tool . This process is done in several steps : 1 . Each instance of a DMT is built up by declaring a pointer to a corresponding data structure : dmt_t * dmt ; This data structure is the place to hold all information for one instance of the Distributed Memory Tool on each node . So each user module that wants to use the Distributed Memory Tool needs to declare a variable of this type . Figure 18 : Structure of the Data Stabilizing System Tool . 2 . In the next step , the Distributed Memory Tool is defined and described . This creates a static map which holds all necessary information to drive the tool on each node . The following code fragment : dmt = DMT_open ( id , VotingAlgorithm ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < NumHandlers ; i ++ ) DMT_add ( dmt , i , PartitionSize , ( i == MyNodeId )) ; when executed on every node where the Distributed Memory Tool is intended to run , sets up a local memory handler to be used by the tool . The voting algorithm can be selected by the user via a kind of call-back function . 3 . After the definition and description of the Distributed Memory Tool , the latter has to be started to set up data structures and threads . This activation is done via function int DMT_run ( dmt_t * dmt ) ; This function simply spawns the local memory handler thread after having checked the consistency of the structures defined in the description phase . All allocation of memory is done in the handler itself . 7.3 The Data Stabilizing System Tool As already mentioned , the Data Stabilizing System tool builds on top of the Distributed Memory Tool . The latter is used for the management of the spatial redundancy ( see Fig. 18 ) , while the Data Stabilizing System takes care of the management of the temporal redundancy strategy . On each node the writing requests to the Data Stabilizing System are done into a temporal redundancy buffer , which holds a user definable number Ntime of copies of the last inputs . As the temporal buffers are only handled locally , this fits well to the concept of local memory handler . The Data Stabilizing System module performs a voting on the contents of the temporal buffers and , if this voting is successful , the result is fed into the Distributed Memory Tool . The Data Stabilizing System handles all accesses as well as the temporal voting transparently of the local user context . 7.3.1 Algorithms The Data Stabilizing System Module as a whole gives each local user context a combination of temporal and spatial redundant memory buffers , which are able to keep the local state variables . The set of all local user contexts that store data in an instance of a Data Stabilizing System is called the context family associated to that tool . The Data Stabilizing System completely hides the memory handling and the handling of the Distributed Memory Tool , so that the user only needs to write to and read from the memory – all other handling is done transparently . This guarantees an acceptable separation of design concerns ( sc ) , which could be further improved by using some translator as in Chapter 4 . The following steps are executed automatically : 1 . The new data is written into the temporal buffer . 2 . Using internal flag values the current and the future banks are determined . This is done within the Distributed Memory Tool , therefore only the flag values of the spatial redundancy buffers are used . 3 . A voting on the temporal buffer takes place . If the temporal buffer is stabilized , i.e. the voting is positive , the content of the temporal buffer is stored into the spatial redundancy buffers , i.e. the respective calls to the DMT are done . 4 . If the evaluation of the internal flags allows it , the Distributed Memory Tool switches the memory banks . 5 . A voting is applied to evaluate the output of the current bank in the distributed memory . Such output is returned to the calling local user context . 7.3.2 Application-Program Interface The Data Stabilizing System is identified via a control block structure . It must be seen in connection with the Distributed Memory Tool – in fact it is a kind of front end to that tool , which provides additional functionality . The steps to be performed to set up the Data Stabilizing System are similar to those elaborated for the Distributed Memory Tool : 1 . Each instance of a Data Stabilizing System Tool is built up by declaring a pointer to a corresponding data structure : smCB_t * sm ; Each local user context that is member of the associated context family needs to declare a pointer to a variable of type smCB t . Similarly to the Distributed Memory Tool , the Data Stabilizing System Tool has to be defined and described . With the SM open statement a local instance of the system is created . In addition to the parameters of the DMT open statement some parameters regarding the temporal redundancy are passed to this statement . sm = SM_open ( id , N_time , TemporalVotingAlgorithm , SpatialVotingAlgorithm ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N_spat ; i ++ ) SM_add ( sm , i , PartitionSize , ( i == MyNodeId )) ; The above code sets up an instance of the Data Stabilizing System tool , provided it is called in every local user context that needs to take part in the processing of the tool . 2 . Up to this point the Data Stabilizing System Tool is defined and described , that is its structure is set up , but no instance has been installed , no memory has been allocated and no handler for the spatial redundant memory has been started yet . To do this the tool must be activated . This is done via the function SM run . This function allocates the temporal redundancy buffers , initializes the variables , and activates the attached Distributed Memory Tool using the function DMT run . The Data Stabilizing System can only be started up if all local user contexts belonging to its context family call SM run at the same point in their start-up phase . At run-time , the Data Stabilizing System Tool is controlled via two functions , which read the data from the application or provide stabilized and voted data to the application : int SM_write ( smCB_t * MyCB , void * SM_in ) ; int SM_read ( smCB_t * MyCB , void * SM_out ) ; The user provides data to the Data Stabilizing System via function SM write , which is then responsible for the handling of these values . This function is used to input the local data of a local user context to the Data Stabilizing System . The parameters submitted to the function describe the Data Stabilizing System control block structure ( MyCB ) and the address of the data to be copied into the Data Stabilizing System ( SM in ) . When the function is returned , all data provided to the function using the SM in pointer are copied out of this memory location into the temporary buffer of the Data Stabilizing System . The SM read function writes the local data of the calling local user context back to the address submitted through the pointer SM out . The Data Stabilizing System control block structure MyCB is used to identify the Data Stabilizing System . Switching from the current to the future bank is achieved by means of the following procedure : • Determine the current meaning of the banks from their internal flags . • Write data into the specified partition ( s ) of the future bank of the memory . • Output data via a voting between the distributed copies of the current bank . • If the contents of the future banks of all nodes are equal , switch the role of the memory banks . 7.3.3 System and Fault Models As already mentioned , the embedded and hard real-time character of the application makes it reasonable to assume a synchronous system model . The overall strategy implemented in the Data Stabilizing System allows to mask a number of transient faults resulting in : • An erroneous input value . • Errors affecting the circular buffer . • Errors affecting the temporal redundancy modules . • Errors affecting the flag values , occurring during the execution cycle , or caused by an external disturbance , or a wrong flag value , and so forth . These are tolerated either through the voting sessions ( temporal redundancy ) or are masked via the periodic restarts which invalidate the current cycle . In this latter case this is therefore perceived as a delay of the stabilized output . The same applies when a fault affects the phase of determining the current bank , or faults occurring during the voting among temporal redundancy modules , or faults affecting the spatial redundancy modules . More details on this can be found in [ 4 ] . Tolerance of permanent faults resulting in node crashes is achieved by using the Data Stabilizing System as a dependable mechanism compliant to the recovery language approach described in Chapter 6 . As explained in that chapter , this approach exploits a high level distributed application ( the TIRAN backbone ) and a library of error detection tools in order to detect events such as node and task crashes . User defined error recovery actions can then be attached to the error detection events so as to trigger corrective actions such as a reconfiguration of the Data Stabilizing System tasks . 7.4 Conclusion In the text above a software system implementing a data stabilizing tool has been described . Such tool is to be placed in highly disturbed environments such as those typical of sub-station automation . Due to its design , based on a combination of spatial and temporal redundancy and on a cyclic restart policy , the tool proved to be capable of tolerating transient and permanent faults and to guarantee data stabilization . Initially developed on a Parsytec CC system , the tool has been then ported to several runtime systems . The most important lessons learned while developing this tool are those that brought the author of this book to the concept of service portability introduced in Chapter 2 : A software code such as the one of the system described so far can be ported to a different environment with a moderated effort ; but porting the service is indeed something else . In this case , a thorough evaluation of the new working environment is due in order to come up with proper new values for parameters such as Ntime and Nspat . A system like the Data Stabilizing tool puts this requirement in the foreground and makes it possible to perform an off-line adaptability of its service . As a consequence a is assessed as "" moderate "" . Augmenting the approach towards acceptable degrees of a would call for the adoption of a strategy such as the one used in redundant variables ( see Chapter 4 ) . As a final remark , its single-purpose design intrinsically translates in bad sa . 8 An Approach to Express Recovery Blocks : The Recovery Meta-Program The Recovery Meta-Program ( RMP ) ( Ancona , Dodero , Giannuzzi , Clematis , & Fernandez , 1990 ) is a mechanism that alternates the execution of two cooperating processing contexts . The concept behind its architecture can be captured by means of the idea of a debugger , or a monitor , which : • is scheduled when the application is stopped at some breakpoints , • executes some sort of a program , written in a specific language , Figure 19 : Control flow between the application program and RMP while executing a fault-tolerance strategy based on recovery blocks . • and finally returns the control to the application context , until the next breakpoint is encountered . Breakpoints outline portions of code relevant to specific fault-tolerance strategies – for instance , breakpoints can be used to specify alternate blocks or acceptance tests of recovery blocks ( see Sect . 2.3 ) – while programs are implementations of those strategies , e.g. , of recovery blocks or N - version programming . The main benefit of RMP is in the fact that , while breakpoints require a ( minimal ) intervention of the functional-concerned programmer , RMP scripts can be designed and implemented without the intervention and even the awareness of the developer . In other words , RMP guarantees a good separation of design concerns . As an example , recovery blocks are implemented , from the point of view of the functionally concerned designer , specifying alternates and acceptance tests , while the execution goes like in Fig. 19 : • When the system encounters a breakpoint corresponding to the entrance of a recovery block , control flows to the RMP , which saves the application program environment and starts the first alternate . • The execution of the first alternate goes on until its end , marked by another breakpoint . The latter returns the control to RMP , this time in order to execute the acceptance test . • Should the test succeed , the recovery block is exited , otherwise control goes to the second alternate , and so forth . In RMP , the language to express the meta-programs is Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes language ( Hoare , 1978 ) ( CSP ) . Conclusions . In the RMP approach , all the technicalities related to the management of the fault-tolerance provisions are coded in a separate programming context . Even the language to code the provisions may be different from the one used to express the functional aspects of the application . One can conclude that RMP is characterised by optimal sc . The design choice of using CSP to code the meta-programs influences negatively attribute sa . Choosing a pre-existent formalism clearly presents many practical advantages , though it means adopting a fixed , immutable syntactical structure to express the fault-tolerance strategies . The choice of a pre-existing general-purpose distributed programming language as CSP is therefore questionable , as it appears to be rather difficult or at least cumbersome to use it to express at least some of the fault-tolerance provisions . For instance , RMP proves to be an effective linguistic structure to express strategies such as recovery blocks and N - version programming ( Yeung & Schneider , 2003 ) , where the main components are coarse grain processes to be arranged into complex fault-tolerance structures . Because of the choice of a pre-existing language like CSP , RMP appears not to be the best choice for representing provisions such as , e.g. , atomic actions ( Jalote & Campbell , 1985 ) . This translates in very limited sa . No a was foreseen among the design choices of RMP . Our conjecture is that the coexistence of two separate layers for the functional and the non-functional aspects could have been better exploited to reach the best of the two approaches : Using a widespread programming language such as Java for expressing the functional aspect , while devising a custom language for dealing with non-functional requirements , e.g. , a language especially designed to express error recovery strategies . This design choice has been taken in the approach described in Chapter 6 , the recovery language approach . 9 A Hybrid Case : The RAFTNET Library for Dependable Farmer-Worker Parallel Applications RAFTNET is a tool to compose dependable parallel applications obeying the farmer-worker data parallel paradigm . It is described here as a hybrid example of a system that appears to its users as a library , hence a single-version software fault-tolerance provision , though at run-time manages a potentially large degree of redundant components – a typical characteristics of multiple-version software fault-tolerance . 9.1 Introducing RAFTNET The RAFTNET Library is another example of a library to build fault-tolerant services . The main difference between RAFTNET and a system such as the Voting Farm is that it does not provide the application programmer with a dependable mechanism ( in this case , distributed voting ) , but rather it provides a dependable structure for a class of target applications . In more detail , RAFTNET is a library for data parallel , farmer-worker applications : Any such applications using RAFTNET makes uses of the available redundancy not only to reach higher performance but also to tolerate certain faults and disruptions that would normally jeopardize its progress . In the following the structure of RAFTNET , its models , properties , and features are described . 9.2 Why Dependable Parallel Applications ? Parallel computing is nowadays the only technique that can be used in order to achieve the impressive computing power needed to solve a number of challenging problems ; as such , it is being employed by an ever growing community of users in spite of what are known as two main disadvantages , namely : 1 . harder-to-use programming models , programming techniques and development tools – if any , – which sometimes translate into programs that do n't match as efficiently as expected with the underlying parallel hardware , and 2 . the inherently lower level of dependability that characterizes any such parallel hardware i.e. , a higher probability for events like a node's permanent or temporary failure . A real , effective exploitation of any given parallel computer asks for solutions which take into a deep account the above outlined problems . Let us consider for example the synchronous farmer-worker algorithm i.e. , a well-known model for structuring data-parallel applications : a master process , namely the farmer , feeds a pool of slave processes , called workers , with some units of work ; then polls them until they return their partial results which are eventually recollected and saved . Though quite simple , this scheme may give good results , especially in homogeneous , dedicated environments . But how does this model react to events like a failure of a worker , or more simply to a worker's performance degradation due e.g. , to the exhaustion of any vital resource ? Without substantial modifications , this scheme is not able to cope with these events – they would seriously affect the whole application or its overall performances , regardless the high degree of hardware redundancy implicitly available in any parallel system . The same inflexibility prevents a failed worker to re-enter the computing farm once it has regained the proper operational state . As opposed to this synchronous structuring , it is possible for example to implement the farmer-worker model by de-coupling the farmer from the workers by means of an intermediate module , a dispatcher which asynchronously feeds these latter and supplies them with new units of work on an on-demand basis . This strategy guarantees some sort of a dynamic balancing of the workload even in heterogeneous , distributed environments , thus exhibiting a higher matching to the parallel hardware . The Live Data Structure computational paradigm , known from the LINDA context , makes this particularly easy to set up ( see for example ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989a , 1989b ; De Florio , Murgolo , & Spinelli , 1994 )) . With this approach it is also possible to add a new worker at run-time without any notification to both the farmer and the intermediate module – the newcomer will simply generate additional , non-distinguishable requests for work . But again , if a worker fails or its performances degrade , the whole application may fail or its overall outcome be affected or seriously delayed . This is particularly important when one considers the inherent loss in dependability of any parallel ( i.e. , replicated ) hardware . Next sections introduce and discuss a modification to the above sketched asynchronous scheme , which inherits the advantages of its parent and offers new ones , namely : • it allows a non-solitary , temporarily slowed down worker to be left out of the processing farm as long as its performance degradation exists , and • it allows a non-solitary worker which has been permanently affected by some fault to be definitively removed from the farm , both of them without affecting the overall outcome of the computation , and dynamically spreading the workload among the active processors in a way that results in an excellent match to various different MIMD architectures . 9.3 The Technique For the purpose of describing the technique the following scenario is described : a MIMD machine consists of n + 2 identical "" nodes "" ( n > 0 ) , or processing entities , connected by some communication line . On each node a number of independent sequential processes are executed on a time-sharing basis . A message passing library is available for sending and receiving messages across the communication line . A synchronous communication approach is used : a sender blocks until the intended receiver gets the message . A receiver blocks waiting for a message from a specific sender , or for a message from a number of senders . When a message arrives , the receiver is awaken and is able to receive that message and to know the identity of the sender . Nodes are numbered from 0 to n + 1 . Node 0 is connected to an input line and node n + 1 is connected to an output line . • Node 0 runs : – a Farmer process , connected by the input line to an external producer device . From now on a camera is assumed to be the producer device . A control line wires again the Farmer to the camera , so that this latter can be commanded to produce new data and eventually send this data across the input line ; – a Dispatcher process , yet to be described . Figure 20 : Summary of the interactions among the processes . • Node n + 1 runs a Collector process , to be described later on , connected by the output line to an external storage device e.g. , a disk ; • Each of the nodes from 1 to n is purely devoted to the execution of one instance of the Worker process . Each Worker is connected to the Dispatcher and to the Collector processes . 9.4 Interactions Between the Farmer and the Dispatcher On demand of the Farmer process , the camera sends it an input image . Once it has received an image , the Farmer performs a predefined , static data decomposition , creating m equally sized sub-images , or blocks . Blocks are numbered from 1 to m , and are represented by variables bi , 0 < i < m + 1 . The Farmer process interacts exclusively with the camera and with the Dispatcher process . • Three classes of messages can be sent from the Farmer process to the Dispatcher ( see Fig. 20 ) : 1 . a NEW RUN message , which means : "" a new bunch of data is available "" ; 2 . a STOP message , which means that no more input is available so the whole process has to be terminated ; 3 . a couple ( k , bk ) , k in { 1 , ... m } i.e. , an integer which identifies a particular block ( it will be referred from now on as a "" block-id "" ) , followed by the block itself . • The only type of message that the Dispatcher process sends to the Farmer process is a block-id i.e. , a single integer in the range { 1 , ... , m } which expresses the information that a certain block has been fully processed by a Worker and recollected by the Collector ( see Sect . 9.4.2 . ) At the other end of the communication line , the Dispatcher is ready to process a number of events triggered by message arrivals . For example , when a class-3 message is received , the block is stored into a work buffer as follows : receive ( k , bk ) sk = DISABLED wk = bk ( Here , receive is the function for receiving an incoming message , ~ s is a vector of m integers pre-initialized to DISABLED , which represents some status information that will be described later on , and w ~ is a vector of "" work buffers "" , i.e. , bunches of memory able to store any block . DISABLED is an integer which is not in the set { 1 , ... , m } . ) As the Farmer process sends a class-1 message , that is , a NEW RUN signal , the Dispatcher processes that event as follows : ~ s = 0 broadcast RESUME that is , it zeroes each element of ~ s and then broadcasts the RESUME message to the whole farm . When the first image arrives to the Farmer process , it produces a series ( bi ) 0 < i < m + 1 , and then a sequence of messages ( i , bi ) 0 < i < m + 1 . Finally , the Farmer sends a NEW RUN message . Starting from the second image , and while there are images to process from the camera , the Farmer performs the image decomposition in advance , thus creating a complete set of ( k , bk ) couples . These couples are then sent to the Dispatcher on an on-demand basis : as soon as block-id i is received , couple ( i , bi ) is sent out . This is done for anticipating the transmission of the couples belonging to the next run of the computation . When eventually the last block-id of a certain run has been received , a complete set of "" brand-new "" blocks is already in the hands of the Dispatcher ; at that point , sending the one NEW RUN message will simultaneously enable all blocks . 9.4.1 Interactions Between the Dispatcher and the Workers The Dispatcher interacts with every instance of the Worker process . • Four classes of messages can be sent from the Dispatcher to the Workers ( see Fig. 20 ) : 1 . a SLEEP message , which sets the receiver into a wait condition ; 2 . a RESUME message , to get the receiver out of the waiting state ; 3 . a STOP message , which makes the Worker terminate ; 4 . a ( k , w ) couple , where w represents the input data to be elaborated . • Worker j , 0 < j < n + 1 , interacts with the Dispatcher by sending it its worker-id message , i.e. , the j integer . This happens when Worker j has finished dealing with a previously sent w working buffer and is available for a new ( k , w ) couple to work with . In substance , Worker j continuously repeats the following loop : send j to Dispatcher receive message from Dispatcher process message Clearly , send transmits a message . The last instruction , in dependence with the class of the incoming message , results in a number of different operations : • if the message is a SLEEP , the Worker waits until the arrival of a RESUME message , which makes it resume the loop , or the arrival of any other message , which means that an error has occurred ; • if it is a STOP message , the Worker breaks the loop and exits the farm ; • if it is a ( k , w ) couple , the Worker starts computing the value f ( w ) , where f is some user-defined function e.g. , an edge detector . If a RESUME event is raised during the computation of f , that computation is immediately abandoned and the Worker restarts the loop . Contrariwise , the output couple ( k , f ( w )) is sent to the Collector process . When the Dispatcher gets a j integer from Worker j , its expected response is a new ( k , w ) couple , or a SLEEP . What rules in this context is the ~ s vector – if all entries of ~ s are DISABLED , then a SLEEP message is sent to Worker j . Otherwise , an entry is selected among those with the minimum non-negative value , say entry l , and a ( l , bl ) message is then sent as a response . Then sl is incremented by 1 . More formally , considered set S = { s in ~ s | s ¬ = DISABLED } , if S is non-empty it is possible to partition S according to the equivalence relation R defined as follows : For all ( a , b ) in S × S : aR b if and only if sa = sb . So the blocks of the partition are the equivalence classes : def [ x ] = { s in S | Exists y in { 1 ... m } such that ( s = sy ) and ( sy = x ) } . Now , first let us consider a = min { b | Exists b > = 0 such that [ b ] in S / R } ; then l is chosen in [ a ] in some way , e.g. pseudo-randomly ; finally , message ( l , bl ) is sent to Worker j , sl is incremented , and the partition is reconfigured accordingly . If S is the empty set , a SLEEP message is generated . In other words , entry si when greater than or equal to 0 represents some sort of a priority identifier ( the lower the value , the higher the priority for block bi ) . The block to be sent to a requesting Worker process is always selected among those with the highest priority ; after the selection , si is updated incrementing its value by 1 . In this way , the content of si represents the degree of "" freshness "" of block bi : it substantially counts the number of times it has been picked up by a Worker process ; fresher blocks are always preferred . As long as there are "" brand-new "" blocks i.e. , blocks with a freshness attribute of 0 , these are the blocks which are selected and distributed . Note that this means that as long as the above condition is true , each Worker deals with a different unit of work ; on the contrary , as soon as the last brand-new block is distributed , the model admits that a same block may be assigned to more than one Worker . This is tolerated up to a certain threshold value ; if any si becomes greater than that value , an alarm event is raised – too many workers are dealing with the same input data , which might mean that they are all affected by the same problem e.g. , a software bug resulting in an error when bi is being processed . This special case shall not be considered . Another possibility is that two or more Workers had finished their work almost at the same time thus bringing rapidly a flag to the threshold . Waiting for the processing time of one block may supply the answer . A value of DISABLED for any si means that its corresponding block is not available to be computed . It is simply not considered during the selection procedure . 9.4.2 Interactions Between the Workers and the Collector Any Worker may send one class of messages to the Collector ; no message is sent from this latter to any Worker ( see Fig. 20 ) . The only allowed message is the couple ( k , o ) in which o is the fully processed output of the Worker's activity on the k th block . The Collector's task is to fill a number of "" slots "" , namely pi , i = 1 , ... , m , with the outputs coming from the Workers . As two or more Workers are allowed to process a same block thus producing two or more ( k , o ) couples , the Collector runs a vector of status bits which records the status of each slot : if fi is FREE then pi is "" empty "" i.e. , it has never been filled in by any output before ; if it is BUSY , it already holds an output . f ~ is firstly initialized to FREE . For each incoming message from the Worker , the Collector repeats the following sequence of operations : receive ( k , o ) from Worker if fk is equal to FREE then send k to Dispatcher pk = o fk = BUSY check-if-full else detect endif where : check-if-full checks if , due to the last arrival , all entries of f ~ have become BUSY . In that case , a complete set of partial outputs has been recollected and , after some user-defined post-processing ( for example , a polygonal approximation of the chains of edges produced by the Workers ) , a global output can be saved , and the flag vector re-initialized : if f ~ is equal to BUSY then post-process p ~ save p ~ f ~ = FREE endif detect is a user-defined functionality – he or she may choose to compare the two o 's so to be able to detect any inconsistency and start some recovery action , or may simply ignore the whole message . Note also that an acknowledgment message ( the block-id ) is sent from the Collector to the Dispatcher , to inform it that an output slot has been occupied i.e. , a partial output has been gathered . This also means that the Farmer can anticipate the transmission of a block which belongs to the next run , if any . 9.4.3 Interactions Between the Collector and the Dispatcher As just stated , upon acceptance of an output , the collector sends a block-id , say integer k , to the Dispatcher – it is the only message that goes from the Collector to the Dispatcher . The Dispatcher then simply acts as follows : sk = DISABLED send k to Farmer that is , the Dispatcher "" disables "" the k th unit of work – set S as defined in Sect . 9.4.1 is reduced by one element and consequently partition S / R changes its shape ; then the block-id is propagated to the Farmer ( see Fig. 20 ) . On the opposite direction , there is only one message that may travel from the Dispatcher to the Collector : the STOP message that means that no more input is available and so processing is over . Upon reception of this message , the Collector stops itself , like it does any other receiver in the farm . 9.5 Discussion The just proposed technique uses asynchronicity in order to efficiently match to a huge class of parallel architectures . It also uses the redundancy which is inherent to parallelism to make an application able to cope with events like e.g. , a failure of a node , or a node being slowed down , temporarily or not . • If a node fails while it is processing block k , then no output block will be transferred to the Collector . When no more "" brand-new "" blocks are available , block k will be assigned to one or more Worker processes , up to a certain limit . During this phase the replicated processing modules of the parallel machine may be thought of as part of a hardware redundancy fault tolerant mechanism . This phase is over when any Worker module delivers its output to the Collector and consequently all others are possibly explicitly forced to resume their processing loop or , if too late , their output is discarded . • If a node has been for some reason drastically slowed down , then its block will be probably assigned to other possibly non-slowed Workers . Again , the first who succeeds , its output is collected ; the others are stopped or ignored . In any case , from the point of view of the Farmer process , all these events are completely masked . The mechanism may be provided to a user in the form of some set of basic functions , making all technicalities concerning both parallel programming and fault tolerance transparent to the programmer . Of course , nothing prevents the concurrent use of other fault tolerance mechanisms in any of the involved processes e.g. , using Watchdog timers to understand that a Worker has failed and consequently reset the proper entry of vector f ~ . The ability to re-enter the farm may also be exploited committing a reboot of a failed node and restarting the Worker process on that node . 9.5.1 Reliability Analysis In order to compare the original , synchronous farmer-worker model with the one described in this paper , a first step is given by observing that the synchronous model depicts a series system ( Johnson , 1989 ) i.e. , a system in which each element is required not to have failed for the whole system to operate . This is not the case of the model described in this paper , in which a subset of the elements , namely the Worker farm , is a parallel system ( Johnson , 1989 ) : if at least one Worker has not failed , so it is for the whole farm subsystem . Note how Fig. 20 may be also thought of as the reliability block diagram of this system . Considering the sole farm subsystem , if Ci ( t ) , 0 < i < n + 1 is the event that Worker on node i has not failed at time t , and R ( t ) is the reliability of any Worker at time t then , under the assumption of mutual independency between the events , one can conclude that : ( 1 ) being Rs ( t ) the reliability of the farm as a series system , and ( 2 ) where Rp ( t ) represents the reliability of the farm as a parallel system . Of course failures must be independent , so again data-induced errors are not considered . Figure 21 shows the reliability of the farm in a series and in a parallel system as a Worker's reliability goes from 0 to 1 . An Augmented LINDA Model . The whole idea pictured in this paper may be implemented in a LINDA tuple space manager ( see for example ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989b , 1989a )) . Apart from the standard functions to access "" common "" tuples , a new set of functions may be supplied which deal with "" book-kept tuples "" i.e. , tuples that are distributed to requestors by means of the algorithm sketched in Sect . 9.4.1 . As an example : fout ( for fault tolerant out ) may create a book-kept tuple i.e. , a content-addressable object with book-kept accesses ; frd ( fault tolerant rd ) may get a copy of a matching book-kept tuple , chosen according to the algorithm in Sect . 9.4.1 ; fin ( fault tolerant in ) may read-and-erase a matching book-kept tuple , chosen according to the algorithm in Sect . 9.4.1 , and so on . The ensuing augmented LINDA model results in an abstract , elegant , efficient , dependable , and transparent mechanism to exploit a parallel hardware . Chapter 9 describes another example of a dependable LINDA model . 9.6 Implementation Issues The RAFTNET system has been developed for network of workstations using a subset of the MPICH routines ( MPICH ( MPICH , n.d. ) is a portable implementation of the MPI message passing library ( Gropp , Lusk , & Skjellum , 1 n = 16 0.8 n = 8 n = 4 either n = 2 0.6 Rp ( t ) or Rs ( t ) n = 1 0.4 n = 2 n = 4 0.2 n = 8 n = 16 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 R ( t ) Figure 21 : For a fixed value ~ t , a number of graphs of Rp ( ~ t ) ( the reliability of the parallel system ) and Rs ( ~ t ) ( the reliability of the series system ) are portrayed as functions of R ( ~ t ) , the reliability of a Worker at time t , and n , the number of the components . Each graph is labeled with its value of n ; those above the diagonal portray reliabilities of parallel systems , while those below the diagonal pertain to series systems . Note that for n = 1 the models coincide , while for any n > 1 Rp ( ~ t ) is always above Rs ( ~ t ) except when R ( ~ t ) = 0 ( no reliable Worker ) and when R ( ~ t ) = 1 ( totally reliable , failure-free Worker ) . Figure 22 : Data structures and data structure conversions in the masterworker library . 1999 )) . The code of this system has been also ported to a "" pure "" TCP / IP environment by porting the MPICH subset ( Raftnet , n.d. ) . The implemented master-worker system acts as black box . Firstly , knowledge about the algorithm details is not required by the user application programmer . This allows a fast integration of the master-worker library in existing serial applications . Secondly , in RAFTNET data structures in the user application can take any form . They need not to be known beforehand by the master-worker algorithm . Both aspects contribute to the flexibility of the system . The resulting master-worker library can be integrated in a wide variety of programs , on the condition that a limited set of user application functions are written . Both ideas are explained in this section . The modified master-worker algorithm is implemented in the master-worker library . The application that is to be parallelized , resides in the user application library . A main process calls the master-worker library with a restricted set of arguments . Most of these arguments are pointers to functions in the user library for splitting , merging , post-processing the output data or for handling data structures . Communication between the master-worker and the user application library is solely via these functions . Writing these functions forms the main effort of the programmer for integrating the master-worker library with his / her user application library . This setup ensures that the master-worker algorithm can be used for a wide variety of programs . Furthermore , the detailed implementation of the master-worker algorithm remains a black box for the user . The concept of the user application acting as a black box for the master-worker library , is mainly a matter of handling data structures and requires a more elaborated explanation . Often , the program flow can be regarded as a series of data structure conversions . To support a variety of applications , the master-worker library keeps track of various data structures ( Fig. 22 ) . DW STRUCT , WC STRUCT and CM STRUCT denote the input blocks , the processed blocks and the post-processed output data respectively . The prefixes are the first letters of source and destination . Conversion between these structures is performed in the user functions for processing and merging . MC MERGED STRUCT is a structure containing supporting information for merging the data . Fields in data structures are sent one at a time . Details Figure 23 : Process for sending and receiving one field of a data structure . about these structures are beforehand only known by the user library . On the other hand , the master-worker library needs to know these details for sending and receiving the data . Two functions written by the user application programmer , that are passed on via the master-worker interface , serve as a communication channel between user application library and master-worker library for these structure details ( Fig. 23 . ) • The first function ( describe ) receives as input from the master-worker library , information such as the index of the structure ( which is one of the structures in Fig. 22 ) and the field index . The describe function in the user library returns information such as the number of entries in that field ( in case it is an array ) and the data type . For the receiving process , the returned information allows allocating memory for the receive buffer by the master-worker library . For the sending process , also the data itself is returned to the master-worker library , which is transmitted immediately . • After actually receiving this data , the receive process fills in the users data structure with this received field . The user function fillstruct receives via its arguments the structure and field index , the structure itself and the data . It returns the structure with the data field filled in . Via this schedule , the master-worker library does not need to be aware of the data structure details – these are returned and filled in by the user application 's describe and fillstruct functions . The user programmer is completely in control of the data structures that are used . 9.6.1 Failure semantics Due to the characteristics of the underlying algorithm , our system compensates omission / performance and state-transition failures of its workers . • Omission failures occur when an agreed reply to a request is missing . The request appears to be ignored . This is compensated by redistributing a request when its "" freshness "" allows it . • Performance failures occur when the service is supplied , though too late with respect to some real-time interval possibly agreed upon in the specifications . This class of failures can be compensated by adopting a number of workers large enough to mask , e.g. , crashing or late processing workers . • State transition failures are also covered , as the state of the system is never lost because of a failing worker : Indeed , by construction , each state transition is atomic : A block is marked as processed only when its completion is explicitly acknowledged . Half finished blocks are simply discarded . Memory Allocation Delays and Failures . A memory allocation failure can be due to either not enough available memory on that node possibly resulting from memory leaks or due to another memory-greedy program running . In the former case , memory allocation fails permanently and contribution to the system eventually ends . In the latter , the worker might be able to continue after the other program is finished or when it is in a further stage of processing . When receiving data , the receiving process can fail to allocate memory for the receive buffer . In this case , the process sleeps a certain time slice , polling for available memory regularly . In case the failure is temporary ( e.g. another memory-greedy program running on the same node ) , this will allow the process to continue its program cycle . For permanent failures , the process stops contribution after trying to allocate memory for a certain number times . Processes Sending to Failed Workers . The algorithm handles failures of workers if error codes are returned to the master-worker library . These can fail to contribute or be delayed for quite some time . However , processes that send towards these workers are not aware of these kinds of events . Therefore , such events are handled by using appropriate send operations . When using synchronous messages for sending a bunch of data , a sort of "" handshake "" is required between the sender and the receiver . When the send operation is a blocking one and the receiving process is a worker that failed meanwhile , the whole system will block . For this reason , using synchronous blocking messages for sending towards workers is avoided . In the MPI-1 standard , no explicit asynchronous send operation is available . The standard send operation can be asynchronous , but this depends typically on the MPI implementation and – in case of MPICH – also on the length of the message that is to be transmitted . Therefore , non-blocking send operations are invoked . This is combined with standard messages , in order to exploit optimizations of buffering in the MPI implementation . 9.6.2 Initialization and Finalization The master-worker library and the MPI environment are initialized and finalized with two separate calls to the master-worker library , masterworker_init and masterworker_final . The masterworker interface itself can be invoked one or more times in between . One master-worker run can e.g. use the output of a former master-worker run as input . Also , other process functions or other user functions can be used in these separate masterworker runs . All nodes can be initialized and finalized via user application functions that are passed on to the master-worker library via the masterworker interface . These functions can be used for setting up or freeing global variables in these processes once . These global variables can be used during the program flow of that node , avoiding re-initialization and re-finalization after each process cycle of that node . If such initialization is not necessary , empty functions can be used . Not all variables that are needed for processing are available at all nodes . If a set of variables is needed by the collector for merging the data , these can be transmitted in the MC_MERGED_STRUCT structure . Variables needed for processing a block , but changing according to the blockid ( k ) , should be sent to the workers via the DW_STRUCT . Variables that do not change according to the blockid , should however not be transmitted with each block . These can be initialized as global variables before calling the masterworker_init function . All processes will possess these variables in this case . 9.6.3 Speeding up Possible time-consuming operations , such as saving results , splitting input units or merging and post-processing the output , are performed in RAFTNET by separate threads . In this way , temporary delays are smoothed out over one cycle of the master-worker system for splitting , processing and postprocessing a data unit . The same reasoning has been applied to the master and the dispatcher . These consist of separate threads on the same node . Sending a certain set of input blocks from the master to the dispatcher results in this case in only exchanging pointers . This avoids the communication cost of sending input blocks from the master to the dispatcher or output units from the dispatcher to the master . 9.7 9.7.1 Application and System Description Parallelization Choice Not all algorithms are good candidates to apply the master-worker on . Parallelising an application over different processors offers a real added value when code optimizations have been done on the algorithm . As such , these two approaches are complementary . The following rules of thumb were used in the decision of applying the raftnet library on the algorithms described in the rest of this section : Algorithm locality : Splitting up the input data for parallel execution is most efficient when operations have no or little data dependency or when these operations are very local if there is a positional data dependency ( e.g. pixels in an image grid ) . Input and output : When data is split up , this can affect the final result . Either the result is erroneous ( mostly because of the absence of locality in the algorithm ) , the output has noise added to it or the merged output is correct ( identical to serial execution ) . This example is often because parallel execution only used a similar split policy that was already inherently used in the serial execution ( e.g. audio MP3 encoding ) . In the second case , the evaluation has to be made if the noise is significant for the final outcome and if it is , can the noise be filtered out in an efficient way . In the following , a case study is briefly described : Feature selection via corner detection and Delaunay triangulation on the reconstructed points . The testing environment consisted of a PA RISC 85000 processor with a 400 MHz clock and 1.5 MB cache , running the HP-UX 11.0 operating system . MPICH 1.2.2 has been used , which implements the MPI 1.2 standard . 9.7.2 Corner Detection The corner detection algorithm ( Harris & Stephens , 1988 ) forms the basis of , e.g. , a 3D reconstruction algorithm . The features selected in this phase are matched ( i.e. the corresponding corners in several images ) and used for reconstruction of the 3rd dimension , which was lost in the projection to 2D while capturing . During the tests , the setup in Fig. 24 was used . Machine A captures , via a Conexant Bt878 based card , the data onto a local disk ( NVREC , n.d. ) . In turn , this disk is shared via NFS with the rest of the network , in particular the parallel master-worker cluster . The images are captured in PAL VideoCD format , 352 × 288 , 25 fps ( frames per second ) , to pgm frames . The initial version in C , based on the C ++ development code was not even close to be able to process the images in soft real time and only 7 fps were processed . In a following step , the algorithm was optimized by including faster Figure 24 : Capture and processing setup . Figure 25 : Image processing parallelization schemes . and more memory aware data types and by reducing intermediate buffers and loop transformations ( Leeman et al. , 2005 ) . Due to these changes , this algorithm got a speedup of 30 % , which still put it about two times slower than the minimal soft real time requirement ( 10 – 12 fps ) . Since conventional code optimization techniques were exhausted , assigning a larger cycle budget to the task within the available environment was done by adding a parallelization layer . Figure 25 shows two possible parallelization schemes . One possibility is to split up the figure . In doing this , edge effects have to be accounted for , so about 7 % of the pixel values need to be replicated . In the test setup , the second option was preferred : The frames are handled in a FIFO by the master and are sent as a whole to the workers . This has also the advantage that no splitting is needed at the dispatcher side , nor is there need for merging of the results ( coordinate data ) on the collector's side . For the integration of the master-worker algorithm , only 125 extra lines of code had to be written to use the required functionality of raftnet . Tests on the implemented system show that soft real time feature detection in the absence of faults is possible with 4 to 5 workers ( depending on the network and worker load ) . Adding more workers improves further performance and , at the same time , enhances the dependability of the service .

Also the main features of a few systems based on these approaches have been discussed . After this a number of examples have been treated in more detail – a flexible and easy to use mechanism for software voting ; a software watchdog timer ; a tool providing exception handling for the C programming language ; a tool to manage transactions in C ; and a system combining spatial and temporal redundancy to achieve data stabilization . Some of their algorithms have been introduced – Table 6 locates them in the chapter . A so-called recovery meta-program – a syntactical structure for the expressions of provisions such as recovery blocks – has been also introduced . Finally a hybrid system , RAFTNET , combining aspects of both approaches , has been discussed . Main aspect of the SV approach is the inherent mixture of the functional and the fault-tolerant code , which requires the developer to deal with the two corresponding concerns at the same time . MVSFT do not suffer from such flaw . On the other hand , as already mentioned , MVSFT have been designed expressly in order to address residual design faults . Such fault model though is intrinsically static , as the approach requires an off-line definition of the variants . This means that any service adopting the MVSFT provision assumes a static , stable environment , the typical faults of which are known as well as the extent of their consequences . Any time this is not valid anymore , the risk is higher of a coverage failure for the assumption of statistical independence becomes greater . Despite their relatively long life , the approaches reviewed in this chapter are still being used and debated upon . This is especially true for MVSFT based on design diversity , whose effectiveness with respect to the problem of correlated failures appears to be a constant field of debate ( Meulen & Revilla , 2005 ) , while its applicability is being enlarged to domains such as security ( Cox et al. , 2006 ) and to non custom-made versions ( Gashi et al. , 2006 ) .

In software the redundancy required is not simple replication of programs but redundancy of design . "" Chapter 2 reported the consequences of a well known case where redundancy of design would have prevented a catastrophic failure – the Ariane 5 flight 501 . 3 Randell himself states that , given the ever increasing complexity of modern computing , there is still an urgent need for "" richer forms of structuring for error recovery and for design diversity "" ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) . 4 This weakness of NVP can be narrowed , if not solved , adopting the approach used in the so-called "" voting farm "" ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998c , 1998a ; De Florio , 1997 ) , a generic voting tool designed by author of this book in the framework of his participation to project "" EFTOS "" ( see Sect . 2.1.1 ) : such a tool works with opaque objects that are compared by means of a user-defined function . This function returns an integer value representing a "" distance "" between any two objects to be voted . The user may choose between a set of predefined distance functions or may develop an application-specific distance function . Doing the latter , a distance may be endowed with the ability to assess that bitwise different objects are semanticly equivalent . Of course , the user is still responsible for supplying a bug-free distance function – though is assisted in this simpler task by a number of template functions supplied with that tool . 5 We recall that EPX , or Embedded Parix , was the operating system and message passing library of EFTOS' target platforms . page Contents 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES 49 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING SINGLE - AND MULTIPLEVERSION SOFTWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE 49 2.1 Single-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Libraries of Tools .... 50 2.1.1 The EFTOS library ...................... 50 2.1.2 The SwIFT System ...................... 52 2.1.3 Two libraries for Checkpointing and Rollback ....... 54 2.2 Conclusions ............................... 55 2.3 Multiple-version Software Fault-Tolerance : Structures for Design Diversity ............................... . 56 2.3.1 A hybrid case : Data Diversity ................ 61 3 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Voting Farm 3.1 Basic Structure and Features of the EFTOS Voting Farm 3.1.1 Client-Side of the Voting Farm : the User Module . 3.1.2 System and Fault Models .............. 3.1.3 Server-Side of the Voting Farm : the Voter ..... 3.1.4 Voting Farm : An Example ............. 3.1.5 Voting Farm : Some Conclusions .......... 4 The EFTOS Tools : The Watchdog Timer ........................ 64 64 67 68 69 72 74 75 5 The EFTOS Tools : The EFTOS Trap Handler 77 5.1 The EFTOS Trap Handling Tool .................. 78 5.2 Algorithm of the Trap Handling Tool ................ 78 5.2.1 Structure of user trap handling ............... 78 5.2.2 System and Fault Models of the EFTOS Trap Handling Tool ............................. . 81 5.2.3 Conclusions .......................... 81 6 The EFTOS Tools : Atomic Actions 6.1 The EFTOS Atomic Action Tool . 6.1.1 System Model ........ 6.1.2 The Implementation .... 6.1.3 Functionality ... ..... 6.2 Conclusion ................................................ .......... 81 81 82 84 84 85 ........................................ 7 The TIRAN Data Stabilizing Software Tool 7.1 Introduction ....................... 7.2 Requirements for the Data Stabilizer ......... 7.2.1 The Distributed Memory Tool ........ 7.2.2 The Local Memory Handler and Its Tasks .. 7.2.3 Application-program Interface and Client side 7.3 The Data Stabilizing System Tool ... ....... 7.3.1 Algorithms ................... 7.3.2 Application-Program Interface ........ 7.3.3 System and Fault Models ........... 7.4 Conclusion ........................... ........................................................ 85 . 88 . 89 . 92 . 93 . 95 . 97 . 97 . 98 . 99 . 100 8 An Approach to Express Recovery Blocks : The Recovery MetaProgram 100 9 A Hybrid Case : The RAFTNET Library for Dependable FarmerWorker Parallel Applications 102 9.1 Introducing RAFTNET ..... .................. 102 9.2 Why Dependable Parallel Applications ? .............. 103 9.3 The Technique ............................ 104 9.4 Interactions Between the Farmer and the Dispatcher ....... 105 9.4.1 Interactions Between the Dispatcher and the Workers .. 106 9.4.2 Interactions Between the Workers and the Collector ... 108 9.4.3 Interactions Between the Collector and the Dispatcher .. 109 9.5 Discussion ............................... 110 9.5.1 Reliability Analysis ........ .............. 110 9.6 Implementation Issues ........................ 111 9.6.1 Failure semantics ....................... 115 9.6.2 Initialization and Finalization ....... ......... 116 9.6.3 Speeding up .......................... 116 9.7 Application and System Description ................ 117 9.7.1 9.7.2 Parallelization Choice ............... ..... 117 Corner Detection ....................... 117 10 CONCLUSION 119 References 119 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING COMPILERS AND TRANSLATORS 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES In this chapter our survey of methods and structures for application-level fault-tolerance continues getting closer to the programming language : Indeed , tools such as compilers and translators work at the level of the language – they parse , interpret , compile or transform our programs , so they are interesting candidates for managing dependability aspects in the application layer . An important property of this family of methods is the fact that fault-tolerance complexity is extracted from the program and turned into architectural complexity in the compiler or the translator . Apart from continuing with our survey , this chapter also aims at providing the reader with two practical examples : • Reflective and refractive variables , i.e. a syntactical structure to express adaptive feedback loops in the application layer . This is useful to resilient computing because a feedback loop can attach error recovery strategies to error detection events . • Redundant variables , that is a tool that allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of redundancy is not fixed once and for all at design time , but rather it changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . Both tools are new research activities that are currently being carried out by the author of this book at the PATS research group of the University of Antwerp . It is shown how through a simple translation approach it is possible to provide sophisticated features such as adaptive fault-tolerance to programs written in any language , even plain old C. 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING COMPILERS AND TRANSLATORS Our first subject is tools that work "" within "" the compiler : Meta-object protocols . Most of such tools are based on the concept of reflection : The ability to mirror the feature of a system by creating a causal connection between sub-systems and internal objects . In other words , events experienced by a reflected sub-system trigger events on the object representing that sub-system , and vice-versa . 2.1 Compiler-level Tools : Meta-object Protocols , Reflection , and Introspection Some of the negative aspects pointed out while describing single and multiple version software approaches can be in some cases weakened , if not solved , by means of a generic structuring technique that allows to reach in some cases an adequate degree of flexibility , transparency , and separation of design concerns : the adoption of meta-object protocols ( Kiczales , Rivières , & Bobrow , 1991 ) . The idea is to "" open "" the implementation of the run-time executive of an object-oriented language like C ++ or Java so that the developer can adopt and program different , custom semantics , adjusting the language to the needs of the user and to the requirements of the environment . Using meta-object protocols , the programmer can modify the behavior of a programming language's features such as methods invocation , object creation and destruction , and member access . The transparent management of spatial and temporal redundancy ( Taylor , Morgan , & Black , 1980 ) is a context where meta-object protocols appear to be particularly adequate . The key concept behind meta-object protocols is that of computational reflection , or the causal connection between a system and a meta-level description representing structural and computational aspects of that system ( Maes , 1987 ) . The protocols offer the meta-level programmer a representation of a system as a set of meta-objects , i.e. , objects that represent and reflect properties of "" real "" objects , i.e. , those objects that constitute the functional part of the user application . Meta-objects can for instance represent the structure of a class , or object interaction , or the code of an operation . This mapping process is called reification ( Robben , 1999 ) . The causality relation of meta-object protocols could also be extended to allow for a dynamical reorganisation of the structure and the operation of a system , e.g. , to perform reconfiguration and error recovery . The basic object-oriented feature of inheritance can be used to enhance the reusability of the fault-tolerance mechanisms developed with this approach . A related concept is introspection , a technique that hacks the compiler to unravel and reason upon the hidden structure of our programs . 2.1.1 OpenC ++ and Project FRIENDS OpenC ++ has been defined as a "" code analysis library "" ( Karpov , 2008 ) : A tool to parse and analyze C ++ source code . Such tool makes use of a meta-object protocol to provide services for language extensions . In OpenC ++ , classes are objects as in Smalltalk , and called class metaobjects . A class metaobject translates – at compile time – expressions involving a class . In a sense , it works like a filter parsing all the expressions that mention its class . The default filter leaves the expressions unmodified , but the programmer can choose otherwise . This simple idea translates in a powerful tool for the programmer : For instance ( Shigeru , 1996 ) , shows how easy it is to perform some accounting on all methods invocations of a given class ( doing this in a standard programming language such as C ++ would require considerable programming effort ( Leeman et al. , 2005 )) . As one can easily understand , such features may translate in a useful syntactical structure for the tolerance of faults . An architecture supporting this approach is the one developed in the framework of project FRIENDS ( Fabre & Pérennou , 1996 , 1998 ) . Name FRIENDS is the acronym of "" Flexible and Reusable Implementation Environment for your Next Dependable system "" . This project aims at implementing a number of fault-tolerance provisions ( e.g. , replication , group-based communication , synchronization , voting ) at meta-level . In FRIENDS a distributed application is a set of objects interacting via the proxy model , a proxy being a local intermediary between each object and any other ( possibly replicated ) object . 2.1.2 Javassist Javassist ( Java Programming Assistant ) ( Javassist , n.d. ) is a Java meta-library : It allows the programmer to access and manipulate the bytecode of an application , that is , the Java pseudo-code that is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine to execute that application . This powerful feature allows to change the implementation of a class at run-time , which is known as structural reflection . Javassist can edit the bytecode either in the high-level form of the corresponding Java source level or directly as bytecodes . It is even possible to compile bytecode strings on the fly . Working with the standard Java compiler and virtual machine , Javassist offers a meta-object interface to control method invocations on base-level objects . All these features makes it a powerful tool for program transformation . One of the possible uses of Javassist is to augment Java for aspect-oriented programming1 , e.g. inserting before , after , and around advices . This gave raise to the GluonJ system , "" a light-weight but powerful AOP framework on top of Javassist "" ( GluonJ , n.d. ) . Another interesting application would be to make use of Javassist to monitor and protect objects , for instance taking periodic "" snapshots "" of their state . This is but one possible way to achieve higher dependability through an approach like the one offered by Javassist , though to the best of our knowledge no research is being carried out on this topic yet . 2.1.3 MetaC ++ MetaC ++ ( Strasser , 2005 ) is a tool that reads a C ++ program and produces a tree with a representation of language constructs . The tree is exported to clients through an API or in the form of an XML file . The gathered meta-data can be used to rewrite a modified version of the original program , including all types of patches , filters , and improvements – which makes it interesting as a fault-tolerance provision . It was designed by its author primarily as a source-to-source code translator , but also to be used by source code analysis tools , stub generators , and source-to-UML converters . According to its author , future releases of MetaC ++ will provide mechanisms to mark elements of the language with attributes , as in persistent class MyDatabaseObject ; This will facilitate the set up of systems such as redundant variables , the dynamically redundant data structures described in Chapter 10 . 2.1.4 Introspection Data hiding and encapsulation are powerful tools to master the complexity of complex computer services , but they also represent a process that inhibits the access to complexity that is still there , and therefore can potentially jeopardize those services . The idea of introspection is to gain access into this complexity , to inspect the hidden structure of programs , and to interpret their meaning through semantic processing , the same way the Semantic Web promises to achieve with the data scattered in the Internet . Quoting its author , "" introspection is a means that , when applied correctly , can help crack the code of a software and intercept the hidden and encapsulated meaning of the internals of a program "" . The way to achieve introspection is by instrumenting the software with data collectors producing information available in a form allowing semantic processing , such as RDF . This idea is being used in the Introspector project , which aims at instrumenting the GNU programming tool-chain so as to create a sort of semantic web of all software derived from those tools . The ultimate goal is very ambitious : "" To create a super large and extremely dense web of information about the outside world extracted automatically from computer language programs "" ( DuPont , n.d. ) . Should this become possible , we would be given a tool to reason ( and to let computers reason on our behalf ! ) about the dependability characteristics of the application software – imagine what could mean for instance being able to check for the presence of a hidden design goal and have the problem solved without human intervention . Some years ago this would have sounded like science fiction , now it appears that many researchers are focussing on tools that go in this direction : GASTA ( Gcc Abstract Syntax Tree Analysis ) ( Thouvenin , 2004 ) for instance uses introspection to automatically annotate C code to analyze the presence of null pointer design faults ) . GCC-XML ( King , 2004 ) has similar goals . A more advanced example appears to be XOGASTAN ( XML-Oriented Gcc Abstract Syntax Tree ANalyzer ) ( Antoniol , Di Penta , Masone , & Villano , 2004 ) , which uses the abstract syntax tree produced by the GNU compiler while processing a C file and translates it into XML . Another of their tools then can read the XML file and analyze it . So let us hope this may become part of our future . Conclusions . Meta-object protocols and reflection are indeed a promising system structure for embedding different non-functional concerns in the application-level of a computer program . They work at language level , providing means to modify the semantics of basic object-oriented language building blocks like object creation and deletion , calling and termination of class methods , and so forth . This appears to match perfectly to a proper subset of the possible fault-tolerance provisions , especially those such as transparent object redundancy , which can be straightforwardly managed with the meta-object approach . When dealing with these fault-tolerance provisions , meta-object protocols and reflection provide a perfect separation of the design concerns , i.e. , optimal sc . Some other techniques , specifically those who might be described as "" the most coarse-grained ones "" , such as distributed recovery blocks ( Kim & Welch , 1989 ) , appear to be less suited for being efficiently implemented via meta-object protocols . These techniques work at distributed , i.e. , macroscopic , level . The above situation reminds the author of this book of another one , regarding the "" quest "" for a novel computational paradigm for parallel processing able of dealing effectively with the widest class of problems , the same way the Von Neumann paradigm does for sequential processing , though with the highest degree of efficiency and the least amount of changes in the original ( sequential ) user code . In that context , the concept of computational grain came up : Some techniques were inherently looking at the problem "" with coarse-grained glasses , "" i.e. , at macroscopic level , while others were considering the problem exclusively at microscopic level . Meta-object protocols are an example of the latter approaches : They provide a small grain access to a program's atomic structures and provide means to modify their behavior . Meta-object protocols look at the problem from a microscopic point of view . Some of the hitherto developed fault-tolerance techniques fit perfectly with this approach – for instance , object redundancy can be easily managed with the meta-object approach , and , for instance , Robben ( Robben , 1999 ) describes meta-programs for checkpointing , active replication , and transaction processing . It is still unclear whether this set is general enough to host , efficaciously , many forms of fault-tolerance , as it is remarked for instance in ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ; Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) ( "" what reflective capabilities are needed for what form of fault-tolerance , and to what extent these capabilities can be provided in more-or-less conventional programming languages , and allied to other structuring techniques [ like RB and NVP ] remain to be determined "" ) . It is therefore difficult to establish a qualitative assessment of attribute sa for meta-object protocols and reflection . Judging from the evidence acquired to date one can cautiously assess their sa as "" ≥ average "" ( average or more . ) The run-time management of libraries of meta-object protocols may be used to reach satisfactory values for attribute a . To the best of our knowledge this feature has not been exploited for reaching higher dependability in any system supporting meta-object protocols and reflection . As evident , the target application domain is mostly the one of object-oriented applications written with languages extended with a meta-object protocol , such as Open C ++ . One can conclude that meta-object protocols and reflection offer an elegant system structure to embed a certain set of non-functional services ( including some fault-tolerance provisions ) in an object-oriented program . Computational reflection is a relatively old concept , though still actively investigated in various forms , especially because it is one of the possible ways to realize aspect-orientation , which is being given an even larger attention by researchers these days . OpenC ++ is still referenced and investigated ( Karpov , 2008 ) . MetaC ++ does not appear to have received wide attention . On the contrary , introspection appears to be spreading with projects such as GASTA , XOGASTAN and GCC-XML . Both computational reflection and introspection are conceptual ingredients that can be used to craft fault-tolerance systems , though can not provide an answer of their own but must be coupled with other approaches . No fault-tolerance provisions based on introspection surfaced to date , so it is difficult to assess the value of the structural attributes for introspection for the time being . 2.2 2.2.1 Enhancing Programs through Translations LINDA Systems The Linda ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989b , 1989a ) approach adopts a special model of communication , known as generative communication ( Gelernter , 1985 ) . According to this model , communication is still carried out through messages , though messages are not sent to one or more addressees for them to be retrieved from local mailboxes – on the contrary , messages are included in a distributed ( virtual ) shared memory , called tuple space , where every Linda process has equal read / write access rights . In generative communication , the sender of a message can not know who will read any sent message – if any eventually will . This means that traditional terms such as client-server or peer-to-peer , which are normally used to describe relationships between communicating entities , do not apply to generative communication . A tuple space is some sort of a shared relational database for storing and withdrawing special data objects called tuples , sent by the Linda processes . Tuples are basically lists of objects identified by their contents , cardinality and type . Two tuples match if ( 1 ) they have the same number of objects , ( 2 ) if the objects are pairwise compatible for what concerns their types , and ( 3 ) if the memory cells associated to the objects are bitwise equal . A Linda process inserts , reads , and withdraws tuples via blocking or non-blocking primitives . Read operations can be performed by supplying a template tuple – that is , a prototype tuple consisting of constant fields and of fields that can assume any value . A process trying to access a missing tuple via a blocking primitive enters a wait state that continues until any tuple matching its template tuple is added to the tuple space . This allows processes to synchronize . When more than one tuple matches a template , the choice of which actual tuple to address is done in a non-deterministic way . Concurrent execution of processes is supported through the concept of "" live data structures "" : Tuples requiring the execution of one or more functions can be evaluated on different processors – in a sense , they become active , or "" alive "" . Once the evaluation has finished , a ( no more active , or passive ) output tuple is entered in the tuple space . Parallelism is implicit in Linda – there is no explicit notion of network , number and location of the system processors , though Linda has been successfully employed in many different hardware architectures and many applicative domains , resulting in a powerful programming tool that sometimes achieves excellent speedups without affecting portability issues . Unfortunately the model does not cover the possibility of failures – for instance , the semantics of its primitives are not well defined in the case of a processor crash , and no fault-tolerance means are part of the model . Moreover , in its original form , Linda only offers single-op atomicity ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) , i.e. , atomic execution for only a single tuple space operation . With single-op atomicity it is not possible to solve problems arising in two common Linda programming paradigms when faults occur : Both the distributed variable and the replicated-worker paradigms can fail ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) . As a consequence , a number of possible improvements have been investigated to support fault-tolerant parallel programming in Linda . Apart from design choices and development issues , many of them implement stability of the tuple space ( via replicated state machines ( Schneider , 1990 ) kept consistent via ordered atomic multicast ( Birman , Schiper , & Stephenson , 1991 )) ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Xu & Liskov , 1989 ; Patterson , Turner , Hyatt , & Reilly , 1993 ) , while others aim at combining multiple tuple-space operations into atomic transactions ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ; Cannon & Dunn , 1992 ) . Other techniques have also been used , e.g. , tuple space checkpoint-and-rollback ( Kambhatla , 1991 ) . The author of this book also proposed an augmented Linda model for solving inconsistencies related to failures occurring in a replicated-worker environment ( see Chapter 9 ) and an algorithm for implementing a resilient replicated worker scheme for message-passing farmer-worker applications . As seen in Chapter 3 , this algorithm can mask failures affecting a proper subset of the set of workers ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1999 ) . Linda can be described as a parallel processing extension that can be added to any existing programming language . The greater part of these extensions requires a preprocessor translating the extension in the host language . This is the case , e.g. , for FT-Linda ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ) , PvmLinda ( De Florio , Murgolo , & Spinelli , 1994 ) , C-Linda ( Berndt , 1989 ) , and MOM ( Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ) . A counterexample is , e.g. , the POSYBL system ( Schoinas , 1991 ) , which implements Linda primitives with remote procedure calls , and requires the user to supply the ancillary information for distinguishing tuples . Linda systems allow dealing with redundant data and redundant processes in a transparent way , so they are in general characterized by good sc . Though available in many flavours , typically Linda systems focus on a few fault-tolerance solutions , hence sa is assessed as "" average / potentially good "" . Adaptivity is not supported in the available Linda systems , so their a is deemed as insufficient . The Linda approach , on the other hand , may make use of its high transparency to achieve fault-tolerance applications whose redundancy changes with the experienced or forecast faults – which would bring to good a . Very popular some years ago , Linda appears not to be an emergent fault-tolerance the solution these days . 2.2.2 The Porch Translator Porch ( Strumpen , 1998 ) is a source-to-source translator that converts a sequential C program into an equivalent one that supports the saving and reloading of "" portable checkpoints "" . This means that Porch allows to dump a checkpoint on machine m and restart it on machine n , even though m and n have different computer architecture . Clearly this can be used to achieve task migration and reconfiguration . Porch allows to execute checkpoints periodically , or by sending signals e.g. through the UNIX "" kill "" command . Porch suffers from several limitations : Rolling back a checkpoint does not preserve open file descriptors and sockets ; only initialized pointers are stored in the checkpoints , hence uninitialized pointers may change their value . Porch is functionally not dissimilar from other checkpoint and rollback systems such as psncLibCkpt ( Meyer , 2003 ) , ckpt ( Zandy , n.d. ) or Dynamite ( Iskra et al. , 2000 ) . Its added value is the use of a translator , which improves its sc . Clearly sa is limited to a single class of fault-tolerance provisions . No adaptivity is foreseen in Porch , so a is set to insufficient . Next section describes an application-level approach to fault-tolerance employing translators . The approach is based on so-called Reflective and refractive variables . Available as a rough prototype , a system supporting this approach is currently being developed by the author of this book . Figure 1 : A simple example of the use of reflective and refractive variables . 3 AN EXAMPLE : REFLECTIVE AND REFRACTIVE VARIABLES The idea behind reflective and refractive variables is to use memory access as an abstraction to perform concealed tasks . Reflective and refractive variables are volatile variables whose identifier links them with an external device , such as a sensor , or an RFID , or an actuator . In reflective variables , memory cells get asynchronously updated by service threads that interface those external devices . The well-known concept of reflection is used , because those variables "" reflect "" the values measured by those devices . In refractive variables , on the contrary , write requests trigger a request to update an external parameter , such as the data rate of the local TCP protocol entity or the amount of redundancy to be used in transmissions . We use to say that write accesses "" refract "" ( that is , get redirected ( Institute for Telecommunication Sciences , n.d. )) onto corresponding external devices . The reflective and refractive variables model does not require any special language : Figure1 is an example in the C language . The portrayed program declares two variables : "" cpu "" , a reflective integer , which reports the current percentage of usage of the local CPU as an integer number between 0 and 100 , and "" tcpTxRate "" , a reflective and refractive integer , which reports and sets the send rate parameter of the TCP layer . The code periodically queries the CPU usage and , when that reaches a value greater than 90 % , it requests to change the TCP send rate . Note that the only non standard C construct used in the example is attribute "" Ref t "" , which specifies that a corresponding declaration is reflective or refractive or both . Through a translation process , discussed in detail in Sect . 3 , this code is instrumented so as to include the logics required to interface the cpu and the TCP external devices . Figure3 shows this simple code in action on our development platform – a Pentium-M laptop running Windows XP and the Cygwin tools . One can observe that through the reflective and refractive variable model the design complexity is partitioned into two well defined and separated Figure 2 : An excerpt from the execution of the code in Fig. 2 . components : The code to interface external devices is specified "" elsewhere "" ( Sect . describes where and how ) while the functional code is specified in a familiar way , in this case as a C code reading and writing integer variables . The result is a structured model to express tasks such as cross-layered optimization , adaptive or fault-tolerant computing in an elegant , non intrusive , and cost-effective way . Such model is characterized by strong separation of design concerns ( that is , excellent sc ) , for the functional strategies are not to be specified aside with the layer functions . Only instrumentation is required , and this can be done once and for all . This prevents spaghetti-like coding for both the functional and the non-functional aspects , and translates in improved maintainability and enhanced efficiency . The reflective and refractive variable model provides the designer also with another attribute : a variable , be it a reflective / refractive variables or a "" common "" one , can be tagged as being "" redundant "" . Redundant variables are variables whose contents get replicated several times so as to protect them from memory faults . Writing to a redundant variable means writing to a number of replicas , either located strategically2 on the same processing node , or on remote nodes – when available and the extra overhead be allowed . Reading from a redundant variable actually translates in reading from each of its cells and performing majority voting ( through an approach such as the one described in Chapter 3 ) . The result of this process is monitored by a special device , called Redundance . Redundance measures the amount of votes that differ from the majority vote , and uses this as a measure of the disturbance in the surrounding environment . Under normal situation , Redundance triplicates the memory cells of redundant variables . This corresponds to tolerating up to one memory fault in the cells associated to a redundant variable . Under more critical situations , the amount of redundancy should change . This is indeed what actually happens : The component that manages redundant variables Figure 3 : General structure of feedback loops . Figure 4 : Redundant variables . declares the integer reflective variable "" ref t int redundance "" . The latter is set asynchronously by the Redundance device , which adjusts the corresponding memory cells3 with a number representing the ideal degree of redundancy with respect to the current degree of disturbances . The reflective and refractive variables model can also be used in contexts such as cross-layer optimization . In general , it provides an application-level construct to manage feedback loops . Feedback loops ( see Fig. 2 ) – a well known concept from system theory – are ideal forms to shape our systems so as to be adaptive-and-dependable ( Van Roy , 2006 ) . As we have mentioned already in Chapter 2 , such property is an important pre-requisite for the welfare of our computer-dominated societies and economies : In the cited paper Van Roy explains their relevance to future software design . Reflective and refractive variables provide a straightforward syntactical structure and software architecture for the expression of feedback loops . This structure is used , e.g. , to implement redundant variables . The main advantage in this case is that , instead of taking a design decision once and for all , one lets a system parameter change as needed , zeroing in on the optimum . The use of reflective and refractive variables simplifies the design of our solution , which also enhances maintainability . But probably the most important consequence of that design choice is that our solution does not assume a fixed , immutable fault model , but lets it change with the actual faults being experienced – which is precisely the property pointed out in Chapter 2 as a key requirement for modern dependable software . Figure4 shows how simple it is to use a redundant variable : No syntactic differences can be noticed . The required logic is "" hidden "" in the translation process . More detail about redundant variables is provided in Sect . 4 . 3.1 Implementation The core of the reflective and refractive variables architecture is a LEX analyzer4 that translates the input source code into two source files , one with an augmented version of the original code and one server-side to monitor and drive the external devices . This process is considered in Fig. 5 , an excerpt from the translation of the code in Fig. 4 . Let us review the resulting code in more detail ( please note that item x in the following list refer to lines tagged as "" // x "" in the code ) : 1 . First the translator removes the occurrences of attributes "" ref t "" and "" redundant "" . 2 . Then it performs a few calls to function "" aopen "" . This is to open the associative arrays "" reflex "" and "" rtype "" . As well known , an associative array generalizes the concept of array so as to allow addressing items by non-integer indexes . The arguments to "" aopen "" are functions similar to "" strcmp "" , from the C standard library , which are used to compare index objects . The idea is that these data structures create links between the name of variables and some useful information ( see below ) . 3 . There follow a number of "" awrites "" , i.e. , associations are created between variables identifiers and two numbers : The corresponding variables' address and an internal code representing its type and attributes . 4 . Then "" Server "" , the thread responsible to interface the external devices , is spawned . 5 . Besides a write access into refractive variable tcpTxRate , the translator places a call to function "" CalltcpTxRate "" . In general , after a call to refractive variable v , the call "" Callv ( & v ) "" is produced . 6 . Similarly , a write access to redundant variable w , of type t , is followed by a call to "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" . 7 . Finally , reading from redundant variable w , of type t , is translated into a call to function "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" . It is the responsibility of the designer to make sure that proper code for functions "" Callv ( & v ) "" is produced . Functions "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" and "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" are automatically generated through a template-like approach – the former performs a redundant write , the latter a redundant read plus majority voting . For voting , an approach similar to that in Chapter 3 has been followed ( that is , voting farms ) . As already mentioned , the "" Server "" thread is the code responsible to monitor and interface the external devices . Its algorithm is quite simple ( see Fig. 6 ) : Figure 5 : Abridged version of the main function of the translated code . the code continuously waits for a sensor update ( lines tagged with "" // 1 "" ) , then retrieves the address and type of the corresponding reflective variable ( in "" // 2 "" ) and finally updates that variable ( "" // 3 "" ) . The complexity to interface external devices is charged to function "" getValue "" , an excerpt of which is shown in Fig. 7 . The core of "" getValue "" is function "" cpu "" , which returns the amount of CPU currently being used . 3.2 Other Uses of Reflective and Refractive Variables As mentioned at the beginning , our research on this topic has begun only recently . We are in the process of making use of our approach in several real-life applications – most likely the subject of future publications . In what follows a few contexts where our variables could provide effective and low-cost solutions are discussed . 3.2.1 Management of Concurrency As cleverly explained e.g. by Gates in ( Gates , 2007 ) , a well known challenge in robotics is concurrency , defined in the cited paper as "" how to simultaneously handle all the data coming in from multiple sensors and send the appropriate commands to the robot's motors "" . The conventional approach , i.e. , making use of a long loop that first reads all the data from the sensors , then processes the input and finally controls the robot is not adequate enough . Because of this , the robot control could be using stale values , which could bring to disastrous consequences . As Gates mentions in the cited paper , this is a scenario that applies not only to Figure 6 : The Server code . Figure 7 : Function getValue interfaces all the external devices that are connected to reflective and refractive variables . Figure 8 : RR var to localize objects with RFID tags on them . robotics but also to all those fields such as distributed , parallel and resilient computing where data and control often need to be effectively orchestrated under strict real-time constraints and despite the occurrence of faults . "" To fully exploit the power of processors working in parallel , the new software must deal with the problem of concurrency "" , Gate says . It is our belief that an approach such as the one offered by reflective and refractive variables could result in an effective syntactic structure for that : A control loop using reflective variables , for instance , would not need to specify a reading order for the input variables , which are updated asynchronously , as new values need to replace old ones . Within that loop one could attach e.g. the asynchronous management of failures . 3.2.2 Localizing Hidden Assets Extending our translator it can be possible to allow writing programs such as the one in Fig. 8 . At first sight the program may sound meaningless , as it only declares a function and a reflective variable , "" rfid "" , and does not seem to perform any useful action . "" Behind the lines "" – a nice feature offered by translators – what happens is that surrounding RFID tags reflect their content onto variable "" rfid "" . Data stored into that variable is compared with the initialization value ( in this case , an ISBN number ) . In case of a match , function "" beep "" is called . Now imagine running this code onto your PDA while walking through the lanes of a large library such as the Vatican Library in search for a "" lost "" or misplaced book . When in reach of the searched item , the PDA starts beeping5 . Or imagine that , thanks to international regulations , all "" companies "" building antipersonnel mines be obliged by law to embed RFID tags into their "" products "" . When activated , these tags and a program as simple as the one in Fig. 8 could easily prevent dreadful events that continuously devastate the lives of too many a human being . Changing context , the same approach could be used to speed up the localizing of people trapped in the ruins of a fallen building after an earthquake , and so forth . This could be sensible in a highly seismic region . Conclusions . This section introduced a translation system that allows making use of reflection in a standard programming language such as C. The same translator supports "" refraction "" , that is the control of external devices through simple memory write accesses . These two features are used to realize redundant data structures . As well known , redundancy is a key property in fault-tolerance . The Shannon theorem teaches us that through any unreliable channel it is possible to send data reliably by using a proper degree of redundancy . This famous result can be read out in a different way : For each degree of unreliability , there is a minimum level of redundancy that can be used to tolerate any fault . Our approach uses reflective and refractive variables to attune the degree of redundancy required to ensure data integrity to the actual faults being experienced by the system . This provides an example of adaptive fault-tolerant software . Reflective and refractive variables can be used to express problems in cross-layer optimization , but also in contexts where concurrency calls for expressive software structures , e.g. robotics . Localization problems could also be solved through a very simple scheme . Other fields where our tool is being exercised include personalized healthcare ( De Florio , Vaerenbergh , & Blondia , 2007 ) and global adaptation frameworks to enhance the quality of experience of mobile services ( Sun , De Florio , Ning , & Blondia , 2007 ) . By construction , reflective and refractive variables exhibit a good amount of transparency , which translates in good sc . sa is limited to those fault-tolerance techniques that can be expressed in terms of the variables ; some variables could be used e.g. to express processing and communication entities , and allow them to migrate transparently ; other variables could change their state to represent the detection of faults , and so forth . As authors we are convinced of their merits , but we must be objective and state that no such provisions exist so far – with the exception of the ones described in next section . So a fair assessment for sa could be "" limited / potentially good "" . The hidden implementation of reflective and refractive variables allows to achieve a good a with an approach such as the one described in the next section . 4 ADAPTIVE DATA INTEGRITY THROUGH DYNAMICALLY REDUNDANT DATA STRUCTURES Changes , they use to say , are the only constant in life . Everything changes rapidly around us , and more and more key to survival is the ability to rapidly adapt to changes . This consideration applies to many aspects of our lives . Strangely enough , this nearly self-evident truth is not always considered in computer science with the seriousness that it calls for : The assumptions that are drawn for our systems often do not take into due account that e.g. , the run-time environments , the operational conditions , or the available resources will vary . Software is especially vulnerable to this threat , and with today's software-dominated systems controlling crucial services in nuclear plants , airborne equipments , health care systems and so forth , it becomes clear how this situation may potentially lead to catastrophes . Let us consider in particular the viewpoint of the software fault-tolerance engineer and the design goal of enhanced data integrity : It is clear that protecting data against memory faults requires the definition of a fault model stating the possible fault scenarios that our software is going to experience . The current practice is to take this as a static choice , which means that our data integrity provisions ( DIP ) have a fixed range of admissible events to address and tolerate . This translates into two risks : 1 . overshooting , i.e. , over-dimensioning the DIP with respect to the actual threat being experienced , and 2 . undershooting , namely underestimating the threat in view of an economy of resources . Note how those two risks turn into a crucial dilemma to the designer : Wrong choices here can lead to either unpractical , too costly designs or cheap but vulnerable provisions . A sensible example of the problem just stated is given by redundant data structures ( RDS ) . Here redundancy and voting are used to protect memory from possible transient or permanent corruptions . The common choice would be that of adopting a static fault model assumption , such as e.g. "" during any mission , up to 3 faults shall affect the replicas "" , which translates into using a 7-redundant cell to address the worst possible scenario . This is precisely a case of the above stated dilemma . Our starting point in the research reported herein was the question "" Is this the right approach ? , "" or "" Does it make sense in the first place to fix , once and for all , a set of possible conditions affecting memory modules ? "" We do n't think so . First of all , memory technology ( like all technologies ) changes , which means that while yesterday our software was running atop CMOS chips , today the common choice e.g. for airborne applications is SDRAMs because of speed , cost , weight , power and simplicity of design ( Ladbury , 2002 ) . But CMOS memories for airborne applications mostly experience single bit errors ( Oey & Teitelbaum , 1981 ) , while SDRAMS are known to be subject to several classes of faults , including so-called "" single-event effects "" , i.e. single faults affecting whole chips6 ( Ladbury , 2002 ) . Furthermore the cited paper remarks how even from lot to lot error / failure rates vary more than one order of magnitude . A static choice of the fault model can not take all this into proper account . A second argument is that run-time environments change , often because the application is mobile but sometimes also because of external events affecting e.g. temperature , radiation , electro-magnetic interference , or cosmic rays ( think of a wireless sensor network to assist a fire brigade , or of a spaceborne application circulating around the sun ) . Also in these cases a static choice would be unpractical , as the nature of faults may change during a same mission . Figure 9 : A simple example of use of redundant variables . Our conjecture is that the solution to this problem should come by considering the nature of faults as a dynamic system , i.e. , a system evolving in time , and by modeling faults as a function F ( t ) . Consequently , any fault-tolerance provision that be able to solve effectively the problem of over-dimensioning and under-dimensioning should function as an adaptation feedback loop ( Van Roy , 2006 ) in which the resources are allocated after the estimated values of F ( t ) , derived by monitoring sensible environmental variables . This section reports on the design of a tool compliant to that model . Our tool allows designers to make use of adaptively redundant data structures with commodity programming languages such as C or Java . Designers using such tool can define redundant data structures where the degree of redundancy changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced at run-time . Our approach attunes the degree of redundancy required to ensure data integrity to the actual faults being experienced by the system and provides an example of adaptive fault-tolerance software provision . In what follows a description of our tool and design issues are given . 4.1 Dynamically Redundant Data Structures Our tool is a translator that loosely parses a source code performing some transformations as reported in the rest of this section . A translator was developed in the C programming language together with the Lex lexical analyzer generator and the YACC syntactic analyzers generator ( Levine , Mason , & Brown , 1992 ) . The reported version supports the C syntax though the same principles can be easily applied to any other language . Our translator performs a simple task – it allows the programmer to tag variables with a keyword , "" redundant , "" and then instruments the memory accesses to tagged variables . Figure 9 shows how this is done in practice with a very simple example whose translation is provided in Fig. 10 . Let us review the resulting code in more detail ( please note that item x in the following list refer to lines tagged as "" // x "" in the code ) : 1 . First the translator removes the occurrences of attribute "" redundant "" . 2 . Then it performs a few calls to function "" aopen "" . This is to open the associative arrays "" redun "" and "" rtype "" . As well known , an associative Figure 10 : An excerpt from the translation of the code in Fig. 9 . Variable "" Redundance "" represents the current amount of redundancy , initially set to "" REDUNDANCE "" ( that is , 3 ) . array generalizes the concept of array so as to allow addressing items by non-integer indexes . The arguments to "" aopen "" are functions similar to "" strcmp "" , from the C standard library , which are used to compare index objects . The idea is that these data structures create links between the name of variables and some useful information ( see below ) . 3 . There follow a number of "" awrites "" , i.e. , associations are created between variables' identifiers and two numbers : the corresponding variables' address and an internal code representing its type and attributes ( code 64 means "" redundant int "" ) . 4 . Then the "" Server "" thread , responsible to allocate replicas and to monitor and adapt to external changes , is spawned . 5 . A write access to redundant variable w , of type t , is followed by a call to "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" . 6 . Finally , reading from redundant variable w , of type t , is translated into a call to function "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" . The strategy to allocate replicas is a research topic on its own . Solutions range from naı ̈ ve simple strategies such as allocating replicas into contiguous cells – which makes them vulnerable to burst faults – to more sophisticated strategies where replicas get allocated e.g. in different memory banks , or different memory chips , or even on different processors . Clearly each choice represents a trade-off between robustness and performance penalty . In our current version replicas are separated by strides of variable length . The core of our tool is given by functions "" RedundantAssign t ( & w ) "" and "" RedundantRead t ( & w ) "" , which are automatically generated for each type t through a template-like approach . The former function performs a redundant write , the latter a redundant read plus majority voting . For voting , an approach similar to that in ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) is followed . What differs our tool from classical libraries for redundant data structures such as the one in ( Taylor et al. , 1980 ) is the fact that in our system the amount of replicas of our data structures changes dynamically with respect to the observed disturbances . A monitoring tool is assumed to be available to assess the probability of memory corruptions of the current environment . An example of such monitoring tool , which estimates that probability by measuring for each call to "" RedundantRead t "" the risk of failure r , is provided . Quantity r may be defined for instance as follows : If our current redundancy is 2n + 1 , and if the maximum set of agreeing replicas after a "" RedundantRead t "" is m ( 0 < m < 2n + 2 ) , then ( 1 ) For instance if redundancy is 7 and m = 6 , that is if only one replica differs , then r = 1 / 3 . Clearly the above choice of r lets risk increase linearly with the number of replicas not in agreement with the majority . Other formulations for r and for the monitoring tool7 are possible and likely to be more effective than the ones taken here – also a matter for future research . Our strategy to adjust redundancy is also quite simple : If r > 0.5 , redundancy is increased by 2 ; if r = 0 for 1000 consecutive calls to "" RedundantRead t "" , redundancy is decreased by 2 . Lower bound and upper bound for redundancy have been set to 3 and 11 respectively . Each request for changing redundancy is reflected by the "" Server "" thread into variable "" Redundance "" through the scheme introduced in ( De Florio & Blondia , 2007 ) . In Chapter 10 it is described how our tool behaves when memory faults are injected . It us shown how , despite the above naı ̈ ve design choices , our tool already depicts valuable results . 4.2 Conclusions As already pointed out , redundancy is a key asset to achieve fault-tolerance . The Shannon theorem teaches us that through any unreliable channel it is possible to send data reliably by using a proper degree of redundancy . This famous result can be read out in a different way : For each degree of unreliability characterizing a run-time environment there is a minimum level of redundancy that can be used to tolerate any fault . Unfortunately environments change , e.g. because of external events , or because assets dissipate , or because the service is mobile . Hence , there is no static allocation of redundancy that can accommodate for any possible scenario : A highly redundant system will withstand no more faults than those considered at design time , and will allocate a large amount of resources even when no faults are threatening the service . Denying this truth is not a wise choice : As Einstein said , the rule should be "" Make everything as simple as possible , but not simpler "" . Likewise , hiding complexity is good , but hiding too much can lead to disasters – history of computing is paved with dreadful examples unfortunately . The main lesson learned by carrying out our research is that this problem must be addressed , and that this complexity must not be neglected , but isolated into architectural components . This section introduced a translation-based approach that has precisely these design goals – addressing the problem of complex fault behaviors and providing an architectural solution that make it as simple as possible for the designer to concentrate on their functional design goals . Our tool provides programmers of commodity languages such as C or Java with adaptively redundant data structures . Designers using our tool can define redundant data structures in which the degree of replication is not fixed once and for all at design time , but changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . In Chapter 10 the performance of our tool is reported . Such analysis is carried out through a fault injector called scrambler , which is also briefly introduced . Redundant variables are a recent research project of our group at the University of Antwerp . Future work will be devoted to further developing and enhancing both those tools , e.g. by experimenting with other adaptation strategies , other replica allocation strategies , and introducing more complex fault injection scenarios such as single event effects . The global effect of adaptive dependable provisions on power consumption shall also be investigated in the near future . 5 CONCLUSIONS Focus of this chapter has been approaches that reach fault-tolerance by means of compilers and translators . Such tools are not only used to bring "" syntactic sugar "" and possibly enhance sa and sc : It was shown how compilers can become another important "" place "" where one may place application-level fault-tolerant protocols that operate at the level of the programming language through so-called meta-object protocols . The reader is also provided of what we consider to be a glimpse into the future of our discipline : As cleverly stated by Torres-Pomales , "" we use computer languages to try to capture the essence of software , but the concepts are so intricate that they generally defy attempts to completely visualize them in a practical manner and require the use of techniques to simplify relationships and enable communication among designers . "" ( Torres-Pomales , 2000 ) This is exactly the starting point of the approaches based on introspection . It is our belief that such approaches , combined with knowledge management , semantic processing , and service orientation , may provide us with an important tool to deal effectively with software complexity .

Also in this case a significant part of the complexity of dependability enforcement is moved from each single code to the architecture , in this case the programming language . Many cases exist of fault-tolerance programming languages ; this chapter proposes a few of them , considering three cases : Object-oriented languages , functional languages , and hybrid languages . In particular it is discussed the case of Oz , a multi-paradigm programming language that achieves both transparent distribution and translucent failure handling . 2 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING CUSTOM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES Another approach is given by working at language level enhancing a pre-existing programming language or developing an ad hoc distributed programming language so that it hosts specific fault-tolerance provisions . The following two sections cover these topics . 2.1 2.1.1 Object-oriented approaches The Arjuna Distributed Programming System Arjuna ( Arjuna Technologies , ltd . ) is an object-oriented system for portable distributed programming in C ++ ( Shrivastava , 1995 ) . It can be considered as a clever blending of useful and widespread tools , techniques , and ideas – as such , it is a good example of the evolutionary approach towards application-level software fault-tolerance . It exploits remote procedure calls ( Birrell & Nelson , 1984 ) and UNIX daemons ( Haviland & Salama , 1987 ) . On each node of the system an object server connects client objects to objects supplying services . The object server also takes care of spawning objects when they are not yet running ( in this case they are referred to as "" passive objects "" ) . Arjuna also exploits a "" naming service "" , by means of which client objects request a service "" by name "" . This transparency effectively supports object migration and replication . Arjuna offers the programmer means for dealing with atomic actions ( via the two-phase commit protocol ) and persistent objects . Unfortunately , it requires the programmers to explicitly deal with tools to save and restore the state , to manage locks , and to declare in their applications instances of the class for managing atomic actions . As its authors state , in many respects Arjuna asks the programmer to be aware of several complexities – as such , it is prejudicial to transparency and separation of design concerns ( insufficient sc ) . On the other hand , its good design choices result in an effective , portable environment . Arjuna provides the programmer with "" a computation model in which application programs manipulate persistent objects under the control of atomic actions "" ( Shrivastava , 1995 ) . This concise definition reflects the opinions of many fault-tolerance language designers , that is , that coupling the object and atomic action model with object persistency provides a good solution to designing fault-tolerant systems . In Arjuna a failure appears to the programmer as a persistent object becoming unavailable . Actual reasons for this event may be e.g. a crash of the object repository , or a network partitioning . Accordingly , avoiding failures in Arjuna is achieved by any method directed to increasing the availability of its objects . The main approach used for this in Arjuna is object replication . Like in any replication scheme , clearly this calls for consistency protocols among the replicas . As mentioned above , Arjuna uses an object server to turn passive objects into active ones , when a reference to any such object is detected in the system . Binding is the name of the operation that creates a local instance of any valid Arjuna object and creates one such reference . The object server then attaches the latest ( committed ) state of the named object to the local instance . An example ( from the cited reference ) follows : { / * scope of o1 , o2 and act is between the C ++ block ( "" automatic variables "" ) * / MyArjunaObject o1 ( Name-A ) ; / * o1 is bound to object whose global name is "" A "" * / MySecondArjunaObject o2 ( Name-B ) ; / * o2 to "" B "" * / AtomicAction act ; / * o1 and o2 will be used in atomic action act * / act . Begin ( ) ; / * act starts * / o1 . method1 ( ... ) ; o2 . method1 ( ... ) ; / * invocations , possibly changing state of o1 and o2 * o2 . method2 ( ... ) ; ....... act . End ( ) ; / * act commits : if successful , "" A "" and "" B "" get updated } / * o1 and o2 are deallocated , which breaks bindings to A and B * / As it is often the case for ALFT based on programming languages , Arjuna builds on top of a few design axioms that determine its effectiveness but also limit its general usability . Hence sa is assessed as "" average "" . No support for adaptivity exists , though transparency replication could have been exploited to reach a better a ( limited / potentially good ) . 2.1.2 Programming languages based on Compositional Filters Composition Filters ( CF ) are a concept developed and explored at the University of Twente , The Netherlands . Originally CF were embedded into a custom programming language called Sina . Later the concept was enucleated from Sina and made available as extensions to existing languages such as C ++ ( Glandrup , 1995 ) or Java ( Wichman , 1999 ) . The latter reference provides a very nice and clear metaphor explaining what CF are . In what follows the main reference is ( Wichman , 1999 ) and the Java implementation of composition filters , ComposeJ . Composition filters allow extending the object oriented model with the possibility to model concerns such as coordinated behavior , dynamic inheritance , delegation and multiple interfaces / views in a reusable , extensible and adaptable way . The main idea is that of introducing input and output filters , i.e. components that intercept and manipulate message transmission and reception . An input filter set filters incoming messages and an output filter set filters outgoing messages . Filters in a filter set orderly evaluate and possibly manipulate the messages before passing them to the target object . All messages sent to the object have to pass its input filter set . All messages sent by the object have to pass its output filter set . A special object ( the filter object ) provides the filters as its methods , which are not publicly available to the filtered object . Filter set are like a block of selection statements : An ordered cascade of conditions , each of which checks whether the incoming message belongs or not to some category . If so , the message is intercepted ( "" accepted "" , in the CF lingo ) and processed . As a consequence of this processing , the message may change . Then the message is passed to the next filter in the set and this goes on until the last filter in the set is encountered . A message that is not accepted by the last filter raises an exception . Clearly this procedure can be added to any hosting language , as it is a procedural addition that has no impact on the language grammar . The input and output filter set are declared within a class through the inputfilters and outputfilters keywords , for instance , inputfilters filter1 : Error = .. ( will be explained shortly ) filter2 : Dispatch = ( will be explained shortly ) The general structure of a filter element is FilterName : FilterType = Conditions ConclusionOperator MatchingPattern Parameters "" Conditions "" is a Boolean that rejects the message when false . If true , the second and the third sections come into play : if "" ConclusionOperator "" is an inclusion , represented by ' = > ' , then one accepts all messages that verify the matching pattern ; if it is an exclusion , represented by ' ~ > ' , then one accepts all message that did not verify a previous inclusion operator . "" Parameters "" is an optional section that depends on the filter being used . If a message is accepted , the filter 's accept handler is executed , otherwise the next filter element is evaluated . If there are no more elements left in the current filter , the filter's reject handler is executed . Filters belong to different types : • Dispatch : any accepted message is delegated to one or more objects ; rejected messages go to the next filter in the set . • Error : any accepted message does to next filter ; rejected ones raise an exception . • Substitution : the accepted message is substituted with another one as specified in section "" Parameters "" ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Send : accepted messages are passed to any object ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Meta : any accepted message is reified and delegated to a "" meta-object "" ( that is , an object describing and monitoring the behavior of another object ) ; rejected messages go to the next filter . • Wait : accepted messages go to the next filter , while rejected ones are blocked until a certain condition is met – which is clearly useful for concurrency control and synchronization . For the sake of brevity these filters shall not be discussed in detail , but it is clear that they have the potential to compose powerful fault-tolerance mechanisms based , e.g. , on replication and reflection . As an example , a Dispatch input filter could be used to redirect an input message to several replicas , while a Substitution or a Meta filter could be used to do voting among the output objects produced by the replicas ; a Wait filter could make sure that all replicas synchronize , and so forth . Composition Filters and Aspect Oriented Programming ( described in Chapter 7 ) have many points in common , as they represent two paths towards reaching similar goals , e.g. , separation of concerns . The main difference between the two approaches is in the fact that Composition Filters work on a per object basis , while AOP languages provide a system-wide ( application-wide ) specification which is integrated with the class hierarchies by means of a pre-processor ( the aspect weaver , see Chapter 7 ) . Composition Filters provide "" by construction "" , so to say , excellent sc . As it is often the case in this category of fault-tolerance provisions , sa is limited to those fault-tolerance techniques that can be expressed in terms of composition filters ( average sa ) . All CF implementations we are aware of work at compile-time , which impacts negatively on a . 2.1.3 FT-SR FT-SR ( Schlichting & Thomas , 1995 ) is basically an attempt to augment the SR ( Andrews & Olsson , 1993 ) distributed programming language with mechanisms to facilitate fault-tolerance . FT-SR is based on the concept of fail-stop modules ( FSM ) . A FSM is defined as an abstract unit of encapsulation . It consists of a number of threads that export a number of operations to other FSMs . The execution of operations is atomic . FSM can be composed so to give rise to complex FSMs . For instance it is possible to replicate a module n > 1 times and set up a complex FSM that can survive to n − 1 failures . Whenever a failure exhausts the redundancy of a FSM , be that a simple or complex FSM , a failure notification is automatically sent to a number of other FSMs so to trigger proper recovery actions . This feature explains the name of FSM : as in fail-stop processors , either the system is correct or a notification is sent and the system stops its functions . This means that the computing model of FT-SR guarantees , to some extent , that in the absence of explicit failure notification , commands can be assumed to have been processed correctly . This greatly simplifies program development because it masks the occurrence of faults , offers guarantees that no erroneous results are produced , and encourages the design of complex , possibly dynamic failure semantics ( see Chapter 1 ) based on failure notifications . Of course this strategy is fully effective only under the hypothesis of perfect failure detection coverage – an assumption that sometimes may be found to be false . FT-SR exloits much of the expressive power of SR to offer fault-tolerance to the programmer ; the only additions added by FT-SR are : • Automatic generation of failure notifications , when a resource is destroyed due to failure or explicit termination , and • so-called higher-level fail-stop atomic objects . Automatic generation of failure notifications . In FT-SR a failure is detected by the language runtime system . The focus herein is on the ways the application programmer instructs a notification . FT-SR offers so-called synchronous and asynchronous failure notifications : • Synchronous notification is one that is attached to a method's invocation and specifies a backup method to be executed as soon as the primary has been detected as failed . This is done very simply from the point of view of the programmer : He or she has just to add the identifier of the backup method , as in call { task1 . primary , task2 . backup } . • Asynchronous failure notifications are used when one wants to make sure that , whenever a certain condition takes place during a certain time interval , a given "" alarm "" or reactive measure will be instructed . This is specified by issuing the monitor statement , as in monitor task1 send task2 ( arguments ) , after which the FT-SR run-time executive starts monitoring task1 with task2 ( arguments ) as reactive measure . This mean that , in case task1 fails during monitoring , method task2 ( arguments ) is implicitly invoked with the current value of its arguments . Higher-level fail-stop atomic objects . FT-SR makes use of replication and error recovery techniques to build more complex fault-tolerance mechanisms ( Schlichting & Thomas , 1992 ) . Replication is used to create a group of replicated resources that appear to the user as a single , more resilient or more performant resource . A similar concept has been adopted in Ariel for tasks ( see Chapter 6 ) . Replication is available to the FT-SR programmer through the create statement – an augmented version of the SR statement with the same name . As an example , task1_cap : = create ( i : = 1 to N ) task2 ( ) on remote_node_caps [ i ] creates a replicated task consisting of N replicas of task2 , with replica i to be executed on the processing node specified in remote_node_caps [ i ] . Once the replicated task is created , all operations to that task are managed accordingly : Sending messages becomes a multicast and the same applies for invoking methods . The system guarantees consistent total order , but the programmer can choose otherwise . Sending is managed through atomic broadcast . When performing a call to a method in a replicated task , it is the run-time system that makes sure that only a single result is returned to the caller . No voting is done by the run-time system in this case : the failure semantic assumptions of fail-silent processes allows the system to just return the first result becoming available . Another important feature offered by FT-SR is restartability – the ability to instruct the automatic restart of a failed entity in a healthier location of the system's . The syntax for doing so is very simple : restart entity on somewhere_else . The entity may be replicated , in which case the programmer can make use of a syntax similar to that of create : restart ( i : = 1 to N ) task2 ( ) on remote_node_caps [ i ] . Restarted FT-SR entities are not ... restarted from scratch : they retain their state – a useful property which is not available , e.g. , with the RESTART recovery code of Ariel ( again , see Chapter 6 for more details on Ariel ) . Finally , FT-SR offers persistency ( also called "" implicit restart "" by its authors ) : any entity tagged with the persistent attribute when declared is automatically restarted on any of a certain number of backup nodes ( "" backup virtual machines "" in FT-SR lingo ) . This allows to compose easily a stable storage resource , which in turn is an important requirement to build even more complex and advanced fault-tolerance protocols . FT-SR places fault-tolerance in the foreground of system design , which translates in bad sc . It offers several constructs , with sufficient sa . No support for a is part of the language . 2.1.4 ARGUS Argus ( Liskov , 1988 ) is a distributed object-oriented programming language and operating system . Argus was designed to support application programs like banking systems . To capture the object-oriented nature of such programs , it provides a special kind of objects , called guardians , which perform user-definable actions in response to remote requests . To solve the problems of concurrency and failures , Argus allows computations to run as atomic transactions . Argus' target application domain is clearly the one of transaction processing . Like in Arjuna , Argus builds on top of a few fault-tolerance design axioms , which limits Argus' sa . Explicit , non-transparent support translates in insufficient sc . No support for adaptivity has been foreseen in Argus . 2.1.5 The Correlate Language The Correlate object-oriented language ( Robben , 1999 ) adopts the concept of active object , defined as an object that has control over the synchronization of incoming requests from other objects . Objects are active in the sense that they do not process immediately their requests – they may decide to delay a request until it is accepted , i.e. , until a given precondition ( a guard ) is met – for instance , a mailbox object may refuse a new message in its buffer until an entry becomes available in it . The precondition is a function of the state of the object and the invocation parameters – it does not imply interaction with other objects and has no side effects . If a request can not be served according to an object's precondition , it is saved into a buffer until it becomes servable , or until the object is destroyed . Conditions like an overflow in the request buffer are not dealt with in ( Robben , 1999 ) . If more than a single request becomes servable by an object , the choice is made non-deterministically . Correlate uses a communication model called "" pattern-based group communication "" – communication goes from an "" advertising object "" to those objects that declare their "" interest "" in the advertised subject . This is similar to Linda's model of generative communication , introduced in Chapter 4 . Objects in Correlate are autonomous , in the sense that they may not only react to external stimuli but also give rise to autonomous operations motivated by an internal "" goal "" . When invoking a method , the programmer can choose to block until the method is fully executed ( this is called synchronous interaction ) , or to execute it "" in the background "" ( asynchronous interaction ) . Correlate supports meta-object protocols . It has been effectively used to offer transparent support for transaction , replication , and checkpoint-and-rollback . The first implementation of Correlate consists of a translator to plain Java plus an execution environment , also written in Java . Correlate bears several similarities with Composition Filters and reaches the same values of the structural attributes . 2.1.6 Fragmented Objects Fragmented Objects ( FO ) are an extension of objects for distributed environments ( Makpangou , Gourhant , Narzul , & Shapiro , 1994 ) . FO do not reside integrally in one processing node , but are decomposed into chunks called "" fragments "" , consisting of data and methods , which may reside on different nodes . The logics for the distribution of fragments is part of the objects themselves . The client of a FO must have access to at least one fragment . FO offer an abstract view and a concrete view : In the abstract view they appear as a single , shared object . In the concrete view , the designer can decompose the objects into fragments and can deploy them on different machines . He or she may also control the communications among fragments . All these aspects are specified through a custom programming language , FOG ( an extension of C ++ ) , a toolbox , and a compiler also responsible for object serialization . The key aspect of FO with respect to dependability is the full transparency that they provide their users with : In particular there is no way to distinguish between a local object and a local fragment . This paves the way to the transparent adoption of dependability methods based on replication and reconfiguration ( Reiser , Kapitza , Domaschka , & Hauck , 2006 ) . In particular the amount of redundancy used could be made adaptively tracking the current disturbances – with an approach similar to the redundant variables described in Chapter 4 . This translates in potentially good a . Also sc is good in FO , due to the ingenious separation between abstract and concrete views . sa appears to be somewhat limited due to specifics of the approach . The interest around FO has never abated – examples include the adaptive fragmented objects of FORMI ( Kapitza , Domaschka , Hauck , Reiser , & Schmidt , 2006 ) . 2.2 2.2.1 Functional Languages Fault-Tolerance Attribute Grammars The system models for application-level software fault-tolerance encountered so far all have their basis in an imperative language . A different research trend exists , which is based on the use of functional languages . This choice translates in a program structure that allows a straightforward inclusion of fault-tolerance means , with high degrees of transparency and flexibility . Functional models that appear particularly interesting as system structures for software fault-tolerance are those based on the concept of attribute grammars ( Paakki , 1995 ) . This paragraph briefly introduces the model known as FTAG ( fault-tolerant attribute grammars ) ( Suzuki , Katayama , & Schlichting , 1996 ) , which offers the designer a large set of fault-tolerance mechanisms . A noteworthy aspect of FTAG is that its authors explicitly address the problem of providing a syntactical model for the widest possible set of fault-tolerance provisions and paradigms , developing coherent abstractions of those mechanisms while maintaining the linguistic integrity of the adopted notation . This means that optimizing the value of attribute sa is one of the design goals of FTAG . FTAG regards a computation as a collection of pure mathematical functions known as modules . Each module has a set of input values , called inherited attributes , and of output variables , called synthesized attributes . Modules may refer to other modules . When modules do not refer any other module , they can be performed immediately . Such modules are called primitive modules . On the other hand , non-primitive modules require other modules to be performed first – as a consequence , an FTAG program is executed by decomposing a "" root "" module into its basic submodules and then applying recursively this decomposition process to each of the submodules . This process goes on until all primitive modules are encountered and executed . The execution graph is clearly a tree called computation tree . This scheme presents many benefits , e.g. , as the order in which modules are decomposed is exclusively determined by attribute dependencies among submodules , a computation tree can be mapped onto a parallel processing means straightforwardly . The linguistic structure of FTAG allows the integration of a number of useful fault-tolerance features that address the whole range of faults – design , physical , and interaction faults . One of these features is called redoing . Redoing replaces a portion of the computation tree with a new computation . This is useful for instance to eliminate the effects of a portion of the computation tree that has generated an incorrect result , or whose executor has crashed . It can be used to implement easily "" retry blocks "" and recovery blocks by adding ancillary modules that test whether the original module behaved consistently with its specification and , if not , give rise to a "" redoing "" , a recursive call to the original module . Another relevant feature of FTAG is its support for replication , a concept that in FTAG translates into a decomposition of a module into N identical submodules implementing the function to replicate . The scheme is known as replicated decomposition , while involved submodules are called replicas . Replicas are executed according to the usual rules of decomposition , though only one of the generated results is used as the output of the original module . Depending on the chosen fault-tolerance strategy , this output can be , e.g. , the first valid output or the output of a demultiplexing function , e.g. , a voter . It is worth remarking that no syntactical changes are needed , only a subtle extension of the interpretation so to allow the involved submodules to have the same set of inherited attributes and to generate a collated set of synthesized attributes . FTAG stores its attributes in a stable object base or in primary memory depending on their criticality – critical attributes can then be transparently retrieved from the stable object base after a failure . Object versioning is also used , a concept that facilitates the development of checkpoint-and-rollback strategies . FTAG provides a unified linguistic structure that effectively supports the development of fault-tolerant software . Conscious of the importance of supporting the widest possible set of fault-tolerance means , its authors report in the cited paper how they are investigating the inclusion of other fault-tolerance features and trying to synthesize new expressive syntactical structures for FTAG – thus further improving attribute sa . FTAG also exhibits "" by construction "" a good separation of concerns ( sc ) . No support for a is known to exist for FTAG . Unfortunately , the widespread adoption of this valuable tool is conditioned by the limited acceptance and spread of the functional programming paradigm outside the academia . 2.3 A Hybrid Case : Oz Oz is defined by its authors as "" a multiparadigm programming language "" . The main reasons for that is that Oz offers , by construction , several features common to programming paradigms such as logic , functional , imperative , and object-oriented programming . Another important feature of Oz is that it provides the programmer with a network-transparent distributed programming model that facilitates considerably the development of distributed fault-tolerant applications . The Oz programming system , called Mozart , was designed by the so-called Mozart Consortium . Thanks to its rich model , Oz allows to solve , to some extent , the transparency conundrum of distributed computing : Indeed distributed computing approaches either choose to mask all complexity providing an illusion of a fully synchronous system where all failures and disruptions are masked , or go for a fully translucent system where everything is made known and reflected onto the system controller . Oz solves this and shows that "" network transparency is not incompatible with entity failure reflection "" ( Collet & Mejı ́ as , 2007 ) . The idea is that the language gives the illusion of a single memory space shared by distributed processing nodes called sites . Full transparency is achieved for this : It is simply not possible to tell whether a method or an entity is local or distributed . But this is not true for all aspects of distribution – in particular , site crashes and partial failures are made translucent and reflected in the language . The mechanism offered by Oz to handle partial failures is asynchronous failure detectors , managed through failure listeners : All entities produce streams of events that reflect the sequential occurrence of their fault states . Any Oz task can become a failure listener , that is , it can hook to such streams and be informed of all the faults experienced by any other tasks . This means that fault detection is intrinsically managed by Oz and Mozart . Error recovery can then be managed by guarded actions , a little like in ariel , the error recovery language described in next chapter . This facilitates considerably the development of asynchronous failure detectors with one of the algorithms described in Chapter 8 . The trade off between transparency and translucency in Oz leads to a satisfactory sc . Its multiparadigmic nature should translate in a good score for sa , though no concrete evidence to this appears to exist . Oz has been used to express adaptive control loops ( Van Roy , 2006 ) for self-management , so it proved to exhibit good a . 3 CONCLUSION Several examples of fault-tolerance protocols embedded in custom programming languages have been shown . This class of methods can achieve satisfactory degrees of sc . The language designer has the widest syntactic freedom which is necessary to achieve good values of sa , but often , as a result of the design choices , the programmer is confined to a limited amount of possibilities . Attribute a depends on specific characteristics of the language , e.g. being able to select dynamically the error recovery strategy when the environment and its faults change . Most of the programming languages discussed so far is not being supported anymore , a noteworthy exception being Oz , whose most widespread platform , Mozart , is a strategic research path at the University of Louvain-la-neuve , Belgium . Next chapter is devoted to a special case of a fault-tolerance programming language : The ariel error recovery language . References Andrews , G. R. , & Olsson , L. L. ( 1993 ) .

It is also described an approach towards resilient computing based on ariel and therefore dubbed the "" recovery language approach "" ( RεL ) . In this chapter first the main elements of RεL are introduced in general terms , coupling each concept to the technical foundations behind it . After this a quite extensive description of ariel and of a compliant architecture are provided . Target applications for such architecture are distributed codes , characterized by non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language such as C , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a predefined ( fixed ) set of processing nodes . Reason for giving special emphasis to ariel and its approach is not in their special qualities but more on the fact that , due to the first-hand experience of the author , who conceived , designed and implemented ariel in the course of his studies , it was possible for him to provide the reader with what may be considered as a sort of practical exercise in system and fault modeling and in application-level fault-tolerance design , recalling and applying several of the concepts introduced in previous chapters . 2 THE ARIEL RECOVERY LANGUAGE This section casts the basis of a general approach in abstract terms , while a particular instance of the herein presented concepts is described in Section 3 as a prototypic distributed architecture supporting a fault-tolerance linguistic structure for application-level fault-tolerance . System and fault models are drawn . The approach is also reviewed with respect to the structural attributes ( sc , sa and a ) and to the approaches presented in Chapter 3 , 5 , and 6 . The structure of this section is as follows : • Models are introduced in Sect . 2.1 . • Key ideas , concepts , and technical foundations are described in Sect . 2.2 . • Section 2.4 shows the workflow corresponding to using RεL . • Sect . 2.5 summarizes the positive values of the structural attributes sa , sc , and a for RεL . 2.1 System and Fault Models This section introduces the system and fault models that will be assumed in the rest of this chapter . 2.1.1 System Assumptions In the following , the target system is assumed to be a distributed or parallel system . Basic components are nodes , tasks , and the network . • A node can be , e.g. , a workstation in a networked cluster or a processor in a MIMD parallel computer . • Tasks are independent threads of execution running on the nodes . • The network system allows tasks on different nodes to communicate with each other . Nodes can be commercial-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) hardware components with no special provisions for hardware fault-tolerance . It is not mandatory to have memory management units and secondary storage devices . A general-purpose operating system is required on each node . No special purpose , distributed , or fault-tolerant operating system is required . The number N of nodes is assumed to be known at compile time . Nodes are addressable by the integers in { 0 , ... , N − 1 } . For any integer m > 0 let us call the set of integers { 0 , ... , m − 1 } as Im . Let us furthermore refer to the node addressed by integer i as ni , i in IN . Tasks are pre-defined at compile-time : in particular for each i in IN , it is known that node ni is to run ti tasks , up to a given node-specific limit . No special constraints are posed on the task scheduling policy . On each node , say node i , tasks are identified by user-defined unique local labels – integers greater than or equal to zero . Let us call Ini the set of labels for tasks to be run on node ni , i in IN . The task with local label j on node i will be also referred to as ni [ j ] . The system obeys the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) already introduced in Chapter 2 . As already mentioned , such model allows a straightforward modeling of system partitioning – as a consequence of sufficiently many omission or performance communication failures , correct nodes may be temporarily disconnected from the rest of the system during so-called "" periods of instability "" ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) . Moreover it is assumed that , at reset , tasks or nodes restart from a well-defined , initial state – partial-amnesia crashes ( defined in Chapter 1 ) are not considered . A message passing library is assumed to be available , built on the datagram service . Such library offers asynchronous , non-blocking multicast primitives . The adoption of a library like ISIS ( see Chapter 3 ) is suggested , in order to inherit the benefits of its reliable multicast primitives . As clearly explained in ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , the above hypotheses match well to nowadays distributed systems based on networked workstations – as such , they represent a general model with no practical restriction . The following assumptions characterize the user application : 1 . ( When N > 1 nodes are available ) : the target application is distributed on the system nodes . 2 . It is written or is to be written in a procedural language such as , e.g. , C or C ++ . 3 . The service specification includes non-safety-critical dependability goals – safety-critical systems may also be addressed , but in this case the crash failure semantics assumption must be supported with a very high coverage ( Mortensen , 2000 ) This would require : • Extensive self-checking ( by means of , e.g. , signature checking , arithmetic coding , control flow monitoring , or dual processors ) . • Statistical estimation of the achieved coverage , by means of proper fault injection . 4 . Inter-process communication takes place by means of the functions in the above mentioned message passing library . Higher-level communication services , if available , must be built atop that message passing library too . The reason behind the third assumption is that , forcing communication through a single virtual provision , namely the functions for sending and for receiving messages , allows a straightforward implementation of mechanisms for task isolation . This concept is explained in more detail in Sect . 3.2.9 . 2.1.2 Fault Model As suggested in Chapter 2 , any effective design including dependability goals requires provisions , located at all levels , to avoid , remove , or tolerate faults . Hence , as an application-level structure , RεL is complementary to other approaches addressing fault-tolerance at system level , i.e. , hardware-level and OS-level fault-tolerance . In particular , a system-level architecture such as GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , that is based on redundancy and hardware and operating system provisions for systematic management of consensus , appears to be particularly appropriate for being coupled with RεL , which offers application-level provisions for NVP and replication ( see later on ) . The main classes of faults addressed by RεL are those of accidental , permanent or temporary design faults , and temporary , external , physical faults . Both value and timing failures are considered . The architecture addresses one fault at a time : The system is ready to deal with new faults only after having recovered from the present one . 2.2 Key Ideas and Technical Foundations The design of RεL tries to capture , by construction , some of the positive aspects of most of the approaches so far surveyed . Some of the key design choices of RεL are : • The adoption of a fault-tolerance toolset . • The separation of the configuration of the toolset from the specification of the functional service . • The separation of the system structure for the specification of the functional service from that for error recovery and reconfiguration . These concepts and their technical foundations are illustrated in the rest of this section . 2.3 Adoption of a Fault-Tolerance Toolset A requirement of RεL is the availability of a fault-tolerance toolset , to be interpreted herein as the conjoint adoption of : • A set of fault-tolerance tools addressing error detection , localisation , containment and recovery , such as the ones in SwIFT ( Huang , Kintala , Bernstein , & Wang , 1996 ) or EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ; Deconinck , Varvarigou , et al. , 1997 ) . As seen in detail in Chapter 3 , fault-tolerance services provided by the toolset include , e.g. , watchdog timers and voting . Such tools are called basic tools ( BT ) in what follows . • A "" basic services library "" ( BSL ) is assumed to be present , providing functions for : – intra-node and remote communication ; – task management ; – access to the local clock ; – application-level assertions ; – functions to reboot or shut down a node . This library is required to be available in source code so that it can be instrumented , e.g. , with code to forward information transparently to some collector ( described in what follows ) . Information may include , for instance , the notification of a successful task creation or any failure of this kind . This allows to create fault streams as in Oz ( Chapter 5 ) . If supported , meta-object protocols ( see Chapter 4 ) may also be used to implement the library and its instrumentation . It is also suggested that the functions for sending messages work with opaque objects that reference either single tasks or groups of tasks . In the first case , the function would perform a plain "" send "" , while in the second case it would perform a multicast . This would increase the degree of transparency . • A distributed component serving as a sort of backbone controlling and monitoring the toolset and the user application . Let us call this application "" the Backbone "" . It is assumed that the Backbone has a component on each node of the system and that , through some software ( and , possibly , hardware ) fault-tolerance provisions , it can tolerate crash failures of up to all but one node or component . An application such as the EFTOS DIR net discussed in Chapter 3 may be used for this . Notifications from the BSL and from the BT are assumed to be collected and maintained by the Backbone into a data structure called "" the database "" ( DB ) . The DB therefore holds data related to the current structure and state of the system , the user application , and the Backbone . A special section of the DB is devoted to keeping track of error notifications , such as , for instance , "" divide-by-zero exception caught while executing task 11 "" sent by a trap handling tool like the one discussed in Chapter 3 . If possible , error detection support at hardware or kernel level may be also instrumented in order to provide the Backbone with similar notifications . The DB is assumed to be stored in a reliable storage device , e.g. , a stable storage device , or replicated and protected against corruption or other unwanted modifications . • Following the hypothesis of the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , a time-out management system is also assumed to be available . This allows an application to define time-outs , namely , to schedule an event to be generated a given amount of "" clock ticks "" in the future ( Cristian & Schmuck , 1995 ) . Let us call this component the "" time-out manager "" ( tom ) . A prototype of a RεL-compliant toolset has been developed within the European ESPRIT project "" TIRAN "" . Section 3.2 describes its main components . 2.3.1 Configuration Support Tool The second key component of RεL is a tool to support fault-tolerance configuration , defined herein as the deployment of customized instances of fault-tolerance tools and strategies . RεL envisages a translator to help the user configure the toolset and his / her application . The translator has to support a custom configuration language especially conceived to facilitate configuration and therefore to reduce the probability of fault-tolerance design faults – the main cause of failure for fault-tolerant software systems ( Laprie , 1998 ; Lyu , 1998 ) . As an output , the translator could issue , e.g. , C or C ++ header files defining configured objects and symbolic constants to refer easily to the configured objects . Recompilation of the target application is therefore required after each execution of the translator . Configuration can group a number of activities , including : • Configuration of system and application entities , • configuration of the basic tools , • configuration of replicated tasks , • configuration for retry blocks , • configuration for multiple-version software fault-tolerance . The above configuration activities are now briefly described . 2.3.2 Configuration of System and Application Entities One of the tasks of a configuration language is to declare the key entities of the system and to define a global naming scheme in order to refer to them . Key entities are nodes , tasks , and groups of tasks . For each node ni , 0 < = i < N and for each task ni [ j ] , 0 < = j < Ini , a unique , global-scope identifier must be defined by the user . Let us call this identifier the task's unique-id . This can be done by editing a configuration script with rules of the form taskt = ni [ j ] , ( 1 ) which assigns unique-id t to ni [ j ] , that is , task number j on node i . Similarly one could define groups of task with rules of the form groupg = { u } , ( 2 ) where u is a list of comma-separated integers representing unique-ids . Such rule defines then a group named g and made of the tasks corresponding to the mentioned unique-ids . The translator would then turn a configuration script containing rules of this kind into a header file to be compiled with the target application and , if necessary , in configuration files expected by the toolset . 2.3.3 Configuration of the Fault-Tolerance Tools in the Toolset Specific instances of the tools in the toolset can be statically configured by means of the translator . For instance , in the case of a watchdog timer , configuration can specify : • The unique-id of the watching task as well as that of the watched task . • The initial expected frequency of "" heartbeats "" to be sent from the watched task to the watchdog . • The actions to be taken when an expected heartbeat is not received in time , and so forth . As an example , a watchdog timer may be configured in high level terms as follows : WATCHDOG TASK 10 WATCHES TASK 14 HEARTBEATS EVERY 100 MS ON ERROR WARN TASK 18 END WATCHDOG Ideally , the output of the translator should be a configuration file for the BSL to associate transparently the creation of the configured instance of the watchdog to the creation of the watched task . Doing like this , the only non-functional code to be intruded in the watched task can be the function call corresponding to sending the heartbeat to the watchdog . A generic "" HEARTBEAT "" method , with no arguments , can be used . This can be a symbolic name properly defined in a header file written by the translator and automatically included when compiling the user application . Even when instrumenting is not possible , the watched task can start the watchdog by means of a symbolic name properly defined in the above mentioned header file . This kind of translations can be applied to most of the tools of a library such as SwIFT or EFTOS that have been described in Chapter 3 . Note how the minimal or absent code intrusion provides an optimal sc . The adoption of a custom , ad hoc language for the expression of the configuration concerns can be used to reach high values for sa and compile-time a . Configuration of Replicated Tasks . The translator and the BSL may be used to implement replicated tasks , i.e. , multiple instances of the same task that perform like a more dependable entity . The goal of the translator is to mask this choice and any other fault-tolerance technicalities , including , in this specific case , replication . This can be obtained , e.g. , by solving separately the following sub-problems , both at syntactical and at semantic level : 1 . Replication and forwarding of the input value . 2 . Execution support of a fault-tolerance strategy . 3 . Output management . Problem 1 can be solved by defining a group-of-tasks object that , once passed to the BSL function for sending messages , triggers a multicast of the same message to the whole group , as suggested in Sect . 2.3.2 . Problem 2 can be solved in various ways – for instance , through a temporal redundancy scheme , executing the involved tasks one after the other , on the same node , or via spatial redundancy , executing tasks in parallel . Increased dependability may be obtained via a number of software techniques , implementing schemes such as active replication or primary-backup replication ( Guerraoui & Schiper , 1997 ) . As noticed in the cited paper , each scheme has both positive and negative aspects and requires solving specific problems . All these problems are low-level design issues that can be made transparent to the user of an RεL system . Other choices and options , e.g. , which type and degree of replication and which redundancy scheme to adopt , that would result in non-functional code intrusion , can be also made transparent to the user by means of the translator ( see Sect . 2.3.3 ) , hence increasing configurability . Problem 3 , depending on the adopted scheme , can be as simple as sending a message ( when in primary-backups mode ) or could require special processing . For instance , in the case of active replication , two sub-problems would call for specific treatment : 3.1 . Routing the outputs produced by the base tasks . 3.2 . De-multiplexing , i.e. , production of a unique output value from the values routed in sub-problem 3.1 . Sub-problem 3.1 can be solved , e.g. , by a proper combination of pipelining and redirection . Other approaches may be used when the OS does not support the above tools . De-multiplexing , i.e. , solution of sub-problem 3.2 , can be for instance the result of a voting procedure performed among the outputs produced by the base tasks . Also in this case , the availability of a translator and an appropriate syntax rule could guarantee an almost complete separation of design concerns . The configuration of a replicated task requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task globally representing a set of replicas . • The unique-ids of the replicas . • The replication method and its parameters . • The actions to be taken when an output is produced by the replicated task . • The actions to be taken when an error occurs . In the case of replicated tasks , the translator is also responsible for the set up of a proper run-time executive . The latter would then be responsible , at run-time , for the orchestration of the services required by the replicated tasks – task management , distributed voting , and so forth . Proper calls to the BSL and to instances of the basic tools may be used for this . A voting tool such as the EFTOS voting farm , described in Chapter 3 , appears to be a natural choice , as it addresses many of the required issues . It is worth noting how , also in this case , full transparency is reached : A client of a replicated task would have no way to tell whether its server be simple or replicated – possibly apart from some performance penalty and a higher quality of service . This translates into optimal sc . The same applies to sa and a for the reasons mentioned in Sect . 2.3.3 . Configuration for Retry Blocks . Transparent support for redoing ( see e.g. language FTAG in Chapter 5 ) – another important fault-tolerance provisions – can be provided via "" retry blocks "" . Again , a proper run-time executive is to be produced by the translator . The problems to be solved at this level include 1 . reversibility of a failed task and 2 . input replication . The first problem can be solved by implementing some "" recovery cache "" ( as in the recovery block technique described in Chapter 3 ) : That is a mechanism to checkpoint the state of the calling task before entering the retry block and to roll it back to its original value in case the acceptance test fails . This may be done transparently or with the intervention of the user . In the latter case , one restricts the size of the recovery cache and reduces the corresponding overheads , at the same time increasing the code intrusion . The second problem could be solved via an "" input cache "" , i.e. , a mechanism that : • Intercepts the original input message . • Stores the original message into some stable means . • And forwards the saved original message to each new retry instance . Transparent adoption of an input cache can also be realized , e.g. , by means of pipelining and redirection ( when the OS supports these ) . The configuration of a retry block requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task to be retried in case of errors . • An acceptance test , in the form of the name of a function returning a Boolean value or of a task that , upon termination , returns a Boolean value2 . • A threshold r representing the maximum number of retries . • The actions to be taken when the base task fails for r times in a row . Configuration for Multiple-Version Software Fault-Tolerance . Compile-time support towards multiple-version software fault-tolerance can be provided by the translator through syntax rules and techniques similar to those described for task replication . The configuration of a provision for MV requires the specification of : • The unique-id of a task representing the provision . • The unique-id 's of the tasks running the versions . • A set of thresholds representing time-outs on the execution of the version tasks3 . • The name of the user-specified function to be executed by each version task . • A method to de-multiplex the multiple outputs produced by the versions into a single output value . • Possible arguments to the de-multiplexing method . • The unique-id of a task to be notified each time an execution cycle is successfully completed . • The unique-id of a task to be notified each time an execution cycle fails . Support towards consensus recovery blocks ( Scott , Gault , & McAllister , 1985 ) may be provided in a similar way . Acceptance tests should be specified as described in Sect . 2.3.3 . An Example Scenario and Some Conclusions . A possible compile-time and run-time scenario is now described for the case of the configuration of multiple-version software fault-tolerance . This is done in order to provide the reader with a more concrete view of the kind of support supplied by a configuration language . It is assumed that the OS supports pipelining and stream redirection . It is also assumed that , by agreement , the user tasks that are going to be used as NVP versions forward a single output value onto the standard output stream . Finally , user tasks are assumed to be side effect-free . Once fed with a configuration script , the translator writes a number of source files for the tasks corresponding to the employed versions . Each of these source files , set up from some template file , specify how to : • Set up a configured instance of a distributed voting tool ( such as the EFTOS voting farm ) . • Redirect standard output streams . • Execute one of the version tasks . During the execution , when a client needs to access a service supplied by the provisions , it simply sends a request message to the corresponding task . The client does not need to know that the latter is actually an "" NVP task "" , that is , a group . Through the BSL , this sending turns into a multicast to the version tasks . These tasks , which in the meanwhile have transparently set up a distributing voting tool , • get their input , • compute some user-specified function , • produce an output , • and ( by the above agreement ) write that output into their standard output stream . This output , which was already redirected through a piped stream to the template task , is fed into the voting system . The latter eventually produces an output that , in case of success , is sent to some output task with the notification of successful completion of a processing cycle . Note that the client task of such an "" NVP task "" is completely unaware of the context in which it is running , with full transparency and separation of design concern . One can conclude that the adoption of a configuration strategy like the one just sketched can lead to an optimal sc . The variety of fault-tolerance provisions that can be supported by configuration and the adoption of a linguistic environment separated from the functional application layer can be exploited by programming language designers in order to attain optimal values for sa and a as well . 2.3.4 Recovery Languages Two of the three key concepts of RεL have been described , namely the adoption of a fault-tolerance toolset and that of a configuration language . This section now introduces the third component of RεL . This component supports two application layers , namely : • The functional application layer , i.e. , the one devoted to the fulfillment of the functional requirements and to the specification of an intended user service , supported by the run-time modules of conventional programming languages such as , e.g. , C or C ++ . • An ancillary application layer , specifically devoted to error processing and fault identification , to be switched in either asynchronously , when errors are detected in the system , or when the user synchronously signals particular run-time conditions , such as a failed assertion , or when the control flow runs into user-defined breakpoints . In the following the service language is the language constituting the front layer and recovery language the one related to error processing . Note how a recovery language can be specified in a separate script . The latter can then be translated into pseudo-code to be interpreted at run-time , or , e.g. , into plain C to be compiled with the user application . In the first case , the functional code and the recovery code are fully separated , also at run-time , which can be exploited to reach optimal a and to extend or reduce the set of faults to be tolerated . This feature could be used to realize the vision of a fault model structured as a dynamic system , F ( t ) , as described in Chapter 2 . The second case eliminates the overhead of interpreting the pseudo-code . The same translator used for fault-tolerance configuration may be used to generate the pseudo-code or the C source code . The general strategy is as follows : • During the lifetime of the application , in the absence of errors , the front layer controls the progress of the service supply while the Backbone collects and maintains in the DB the data concerning the state of each component of the application , the state of each node of the system , the state and progress of public and private resources , and so forth . • As soon as an error is detected by a basic tool , such as a watchdog timer , the latter transparently forwards a notification of this event to the Backbone , which awakes the ancillary layer by enabling a module to interpret or execute the recovery code . Let us call this module RINT , for recovery interpreter . A possible syntactical structure for the recovery language is that of a list of guarded actions , i.e. , statements in the form g : a , where g is a guard , i.e. , a Boolean expression on the contents of the DB , and a is one or more actions ( to be specified later on ) . Hence , adequate paradigms for the recovery language could be that of procedural or logic programming languages . The following two paragraphs describe guards and actions in more detail . Guards represent conditions that require recovery . As just said , they are Boolean expressions made of basic queries called atoms . Possible atoms may express conditions such as : • Task t has been detected as faulty . • Task t has been detected as faulty by error detection tool d . • For m times in a row , task t has been detected as faulty . • A time-out concerning task t has expired . • An N - version task has signaled that no full consensus has been reached , or in more detail : – For m times in a row , the same version , say task t ' , has been found in minority with respect to the other versions ; – for m times in a row , version t ' did not produce any output within its deadline ; – and so forth . • Node n is down , or , in more detail : – Node n has crashed ; – Node n is unreachable ; – No sign of life from node n in the last s seconds , as measured by the local clock ; – and so forth . • Task t could not be restarted ; • Some of the tasks in group g are faulty . and so forth . Most of the atoms in a Boolean clause will require a DB query or proper actions on DB fields – for instance , conditions such as "" task t is affected by a transient fault "" require the adoption , within the DB , of a thresholding statistical technique such as α-count ( Powell et al. , 1999 ; Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 1997 ) , which is capable of distinguishing between transient and permanent / intermittent faults . In particular , α-count ( described in Sect . 3.2.4 ) can be straightforwardly "" wired "" into the DB management system within the Backbone , because that mechanism is based on adjusting some counters according to the contents in a stream of error messages forwarded by a set of error detectors . Actions are local or remote commands to be executed when their guard is evaluated as true . Actions can specify , for instance , recovery or reconfiguration services . A special case of action can be also another guarded action – this allows to have nested guarded actions that can be represented as a tree . The execution of an inner guard is , again , its evaluation . When a parent guard is evaluated as false , all its actions are skipped , including its child guards . Actions can include , for instance : • Switching tasks in and out of a fault-tolerance structure such as , e.g. , an "" NVP task "" ( see Sect . 2.3.3 ) . • Synchronizing groups of tasks . • Isolating4 groups of tasks . • Instructions to roll the execution of a task or a group of tasks back to a previously saved checkpoint , and so forth . Actions have a system-wide scope and are executed on any processing node of the system where a non-faulty component of the Backbone is running . They may include commands to send control signals to specific components of the Backbone or to user tasks . Basic tools such as a distributed voting tool like the EFTOS voting farm ( discussed in Chapter 3 ) can be instructed so that they respond to that signal supplying transparent support towards graceful degradation , task switching , and task migration , as described for instance in ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . Furthermore , the ability to distinguish between transient and permanent / intermittent faults can be exploited , in order to avoid unnecessary reconfigurations or other costly or redundancy-consuming actions , attaching different strategies to these two cases . Figure 1 : A workflow diagram for RεL . Labels refer to usage steps and are described in Sect . 2.4 . 2.4 Workflow This section describes the workflow corresponding to the adoption of the RεL approach . Figure 1 summarizes the workflow . The following basic steps have been foreseen : • In the first steps ( labels 1 and 2 in the cited figure ) , the designer describes the key application and system entities , such as tasks , groups of tasks , and nodes . The main tool for this phase is the configuration language . • Next ( step 3 ) , the designer configures the basic tools and the fault-tolerance provisions he / she has decided to use . The configuration language is used for this . The output of steps 1 – 3 is the configuration code . • Next ( step 4 ) , the designer defines what conditions need to be caught , and what actions should follow each caught condition . The resulting list is coded as a number of guarded actions via a recovery language . • The configuration code and the recovery code are then converted via the translator into a set of C header files , C fragments , and system-specific configuration files ( steps 5 and 6 ) . These files represent : configured instances of the basic tools , of the system and of the application ; initialization files for the communication management functions ; user preferences for the backbone ; and the recovery pseudo-code . • On steps 7 – 9 , the application source code and the configured basic tool instances are compiled in order to produce the executable code of the application . • Next , the backbone is compiled on steps 10 – 12 . • Finally , on step 13 , the communication management services of the BSL are configured in order to allow the proper management of multicasting and other communication services . 2.5 Conclusions In this section an approach to application-level software fault-tolerance has been introduced . Such an approach provides its users with a linguistic structure to express application-level error recovery concerns and to configure a number of fault-tolerance provisions outside the functional application layer . The latter can be provided by any procedural language . The RεL approach addresses dependability goals for distributed or parallel applications written in any procedural language . Its target hardware platforms include distributed and parallel computers consisting of a set of processing nodes known at compile time . Within this application and system domain , the novel approach can be qualitatively assessed as reaching optimal values of the structural attributes . In particular , with respect to the application-level software fault-tolerance approaches reviewed in Chapter 3 , 4 , and 5 : • Error recovery is expressed in a separate programming context – thus good sc can be obtained . • The executable code is separable – that is , at run-time , the portion of the executable code devoted to the fault-tolerance aspects is clearly distinct from the functional code . • Run-time adaptability to diverse environmental conditions may be obtained without requiring the entire executable code to be recompiled . This and previous items bring to a good a . • A large number of well-known fault-tolerance strategies are supported in a straightforward way ( i.e. good sa ) . • The RεL approach addresses a wide class of applications : That of distributed applications , with non-strict real-time requirements , written in a procedural language , to be executed on distributed or parallel computers consisting of a set of processing nodes known at compile time . • Our approach reaches both the benefits of the evolutionary approaches , which base themselves on standards , and those of "" revolutionary "" approaches , exploiting ad-hoc , non-standard solutions . • It can host other provisions and approaches . • As shown in Chapter 9 , in same cases RεL can be adopted with minimal programming effort and minimal adaptation of a pre-existing , non fault-tolerant application . Finally , one can note that the language-based approaches such as those in Chapter 5 differ considerably from RεL . Despite their many positive characteristics , their very axioms – using a custom syntax for both the functional and the fault-tolerance concerns – may restrict significantly their usability . The lack of standards is further detrimental to their diffusion . On the contrary , the choice to support a standard language for the functional aspects and an ad-hoc syntactical structure for the fault-tolerance aspects allows reach optimal sa with no impact on the usability . Next chapter describes a prototype architecture based on the RεL approach . 3 A DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE BASED ON THE RECOVERY LANGUAGE APPROACH This section describes a prototypic architecture based on RεL that has been designed in the context of the European ESPRIT project TIRAN . The structure of the section is as follows : first , project TIRAN is described in Sect . 3.1 . The main components of the TIRAN architecture are covered in Sect . 3.2 . Section 3.2.6 describes the TIRAN configuration and recovery language . Section 5 closes this part and draws a few conclusions . 3.1 The ESPRIT Project TIRAN TIRAN is the name of the European ESPRIT project 28620 . Its name loosely derives from "" Tailorable fault-tolerance frameworks for embedded applications "" ( Botti et al. , 1999 ) . The main objective of TIRAN was to develop a software framework 5 providing fault-tolerant capabilities to automation systems . Application-level support to fault-tolerance was included by means of a RεL architecture , which is described in the rest of this chapter . The framework provides a library of software fault-tolerance provisions that are parametric and support an easy configuration process . TIRAN builds on top of EFTOS , inheriting several of the concepts and tools developed in that project and described in Chapter 3 . Using the TIRAN framework , application developers are allowed to select , configure and integrate provisions for fault masking , error detection , isolation and recovery among those offered by the library . Goal of the TIRAN project was to provide a tool that significantly reduced the development times and costs for dependable systems . TIRAN's target market segment was that of non-safety-critical6 distributed real-time embedded systems ( Botti et al. , 2000 ) . TIRAN explicitly adopted formal techniques to support requirement specification and predictive evaluation . This , together with the intensive testing on pilot applications , was exploited in order to : • Guarantee the correctness of the framework . • Quantify the fulfillment of real-time , dependability and cost requirements . • Provide guidelines to the configuration process of the users . Most of the TIRAN framework was designed for being platform independent . A single version of the framework has been written in the C programming language making use of a BSL designed by the TIRAN consortium and initially developed by one of the partners for the development platform ( Microsoft Windows NT ) . Within TIRAN , a number of target platforms and systems compliant to the model sketched in Sect . 2.1 have been selected . Porting the TIRAN code to these platforms was mainly obtained through the porting of the BSL . As mentioned already , this does not automatically translate in porting the service expected by the BSL ; the latter was obtained by proper verification and validation of its properties on the target platforms . Such platforms included : • A set of Mosaic0207 boards running the Virtuoso microkernel ( Systems , 1998 ; Mosaic020 , 1998 ) . • A set of VME boards based on PowerPC processors and running the VxWorks operating system ( VxWorks , 1999 ) . An MMU is available on these boards , which translates in special hardware support for memory protection . • A set of DEC Alpha boards running the TEX kernel . These boards have no MMU and address spaces of tasks are not protected . Proper protection is guaranteed by TEX , which does not allow any dynamic memory allocation . All addresses are therefore known at compile time , so a preprocessing tool could be used in principle to prevent memory contamination . • Clusters of Windows-CE personal computers ( PCs ) . The final version of the TIRAN framework , running on all the above systems , was demonstrated in November 2000 at the final TIRAN review meeting and at the TIRAN workshop ( Thielemans , 2000 ) . Some elements of the TIRAN framework ( namely those derived from EFTOS ) are also available on Parsytec CC and Parsytec Xplorer systems based on the PowerPC processor and the EPX kernels ( Parsytec , 1996a , 1996b ) and on a proprietary hardware board based on the DEC Alpha chip and running the TEX kernel . The main components of the TIRAN framework are : 1 . The TIRAN toolset , the components of which are discussed in Sect . 3.2 . 2 . The TIRAN configuration and recovery language ariel , described in Sect . 3.2.6 . In particular : • Its translator is dealt with in Sect . 3.2.9 . • The run-time executive of ariel , which is sketched in Sect . 3.2.9 . As mentioned already TIRAN was built on top of ESPRIT project EFTOS – described in full detail in Chapter 3 . In particular TIRAN adopted and improved the EFTOS voting farm ( De Florio et al. , 1998 ) , also described in the mentioned chapter , so as to function as the distributed voting system of the TIRAN framework . Figure 2 draws the TIRAN architecture and locates its main components into it . Two types of edges are used in the picture : • The thinner , directed edge represents relation "" <Sends> "" : If such an edge goes from entity a to entity b then it means that a sends a data message to b or requests a service provided by b through a control message or a method invocation . • The thicker edge is only used between the RINT and ariel entities and means that the former implements the latter through the process of interpreting a pseudo-code called "" r-codes "" ( detailed information about this is available in Sect . 3.2.9 ) . The central , whiter layers represent the TIRAN framework . In particular : • The level 0 hosts the TIRAN BSL , which gives system-independent access to the services provided by the underlying run-time system ( see Sect . 2.3 ) . The user application , the BT , the Backbone , the Time-out Manager , and the dependable mechanisms ( DMs , see Sect . 3.2.3 ) , all make use of the BSL , e.g. , to create tasks or to send messages through mailboxes . • Level 1 services are provided by the BT for error detection and fault masking ( level 1.1 ) and by the BT addressing error isolation , recovery and reconfiguration ( level 1.2 ) . Both services are supplied by node-local ( simplex ) provisions . Section 3.2.1 describes in more detail the BT . The edge from BT to Backbone represents the sending of error detection or diagnostic messages . The edge from Backbone to BT represents control messages , such as , for instance , a request to modify a parameter of a watchdog , or a request to reboot the local node ( see Fig. 4 ) . Figure 2 : A representation of the TIRAN elements . The central , whiter layers constitute the TIRAN framework . This same structure is replicated on each processing node of the system . • Level 2 hosts the TIRAN Backbone , including the Time-out Manager component , the DB management functions , and the recovery interpreter , RINT . In Fig. 2 , the thicker edge connecting RINT to ariel means that RINT actually implements ( executes ) the ariel programs . Note the control and data messages that flow from Backbone to Time-out Manager , DB , and RINT . RINT also sends control messages to the isolation and recovery BT . Data messages flow also from Backbone to the monitoring tool . • Dependable mechanisms , i.e. , high-level , distributed fault-tolerance tools exploiting the services of the Backbone and of the BT , are located at level 3 . These tools include the distributed voting tool , the distributed synchronization tool , the stable memory tool , and the distributed memory tool , described in Sect . 3.2.3 . Dependable Mechanisms receive notifications from RINT in order to execute reconfigurations such as introducing a spare task to take over the role of a failed task ( see Table 5 ) . The layers around the TIRAN framework in Fig. 2 represent ( from the layer at the bottom and proceeding clockwise ) : • The run-time system . • A provision to inject software faults at all levels of the framework and in the run-time system . • The monitoring tool , for hypermedia rendering of the current state of the system within the windows of an Internet browser . • The functional application layer and the recovery language application layer ( the latter is represented as the box labeled ariel ) . Figure 3 pictures the key elements of the TIRAN architecture within the workflow diagram in Fig. 1 . The following sections describe some of the TIRAN components in more detail . 3.2 Some Components of the TIRAN Framework This section describes some key components of the TIRAN framework , namely : The TIRAN toolset , i.e. , the BT , the BSL , the Backbone , and the Time-out Manager service . It also briefly enumerates the TIRAN level-3 mechanisms . 3.2.1 The TIRAN Basic Tools The TIRAN Basic Tools represent a layer of node-local services for error detection , fault masking , error recovery , and isolation . The TIRAN BT include : 1 . A watchdog timer . Figure 3 : The main components of the RεL architecture developed in TIRAN are located within the workflow diagram of Fig. 1 . A so-called "" SocketServer "" has been also depicted , i.e. , a BSL component managing message transmission and dispatching . 2 . A node-local voting system . 3 . An input replicator , to be used with the voting system . 4 . An output collector , to be used with the voting system . 5 . A tool responsible for node shutdowns . 6 . A tool responsible for node reboots . 7 . A tool responsible for isolating a task . Some of the BT ( such as the level 1.1 BT with numbers 1 – 4 ) are application-level software tools , others ( for instance , the level-1 . 2 BT number 5 – 7 ) provide hooks to lower-level services . Most of these tools have been designed and developed by the TIRAN partners and have been especially conceived in order to meet hard real-time requirements . A deeper description of some of these tools can be found in ( Deconinck , Botti , Cassinari , De Florio , & Lauwereins , 1998 ; Deconinck et al. , 1999 ) . As a side effect of using these tools , the TIRAN Backbone ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) is transparently notified of a number of events related to fault-tolerance . Notifications generally describe the state of a given component and have the form of a 4-tuple of integers ( c , t , u , p ) , in which c identifies a specific condition , t is a label that identifies a class of BT , u is the unique-id of either a task , or a group of tasks , or a node , and p is a possibly empty list of optional arguments . Unlike in Mozart ( Chapter 5 ) , where an entity can register to a fault stream and be notified of all faults affecting any entity , within TIRAN an entity must explicitly set up such fault stream by calling function RaiseEvent . Such function forwards notifications to the Backbone . It has the following prototype : int RaiseEvent ( int condition , int actor , TIRAN TASK ID uniqueId , int nargs , ... ) . 3.2.2 The TIRAN Basic Services Library The TIRAN Basic Services Library offers specific services such as communication , task creation and management , access to the local hardware clock , management of semaphores , and so forth . It supports multicasting : Messages are sent to so-called "" logicals , "" i.e. , groups of tasks . It was designed by the TIRAN Consortium and developed by various partners for the different target platforms and operating systems . Specific adaptation layers may be designed for mapping existing communication libraries , such as MPI2 , to the TIRAN BSL . As a side effect of using some of the BSL functions , the TIRAN Backbone ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) can be transparently notified of events such as a successful spawning of a task , or the failure state of a communication primitive . BSL notifications are similar to BT notifications – 4-tuples of integers ( c , t , u , p ) , where c and p are as in Sect . 3.2.1 , while in this context t is a label that specifies the class of BSL services and u is the unique-id of the task that experienced condition c . A full description of the TIRAN BSL can be found in ( Calella et al. , 1999 ) . 3.2.3 The TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms As already mentioned , the TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms are distributed , high-level fault-tolerance provisions that can be used to facilitate the development of dependable services . The TIRAN Dependable Mechanisms include : • A tool to enhance data integrity by means of a stabilizing procedure ( data is only allowed to pass through the system boundaries when it is confirmed a user-defined number of times ) . This is known as Stable Memory Tool and is described in detail in Chapter 3 . • A Distributed Synchronization Tool , i.e. , a software tool for synchronizing a set of tasks . A description of this tool can be found in ( Calella et al. , 1999 ) . • A so-called Distributed Memory Tool that creates and manages distributed replicas of memory cells . Several features of this tool have been described in Chapter 3 . • A "" Redundant Watchdog "" , i.e. , a distributed system exploiting multiple instances of the watchdog basic tool in order to enhance various dependability properties ( see Chapter 9 ) . • The TIRAN distributed voting tool ( DV ) , an adaptation of the EFTOS voting farm described in Chapter 3 . 3.2.4 The TIRAN Backbone The TIRAN Backbone is the core component of the fault-tolerance distributed architecture described in this chapter . The main objectives of the TIRAN Backbone include : 1 . Gathering and maintaining error detection information produced by TIRAN BT and BSL . 2 . Using this information at error recovery time . In particular , as described in Sect . 3.2.1 , the TIRAN BT focusing on error detection and fault masking forward their deductions to the Backbone . The Backbone maintains these data in the TIRAN DB , replicated on multiple nodes of the system . Incoming data are also fed into an α-count ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) filter ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) . This mechanism allows identifying statistically the nature of faults – whether a given fault is transient or whether it is permanent or intermittent . A set of private functions to query the current state of the DB is available within the Backbone . Other private functions request remote services such as , for instance , rebooting a node or spawning a certain task on a given node . When the underlying architecture is built around a host computer controlling a number of target boards by means of a custom OS , the latter may execute remote commands on the boards . On the contrary , when the OS is general-purpose and node-local , remote services can be executed on any node of the system by sending command messages from one component to the other of the Backbone – for instance , a "" reboot "" message may be sent from the component of the Backbone on node 0 to the component on node 2 . On receipt , the latter may execute the reboot command by forwarding a local request to a BT addressing error isolation or recovery , e.g. , the tool managing the reboot service . Figure 4 represents this scheme . The above remote services can be the basis for more complex , system-wide recovery and reconfiguration actions . Figure 4 : On each processing node exactly one component of the Backbone is located . This component is the intermediary of the Backbone on that node . In particular , it gathers information from error detection and fault containment BT ( grey circles ) and forwards requests to error containment and recovery BT ( light grey circles ) . These latter execute recovery actions and possibly , at test time , fault injection requests . The TIRAN Backbone consists of two core components . In the absence of system partitioning , within the system there is exactly one manager , holding the main copy of the DB and with recovery management responsibilities . On other nodes , Backbone components called assistants deal with DB replicas , forward local deductions to the manager and can take over the role of the manager should the latter or its node fail . A key point in the effectiveness of this approach is guaranteeing that the Backbone itself tolerates internal and external faults . A custom distributed algorithm has been designed to detect the failures of up to all but one of the components of the Backbone or the nodes of the system . The same algorithm also tolerates system partitioning during the "" periods of instability "" ( see the timed-asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , briefly described in Chapter 2 ) . This procedure has been called the "" algorithm of mutual suspicion "" ( AMS ) since each component of the Backbone continuously questions the correctness of all the other valid components . It is described in detail in Chapter 7 . The α-Count Fault Identification Mechanism . It is a well known fact that reconfiguration is a costly activity , in the sense that it always results in redundancy consumption . This translates in a possibly graceful , though actual degradation of the quality of service of a system . This may have drastic consequences , especially in systems where service degradations are static and irreversible . For instance , in satellites and space probes , rapid exhaustion of redundancy may severely affect the duration of the useful mission hours and hence reliability ( Inquiry , 1996 ) . Two important issues towards solving the problem just stated are : 1 . Understanding the nature of faults , and in particular identifying faults as permanent ( and thus actually requiring reconfiguration ) with respect to transient ones . 2 . Tolerating transient faults with less redundancy consuming techniques , possibly not based on reconfiguration . Issue 1 means that the adopted fault-tolerance mechanism is required not only to locate a component subject to an error , but also to assess the nature of the originating fault . This implies processing additional information and unfortunately translates also in a larger delay in fault diagnosis . Despite this larger delay , in same cases the benefits of techniques based on the above issues may be greater than its penalties in performance and latency ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . A number of techniques have been devised to assess the character of faults – some of them are based on tracking the occurrences and the frequency of faults and adopting thresholds of the kind "" a device is diagnosed as affected by a permanent fault when four failures occurs within 24 hours "" . This and other similar heuristics are described in ( Lin & Siewiorek , 1990 ) . A fault identification mechanism , called α-count , has been described in ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) and generalized in ( Bondavalli , Chiaradonna , Di Giandomenico , & Grandoni , 2000 ) . α-count is also based on thresholds . The basic idea is that each system component to be assessed is to be "" guarded "" by an error detection device . This device should forward its deductions , in the form of a binary digit , to a device called α-count filter . For each incoming judgement , the filter would then perform the α-count technique and issue an assessment about the nature of the fault leading to the detected error . More formally , given n "" guarded "" components ui , 0 < = i < n , the authors of the strategy call J ( i , L ) the L-th judgement on ui . Judgement 0 means success ( ui is "" healthy "" ) , 1 means failure ( ui is faulty ) . A score vector , α ( i ) , 0 < = i < n , is initially set to zero and updated , for each judgement L > 1 , as follows : α ( i , L ) = α ( i , ( L − 1 )) Kif J ( i , L ) = 0 α ( i , L ) = α ( i , ( L − 1 )) + 1if J ( i , L ) = 1 , ( 3 ) being 0 < = K < = 1 . When α ( i , L ) becomes greater than a certain threshold αT , ui is diagnosed as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . This event may be signaled to a reconfigurator or another fault passivation mechanism . The authors of α-count show that their mechanism is asymptotically able to identify all components affected by permanent or intermittent faults – if the threshold αT is set to any finite positive integer A , and if the Figure 5 : The picture shows how an α-count filter , α ( 1 , L ) , is updated when it receives 14 error detection notifications ( 0 < = L < = 13 ) from the Backbone . Notifications are in this case chosen randomly . Note that , on the last notification ( L = 13 ) , a threshold ( in this case , 5.5 ) is reached and the corresponding fault is assessed as permanent or intermittent . component is indeed affected by a permanent or intermittent fault , they prove that α ( i , L ) will eventually become greater than or equal to A ( Bondavalli et al. , 1997 ) . The authors also prove that similar results can be reached with some variants of formula ( 3 ) . Figure 5 shows how that counter evolves when random-valued notifications ( either positive or negative assessments ) are sent to the Backbone . It is worth noting how the mechanism described above requires an approach slightly similar to the one of the RεL toolset : in both cases , a fault stream has to flow from a periphery of detection tools to a collector . This collector is the α-count filter in the one case and the TIRAN Backbone and its DB in the other one . This makes it straightforward adopting α-count in TIRAN : The filter can simply be fed with data coming from the detection BT just before this data in inserted into the DB . The added value of this approach is that it is possible to set up a function that returns the current estimation of the nature of a fault ( see Sect . 3.2.9 ) . Clearly , a requirement of this technique is that each detection tool not only forward notifications of erroneous activity , but also confirmations of normal behavior . This may have negative consequences on the performance of the approach , as it may result in many communication requests . In the prototype version developed by the author , Figure 6 : An assistant running on a node of a cluster of PCs . The upper window hosts the assistant , the lower one its SocketServer ( see Fig. 3 ) . In the former one , note how the α-counter detects that task 2 is affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . each notification from any detection tool to the backbone is tagged with an integer label starting at 0 and incremented by 1 at each new deduction . This way , only negative assessments can be sent – in fact , if , for instance , the backbone receives from the same detection tool two consecutive negative assessments labeled respectively , e.g. , 24 and 28 , then this implicitly means that there have been three positive assessments in between , and the α-counter can be updated accordingly – though possibly with some delay . This strategy has been conceived by the author of this book . Figure 6 shows the α-counter in action – a task has reached its threshold and has been declared as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault . Clearly a system like Mozart ( Chapter 5 ) may also easily adopt a tool like α-count . 3.2.5 The TIRAN Time-Out Manager As already mentioned , the main assumption of RεL is the adoption of the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) , the promising model for solving problems such as dynamic membership ( Cristian & Schmuck , 1995 ) in distributed systems that has been introduced in Chapter 2 . The availability of a class of functions for managing time-outs is an important requirement for that model . The TIRAN Time-out Manager ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) fulfils this need – it is basically a mechanism for managing lists of time-outs , that is objects that postpone a function call for a certain number of local clock units . Time-outs are ordered by clock-units-to-expiration , and time-out lists are managed in such a way that only the head of the list needs to be checked for expiration . When the specified amount of time elapses for the head of the list , its function – let us call it "" alarm "" – is executed and the object is either thrown out of the list or renewed ( in this second case , a time-out is said to be "" cyclic "" ) . A special thread monitors and manages one or more of such lists , checking for the expiration of the entries in the time-out list . Within the strategy of the TIRAN Backbone , a Time-out Manager task is available on each node of the system , spawned at initialization time by the local Backbone component . Time-out Manager is used in this context to translate time-related clauses , such as , "" pa seconds have elapsed "" , into message arrivals . In other words , each Time-out Manager instance of the Backbone may be represented as a function a from C to M such that , for any time-related clause c in C : a ( c ) = message "" clause c has elapsed "" is in M. This homomorphism is useful because it allows deal with the entire set of possible events – both messages and time-related events – as the arrival of a homogeneous set of messages . Hence , a single multiple-selection statement such as the C language switch can be used to manage all cases , which translates into a simpler and more straightforward implementation for error detection protocols such as the AMS . The Time-out Manager uses a well-known algorithm for managing its time-outs ( Tanenbaum , 1996 ) . Once the first time-out is entered , the manager creates a linked-list of time-outs and polls the top of the list . For each new time-out to be inserted , a proper position in the list is found and the list is modified accordingly , as described in Fig. 7 . If the top entry expires , a user-defined alarm function is invoked . This is a general mechanism that allows associate any event with the expiring of a time-out . In the case of the backbone , the Time-out Manager component on node k sends a message to Backbone component on the same node – the same result may also be achieved by sending that component a UNIX signal ( Haviland & Salama , 1987 ) . Special time-outs are defined as "" cyclic "" , i.e. , they are automatically renewed at each new expiration , after invoking their alarm function . A special function renews a time-out , i.e. , it deletes and re-enters that entry . It is also possible to temporarily suspend8 a time-out and re-enable it afterwards . Time-out Manager exploits multiple alarm execution threads in order to reduce the congestion that is due to concurrent execution of alarms and the consequent run-time violations . A description of this strategy can be found in ( De Florio et al. , 2000 ) . Figure 7 : How the alarm manager works : in 1 . , a 330ms alarm called X is inserted in the list . In 2 . , after 100ms , X has been reduced to 230ms and a 400ms alarm , called Y , is inserted ( its value is 170 , i.e. , 400-230 ) . Another 70ms have passed in 3 . , so X has been reduced to 160ms . At that point , a 510ms alarm , Z is inserted – it goes at the third position . In 4 . , after 160ms , alarm X occurs – Y becomes then the top of the list ; its decrement starts . In 5 . another 20ms have passed and Y is at 150ms – at that point a 230ms alarm , called W is inserted . Its position is in between Y and Z , therefore the latter is adjusted . In 6 . , after 150ms , Y expires and W goes on top . The TIRAN Time-out Manager is a fundamental building block for the TIRAN dependability strategies , but it is a useful tool also for other approaches : Chapter 7 describes one of them , that is failure detection protocols . 3.2.6 The Ariel Configuration and Recovery Language ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger That you , his friend , are in ; and sends me forth – For else his project dies – to keep them living . ( Shakespeare , The Tempest , Act II , Scene I ) Within TIRAN , a single syntactical structure – provided by the ariel language ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2001 ; Deconinck , De Florio , & Botti , 2001 ) – has been devised by the author of this book as both a configuration and a recovery language . This chapter describes this language and its compile-time and run-time tools . The structure of the section is as follows : • The general characteristics of ariel are described in Sect . 3.2.7 . • ariel as a configuration language is introduced in Sect . 3.2.8 . • Section 3.2.9 is on ariel as a recovery language . ariel bears its name after the character with the same name of Shakespeare's last Comedy , The Tempest . In fact , in the Tempest , spirit Ariel is a magic creature , the invisible assistant of Prospero , the Duke of Milano . While Prospero plays his role in the foreground of the Comedy – orchestrating a strategy to regain possession of his dukedom , which had been usurped by Prospero's brother Antonio – Ariel faithfully serves Prospero performing his magic in the background , exploiting his powers to execute Prospero's commands when his "" Master through his art foresees the danger "" ( see above quote ) . In a sense , the role of the ariel language is somewhat similar to the one of Prospero's ally . Its run-time support is given by the agent that is sent forth when the Backbone , through its nervous terminals – the error detection basic tools – senses a potentially dangerous condition . The author of this book thinks that the name Ariel captures well this similarity . This is also the reason that led to the choice of "" RεL "" as an abbreviation for "" Recovery Language "" : indeed , the spelling of that word is "" [ a : * ] - [ i : ] - [ el ] "" . 3.2.7 General Characteristics of ariel ariel is a declarative language with a simple syntax somewhat similar to that of a UNIX shell . One instruction per line is allowed . Comments are like in the C shell ( "" # "" starts a comment which ends at next new line or at end-of-file ) . Names are not case-sensitive . ariel deals with five basic types : "" nodes "" , "" tasks "" , "" logicals "" , integers , and real numbers . A node is a uniquely identifiable processing node of the system , e.g. , a processor of a MIMD supercomputer . A task is a uniquely identifiable process or thread in the system . A logical is a uniquely identifiable collection of tasks , possibly running on different nodes . Nodes , tasks , and logicals are generically called entities . Entities are uniquely identified via non-negative integers ; for instance , NODE3 or N3 refer to processing node currently configured as node number 3 . Integer symbolic constants can be "" imported "" from C language header files through the statement INCLUDE . For instance , if the C language header file "" vf . h "" contains a define statement such as : # define PROC NUM 4 , then it is possible to use that symbolic constant wherever an integer is expected in the language . To de-reference a symbolic constant imported via INCLUDEs a "" brace-operator "" has been defined – for instance , under the above assumptions the following valid ariel statement : NPROCS = { PROC_NUM } ( described later on ) is equivalent to NPROCS = 4 . An ariel script basically consists of two parts : • A part dealing with configuration . This is described in Sect . 3.2.8 . • A part containing the guarded actions which constitute the user-defined error recovery strategy . They are described in Sect . 3.2.9 . 3.2.8 ariel as a Configuration Language Special linguistic support has been designed by the author of this book while taking part in the TIRAN project . Aim of this linguistic support is to facilitate the configuration of the instances of the framework elements , of the system and application parameters , and of the fault-tolerance provisions . Let us call these elements a framework instance . Once the user has configured a framework instance with ariel , the TIRAN ariel translator "" art "" must be used to translate these high level specifications into the actual C language calls that set up configured tasks such as , for instance , user-configured watchdogs . The output of the translator is a set of C files that need to be compiled with the user application . A subset of the fault-tolerance provisions described in Chapter 6 is supported by the version of ariel described in this book . The rest of this section describes the process of configuring a framework instance with ariel . System and Application Parameters . The ariel configuration language can be used to define and configure the target system and application entities , e.g. , nodes , tasks , and group of tasks . The rules defined in Sect . 2.3.2 are coded as follows : • Rule ( 1 ) , as for instance in task3 = n0 [ 8 ] , is coded as TASK 3 = "" TMR . EXE "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 . In other words , the above statement declares that task 8 , local to node 0 , is to be globally referred to as "" task 3 "" . String "" TMR . EXE "" may also be used to refer symbolically9 to task3 . More complex rules are possible – for instance , TASK [ 1 , 3 ] = "" Triple "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID [ 6 , 8 ] is equivalent to TASK 1 = "" Triple1 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 6 , TASK 2 = "" Triple2 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 7 , TASK 3 = "" Triple3 "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 . • Rule ( 2 ) , as in group10 = { 5 , 6 , 7 } , is coded as LOGICAL 10 = "" TMR "" IS TASK 5 , TASK 6 , TASK 7 END LOGICAL . ( String "" TMR "" may also be used to refer symbolically to group10 ) . The example defines a logical to be globally referred to as "" logical 10 "" , symbolically known as TMR , and corresponding to the three tasks whose unique-id are 5 , 6 , and 7 . Let us assume the following lines have been written in a file called "" test . ariel "" : TASK 5 = "" TMR_LEADER "" IS NODE 0 , TASKID 8 TASK 6 = "" TMR2 "" IS NODE 1 , TASKID 8 TASK 7 = "" TMR3 "" IS NODE 2 , TASKID 8 LOGICAL 10 = "" TMR "" IS TASK 5 , TASK 6 , TASK 7 END LOGICAL File test . ariel can be translated by executing program art as follows : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i test . ariel Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U.

The italics-highlighted strings are the names of two configuration files that are written by art on successful execution . These two files declare tasks and logicals in the format expected by the BSL and by other ancillary components ( e.g. , on the version for Windows NT , these tables are also used by a "" SocketServer10 "" ) . The user can also define a number of other parameters of the TIRAN world like , for instance : • N , i.e. , the total number of processing nodes in the system . • ti , i.e. , the number of tasks running on node ni . • Task-specific parameters of the α-count fault identification mechanism supported by the TIRAN Backbone . As an example , the following lines declare a system consisting of two nodes , each of which has to host 10 user tasks , and define the α-count parameters of task 5 : NPROCS = 2 NUMTASKS 1 = 10 NUMTASKS 2 = 10 ALPHA-COUNT 2 IS threshold = 3.0 , factor = 0.4 END ALPHA-COUNT . The output produced by the art translator is given in this case by a number of header files : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i test . ariel - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U.

The latter will then be used by the TIRAN backbone when updating the α-count filters – see Sect . 3.2.4 ) . Backbone Parameters . ariel can be used to configure the Backbone . In particular , the initial role of each Backbone component must be specified through the DEFINE statement . For instance , the following two lines configure a system consisting of four nodes and place the Backbone manager on node 0 and three assistants on the other nodes : DEFINE 0 = MANAGER DEFINE 1-3 = ASSISTANTS A number of backbone-specific parameters can also be specified via the ariel configuration language . These parameters include , for instance , the frequency of setting and checking the < I 'm Alive > flag of the backbone . Values are specified in microseconds . A complete example can be seen in Table 1 . Again , the art translator changes the above specifications into the appropriate C language settings as expected by the TIRAN Backbone . 20 10 1 2 # Specification of a strategy in the recovery language Ariel # Include files INCLUDE "" phases . h "" INCLUDE "" vf . h "" 3 4 5 # Definitions # After keyword ' DEFINE ' , the user can specify # an integer , an interval , or a list , followed by # the equal sign and a backbone role , that may be # ASSISTANT ( s ) or MANAGER NPROCS = 4 Define 0 = MANAGER Define 1-3 = ASSISTANTS 6 7 # Time-out values for the Backbone and the < I 'm Alive > mechanism MIA SEND TIMEOUT = 800000 # Manager Is Alive -- manager side TAIA RECV TIMEOUT = 1500000 # This Assistant Is Alive -- manager side 8 9 MIA RECV TIMEOUT = 1500000 # Manager Is Alive -- backup side TAIA SEND TIMEOUT = 1000000 # This Assistant Is Alive -- backup side 10 TEIF TIMEOUT = 1800000 # After this time a suspected node is assumed # to have crashed . 11 I 'M ALIVE CLEAR TIMEOUT = 900000 # < I 'm Alive > timeout -- clear IA flag 12 I 'M ALIVE SET TIMEOUT = 1400000 # < I 'm Alive > timeout -- set IA flag 13 14 15 16 # Number NUMTASKS NUMTASKS NUMTASKS NUMTASKS 17 18 19 20 TASK TASK TASK TASK of tasks 0 = 11 # node 0 is to be loaded with 11 tasks 1 = 10 2 = 10 3 = 10 [ 0 , 10 ] IS NODE 0 , TASKID [ 0 , 10 ] [ 11 , 20 ] IS NODE 1 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] [ 21 , 30 ] IS NODE 2 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] [ 31 , 40 ] IS NODE 3 , TASKID [ 1 , 10 ] 21 LOGICAL 1 IS TASK 1 , TASK 2 , TASK 3 END LOGICAL Table 1 : An excerpt from an ariel script : configuration part . Line numbers have been added for the sake of clarity . Basic Tools . ariel can be used to configure statically the TIRAN tools . The current prototypic version can configure only one tool , the TIRAN watchdog . The following syntax is recognized by art to configure it : WATCHDOG 10 WATCHES TASK 14 HEARTBEATS EVERY 100 MS ON ERROR WARN TASK 18 END WATCHDOG . The output in this case is a C file that corresponds to a configured instance of a watchdog . The application developer needs only to send heartbeats to that instance , which can be done as follows : HEARTBEAT 10 . Configuring Multiple-Version Software Fault-Tolerance . As described in Sect . 2.3.3 , it is possible to design syntax rules to support the configuration of the software fault-tolerance provisions described in Chapter 3 . This section describes the solution provided by ariel in order to support N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) , and a possible syntax to support consensus recovery blocks ( Scott et al. , 1985 ) and retry blocks ( Huang & Kintala , 1993 ) . The following is an example that shows how it is possible to define an "" N - version task "" with ariel : # include "" my_nvp . h "" N-VERSION LOGICAL { NVP_LOGICAL } VERSION 1 IS TASK { VERSION1 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } VERSION 2 IS TASK { VERSION2 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } VERSION 3 IS TASK { VERSION3 } TIMEOUT { VERSION_TIMEOUT } METRIC "" nvp_comp "" ON SUCCESS TASK { NVP_OUTPUT } ON ERROR TASK { NVP_ERROR } { NVP_LOGICAL } VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY END N-VERSION The art translator , once fed with the above lines , produces three source files for tasks the unique-id of which is { VERSION1 } , { VERSION2 } and { VERSION3 } . These source files consist of code that • sets up the TIRAN distributed voting tool ( described in Sect . 3.2.3 ) using metric function int nvp_comp ( const void * , const void * ) , setting the voting algorithm to majority voting , and so forth ; • redirects standard output streams ; • executes a user task , e.g. , task { VERSION3 } . By agreement , each user task ( i.e. , each version ) has to write its output onto the standard output stream . During run-time , when the user needs to access a service supplied by an NVP logical , it simply sends a message to entity { NVP_LOGICAL } . This translates into a multicast to tasks { VERSION1 } , { VERSION2 } and { VERSION3 } . These tasks , which in the meanwhile have transparently set up a distributing voting tool , • get their input , • compute a generic function , • produce an output • and ( by the above stated agreement ) they write the output onto their standard output stream . The latter , which had been already redirected through a piped stream to the template task , is fed into the voting system . Such system eventually produces an output that goes to task { NVP_OUTPUT } . A time-out can also be set up so to produce an error notification when no output is sent by a version within a certain deadline . Table 2 shows one of the three files produced by the ariel translator when it parses the script of Sect . 3.2.8 . Note how this file basically configures an instance of the TIRAN DV tool described in Sect . 3.2.3 . Note also how all technicalities concerning : • The API of the tool , • input replication , • the adopted voting strategy , • output communication , and so forth are fully made transparent to the designer , who needs only be concerned with the functional service . This allows the fault-tolerance designer to modify all the above mentioned technicalities with no negative relapses on the tasks of the application designer , and even to deploy different strategies depending on the particular target platform . This can be exploited in order to pursue performance design goals . Support towards consensus recovery block may be provided in a similar way , e.g. , as follows : # include "" my_crb . h "" CONSENSUS RECOVERY BLOCK LOGICAL { CRB_LOGICAL } VARIANT 1 IS TASK { VARIANT1 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT1 } VARIANT 2 IS TASK { VARIANT2 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT2 } # include "" TIRAN . h "" / * Task 101 of NVersion Task 20 Version 1 / 3 * / int TIRAN task 101 ( void ) { TIRAN Voting * dv ; size t size ; double task20 cmp ( const void * , const void * ) ; 10 dv = TIRAN VotingOpen ( task20 cmp ) ; if ( dv == NULL ) { RaiseEvent ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING CANTOPEN , TIRAN DV , 101 , 0 ) ; TIRAN exit ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING CANTOPEN ) ; } / * voting task description : which tasks / * constitute the n-version task * / TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 101 , 1 , TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 102 , 2 , TIRAN VotingDescribe ( dv , 103 , 3 , and which versions * / 1 ) ; 0 ) ; 0 ) ; 20 TIRAN VotingRun ( dv ) ; / * output should be sent to task 40 * / TIRAN VotingOutput ( dv , 40 ) ; TIRAN VotingOption ( dv , TIRAN VOTING IS MAJORITY ) ; / * redirect stdout into a pipe input stream * / TIRAN pipework ( ) ; 30 / * execute the version * / task 101 ( ) ; size = read ( 0 , buff , MAX BUFF ) ; if ( size > 0 ) { / * forward the input buffer to the local voter of this version * / TIRAN VotingInput ( dv , buff , size ) ; } 40 else { / * signal there 's no input * / TIRAN VotingInput ( dv , NULL , 0 ) ; RaiseEvent ( TIRAN ERROR VOTING NOINPUT , TIRAN DV , 101 , 0 ) ; TIRAN NotifyTask ( 60 , TIRAN ERROR VOTING NOINPUT ) ; } } 50 / * EOF file TIRAN task 101 . c * / Table 2 : Translation of the N-Version Task defined in Sect . 3.2.8 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 REPLICATED TASK 10 IS TASK 101 , 102 , 103 METHOD IS MODULAR REDUNDANCY VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY METRIC "" int_cmp "" END METHOD ON SUCCESS TASK 20 ON ERROR TASK 30 END REPLICATED Table 3 : A possible syntax rule for compile-time management of replicated tasks . VARIANT 3 IS TASK { VARIANT3 } TIMEOUT { VARIANT_TIMEOUT } ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK { ACCEPT3 } METRIC "" crb_comp "" ON SUCCESS TASK { CRB_OUTPUT } ON ERROR TASK { CRB_ERROR } { CRB_LOGICAL } VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY END CRB This is syntactically similar to the previous example , but the user is asked to supply tasks for the execution of acceptance tests . Other possibilities might also be considered , e.g. , supplying a function name corresponding to the acceptance test , in order to avoid the overhead of spawning a task for that purpose . As described in Sect . 2.3.3 , it is possible to design syntax rules to support the configuration of replicated tasks . Table 3 shows the syntax recognized by ariel for this . Lines have been numbered to ease the discussion . Line 1 specifies which tasks constitute the replicated task . Line 2 defines the method of replication ( NMR in this case ) . Sub-options of the chosen method , at lines 3 and 4 , specify the type of voting to perform when de-multiplexing the multiple outputs of the base modules of the replicated task ( here , majority voting11 ) . Line 6 specifies the task the output of the replicated task is to be sent to . Line 7 specifies which task to notify in case of failure , e.g. , when no majority can be found . ariel supports redoing as described in Table 4 . Note how , in that table , task 10 has to complete within a user-defined deadline ( line 2 ) fulfilling an acceptance test ( executed by task 20 at line 3 ) . This allows regard run-time violations as actual faults . Note also that both the latter task and task 10 could be also transparently replicated by means of the technique depicted in Sect . 2.3.3 . An upper bound on the number of retries is set at line 4 : should task 10 fail three times in a row , task 30 would be notified of this event and could execute some error recovery scheme . 1 2 3 4 5 6 RETRY TASK 10 TIMEOUT 100ms ACCEPTANCE TEST TASK 20 RETRIES 3 ON ERROR TASK 30 END RETRY Table 4 : A possible syntax rule for compile-time management of retry blocks . 3.2.9 ariel as a Recovery Language The same linguistic structure that realizes the TIRAN configuration language is used also to host the structure in which the user defines his or her error recovery strategies . Recovery strategies are collections of sections with the following syntax12 : section : if elif else fi ; if : IF ' [ ' guard ' ] ' THEN actions ; elif : | ELIF ' [ ' guard ' ] ' THEN actions elif ; else fi : | ELSE actions ; : FI ; where non-terminals guard and actions are the syntactical terms defined respectively in Sect . 2.3.4 and Sect . 2.3.4 . Ariel's guards . follows : An excerpt of the context-free grammar rules for guards status : FAULTY | RUNNING | REBOOTED | STARTED | ISOLATED | RESTARTED | TRANSIENT ; entity : GROUP | NODE | TASK ; expr : status entity | ' ( ' expr ' ) ' | expr AND expr | expr OR expr | NOT expr | ERRN ' ( ' entity ' ) ' comp NUMBER | PHASE ' ( ' entity ' ) ' comp NUMBER ; comp : EQ | NEQ | GT | GE | LT | LE ; The following conditions and values have been foreseen : Faulty . This is true when an error notification related to a processing node , a group of tasks , or a single task , can be found in the TIRAN DB . Running . True when the corresponding entity is active and no error has been detected that regards it . Rebooted ( only applicable to nodes ) . This means that a node has been rebooted at least once during the run-time of the application . Started ( not applicable to nodes ) . This checks whether a waiting task or group of task has been started . Isolated . This clause is true when its argument has been isolated from the rest of the application through a deliberate action . Phase ( only applicable to tasks ) . It returns the current value of an attribute set by any task via the public function RaiseEvent . This value is forwarded to the Backbone to represent its current "" phase "" or state ( e.g. , an identifier referring to its current algorithmic step , or the outcome of a test or of an assertion ) . For instance , a voting task could inform the Backbone that it has completed a given algorithmic step by setting a given integer value after each step ( this approach is transparently adopted in the EFTOS voting tool and is described in more detail in ( De Florio et al. , 1998 )) . Recovery block tests can take advantage of this facility to switch back and try an alternate task when a primary one sets a "" failure "" phase or when a guarding watchdog expires because a watched task sent it no signs of life . This condition returns an integer symbol that can be compared via C-like arithmetic operators . Restarted ( not applicable to nodes ) . This returns the number of times a given task or group has been restarted . It implies started . Transient is true when an entity has been detected as faulty and the current assessment of the α-count fault identification mechanism ( see Sect . 3.2.4 ) is "" transient "" . It implies faulty . Furthermore , it is possible to query the number of errors that have been detected and pertain to a given entity . Complex guards can be built via the standard logic connectives and parentheses . As an example , the following guard : FAULTY TASK { MASTER } AND ERRN ( TASK { MASTER } ) > 10 AND RESTARTED TASK { MASTER } checks whether the three conditions : • the task , the unique-id of which is the value of the symbolic constant MASTER , has been detected as faulty ; • more than 10 errors have been associated to that task ; • that task has been restarted , are all true . Ariel's actions . "" Actions "" can be attached to the THEN or ELSE parts of a section . In the current implementation of the language , these actions allow to start , isolate , restart , terminate a task or a group of tasks , to isolate or reboot a node , to invoke a local function . Moreover , it is possible to multicast messages to groups of tasks and to purge events from the DB . A section of the context-free grammar for Ariel's actions follows : actions action : | actions action ; : | | section recovery action ; recovery action : STOP entity | ISOLATE entity | START entity | REBOOT entity | RESTART entity | ENABLE entity | SEND NUMBER TASK | SEND NUMBER GROUP | WARN entity ( condition ) | REMOVE PHASE entity FROM ERRORLIST | REMOVE ANY entity FROM ERRORLIST ; | CALL NUMBER | CALL NUMBER ' ( ' list ' ) ' condition : ERR NUMBER entity ; As suggested in Sect . 2.3.4 , a special case of action is a section , i.e. , another guarded action . This allows specify hierarchies ( trees ) of sections . During the run-time evaluation of the recovery strategies , a branch shall only be visited when its parent clause has been evaluated as true . The following actions are supported : Stop terminates a task or a group of tasks , or initiates the shutdown procedure of a node13 . Isolate prevents an entity to communicate with the rest of the system14 . Reboot reboots a node ( via the TIRAN Reboot Node basic tool ) . IF [ FAULTY ( GROUP { My Group } ) AND NOT TRANSIENT ( GROUP { My Group } ) ] THEN STOP TASK @ SEND { DEGRADE } TASK ∼ FI Table 5 : This section queries the state of group { My Group } and , if any of its tasks have been detected as affected by a permanent or intermittent fault , it stops those tasks and sends a control message to those considered as being correct so that they reconfigure themselves gracefully degrading their overall service . Start spawns ( or , in static environments , awakes ) a task or a group . Restart is reverting a task or group of tasks to their initial state or , if no other means are available , stopping that entity and spawning a clone of it . Enable awakes a task or group , or boots a node . Send multicasts ( or sends ) signals to groups of tasks ( or single tasks ) . Warn informs a task or group of tasks that an error regarding an entity has been detected . Action "" WARN x "" is equivalent to action "" SEND { WARN } x "" Remove purges records from the section of the DB collecting the errors or the phases of a given entity . Custom actions and conditions may be easily added to the grammar of ariel15 . When actions are specified , it is possible to use meta-characters to refer implicitly to a subset of the entities involved in the query . For instance , when the first atom specifies a group of tasks , STOP TASK @ 1 means "" terminate those tasks , belonging to the group mentioned in the first atom of the guard , which fulfill that condition "" , while WARN TASK ∼ 2 means "" warn those tasks , belonging to the group mentioned in the second atom of the guard , that do not fulfil the second condition "" . If one does not specify any number , as in STOP TASK @ , then the involved group of tasks is the one that fulfils the whole clause . Table 5 shows an example of usage of this feature . Metacharacter "" star "" ( * ) can be used to refer to any task , group , or processing node in the system . Actions like STOP TASK * or STOP GROUP * are trapped by the translator and are not allowed . Metacharacter "" dollar "" ( $ ) can be used to refer in a section to an entity mentioned in an atom . For instance , STOP GROUP $ 2 means "" stop the group mentioned in the second atom of the clause "" . A larger excerpt of ariel's grammar has been given in Chapter 4 . Compile-time Support for Error-Recovery . Once fed with a recovery script , the art translator produces a binary pseudo-code , called the r-code . In the current version , this r-code is written in a binary file and in a C header file as a statically defined C array , as in Table 6 . As can be seen in that table , the r-code is made of a set of "" triplets "" of integers , given by an opcode and two operands . These are called "" r-codes "" . This header file needs to be compiled with the application . Run-time error recovery is carried out by the RINT module , which basically is an r-code interpreter . This module and its recovery algorithm are described in the following section . The rest of this section describes how to translate an ariel script into the r-code . Within this section and the following one the simple script of Table 7 will be used as an example . The following scenario is assumed : a triple modular redundancy ( TMR ) system consisting of three voting tasks , identified by integers { VOTER1 } , { VOTER2 } , and { VOTER3 } is operating . A fourth task , identified as T { SPARE } , is available and waiting . It is ready to take over one of the voting tasks should the latter fail . The failed voter signals its state to the backbone by entering phase HAS_FAILED through some self-diagnostic module ( e.g. , assertions or control-flow monitoring ) . The spare is enabled when it receives a { WAKEUP } message and it requires the identity of the voter it has to take over . Finally , it is assumed that once a voter receives a control message with the identity of the spare , it has to initiate a reconfiguration of the TMR such that the failed voter is switched out of and the spare is switched in the system . Table 7 shows a recovery section that specifies what to do when task { VOTER1 } fails . The user needs to supply a section like the one in lines 8 – 12 for each voting task . Once the specification has been completed , the user can translate it , by means of the art program , into a pseudo-code whose basic blocks are the r-codes ( see Table 8 ) . A textual representation of the r-codes is also produced ( see Table 9 ) . Other than syntax errors , art catches a number of semantic inconsistencies which are reported to the user – as an example , a non-sense request , such as asking the phase of a node , gives rise to the following response : bash-2 . 02 $ art - i . ariel - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0f 25-Jul-2000 , ( c ) K.U.

The ariel Recovery Interpreter . This section briefly describes the ariel recovery interpreter , RINT . Basically RINT is a virtual machine executing r-codes . Its algorithm is straightforward : Each time a new error or burst of errors is detected , • it executes the r-codes one triplet at a time ; / ************************************************************* * * * Header file trl . h * * * * Hardwired set of r-codes for Ariel file ariel * * Written by art ( v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 ) on Fri Aug 18 2000 * * ( c ) Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 1999 , 2000 . * * * ************************************************************* / # ifndef T R L H # define T R L H 10 # include "" rcode . h "" # define RCODE CARD 15 / * total number of r-codes * / rcode t rcodes [ ] = { / * line # * / / * opcode * / / * operand 1 * / / * operand 2 * / / * 0 * / { R INC NEST , − 1 , − 1 } , 0 , − 1 } , / * 1 * / { R STRPHASE , / * 2 * / { R COMPARE , 1 , 9999 } , / * 3 * / { R FALSE , 10 , − 1 } , 18 , 0 } , / * 4 * / { R STOP , / * 5 * / { R PUSH , 18 , − 1 } , 18 , 3 } , / * 6 * / { R SEND , 0 , − 1 } , / * 7 * / { R PUSH , 18 , 3 } , / * 8 * / { R SEND , / * 9 * / { R PUSH , 3 , − 1 } , / * 10 * / { R SEND , 18 , 1 } , / * 11 * / { R PUSH , 3 , − 1 } , / * 12 * / { R SEND , 18 , 2 } , / * 13 * / { R DEC NEST , − 1 , − 1 } , / * 14 * / { R OANEW , 1 , − 1 } , / * 15 * / { R STOP , − 1 , − 1 } , } ; Table 6 : The beginning of header file trl . h , produced by art specifying option "" - s "" .

RINT plays an important role within the RεL architecture – its main objective is establishing and managing a causal connection between the entities of the Ariel language ( identifiers of nodes , tasks , and groups of tasks ) and the corresponding components of the system and of the target application . This causal connection is supported by the Backbone and its DB . In particular , each atom regarding one or more entities is translated at run-time into one or more DB queries . Under the hypothesis that the DB reflects – with a small delay – the actual state of the system , the truth value of the clauses on the entities of the language will have a large probability to tally with the truth value of the assertions on the corresponding components of the system . Furthermore , by means of RINT , symbolic actions on the entities are translated into actual commands on the components . These commands are then managed by the Backbone as described in Fig. 4 . The RINT task is available and disabled on each Backbone assistant while it is enabled on the Backbone manager . Only one execution process is allowed . RINT has the architecture of a stack-based machine – a run-time stack is used bash-2 . 02 $ art - i ariel - v - s Ariel translator , v2 . 0g 03-Aug-2000 , ( c ) K.U. Leuven 1999 , 2000 .

In a future release of RINT , the run-time stack shall also be used as a means for communicating information between actions . For any r-code being executed , a message will be broadcast to the non-faulty assistants . Next r-code will only be executed when all the non-faulty assistants acknowledge the receipt of this message and update their stack accordingly .

It allows error recovery to be expressed in terms of recovery strategies , i.e. , the lightweight code fragments described in Chapter 6 . At run time , the middleware orchestrates their execution . This section reports on the integration of diferent recovery scripts into a distributed run-time environment applied to the embedded automation system of a primary substation . An instrumented automata-based design environment allows the application to be deployed on a heterogeneous platform with several real-time operating systems . While the middleware detects the errors and selects the correct recovery scripts to be executed , the application functionality is maintained through system reconfiguration or graceful degradation . The added value comes from the flexibility to modify recovery strategies without requiring major modifications to the application , while tolerating the same physical faults as in the dedicated hardware solutions . 4.1 Introduction Industrial distributed embedded systems such as those used in the control and automation of electrical energy infrastructures rely on off-the-shelf components and protocols to ensure cost-efficient exploitation ( Caird , 1997 ; Dy-Liacco , 2002 ) . As a particular application can be deployed on a variety of hardware targets ( with different sets of sensors and actuators attached ) and within different environments ( e.g. with different levels of electro-magnetic interference ) , flexibility is needed both to instantiate the application functions appropriately and to react adequately to disturbances to the information and communication infrastructure on which the application is running . For instance , system reconfiguration and recovery may be different , depending on which I / O devices are connected to the different parts of the distributed controllers . More generally , adaptability is required to modify fault tolerance strategies depending on the environment . The DepAuDE architecture deploys a set of middleware modules to provide fault tolerance by exploiting the embedded systems distributed hardware and by separating functional behavior from the recovery strategy , i.e. , the set of actions to be executed when an error is detected . This architecture has been integrated in an innovative demonstrator of a Primary Substation Automation System , i.e. the embedded hardware and software in a substation for electricity distribution , connecting high voltage lines ( HV ) to medium voltage ( MV ) lines over transformers . The Primary Substation Automation System requires protection , control , monitoring and supervision capabilities . It is representative of many applications with dependability requirements in the energy field ( Gargiuli , Mirandola , & et al. , 1981 ) . As mentioned already in Chapter 4 , the major source of faults in the system is electro-magnetic interference caused by the process itself ( opening and closing of HV / MV switchgear ) in spite of the attention paid to designing for electromagnetic compatibility . Software and hardware faults in the automation system have to be considered as well . These cause errors in communication , execution and memory subsystems . In the ongoing renewal of electric infrastructures in Europe , utility companies are replacing their dedicated hardware-based fault tolerance solutions by commercial , interconnected platforms . This trend is motivated by the growing need for more functionality : Development of new , dedicated ( hardware-based ) solutions is considered too expensive and not flexible enough to keep up with the evolving requirements of the liberalized electricity market . The required dependability is reached by exploiting hardware redundancy in the distributed platform , combined with software-implemented fault tolerance solutions at the application and at the middleware level . Although software-based fault tolerance may have less coverage than hardware-based solutions , this was not considered inhibitive , because the physical ( electrical , non-programmable ) protection in the plant continues to act , as a last resort , as a safeguard for non-covered faults16 . Besides , high-quality software engineering and extensive on-site testing remain important to avoid the introduction of design faults that could hamper mission-critical services . This section presents the experience of integrating this DepAuDE software architecture into an application developed with the ASFA distributed run-time environment , a prototypic embedded control system for a primary substation . According to the approach proposed here , support for allocation of tasks to components , for reactions to detected errors and for maintainability of the fault tolerance strategy is accomplished by using the configuration-and-recovery language ariel introduced in Chapter 6 , which was developed in the framework of project TIRAN and later became is a key component of the DepAuDE architecture . In what follows we describe in Sect . 4.2 the DepAuDE assumptions and models , in Sect . 4.3 the Primary Substation Automation System application and in Sect . 4.3 the instantiation of the DepAuDE architecture therein . Section 4.4 concludes with a qualitative evaluation of the experience . 4.2 Assumptions and Models DepAuDE relies on the following assumptions : • Fault model and failure semantics : A single physical fault affects execution or communication entities ( tasks , nodes , links ) . Experiments confirm that EMI affects only the entity to which the responsible I / O element is connected ( Gargiuli et al. , 1981 ) . Depending on the underlying hardware and RTOS ( for instance , whether a memory management unit is available or not ) , a fault containment region is a task or node . Crash failure semantics ( fail-silent behavior ) is assumed for the fault containment region . • System model : A synchronous system model is assumed ( i.e. known and bounded processing delays , communication delays , clock differences and clock drifts , as explained in more detail in Chapter 2 ) . As mentioned already , this is realistic for the set of targeted real-time automation applications , because of their implementation on dedicated systems . • Communication , provided by a Basic Services Library similar to the one designed in the project TIRAN , is assumed to be perfect ( no lost messages , no duplicates , keeping message order ) . In order to increase the coverage for this assumption , a set of mechanisms such as the EFTOS Fault Tolerant Communication tasks described in Chapter 3 can be employed or developed in a similar way . • The communication mechanism targets groups of tasks , that is , a multicast service is prescribed to be available , whose behavior is assumed to be atomic : When a message is sent to a group of tasks , the either all the non-crashed processes receive it or none of them . If this assumption coverage is too low , dedicated atomic multicast support and group membership functions can be added . The DepAuDE middleware supports the reintegration of the basic services library and of the DepAuDE fault tolerance mechanisms ( a concept also derived from the TIRAN project ) . Furthermore it can reload application tasks . The application in itself is responsible for reintegrating these restarted tasks into the ongoing execution , as no checkpoint / restore mechanisms are included . 4.3 Case Study The Local Control Level module is a Primary Substation Automation System component providing control and protection functions for the primary substation , as well as an interface to the operator and – over the inter-site network – to remote control systems and remote operators . The Local Control Level controls the switches to the two HV / MV transformers , the switch connecting the Red MV bar ( on the left ) to the Green MV bar ( on the right ) , as well as switches local to the MV lines ( Figure 8 ) . The pilot application implements two functions from the Local Control Level module : automatic power resumption ( function1 ) and parallel transformers ( function2 ) . Function1 allows automatic power resumption when a HV / MV transformer goes down , e.g. triggered by internal protection ( temperature too high , oil alarm , ... ) . It disconnects the MV lines connected to the busbar of the transformer , computes the load carried by the transformer just before the event happened , and if possible , causes the remaining transformer to take the entire load , as e.g. in the following scenario : • ( Initially ) Red transformer carries 32 MVA ( 8 lines of 4 MVA ) and Green transformer 24 MVA ( 8 x 3 MVA ) ; the switches connecting the Red and Green bars to the transformers are closed ; the switch connecting the Green MV bar to the Red MV bar is open . • ( Anomaly ) An internal protection mechanism shuts down the Green transformer , and its power drops from 24 MVA to zero . The switch connecting the Green bar to the Green transformer opens . ( The switch connecting the Red bar to the Red transformer remains closed and the switch connecting the two bars remains open . ) • ( Reaction ) The switch connecting the Green bar to the Red bar receives the command to close . It closes 1 execution cycle ( 100 ms ) later and the load carried by the Red transformer rises to 56 MVA . Function2 ( parallel transformers ) consists of a series of automatic actions , assisting remote operators . As an example , an operator can request to switch on a transformer and function2 translates this request into a specific sequence of commands . Such a re-insertion scenario may be applied some time after transformer exclusion . System Setup The Primary Substation Automation System application has been developed using a proprietary , automata-based , design environment based on the specification technique ASFA . Application development consists of several steps : • Function1 and function2 are extracted from the Primary Substation Automation System application and specified through the ASFA Graphical Editor , obtaining a tabular description of the pilot application . • These ASFA tables are processed by the ASFA-C Translator , producing a target-independent C-code version of the application , and by the ASFA Partitioner , allowing an application to be mapped to a single task or decomposed into a set of tasks ( Ciapessoni & Maestri , 2001 ) . The single task version has been used for the functional test of the application on a single host node , while a four-task version was selected for testing on a distributed system . Figure 8 : Electric circuit ( grey lines ) and control architecture ( black lines ) of the Primary Substation . Table 10 : Allocation of middleware tasks to nodes . PU stands for "" Peripheral Unit "" . • At run time , the Distributed Execution Support Module , composed of Basic Software ( BSW ) and Executive , enforces cyclic execution , typical for PLC-based automation systems ( PLC = Programmable Logic Controller ) . Robust execution is ensured by cyclically refreshing the I / O image and the non-protected memory areas , while the applications state is safeguarded by hardware or software mechanisms [ 5 ] . The Basic Software takes care of synchronization and exception handling , while the Executive supplies the RTOS interface and a set of ASFA-specific library functions . A peculiarity of the ASFA environment is that the application code is automatically obtained by translating the automata-based specification . Besides reducing the probability of introducing coding errors , this approach provides portability to all platforms supported by the Distributed Execution Support Module . As shown in Figure 9 , this pilot application was deployed on a distributed system consisting of three dedicated heterogeneous ( "" target "" ) processors for the automation functions and two standard PCs for support functions , interconnected by an Ethernet switch : • N1 and N2 : two industrial PCs ( VMIC and INOVA ) , with VxWorks as RTOS ; • N3 : A Siemens SIMATIC M7 , that is , an extended PLC with I / O modules , with RMOS32 as real-time operating system ; • N4 : A number of Linux-based standard PCs , hosting the DepAuDE Backbone ( an enhanced version of the EFTOS DIR net and of the TIRAN Backbone described in previous chapters ) ; • N5 : A Windows-NT PC with Operator Console functions . For inter-site connections ( not considered here ) , an additional node hosts the gateway software . Figure 9 : Primary Substation Automation System hardware architecture . The pilot application runs on this heterogeneous hardware equipment ; input and output from / to the field is simulated . Synchronization signals , for cyclic application execution , are generated by the internal clock of one of the nodes ( in a real set-up , they are obtained from an independent , external device ) . The following assumptions are made for the target nodes : • All three target nodes ( N1 , N2 and N3 in Table 10 ) are attached to I / O components on the field ( the PU boxes in Fig. 8 , that is , peripheral units ) . • The target node N3 handles the synchronization signal . In order to provide a backup solution in case of faults on N3 , synchronization interrupts are also available at N1 and N3 . Instantiating the DepAuDE Mechanisms on the Primary Substation Automation System . The run-time components of the DepAuDE framework are integrated into the Primary Substation Automation System pilot application ( see Table 10 ) . The fault containment region is a node . • An RMOS32 and a VxWorks implementation of the Basic Services Library tasks run on the target nodes ( N1 , N2 , N3 ) ; a Linux and WinNT version runs on the host nodes ( N4 , N5 ) . • A LAN Monitor – that is , a fault-tolerant mechanism used for detecting crashed or isolated nodes – is present on all nodes . • The DepAuDE Backbone task , responsible for the execution of the recovery strategies as described in Chapter 6 , is allocated to N4 . • Each of the three target nodes hosts an instance of the ASFA Distributed Execution Support Module , composed of Basic Software and Executive . Each instance of the Basic Software is able to act as master ( BSW M , on the master node ) or slave ( BSW S , on the slave nodes ) . The role is chosen depending on the specific system configuration . All BSW S entities make up the BSW SLAVE GROUP . The configuration with highest performance ( see below ) requires BSW M to be allocated to N3 and the BSW S processes to run on N1 and N2 . Executive process instances are identical on each processing node and they compose the EXECUTIVE GROUP . The allocation of the application tasks depends on the partitioning of the two Local Control Level functions ( function1 and function2 ) , among which there is no communication . Function2 consists of a single task , PARALLEL TRS , function1 ( automatic power resumption ) consists of three tasks : two tasks ( BUSBAR1 and BUSBAR2 ) handle low-level , I / O dependent , computations relative to the MV lines attached to each busbar ; one task , STRAT , coordinates the whole function and performs no field I / O. There is no communication between the two BUSBAR tasks , while both communicate with STRAT . The basic constraint for allocating tasks to nodes is that a task that controls a specific plant component should be allocated to a processor attached to that plant component ( due to I / O paths ) . As both functions of the pilot application control the same set of field components ( same transformers and switches ) , all target nodes are assumed to be connected to that portion of the field . We assume that target node N2 provides better computing performance than N1 . The start-up configuration is the optimal distribution of application tasks onto the heterogeneous hardware . The most performant configuration , Config 0 in Table 2 , does not require off-node communication among the application tasks : • no application task is allocated to N3 , whose Basic Software acts as master and handles communication with the remote control center ; • PARALLEL TRS runs on N1 ; • BUSBAR1 , BUSBAR2 , and STRAT are allocated to N2 . Table 11 : Different configurations to allocate active Primary Substation Automation System application tasks to target nodes . • Each application task has at least one standby replica task Ri on a different target node Ni ( i = 1 ... 3 ) . 4.3.1 Recovery Strategy of the Primary Substation Automation System In order to cope with temporary and permanent physical faults affecting the information and communication infrastructure of the Primary Substation Automation System , an appropriate recovery strategy has been designed and coded as a set of Ariel recovery scripts . Such strategy combines different kinds of error detection mechanisms , error recovery and system reconfiguration . Reconfiguration is statically associated to the crash of a single node . If two nodes crash simultaneously no reconfiguration is possible . The following scripts are examples of recovery actions . Example 1 . If a slave node ( e.g. , N1 ) crashes , the LAN Monitor detects this event and notifies the Backbone executing the following Ariel code : IF [ FAULTY NODE { N1 } AND RUNNING NODE { N2 } AND RUNNING NODE { N3 } AND PHASE ( TASK { BSW_M } ) == { NEW_CYCLE_PH } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N1 } SEND { CONFIG_1 } TASK { BSW_MSG_M } SEND { CONFIG_1 } GROUP { BSW_SLAVE_GROUP } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } RESTART TASK { PARALLEL_TRS_R2 } FI If the guard of the above script is fulfilled , application tasks are reconfigured as of CONFIG 1 from Table 11 . CONFIG 1 maintains the full Primary Substation Automation System functionality by transferring Parallel TRS to N2 , actually activating its spare replica . This node is able to cope with the whole computational load , as it does not need to perform communication requested by the BSW M's functions . To avoid undesired interference by the Backbone during critical phases of BSW M activity , a condition on the current execution phase ( PHASE ( TASK { BSW_M } ) == { NEW_CYCLE_PH } ) must be satisfied in conjunction with the crash test . The ISOLATE NODE action corresponds to informing other nodes that they may not accept any message from the isolated peer – even if it comes back to life – until the isolation is undone . Example 2 . If a target node ( e.g. N2 ) crashes during a different execution phase of the master Basic Software , then this error is notified by the BSW M to the Backbone ( through function RaiseEvent ( RE_BSW_error )) , causing the execution of the following ARIEL code : IF [ EVENT { RE_BSW_error } ] THEN IF [ FAULTY NODE { N2 } AND RUNNING NODE { N3 } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N2 } SEND { CONFIG_2 } TASK { BSW_MSG_M } SEND { CONFIG_2 } TASK { BSW_MSG_S1 } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } RESTART TASK { BUSBAR1_R3 } , TASK { BUSBAR2_R3 } , TASK { STRAT_R3 } RESTART TASK { PARALLEL_TRS_R1 } FI FI Hence the system is reconfigured as in Config 2 : The spare replicas of BUSBAR1 , BUSBAR2 and STRAT are activated on N3 . Example 3 . In case of a fault on target node N3 ( where BSW M is running ) , the following ARIEL code is executed , triggered by error detection by the LAN Monitor and subsequent notification to the Backbone : IF [ FAULTY NODE { N3 } AND RUNNING NODE { N1 } AND RUNNING NODE { N2 } ] THEN ISOLATE NODE { N3 } SEND { CONFIG_3 } GROUP { BSW_SLAVE_GROUP } SEND { BACKUP_MASTER } TASK { BSW_MSG_S2 } RESTART GROUP { EXECUTIVE_GROUP } STOP TASK { PARALLEL_TRS } RESTART TASK { STRAT_R1 } , TASK { BUSBAR1_R1 } , TASK { BUSBAR2_R1 } FI Figure 10 : User interface for application supervision and active task allocation . As a consequence , the function of master node is transferred to N2 and the application tasks of N2 are moved to N1 . As N1 can not support both application functions simultaneously , PARALLEL TRS is disabled , thus proceeding to a graceful degradation of the automation system ( config 3 ) . Evaluation . Other recovery strategies , such as restarting all tasks on a node after a transient fault , or shutting down the system when reconfiguration is not possible , have also been coded in ARIEL and implemented . We did not provide recovery strategies associated with a crash of N4 or N5 , because as they are not target nodes , they are not concerned with the automation control function itself ; so even if they crash , the application is not endangered . In a real deployment they could be replicated or could backup each other . Figure 10 shows the user interface of the pilot application demonstrator . 4.4 Summary and Lessons Learned The lack of flexibility that is inherent to dedicated hardware-based fault tolerance solutions makes their adoption not cost-effective in cases where similar functionality has to be deployed in several sites , each characterized by a slightly different environment . This section presented the integration of a fault-tolerance architecture based on the recovery language approach into the distributed automation system of a primary substation . The deployment of this fault tolerance middleware allows different recovery strategies to be integrated on a heterogeneous platform . Given the generality of the methods and techniques used the designed solution is applicable to a wide class of process automation systems . The following points summarize the lessons learned : • The ASFA design environment with automatic code generation provides several advantages : less development time , absence of coding errors , portable application code and possibilities for application partitioning . It is straightforward to interface it to IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices ( IED ) . • The implementation effort required to integrate the DepAuDE Basic Services Library into an ASFA application was limited ( about 2400 lines of code for the RMOS and VxWorks targets ) . The communication mechanism supplied by the DepAuDE Basic Services Library provided transparent inter-process communication among ASFA application tasks . The grouping of tasks revealed itself as a useful tool when implementing the standby replicas . Inter-processor communication among application tasks strongly influences application performance and reconfiguration time in case of faults . Therefore inter-processor data flow should be avoided if possible , or at least minimized . • The deployment of the DepAuDE architecture allowed integrating several recovery strategies on a heterogeneous platform . The separation between functional and error recovery programs provides flexibility to modify recovery strategies without requiring major modifications to the application , while tolerating the same physical faults as in the dedicated hardware solutions . 5 CONCLUSION The recovery language approach and ariel , a configuration-and-recovery language , have been discussed . First the concepts have been treated in general terms ; then , a particular context has been chosen and the concepts in that context have been deployed in the form of a prototypic architecture developed in the framework of a European project , TIRAN . Finally , a real-life example from the domain of electrical automation system has been discussed . ariel and its run-time system provide the user with a fault-tolerance linguistic structure that appears to the user as a sort of second application-level especially conceived and devoted to address the error recovery concerns . Designed by the author of this book while taking part to several European research projects , ariel is currently being used as a linguistic structure to express adaptive feedback loops .

This allowed the crash failure semantics assumption ( see Sect . 2.1.1 ) to be satisfied with less strict coverage , which translates into lower development costs for the framework . 7 Mosaic020 boards have been developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project Dipsap II ( Dipsap-II , 1997 ) by DASA / DSS and Eonic Systems . They are based on the Analog Devices ADSP-21020 DSP and the SMCS communication chip . The SMCS chip complies with the IEEE 1355 standard ( IEEE , 1995 ) and has hardware support for detecting transmission and connection errors and for higher level system protocols such as reset-at-runtime . 8 A time-out is said to be suspended when , on expiration , no alarm is executed . The corresponding entry stays in the time-out list and obeys its rules – in particular , if the timeout was cyclic , on expiration the entry is renewed . 9 An associative array ( see , for instance , ( De Florio , 1996 )) may then be used to de-reference an entity through its symbolic name . 10 In TIRAN lingo , a SocketServer is a task run on each node of the system , which is used by the TIRAN BSL for managing off node communication ( via UDP sockets ) and for local dispatching of remote messages . This is a well-known technical solution which is used , e.g. , in PVM , where a single component , pvmd ( PVM daemon ) , is launched on each node of a PVM cluster to manage global tasks ( Geist et al. , 1994 ) . 11 A number of voting techniques have been generalized in ( Lorczak , Caglayan , & Eckhardt , 1989 ) to "" arbitrary N - version systems with arbitrary output types using a metric space framework "" . To use these algorithms , a metric function can be supplied by the user so to compare any two votes . Such a function is called a "" metric "" and has a fixed prototype , the one of function strcmp of the C standard library function – in the example , a function called int cmp is selected . The object code of this function must be available and addressable when compiling the target application . See Chapter 3 for more details on this . 12 Here and in the following , context-free grammars are used in order to describe syntax rules . The syntax used for describing those rules is that of the YACC ( Johnson , 1975 ) parser generator . Appendix A to Chapter 11 describes YACC in detail . Terminal symbols such as GT are in capital letters . They are considered as intuitive and their definition ( in this case , string "" > "" ) in general will not be supplied . 13 These services are obtained via specific function calls to the level-1 . 2 BT ( see the edge from RINT to those BT in Fig. 2 ) . Such BT , in turn , can either execute , through the BSL , a kernel-level function for stopping processes – if available – or send a termination signal to the involved processes . The actual choice is taken transparently , and RINT only calls one or more times either a TIRAN Stop Task or a TIRAN Stop Node function . 14 This service is obtained as described in the previous footnote . Depending on the characteristics of the adopted platform , isolation can be reached either through support at the communication driver or kernel level , or as follows : when a task opens a connection , a reference to a given object describing the connection is returned to both the user code and the 2 For local component of the Backbone . Action ISOLATE simply substitutes this object with another one , the methods of which prevent that task to communicate . This explains the third application-specific assumption of Sect . 2.1.1 . 15 For instance , condition "" DEADLOCKED "" and action "" CALL "" ( see the Appendix of Chapter 11 ) were added to test the inclusion in ariel , respectively , of a provision for checking whether two tasks are in a deadlock ( see ( Efthivoulidis et al. , 1998 ) for a description of this provision ) and of a hook to the function call invocation method . These two provisions were easily introduced in the grammar of ariel . 16 As we have seen in the case of the Therac-25 linear accelerator in Chapter 2 , it is often a good design choice not to remove hardware safeguards ... page FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS USING ASPECT ORIENTATION 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES This chapter resumes our survey of application-level fault-tolerance protocols considering approaches based on aspect-oriented programming . Aspect-compliant programming languages allow to treat a source code as a pliable web that the designer can weave so as to specialize or optimize towards a certain goal without having to recode it . This useful property allows separate concerns , bound complexity and enhance maintainability . Aspect programs may be used for different objectives , including non-functional properties such as dependability . To date it is not known whether aspect-orientation will actually provide satisfactory solutions for fault-tolerance in the application layer . Some researchers believe this is not the case ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) – at least for some fault-tolerance paradigm . Some preliminary studies have been carried out ( for instance in ( Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 )) , but no definitive word has been said on the matter . It is our belief that , at least for some paradigms , aspects may reveal themselves as invaluable tools to engineer the application-level of fault-tolerance services . For this reason their approach is described in this chapter . 2 2.1 FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOLS THROUGH ASPECT ORIENTATION General Ideas Aspect-oriented programming ( AOP ) ( Kiczales et al. , 1997 ) is a programming methodology and a structuring technique that explicitly addresses , at application level , the problem of the best code structure to express different , possibly conflicting design goals such as high performance , optimal memory usage , and dependability . Indeed , when coding a non-functional service within an application – for instance an application-level error handling protocol – using either a procedural or an object-oriented programming language , one is required to decompose the original goal , in this case a certain degree of dependability , into a multiplicity of fragments scattered among a number of procedures or objects . This happens because those programming languages only provide abstraction and composition mechanisms to cleanly support the functional concerns . In other words , specific non-functional goals , such as high performance , can not be easily captured into a single unit of functionality among those offered by a procedural or object-oriented language , and must be fragmented and intruded into the available units of functionality . As already observed , this code intrusion is detrimental to maintainability and portability of both functional and non-functional services ( the latter called "" aspects "" in aspect-oriented terminology ) . Such aspects tend to crosscut the system's class and module structure rather than staying , well localized , within one of these unit of functionality , e.g. , a class . This increases the complexity of the resulting systems . The main idea of aspect-oriented programming is to use : 1 . A "" conventional "" programming language ( that is , a procedural , object-oriented , or functional programming language ) to code the basic functionality . The resulting program is called a component program . The basic functional units of the component program are called components . 2 . A so-called aspect-oriented language to implement given aspects by defining specific interconnections ( "" aspect programs "" in aspect-oriented lingo ) among the components in order to address various systemic concerns . 3 . An aspect weaver , that takes as input both the aspect and the component programs and produces with those ( "" weaves "" ) an output program ( "" tangled code "" ) that addresses specific aspects . The weaver first generates a data flow graph from the component program . In this graph , nodes represent components , and edges represent data flowing from one component to another . Next , it executes the aspect programs . These programs edit the graph according to specific goals , collapsing nodes together and adjusting the corresponding code accordingly . Finally , a code generator takes the graph resulting from the previous step as its input and translates it into an actual software package written , e.g. , for a procedural language such as Java . This package is only meant to be compiled and produce the ultimate executable code fulfilling a specific aspect like , e.g. , higher dependability . In a sense , aspect-oriented programming systematically automatizes and supports the process to adapt an existing code so that it fulfils specific aspects . Aspect-oriented programming may be defined as a software engineering methodology supporting those adaptations in such a way as to guarantee that they do not destroy the original design and do not increase complexity . The original idea of aspect-oriented programming is a clever blending and generalization of the ideas that are at the basis , for instance , of optimizing compilers , program transformation systems , meta-object protocols , and even literate programming ( Knuth , 1984 ) . 2.2 2.2.1 AspectJ and Aspectwerkz AspectJ AspectJ is the first and probably most wide-spread aspect-oriented language ( Kiczales , 2000 ; Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) . Developed as a Xerox PARC project , AspectJ can be defined as an aspect-oriented extension to the Java programming language . AspectJ provides the programmer with the following constructs : • Join points , i.e. points in a program where additional behavior ( logging for example ) can be attached . They represent relevant points in a program's dynamic call graph . Join points mark the code regions that can be manipulated later one by an aspect weaver ( see above ) . In AspectJ , these points can be – method executions , – constructor calls , – constructor executions , – field accesses , and – exception handlers . Join points can be expressed through pointcuts ( see below ) . • Pointcuts are a way to express join points in a program . Let us suppose for example one would need to achieve transparent logging of all the methods whose names start with string "" do "" . In AspectJ this can be expressed as pointcut doMethod ( ) : execution ( * do * ( * )) ; • An advice is the additional code ( the actual logging , for instance ) that has to be executed at the join point . In the logging example it can be implemented as follows : after ( ) returning : doMethod ( ) // log something . • Inter-type declarations provide a mechanism to change the structure of existing classes . It is possible to add methods , fields and even interfaces to existing classes without changing the class itself . For instance if one needs to log how many times a method is executed , it is possible to add a counter field to the class . AspectJ is in a sense an extension to Java and in this regard it has two important properties . The first property is that all valid Java programs are valid AspectJ programs and the second is that after transformation of the AspectJ program , it becomes a valid Java program that can be run in the Java Virtual Machine ( jvm ) . In order for AOP to work , AspectJ has an AspectJ-compiler ( ajc ) that weaves the aspects into the code . This weaving can happen at three different times : • Compile-time : ajc will compile the classes from source and produce the woven classes as output . This is the simplest approach and only necessary if the aspects are required for the code to compile ( which would not be a good approach ) . • Post-compile-time : ajc will weave existing class - and jar-files with the aspects . Post-compiletime weaving allows great flexibility as it enables us to add aspects after the original code has been compiled . • Load-time : The weaving only happens when the class loader loads the class in the environment . This requires the support from a weaving class loader and weaving agent by adding aspectjweaver . jar to the classpath . Load-time weaving allows the most flexibility as the aspects to be woven need only be known at runtime . Another extension to Java is AspectJ's support of the Design by Contract methodology ( Meyer , 1997 ) , where contracts ( Hoare , 1969 ) define a set of pre-conditions , post-conditions , and invariants , that determine how to use and what to expect from a computational entity . A study has been carried out on the capability of AspectJ as an aspect-oriented programming language supporting exception detection and handling ( Lippert & Videira Lopes , 2000 ) . It has been shown how AspectJ can be used to develop so-called "" plug-and-play "" exception handlers : libraries of exception handlers that can be plugged into many different applications . This translates into better support for managing different configurations at compile-time . This addresses one of the aspects of attribute a defined in Chapter 2 . 2.2.2 Dynamic weaving of aspects As mentioned in ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) , dynamic behavior through run-time weaving is being recognized more and more as a key property in modern aspect-oriented architectures . While early versions of AspectJ could only define joinpoints as static source code locations it is now possible to define joinpoints on the occurrence of run-time conditions . This allows activate or deactivate aspects dynamically . Many researchers believe that through this powerful syntactical framework it will be possible to tackle effectively dynamic adaptation and self-configuration . An interesting example of this trend is AspectWerkz ( Bonér & Vasseur , 2004 ; Vasseur , 2004 ) , defined by its authors as "" a dynamic , lightweight and high-performant AOP framework for Java "" ( Bonér , 2004 ) . AspectWerkz utilizes bytecode modification to weave classes at project build-time , class load time or runtime . This capability means that the actual semantics of an AspectWerkz code may vary dynamically over time , e.g. , as a response to environmental changes . This translates in a useful structure to create dependable service whose fault model changes over time , as discussed in Chapter 2 , hence characterized by an excellent a . Recently the AspectJ and AspectWerkz projects have agreed to work together as one team to produce a single aspect-oriented programming platform building on their complementary strengths and expertise . 2.3 Variations on the Main Theme : AspectC ++ and GluonJ A recent project , AspectC ++ ( AspectCpp , n.d. ) , proposes an aspect-oriented implementation of C ++ which appears to achieve most of the positive properties of the other Java-based approaches and adds to this efficiency and good performance . AspectJ and Aspectwerkz are not the only aspect-oriented languages focusing on Java : Another example is GluonJ ( GluonJ , n.d. ; Chiba & Ishikawa , 2005 ) , whose primary design goal is simplicity – a fundamental property for truly dependable systems . Quoting his author , GluonJ "" provides simple but powerful AOP constructs by using annotations in regular Java . Developers can use GluonJ as a compile-time AOP system or a load-time AOP system "" . GluonJ in particular provides its programmer with a mechanism for extending an existing class , called refinement . As mentioned in Chapter 4 , GluonJ has been written on top of Javassist , the Java Programming Assistant meta-library briefly introduced in that chapter . 3 CONCLUSION Figure 1 synthesizes the main characteristics of AOP : it allows decompose , select , and assemble components according to different design goals . This has been represented by drawing the components as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle created by the aspect program and assembled by the weaver into the actual source code . AOP addresses explicitly code re-engineering , which in principle should allow to reduce considerably maintenance costs . AOP is a relatively recent approach to software development . AOP can in principle address any application domain and can use a procedural , functional or object-oriented programming language as component language . The isolation and coding of aspects requires extra work and expertise that may be well paid back by the capability of addressing new aspects while keeping a single unmodified and general design . For the time being it is not yet possible to tell whether AOP will spread out as a programming paradigm among academia and industry the way object-oriented programming has done since the Eighties . The many qualities of AOP are currently being quantitatively assessed , both with theoretical Figure 1 : A fault-tolerant program according to an AOP system . studies and with practical experience , and results seem encouraging . Furthermore , evidence of an increasing interest in AOP is given by the large number of research papers and conferences devoted to this interesting subject . From the point of view of the dependability aspect , one can observe that AOP exhibits optimal sc ( "" by construction "" , in a sense ( Kiczales & Mezini , 2005 )) , and that recent results show that attribute a can in principle reach good values when making use of run-time weaving ( Vasseur , 2004 ) , often realized by dynamic bytecode manipulation . This work by Ostermann ( Ostermann , 1999 ) is an interesting survey on this subject . The adequacy at fulfilling attribute sa is indeed debatable also because , to date , no fault-tolerance aspect languages have been devised1 – which may possibly be an interesting research domain . Positive values for sa have been questioned , at least in the case of fault-tolerance paradigms such as transactions , which appear to be difficult to be "" aspectized "" ( Kienzle & Guerraou , 2002 ) especially because of the "" very syntactic-only nature "" of the manipulations supported by the approach . Possibly an evolution of aspects allowing semantic processing , a little like in Introspector ( Chapter 4 ) , could provide us with the ultimate tool to master the application-level complexity of fault-tolerance expression .

Accurate failure detection in asynchronous systems ( Chapter 2 ) is notoriously difficult , as it is impossible to tell whether a process has actually failed or it is just slow . Because of this , several impossibility results have been derived – see for instance the well known paper ( Fischer , Lynch , & Paterson , 1985 ) . As a consequence of these pessimistic results , many researchers have devoted their time and abilities to understanding how to reformulate the concept of system model in a fine-grained alternative way . Their goal was being able to tackle problems such as distributed consensus with the minimal requirements on the system environment . This brought to the theory of unreliable failure detectors for reliable systems , pioneered by the works of Chandra and Toueg ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . This chapter introduces these concepts and the formulation of failure detection protocols in the application layer . In particular a linguistic framework is proposed for the expression of those protocols . As a case study it is described the algorithm for failure detection used in the EFTOS DIR net and in the TIRAN Backbone – that is , the fault-tolerance managers introduced respectively in Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 . 2 FAILURE DETECTION PROTOCOLS IN THE APPLICATION LAYER In Chapter 2 the concept of system model was briefly introduced together with the main features of the classical asynchronous and synchronous system models . The former model , also known as "" time-free "" system model , is the one that is implicitly used by most non real-time services : For such systems there is no bound for the time required to execute any computation or communication step , which means that there is no way to tell whether a certain part of the system is slow or if it has failed . How to distinguish between these two cases ? The answer found by researchers is failure detectors . As cleverly expressed by Michel Raynal , failure detectors may be considered as a sort of distributed oracle for failure detection . This oracle observes the system and draws its conclusions about failures , informing those who query it . It could be regarded as a sort of middleware service for failure detection . Failure detectors are characterized by two properties : • Completeness , which is the actual detection of failures , and • Accuracy , which tells how reliable a failure detector can be in its assessments . In a sense , completeness and accuracy represent two coordinates by means of which the spectrum of all possible failure detectors can be drawn . This spectrum represents also a two-dimensional set of possible system models , a set which is much more detailed and fine-grained than the linear one hitherto available to researchers : In other words , before failure detectors , the researchers had a sort of interval defined by its two extremes , the asynchronous model ( "" I ask nothing , so I get nothing "" ) and the synchronous model ( "" I ask too much , so I ca n't get it "" ) . Partial synchronous systems are points vaguely identified within that interval . With failure detectors everything changes and one can talk of system model ( c , a ) , where ( c , a ) are the completeness and accuracy of the minimal failure detector F D ( c , a ) that can be implemented in a system obeying that model . This view has revolutionized the research on dependable distributed systems . Several and very important have been the consequences of the introduction of failure detectors . Among them the following ones are highlighted herein : • Famous impossibility results such as the impossibility to solve consensus in a fully asynchronous system ( Fischer et al. , 1985 ) , which had puzzled the research community for years , have been now understood and tamed . The correct way to solve it is to ask which is the weakest of failure detectors the underlying asynchronous system has to be equipped with in order for the consensus problem to be solved . This in turns means to be able to identify which minimal set of additional mechanisms must be available in an asynchronous system in order implement that failure detector , thus making it able to support consensus . The same reasoning can be applied to any other distributed computing problem . Clearly this is a powerful conceptual and practical tool to reason about reliable systems . • Another important consequence of introducing a theory of failure detectors is that a failure detector also reveals what are the minimal requirements necessary for a service to migrate from a system to another while keeping the desired quality of service . One of the key messages of this book is that it is important to distinguish between porting a code Construct Repeat periodically Upon t = current time Upon receive message Concurrency management NFD-E no φ no FD yes GMFD no D ∈ ♦ P yes HB yes HB-pt yes yes no yes yes no no no yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no no yes yes yes Table 1 : Syntactical constructs used in several failure detector protocols . φ is the accrual failure detector discussed in ( Hayashibara , 2004 ; Hayashibara et al. , 2004 ) . D is the eventually perfect failure detector of ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . HB is the Heartbeat detector of ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) . HB-pt is the partitiontolerant version of the Heartbeat detector . By "" Concurrency management "" it is meant co-routines , threading or forking . and porting the service that that code is meant to offer , and that the history of the relations between human beings and computers is paved of cases where erroneous software reuse has led to dreadful disasters . Failure detectors provide the designers with powerful "" lens "" through which the differences among systems and the consequences of migrations are put in the foreground . It is a pity that the awareness of the role of failure detectors in dependable software development has not been fully recognized and exploited yet in the ICT community at large . • Finally , from a theoretical point of view , failure detectors create a partial ordering among problems , which is also very important to better understand and compare the threats of dependability . Failure detection protocols are often described by their authors making use of informal pseudo-codes of their conception . Often these pseudo-codes use syntactical constructs such as repeat periodically ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) ( Aguilera , Chen , & Toueg , 1999 ) ( Bertier , Marin , & Sens , 2002 ) , at time t send heartbeat ( Chen , Toueg , & Aguilera , 2002 ; Bertier et al. , 2002 ) , at time t check whether message has arrived ( Chen et al. , 2002 ) , or upon receive ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) , together with several variants ( see Table 1 ) . Such syntactical constructs are not often found in COTS programming languages such as C or C ++ , which leads us to the problem of translating the protocol specifications into running software prototypes using one such standard language . Furthermore the lack of a formal , well-defined , and standard form to express failure detection protocols often leads their authors to insufficiently detailed descriptions . Those informal descriptions in turn complicate the reading process and exacerbate the work of the implementors , which becomes time-consuming , error-prone and at times frustrating . Several researchers and practitioners are currently arguing that failure detection should be made available as a network service ( Hayashibara et al. , 2004 ; Renesse , Minsky , & Hayden , 1998 ) . No such service exists to date . Lacking such tool , it is important to devise methods to express in the application layer of our software even the most complex failure detection protocols in a simple and natural way . In the following one such method is introduced , which is based on the class of time-outs ( i.e. , objects that postpone a certain function call by a given amount of time ) that has been introduced in Chapter 6 . As mentioned already , this feature allows convert time-based events into non time-based events such as message arrivals . It also allows easily express the constructs in Table 1 in standard C1 . In some cases , our class allows get rid of concurrency management requirements such as co-routines or thread management libraries . The formal character of our method allows rapid-prototype the algorithms with minimal effort . This is proved through a Literate Programming ( Knuth , 1984 ) framework that produces from a same source file both the description meant for publication and a software skeleton to be compiled in standard C or C ++ . The rest of this chapter is structured as follows : Section 2.1 introduces our tool . In Sect . 2.1.2 our tool is put to work and used to express three classical failure detectors . Section 2.2 is a case study describing a software system built with our tool . Our conclusions are drawn in Sect . 2.3 . 2.1 TOM : A Time-outs Management System This section briefly describes the architecture of our time-out management system ( TOM ) . The TOM class appears to the user as a couple of new types and a library of functions . Table 2 provides an idea of the client-side protocol of our tool . To declare a time-out manager , the user needs to define a pointer to a TOM object and then call function tom init . Argument to this function is an alarm , i.e. , the function to be called when a time-out expires : int alarm ( TOM * ) ; tom = tom init ( alarm ) ; The first time function tom init is called a custom thread is spawned . That thread is the actual time-out manager . At this point the user is allowed to define his or her time-outs . This is done via type timeout t and function tom declare ; an example follows : timeout t t ; tom declare ( & t , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TID , TSUBID , DEADLINE ) . In what above , time-out t is declared as : • A cyclic time-out ( renewed on expiration ; as opposed to TOM NON CYCLIC , which means "" removed on expiration "" ) , 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . / * declarations * / TOM * tom ; timeout t t1 , t2 , t3 ; int my alarm ( TOM * ) , another alarm ( TOM * ) ; / * definitions * / tom ← tom init ( my alarm ) ; tom declare ( & t1 , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TIMEOUT1 , SUBID1 , DEADLINE1 ) ; tom declare ( & t2 , TOM NON CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , TIMEOUT2 , SUBID2 , DEADLINE2 ) ; tom declare ( & t3 , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET DISABLE , TIMEOUT3 , SUBID3 , DEADLINE3 ) ; tom set action ( & t3 , another alarm ) ; / * insertion * / tom insert ( tom , & t1 ) , tom insert ( tom , & t2 ) , tom insert ( tom , & t3 ) ; / * control * / tom enable ( tom , & t3 ) ; tom set deadline ( & t2 , NEW DEADLINE2 ) ; tom renew ( tom , & t2 ) ; tom delete ( tom , & t1 ) ; / * deactivation * / tom close ( tom ) ; Table 2 : An example of usage of the TOM class . In 1 . a time-out list pointer and three time-out objects are declared , together with two alarm functions . In 2 . the time-out list and the time-outs are initialized , and an alarm differing from the default one is attached to time-out t3 . Insertion is carried out at point 3 . At 4 . , some control operations are performed on the list , namely , time-out t3 is enabled , a new deadline value is specified for time-out t2 which is then renewed to activate the changing , and time-out t1 is deleted . The whole list is finally deactivated in 5 . • enabled ( only enabled time-outs "" fire "" , i.e. , call their alarm on expiration ; an alarm is disabled with TOM SET DISABLE ) , • with a deadline of DEADLINE local clock ticks before expiration . A time-out t is identified as a couple of integers , in the above example TID and TSUBID . This is done because in our experience it is often useful to distinguish instances of classes of time-outs . TID is used for the class identifier and TSUBID for the particular instance . A practical example of this is given in Sect . 2.2 . Once defined , a time-out can be submitted to the time-out manager for insertion in its running list of time-outs – see ( De Florio & Blondia , 2006 ) for further details on this . From the user point of view , this is managed by calling function tom insert ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Note that a time-out might be submitted to more than one time-out manager . After successful insertion an enabled time-out will trigger the call of the default alarm function after the specified deadline . If that time-out is declared as TOM CYCLIC the time-out would then be re-inserted . Other control functions are available : a time-out can be temporarily suspended while in the time-out list via function tom disable ( TOM * , timeout t * ) and ( re - ) enabled via function tom enable ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Furthermore , the user is allowed to specify a new alarm function via tom set action ) and a new deadline via tom set deadline ; he or she can delete a time-out from the list via tom delete ( TOM * , timeout t * ) , and renew2 it via tom renew ( TOM * , timeout t * ) . Finally , when the time-out management service is no longer needed , the user should call function tom close ( TOM * ) , which possibly halts the time-out manager thread should no other client be still active . 2.1.1 Requirements A fundamental requirement of our model is that processes must have access to some local physical clock giving them the ability to measure time . The availability of means to control the priorities of processes is also an important factor to reducing the chances of late alarm execution . Another assumption is that the alarm functions are small grained both in CPU and I / O usage so as to not interfere "" too much "" with the tasks of the TOM . Finally , asynchronous , non-blocking primitives to send and receive messages are assumed to be available . 2.1.2 Discussion In this section it is shown that the syntactical constructs in Table 1 can be expressed in terms of our class of time-outs . This is done by considering three classical failure detectors and providing their time-out based specifications in the cweb Literate Programming framework ( Knuth , 1984 ) . Let us consider the classical formulation of eventually perfect failure detector D ( Chandra & Toueg , 1996 ) . The main idea of the protocol is to require each task to send a "" heartbeat "" to its fellows and maintain a list of tasks suspected to have failed . A task identifier q enters the list of task p if no heartbeat is received by p during a certain amount of time , ∆ p ( q ) , initially set to a default value . This value is increased when late heartbeats are received . The basic structure of D is that of a co-routine with three concurrent processes , two of which execute a task periodically while the third one is triggered by the arrival of a message : The repeat periodically in Task 1 is called a "" multiplicity 1 "" repeat , because indeed a single action ( sending a "" p-is-alive "" message ) has to be tracked , while the one in Task 2 is called a "" multiplicity q "" repeat , which requires to check q events . Our reformulation of the above code is as follows : where tasks and actions are defined as follows : The following observations can be drawn : • Our syntax is less abstract than the one adopted in the classical formulation . Indeed it was deliberately chosen a syntax very similar to that of programming languages like C and its derivatives . Behind the lines , a similar semantics is also assumed . • Our syntax is more strongly typed : We have deliberately chosen to define ( most of ) the objects our code deals with . • Set-wise operations such as union , complement or membership have been systematically avoided by transforming sets into arrays as , e.g. , in outputp ← outputp U { q } , which was changed into outputp [ q ] = PRESENT . • The abstract constructs repeat periodically have been systematically rewritten as one or more time-outs ( depending on their multiplicity ) . Each of these time-out has an associated action that sends one message to the client process , p. This means that 1 . time-related event "" it 's time to send p-is-alive to all "" becomes event "" message REPEAT TASK1 has arrived . "" 2 . time-related events "" it 's time to check whether q-is-alive has arrived "" becomes event "" message ( REPEAT TASK2 , id = q ) has arrived . "" • Due to the now homogeneous nature of the possible events ( message arrivals ) a single process may manage those events through a multiple selection statement ( a switch ) . The requirement for a co-routine has been removed . Through the Literate Programming approach and a compliant tool such as cweb ( Knuth & Levy , 1993 ; Knuth , 1984 ) it is possible to further improve our reformulation . As well known , the cweb tool allows have a single source code to produce a pretty printable TEX documentation and a C file ready for compilation and testing . In our experience this link between these two contexts can be very beneficial : testing or even simply using the code provides feedback on the specification of the algorithm , while the improved specification may reduce the probability of design faults and in general increase the quality of the code . Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively show a reformulation for the HB failure detector for partitionable networks ( Aguilera et al. , 1999 ) and for the group membership failure detector ( Raynal & Tronel , 1999 ) produced with cweb . A full description of these protocols is out of the scope of this book – for that the reader is referred to the above cited articles . The focus here is mainly on the syntactical constructs used in them and our reformulations , which include simple translations for the syntactical constructs in Table 1 in terms of our time-out API . A case worth noting is that of the group membership failure detector : Here the authors mimic the availability of a cyclic time-out service but intrude its management in their formulation – which could be avoided using our approach . 2.2 A Development Experience : The DIR net As mentioned in Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 , at the core of the software fault tolerance strategies of several European projects ( Deconinck , De Florio , Varvarigou , Verentziotis , & Botti , 2002 ; Botti et al. , 2000 ; Deconinck , De Florio , Dondossola , & Szanto , 2003 ) there is a distributed application Figure 1 : Reformulation of the HB failure detector for partitionable networks . Special symbols such as τ and Dp are caught by cweb and translated into legal C tokens via its "" @ f "" construct . The expression m . path [ q ] ≤ PRESENT means "" q appears at most once in path "" . Figure 2 : Reformulation of the group membership failure detector . called "" DIR net "" ( De Florio , 1998 ) or "" Backbone "" . In this section that application is described ( let us call it just as the DIR net ) and it is reported on how it was designed and developed by means of the TOM system . The DIR net has been described as a fault-tolerant network of failure detectors connected to other peripheral error detectors ( called Dtools in what follows ) . Objective of the DIR net is to ensure consistent fault tolerance strategies throughout the system and play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the Dtools ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 2000 ) . The DIR net consists of four classes of components . Each processing node in the system runs an instance of a so-called I-am-alive Task ( IAT ) plus an instance of either a DIR Manager ( DIR-M ) , or a DIR Agent ( DIR-A ) , or a DIR Backup Agent ( DIR-B ) . A DIR-A gathers all error detection messages produced by the Dtools on the current processing node and forwards them to the DIR-M and the DIR-B's . A DIR-B is a DIR-A which also maintains its messages into a database located in central memory . It is connected to DIR-M and to the other DIR-B 's and is eligible for election as a DIR - M. A DIR-M is a special case of DIR - B. Unique within the system , the DIR-M is the one component responsible for running error recovery strategies – see ( De Florio , 2000 ; De Florio & Deconinck , 2002 ) for a description of the latter . Let us use DIR-x to mean "" the DIR-M or a DIR-B or a DIR - A. "" An important design goal of the DIR net is that of being fault-tolerant . This is accomplished also through a failure detection protocol that will be described Time-out tIA SET tIA CLR Caller DIR-x IAT Action On TimeNow + dIA SET do send mIA SET ALARM to Caller On TimeNow + dIA CLR do send mIA CLR ALARM to IAT Cyclic ? Yes Yes Table 3 : Description of time-outs tIA SET and tIA CLR . Message mIA SET ALARM mIA CLR ALARM Receiver DIR-x IAT k Explanation Time to set IAF Time to check IAF Action IAF ← TRUE if ( IAF ≡ FALSE ) SendAll ( mTEIF , k ) else IAF ← FALSE , Table 4 : Description of messages mIA SET ALARM and mIA CLR ALARM . in the rest of this section . 2.2.1 The DIR net failure detection protocol Our protocol consists of a local part and a distributed part . Each of them is realized through our TOM class . DIR net protocol : local component . As already mentioned , each processing node hosts a DIR-x and an IAT . These two components run a simple algorithm : they share a local Boolean variable , the I 'm Alive Flag ( IAF ) . The DIR-x has to set periodically the IAF to TRUE while the IAT periodically has to check that this has indeed occurred and reverts IAF to FALSE . If the IAT finds the IAF set to FALSE it broadcasts message mTEIF ( "" this entity is faulty "" ) . The just mentioned cyclic tasks can be easily modeled via two time-outs , tIA SET and tIA CLR , described in Table 3 and Table 4 ( TimeNow being the system function returning the current value of the clock register ) . Note that the time-outs' alarm functions do not clear / set the flag – doing so a hung DIR-x would go undetected . On the contrary , these functions trigger the transmission of messages that once received by healthy components trigger the execution of the meant actions . The following is a pseudo-code for the IAT algorithm : The IAT k executes as follows : timeout t tIA CLR ; msg t activationMessage , m ; tom declare ( ❀ tIA CLR , TOM CYCLIC , TOM SET ENABLE , IAT CLEAR TIMEOUT , 0 , dIA CLR ) ; tom set action ( ❀ tIA CLR , actionSendmIA CLR ALARM ) ; tom insert ( ❀ tIA CLR ) ; Receive ( activationMessage ) ; forever { Receive ( m ) ; if ( m . type ≡ mIA CLR ALARM ) if ( IAF ≡ TRUE ) IAF ← FALSE ; else SendAll ( mTEIF , k ) ; delete timeout ( ❀ tIA CLR ) ; } actionSendmIA CLR ALARM ( ) { Send ( mIA CLR ALARM , IAT k ) ; } The time-out formulation of the DIR-x is given in next section . 2.2.2 DIR net protocol : distributed component The resilience of the DIR net to crash faults comes from the DIR-M and the DIR-B 's running a distributed algorithm of failure detection . Algorithm DIR - M. Let us call mid the node hosting the DIR-M and b the number of processing nodes that host a DIR - B. The DIR-M has to send cyclically a mMIA ( "" Manager-Is-Alive "" ) message to all the DIR-B 's each time time-out tMIA A expires – this is shown in the right side of Fig. 3 . Obviously this is a multiplicity b "" repeat "" construct , which can be easily managed through a cyclic time-out with an action that signals that a new cycle has begun . In this case the action is "" send a message of type mMIA A ALARM to the DIR - M. "" The manager also expects periodically a ( mTAIA , i ) message ( "" This-Agent-Is-Alive "" ) from each node where a DIR-B is expected to be running . This is easily accomplished through a vector of ( tTAIA A , ~ ı ) time-outs . The left part of Fig. 3 shows this for node i . When time-out ( tTAIA A , p ) expires it means that no ( mTAIA , p ) message has been received within the current period . In this case the DIR-M enters a so called "" suspicion period "" . During such period the manager has to try to tell a late DIR-B from a crashed one . This is done by inserting a non-cyclic time-out , namely ( tTEIF A , p ) . During the suspicion period only one out of the following three events may take place : 1 . A late ( mTAIA , p ) is received . 2 . A ( mTEIF , p ) from IAT at node p is received . 3 . Nothing comes in and the time-out expires . In case 1 , one gets out of the suspicion period , concludes that DIR-B at node p was simply late and goes back waiting for the next ( mTAIA , p ) . A wrong deduction at this point is possible and will be detected in one of next cycles . Adjustments of the deadlines are possible but not dealt with here for the sake of simplicity of description . Figure 3 : The algorithm of the DIR - M. If 2 is the case the remote component is assumed to have crashed though its node is still working properly , as the IAT on that node still gives signs of life . Therefore an error recovery step is initiated . This includes sending a "" WAKEUP "" message to the remote IAT so that it spawns another DIR-B on that node . In case 3 the entire node is assumed to have crashed and node recovery is initiated . Underlying assumption of our algorithm is that the IAT is so simple that if it fails then the whole node can be safely assumed to have failed . Algorithm DIR - B. This algorithm is also divided into two concurrent tasks . In the first one DIR-B on node i has to cyclically send ( mTAIA , i ) messages to the manager , either in piggybacking or on expiring of time-out tTAIA B. This is represented in the right side of Fig. 4 . The DIR-B 's in turn periodically expect a mMIA message from the DIR - M. As evident when comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 4 , the DIR-B algorithm is very similar to the one of the manager : also DIR-B enters a suspicion period when its manager does not appear to respond quickly enough – this period is managed via time-out tTEIF B , the same way as in DIR - M. Also in this case one can get out of this state in one out of three possible ways : either 1 . a late ( mMIA B ALARM , mid ) is received , or 2 . a ( mTEIF , mid ) sent by the IAT at node mid is received , or 3 . nothing comes in and the time-out expires . In case 1 one gets out of the suspicion period , concludes that manager was simply late , goes back to normal state and starts waiting for the next ( mMIA , mid ) message . Also in this case , a wrong deduction shall be detected in next cycles . If 2 , one concludes that the manager has crashed though its node is still working properly , as its IAT acted as expected . Therefore a manager recovery phase is initiated similarly to the DIR-B recovery step described in Sect . 2.2.2 . In case 3 the node of the manager is assumed to have crashed , elect a new manager among the DIR-B's , and perform a node recovery phase . Table 5 summarizes the DIR-M and DIR-B algorithms .

Figure 4 : Algorithm DIR - B. The DIR net was developed using the Windows TIRAN libraries ( Botti et al. , 2000 ) and the cweb system of structured documentation . Figures 5 – 8 show the DIR net at work in a system consisting of just a DIR-M and a DIR - B. Two ancillary processes called SocketServers are used to manage UDP communication . 2.2.3 Special services Configuration . The management of a large number of time-outs may be an error prone task . To simplify it , the configuration language of Chapter 6 was used . Figure 9 shows an example of configuration script to specify the structure of the DIR net ( in this case , a four node system with three DIR-B 's deployed on nodes 1 – 3 and the DIR-M on node 0 ) and of its time-outs . A translator produces the C header files to properly initialize an instance of the DIR net . Figure 5 : A DIR net consisting of a DIR-B ( top left picture ) and a DIR-M ( bottom left ) . Pictures on the right portray the "" SocketServers "" , i.e. ancillary processes managing communication . Figure 6 : Time-out tTAIA A expires , meaning that expected message mTAIA has not been received within the corresponding deadline dTAIA A. As a result , tTEIF A is inserted . This corresponds to action "" At time TimeNow + dTEIF A check whether mTEIF has arrived "" . Figure 7 : A DIR-B is stopped . Time-out tTEIF A expires and as a result , the assistant is tagged as "" faulty "" . Figure 8 : The DIR-B is restarted . As a result , it begins sending mTAIA messages . Upon receiving , the manager tags the assistant as "" OK . "" Figure 9 : An excerpt from the configuration script of the DIR net . 2.2.4 Fault injection Time-outs may also be used to specify fault injection actions with fixed or pseudo-random deadlines . In the DIR net this is done as follows . First the time-out is defined : # ifdef INJECT tom_declare ( & inject , TOM_NON_CYCLIC , TOM_SET_ENABLE , INJECT_FAULT_TIMEOUT , i , INJECT_FAULT_DEADLINE ) ; tom_insert ( tom , & inject ) ; # endif The alarm of this time-out sends the local DIR-x a message of type "" INJECT FAULT TIMEOUT "" . Figure 10 shows an excerpt from the actual main loop of the DIR-M in which this message is dealt with . Fault tolerance . A service such as TOM is indeed a single-point-of-failure in that a failed TOM brings the local DIR net components to the impossibility to perform their failure detection protocols . Such a case would be indistinguishable from that of a crashed node by the other DIR net components . As well known from , e.g. , ( Inquiry , 1996 ) , a single design fault in TOM's implementation could bring the system to a global failure . Nevertheless , the isolation of a service for time-out management may pave the Figure 10 : An excerpt from the cweb source of the DIR net : the beginning of Code Section 18 ( loop of the DIR-M ) . way for a cost-effective adoption of multiple-version software fault tolerance techniques ( Lyu , 1998 ) such as the well known recovery block ( Randell & Xu , 1995 ) or N - version programming ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1995 ) . No such technique has been adopted in the current implementation of TOM . 2.3 Conclusions A tentative lingua franca for the expression of failure detection protocols was introduced . TOM encloses the advantages of being simple , elegant and not ambiguous . Obvious are the many positive relapses that would come from the adoption of a standard , semi-formal representation with respect to the current Babel of informal descriptions – easier acquisition of insight , faster verification , and greater ability to rapid-prototype software systems . Given the current lack of a network service for failure detection , the availability of standard methods to express failure detectors in the application layer is an important asset : a tool like the one described in this chapter isolates and crystallizes a part of the complexity required to express failure detection protocols . This complexity becomes transparent of the designer – which saves development times and costs – and eligible for cost-effective optimizations . Separation of design concerns is not among the design goals of our tool , which provides the programmer with a library . Hence , our tool is characterized by bad . is not applicable , as TOM only targets one fault-tolerance provisions , i.e. failure detectors . No is considered , but in principle the server side of our system could be designed with adaptivity in mind , e.g. , masking the actual number of failure detectors being used . Similar considerations apply to the DIR net . As a final remark it is noteworthy to remark how , at the core of our design choices , is the selection of C and literate programming , which proved to be invaluable tools to reach our design goals . Nevertheless these choices may turn into intrinsic limitations for the expressiveness of the resulting language . In particular , they enforce a syntactical and semantic structure , that of the C programming language , which may be regarded as a limitation by those researchers who are not accustomed to that language . At the same time we would like to remark also that those very choices allow us a straightforward translation of our constructs into a language like Promela ( Holzmann , 1991 ) , which resembles very much a C language augmented with Hoare's CSP ( Hoare , 1978 ) . Accordingly , our future work in this framework shall include the adoption of the Promela extension of Prof. Bošnački , which allows for the verification of concurrent systems that depend on timing parameters ( Bošnački & Dams , 1998 ) . Interestingly enough , this version of Promela includes new objects , called discrete time countdown timers , which are basically equivalent to our non-cyclic time-outs . Our goal is to come up with a tool that generates from the same literate programming source ( 1 ) a pretty printout in TEX , ( 2 ) C code ready to be compiled and run , and ( 3 ) Promela code to verify some properties of the protocol . 3 CONCLUSION The role of failure detection in dependable computing has been explained . Several examples of failure detection protocols have been described in a uniform way based on the time-out management system used in TIRAN to realize the algorithm used by the Backbone to detect and tolerate crash failures of nodes and Backbone components . That algorithm has been also described with time-outs as a case study . Failure detectors are being studied intensively by many research groups throughout the world . Future work in our group at the University of Antwerp will focus on the expression of failure detection services for service-oriented architectures . References Aguilera , M.

All the approaches reported in the rest of this chapter exploit the recovery language approach introduced in Chapter 6 and couple it with other tools and paradigms described in other parts of this book . Objective of this chapter is to demonstrate how RεL can serve as a tool to further enhance some of the application-level fault-tolerance paradigms introduced in previous chapters . But why hybrid approaches in the first place ? The main reason is that joining two or more concepts and their "" system structures "" ( Randell , 1975 ) , that is , the conceptual and syntactical axioms used in disparate application-level software fault-tolerance provisions , one comes up with a tool with better Syntactical Adequacy ( the SA attribute introduced in Chapter 2 ) . As already mentioned , a wider syntactical structure can facilitate the expression of our codes , while on the contrary awkward structures often lead to clumsy , buggy applications . Hybrid approaches are often more versatile and may also inspire brand new designs . A drawback of hybrid approaches is that they are modifications of existing designs . The extra design complexity must be carefully added to prevent the introduction if design faults in the architecture . Which approaches to make use of is an important design choice . In some cases this may be under the control of the programmer : An example could be for instance , using a fault-tolerance library such as EFTOS to create a library of fault-tolerance meta-objects with OpenC ++ . Section 3 and Sect . 3 are other examples of this case . More ambitious goals would definitely require the design of new frameworks or architectures , such as it is the case for the model described in next section and the system in Sect . 5 . The first case is that of RεLinda , a model coupling RεL with generative communication , introduced in Sect . 2 . Section 3 then shows how to use RεL to enhance the resiliency of N-modular redundant systems by using spare components . A similar method is used in Sect . 4 to come up with flexible and dependable watchdog timers . Finally , Cactus is introduced – a system coupling a sort of recovery language with single-version software fault-tolerance mechanisms . 2 A DEPENDABLE PARALLEL PROCESSING MODEL BASED ON GENERATIVE COMMUNICATION AND RECOVERY LANGUAGES As already remarked , redundancy is an important ingredient at the basis of both parallel computing and dependable computing . In other words , the availability of redundancy and a proper management of the available redundancy can be exploited to reach both functional objectives , such as high performance , and non-functional goals such as the ones at the core of this book , for instance high availability and data integrity . Indeed , the truly extended use of parallel computing technologies asks for effective software engineering techniques to design , develop and maintain dependable parallel software – that is , it requires expressive programming models capable to make effective use of the available redundancy for capturing both the above classes of goals . This happens because any computing service based on parallel computing technologies must be designed in such a way as ( 1 ) to face and counterbalance the inherently lower level of dependability that characterizes any parallel hardware , due to the considerably higher probability for events such as a node's permanent or temporary failure in any such highly redundant system ; and ( 2 ) to match the involved algorithms to the target hardware platform , so as to exploit optimally the available redundancy and reach , e.g. , the expected performance . One can conclude that , in order to be able to set up parallel computing services actually capable to provide their users with the expected high quality of service , it is important that the designers have at their disposal effective structuring techniques and software engineering methodologies for developing and maintaining dependable parallel services : lacking these techniques , the complexity pertaining to the management of the purely functional aspects , i.e. , the service , the aspects related to the performance , i.e. , the parallelism , and those related to fault tolerance , would jeopardize the design of the service increasing both its development times and costs and the probability of introducing design faults . Considering all the above and the main lessons learned exposed in this book , one can conclude that a simple and coherent structuring technique for dependable and parallel services , providing straightforward and effective means to control their complexity , would be a key factor for the wide-spreading of parallel computing technologies . This chapter describes a novel software engineering methodology and structuring technique , RεLinda , whose main goals include separation of design concerns , dynamic adaptability of the service to varying environmental conditions , and expressiveness . Such technique provides a parallel programming model that couples the recovery language approach described in Chapter 5 and generative communication ( Gelernter , 1985 ) i.e. , the well-known model of communication of systems such as , for instance , Linda ( Carriero & Gelernter , 1989 ) or JavaSpaces ( Oaks & Wong , 2000 ) briefly introduced in Chapter 4 . RεLinda provides its users with a single model for both parallel and dependable programming , and it is our conjecture that this single software framework provides both the elegance of generative communication and the effectiveness of recovery languages and , as such , is a valuable design tool for the composition of parallel , and dependable , services . A prototypic implementation of some components of a RεLinda architecture took place in the framework of the ESPRIT project TIRAN , also introduced in Chapter 5 . The key characteristic of the reported technique is that it allows structure the target application into three distinct components , respectively responsible for ( 1 ) the functional service , including its performance aspects , ( 2 ) the management of the fault-tolerance provisions , and ( 3 ) the adaptation to the current environmental conditions . As such it provides another solution to the problem of an optimal expression of fault-tolerance protocol whose fault model is not fixed once and for all but changes with the actual faults being experienced . In what follows the RεLinda approach , its models and elements are described . 2.1 The RεLinda Approach This section describes the RεLinda approach . It is structured into two parts . First , the system and application models are provided in Sect . 2.1.1 . After that , in Sect . 2.1.2 , the basic ideas behind RεLinda are exposed . A key component is then described in § 2 . 1 . 3 , which also points out the key relation between the recovery language approach and RεLinda . 2.1.1 System and Application Models The target system for RεLinda is assumed to be a distributed or parallel system . Basic components of this system are the nodes , the tasks , and the communication network . In particular , • a node can be , e.g. , a workstation in a networked cluster or a processor in a MIMD parallel computer . The number of available nodes is n , n > 0 . Nodes can be commercial-off-the-shelf hardware components with no special provisions for hardware fault-tolerance . • Tasks are independent threads of execution running on the nodes . • The network system allows tasks on different nodes to communicate with each other with the same properties described in Chapter 5 for the TIRAN architecture . A general-purpose operating system ( OS ) is required on each node . No special purpose , distributed , or fault-tolerant OS is assumed to be required . The system is assumed to obey the timed asynchronous distributed system model ( Cristian & Fetzer , 1999 ) ( see Chapter 2 ) . The following assumptions characterize the user application : • the service is supplied by a parallel application ; • it is written or is to be written in a procedural or object-oriented language such as , e.g. , C or Java ; • the service specification includes non-safety-critical dependability goals ; • the target application is characterized by soft real-time requirements . In particular , performance failures ( Cristian , 1991 ) may occasionally show up during error recovery ; • communication is based on the GC model . User tasks communicate exclusively through functions with the semantics of the Linda primitives – in ( ) , out ( ) , rd ( ) , and their non-blocking versions , inp ( ) and rdp ( ) . • task management and , in particular , task creation and termination , is done respectively via a function with the semantics of the Linda primitive eval ( ) and via function lave ( ) , which terminates the matching active tuples . 2.1.2 RεLinda Herein the elements of the RεLinda approach and some key components of its architecture are described . To the performance-oriented designer , RεLinda appears as a standard Linda-like system . In addition to standard tuples , created by the user via function out ( ) , RεLinda supports a special class of tuples , called error notifications ( ENs ) . Error notifications are special , read-only tuples1 that represent error detections such as , for instance "" divide-by-zero exception caught while executing task 11 , "" sent by a trap handling tool , and have the following structure : ( "" ERROR "" , m , t , e , v [ 1 ... e ] ) , where m is an integer that identifies an error detector ( see later on ) , t is an integer that identifies a task found in error by m , e is an integer , e ≥ 0 , and v is a vector of e integers describing the current error detection . By agreement , neither function out ( ) nor function eval ( ) are allowed specify tuples with the same structure as the error notifications . This means that the programmer has no direct way to emit an error notification2 . Indeed , error notifications can only be produced by : • A set of tools addressing error detection and fault masking , collectively called "" error detectors "" ( EDs ) . EDs are tools similar to those of SwIFT ( see Chapter 3 ) or the TIRAN Dtools ( see Chapter 5 ) , and provide services such as , e.g. , watchdog timers and software voting ( a system like the EFTOS Voting Farm could be used for that , see Chapter 3 ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) 3 ; • a failing eval ( ) ; • or a failing assert ( ) , the latter being a function with the semantics of the C standard library function with the same name ( Kernighan & Ritchie , 1988 ) . On the other hand , each user task has free read-only access to the error notifications , and hence can query the current status of any task t – according to its error detectors . This can be used to unblock potentially dangerous deadlock conditions , such as two Table 1 : Scheme of execution of TS when it processes request r . 1 Begin request ( r ) : 2 if tuple type ( r ) 6 = EN then 3 insert plain tuple ( r ) 4 return SUCCESS 5 endif 6 if sender = ED then 7 8 9 10 11 12 update α-count ( r ) insert EN tuple ( r ) awake recovery interpreter ( r ) return SUCCESS endif return FAILURE tasks where each of them is waiting for the other to become available for processing – by simply specifying , as an unblocking condition , the availability of the error notification describing that the other task is being found in error . As it is for "" plain "" Linda systems , also the RεLinda architecture foresees a tuple space manager ( TS ) . The latter is a distributed application , constituted of c components , where 1 ≤ c ≤ n , each of which is located on a different node of the system . As a whole , the TS executes the algorithm of mutual suspicion , that is , the fault tolerance distributed algorithm described in Chapter 5 which allows tolerate up to c − 1 crash failures affecting either its components or the nodes hosting them . Tuples are stored by the tuple space manager into a database that is replicated on each of its c components . Each time a new request for insertion of either an error notification or a "" plain "" tuple reaches the tuple space manager , it is processed according to the following scheme , also summarized in Table 1 : • If the request pertains to a "" plain "" tuple , the latter is inserted in the tuple space . This implies updating the remote copies of the database . • Otherwise , if the ES was sent by an error detector , – first , a field of the database , called α-counter is updated ( see below for more details on this ) ; – then the error notification is inserted as a plain tuple ; and – ( 3 ) a RINT recovery interpreter is started ( see Chapter 5 for a description of RINT ) . Field α-counter is a task-specific variable that is processed according to the threshold-based statistical technique known as α-count and described in Chapter 5 . As explained there , this technique is capable of assessing whether a task is affected by a transient vs. a permanent or intermittent fault ; as such , it allows express fault-aware error recovery strategies . Apart from managing tuples and error notifications , the tuple space manager also keeps track of the current structure and state of the system , the user application , and itself . These data are used at error recovery time as described in the following text . 2.1.3 RεLinda Error Recovery Component The execution of the recovery actions is done via a fixed ( i.e. , special-purpose ) scheme , portrayed in the sequence diagram of Fig. 1 : as soon as an error is detected , a Figure 1 : Scheme of execution of a RεLinda-compliant distributed application : together with the application , two special-purpose tasks are running – a distributed tuple space manager , which stores both the error notifications sent by the error detectors and the "" plain "" tuples requested via out ( ) or eval ( ) , and a "" recovery application "" , i.e. , a task responsible for the execution of a set of recovery actions . The shown sequence diagram describes the execution of the user-specified recovery actions . notification describing that event is sent to a distributed entity responsible for the collection and the management of these notifications . Clearly , in RεLinda this entity is the TS and the above mentioned notifications are the ENs . Immediately after storing each notification , the guards of the recovery actions are evaluated . Guards evaluation is done by querying the database of the TS . When a guard is found to be true , its corresponding actions are executed , otherwise they are skipped . As a conclusive remark RεLinda may be described as a specialization ( in object-oriented terminology ) of the general abstract class RεL addressing parallel programming . 2.2 Conclusions This section has exposed the key ideas behind a novel approach called RεLinda , coupling Generative Communication with the the RεL approach introduced in Chapter 6 . As such , RεLinda is an attempt to explicitly address both the dependability and the performance aspects making use of a single design framework . RεLinda offers a high degree of separation of design concerns , such that the functional and the FT aspects do not conflict with each other . Its dynamic adaptability to varying environmental conditions , which may obtained as described in ( De Florio , 2000 ) through dynamic linking of the r-code , is another important feature of RεLinda . SA in RεLinda is limited to those fault-tolerance provisions that better match its model ; in particular , the strong link with parallel computing makes it especially in line with methods such as MVSFT ( see Chapter 3 ) . Several other important topics related to RεLinda's components could be investigated in the future . Such topics include , for instance , the inclusion in the TS of the concept of so-called "" book-kept tuples , "" i.e. , tuples that are distributed to requesters by means of the algorithm of RAFTNET for dependable farmer worker applications described in Chapter 3 . This strategy translates into effective and elegant support to highly performing and highly dependable data-parallel applications . Another research path is the extension of these schemes towards persistent object stores ( Oaks & Wong , 2000 ) and CORBA-compliant or service-oriented middleware . Other strategies to further increase the dependability of RεLinda applications are , e.g. , the possibility to combine multiple tuple space operations into atomic transactions ( Bakken & Schlichting , 1995 ; Anderson & Shasha , 1991 ; Cannon & Dunn , 1992 ) . Other techniques that could be investigated to further enhance the dependability of the tuple space could be e.g. , tuple space checkpoint-and-rollback ( Kambhatla , 1991 ) . 3 ENHANCING A TIRAN DEPENDABLE MECHANISM As observed by the designers of GUARDS ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , many embedded systems may benefit from an hardware architecture based on redundancy and consensus in order to fulfill their dependability requirements . As pointed out in Chapter 2 , such a hardware architecture needs to be coupled with some application-level strategy or mechanism in order to guarantee end-to-end tolerance of faults4 . The software architecture described in this book may support in many ways the class of applications eligible for being embedded in a GUARDS system instance . The main tool for this is the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism ( derived from the EFTOS Voting Farm described in Chapter 3 ) . This section describes how it is possible to further increase the dependability of the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism by using ARIEL as both a configuration and a recovery language and making use of the TIRAN framework . An assessment of these enhancements is reported in Chapter 10 . The system realizes a sophisticated N - version programming executive that implements the software equivalent of an NMR system . Because of this assumption , the user is required to supply four versions of the same software , designed and developed according to the N - version approach ( Aviz ̆ ienis , 1985 ) . This requirement can be avoided if it is possible to assume safely that no design faults resulting in correlate failures affect the software . To simplify the case study it is assumed that the service provided by any of the versions or instances is stateless . When this is not the case , the management of the spare would also call for a forward recovery mechanism – e.g. , the spare would need to acquire the current state of one of the non-faulty tasks . Furthermore , when using pipelines of N-version tasks under strict real-time requirements , further techniques ( currently not part of the prototype presented in this work ) would be required in order to restore the state of the spare with no repercussion on the real-time goals ( see ( Bondavalli , Di Giandomenico , Grandoni , Powell , & Rabéjac , 1998 ) for an example of these techniques ) . The enhanced TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism described in what follows is representative of the class of applications that are best eligible for being addressed via an application-level fault-tolerance structure such as NVP . This section describes how RεL provides to those applications two additional features , namely , support of spares and support of fault-specific reconfiguration , which are not part of plain NVP systems . A system of four nodes is assumed . Nodes are identified by the symbolic constants NODE1 , ... , NODE4 , defined in the header file nodes . h . Header file my_definitions . h contains a number of user definitions , including the unique-id of each version task ( VERSION1 , ... , VERSION4 ) and the local identifier of each version task ( in this case , on each node the same identifier is used , namely VERSION ) . In the same file also the time-outs of each version are defined ( TIMEOUT_VERSION1 , ... , TIMEOUT_VERSION4 ) . Let us consider the following ARIEL script : INCLUDE "" nodes . h "" INCLUDE "" my definitions . h "" TASK TASK TASK TASK { VERSION1 } { VERSION2 } { VERSION3 } { VERSION4 } IS IS IS IS NODE NODE NODE NODE { NODE1 } , { NODE2 } , { NODE3 } , { NODE4 } , TASKID TASKID TASKID TASKID { VERSION } { VERSION } { VERSION } { VERSION } N-VERSION TASK { TMR PLUS ONE SPARE } VERSION 1 IS TASK { VERSION1 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION1 } ms VERSION 2 IS TASK { VERSION2 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION2 } ms VERSION 3 IS TASK { VERSION3 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION3 } ms VERSION 4 IS SPARE TASK { VERSION4 } TIMEOUT { TIMEOUT VERSION4 } ms VOTING ALGORITHM IS MAJORITY METRIC "" tmr cmp "" ON SUCCESS TASK 20 ON ERROR TASK 30 END N-VERSION IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION1 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION1 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION1 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION1 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION2 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION3 } IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION2 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION2 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION2 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION2 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION1 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION3 } IF [ PHASE ( T { VERSION3 } ) == { HAS FAILED } || FAULTY T { VERSION3 } ] THEN STOP T { VERSION3 } SEND { WAKEUP } T { VERSION4 } SEND { VERSION3 } T { VERSION4 } FI SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION2 } SEND { VERSION4 } T { VERSION1 } The above script consists of two parts – one for managing the configuration of tasks and tools , the other for describing a recovery strategy . The following two subsections describe the two parts . 3.1 Configuration The configuration section of the script just shown defines four tasks , each running on a different node of the system . This decision has been taken to reduce the probability of a common source for multiple failures , in case of a crash of a node . It is worth noting that this design decision – the physical location of the tasks – is made outside the application code and can be changed with no repercussion on it , thus allowing location transparency and high SC . Three of the four tasks are then configured as versions of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism ( derived from the EFTOS Voting Farm described in Chapter 3 ) . The fourth task ( VERSION4 ) is configured as a spare . This means that , when task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE is launched , the first three tasks arrange themselves as components of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism , with each task assisted by a local voter as described in the aforementioned section . On the contrary , the fourth task is blocked waiting for the arrival of a special "" wakeup "" signal . Feeding the ARIEL translator with the configuration script as described in Chapter 6 , a number of source codes are produced , including : • The basic user tasks of a TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism consisting of three modules , an example of which can be seen in Chapter 6 when configuring multiple-version software fault-tolerance . • The spare user task , initially waiting for the arrival of a wakeup message . • Task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . This task is in charge of the : 1 . Transparent set up of the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism via the TIRAN CreateTask function of the TIRAN Basic Services Library . 2 . Management of the replication of the input value . 3 . Declaration and insertion in the TIRAN TOM of the set of time-outs that represent an upper limit to the duration of the base tasks . This upper limit is set by the user and known by one of the hypotheses of the timed-asynchronous distributed system model introduced in Chapter 2 ( all services are timed ) . 4 . De-multiplexing and delivering the output value . In the absence of faults , task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE would appear to the user as yet another version providing the same service supplied by tasks VERSION1 , ... , VERSION4 . The only difference would be in terms of a higher reliability ( see Chapter 10 ) and a larger execution time , mainly due to the voting overhead . Location transparency in this case is supported by ARIEL , while replication transparency is supported by the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism . The degree of code intrusion in the application source code is reduced to the one instruction to spawn task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . No support for the automatic generation of makefiles is provided in the current version of the ARIEL translator , so the user needs to properly instruct the compilation of the source files written by the translator . 3.2 Recovery The recovery section of the ARIEL script on p. 267 defines a recovery strategy for task TMR PLUS ONE SPARE . When any error is detected in the system and forwarded to the backbone , the backbone replies to this stimulus as follows : 1 . It stores the error notification in its local copy of the DB . 2 . It updates the α-count variable related to the entity found in error . 3 . If the notification is local , i.e. , related to a local task , then the local component of the BB forwards the notification to the other components . 4 . If the local BB entity plays the role of coordinator , it initiates error recovery by sending a "" wakeup "" message to the recovery interpreter . This latter orderly reads and executes the r-codes . Table 2 shows a trace of the execution of some of the r-codes produced when translating a simplified version of the ARIEL script on p. 267 . As already mentioned , RINT implements a virtual machine with a stack architecture . Line 5 starts the scanning of a guard . Line 6 stores on RINT's run-time stack the current value of the phase of task 0 ( the value of symbolic constant VERSION1 ) . Line 7 compares the top of the run-time stack with integer HAS FAILED . The result , 0 ( false ) is stored on top of the stack . Line 8 checks the top of the stack for being 0 . The condition is fulfilled , so a jump is made to line 18 of the r-code list . That line corresponds to the end of the current IF statement – the guard has been found as false , therefore the corresponding recovery actions have been skipped . Then , on line 19 , some internal variables are reset . Line 20 starts the evaluation of the clause of the second IF of the recovery script . The scenario is similar to the one just described , though ( on line 22 ) the phase of task 1 ( that is , VERSION2 ) is found to be equal to HAS FAILED . The following conditional jump is therefore skipped , and a stream of recovery actions is then executed : task VERSION2 is terminated on line 24 , then value 10 ( WAKEUP ) is sent to task VERSION4 by means of r-code SEND ( which sends a task the top of the run-time stack ) , and so forth , until line 33 , which closes the current IF . A third guard is then evaluated and found as false . Clearing some internal structures closes the execution of RINT , which again "" goes to sleep "" waiting for a new "" wakeup "" message to arrive . Figure 2 , 3 , and 4 show three different views to a TMR-and-one-spare system at work , as displayed by the TIRAN monitoring tool in a Netscape client ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . The first picture renders the current state and shape of the overall target application . Figure 3 summarizes the framework-level events related to processing node 0 . In particular , a value domain failure is injected on the voter on node 2 . This triggers the execution of a recovery script which reconfigures the TMR isolating the voter on node 2 and switching in the spare voter on node 3 . The execution trace of the r-codes in this script is displayed in Fig. 4 . It is worth noting how , modifying the base recovery strategy of the ARIEL script on p. 267 does not require any modification in the application source code – not even recompiling the code , in case the r-codes are read from an external means ( e.g. , from a file ) . The two design concerns – that of the fault-tolerance software engineer and that of the application software engineer – are kept apart , with no repercussions on the maintainability of the service overall . To prove this , let us consider the ARIEL excerpt in Table 3 . Such a strategy is again based on a TMR plus one spare , though now , before switching off the faulty version and in the spare , the current value of the α-count filter related to the current version is compared with a threshold supplied by the user in the configuration section . If the value is below the threshold , it is not possible to assess that the fault affecting { VERSION1 } is permanent or intermittent . In this case , the faulty task is restarted rather than substituted . In other words , another chance is given to that version , while its "" black list "" ( its α-counter ) is updated . As mentioned in Chapter 6 , research studies have shown that , whatever the threshold , the α-count is bound to exceed it when the fault is permanent or intermittent . In the latter case , therefore , sooner or later the second strategy is to be executed , permanently removing the faulty version . It is worth noting how the adoption of such a scheme , which is no longer purely based on masking the occurrence of a fault , in general implies an execution overhead that may violate the expected real-time behavior – during error-recovery . Further support towards graceful degradation when spares are exhausted could also be foreseen . 5 6 7 8 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 48 49 IF statement .

For those applications that best match with the MV application-level fault-tolerance approach , and with NVP in particular , those services allow further increase the dependability without being detrimental to SC – i.e. , without intruding code . Eligible applications include coarse-grained , distributed or parallel applications , i.e. , those addressed by RεL . SA is clearly limited to the above class of provisions . A has not been considered here , but the code separation of ARIEL could be used to achieve some adaptability . Furthermore , safety-critical parallel or distributed airborne and spaceborne applications appear to be well addressed by those services . It must be remarked , though , that the safety-critical character of these applications calls for specific framework-level and system-level support , such as the one provided by the GUARDS architecture ( Powell et al. , 1999 ) , a generic , parameterizable hardware and OS architecture for real-time systems , which straightforwardly supports the NVP scheme . 4 COMPOSING DEPENDABLE MECHANISMS : THE REDUNDANT WATCHDOG This section describes how it is possible to compose dependable mechanisms addressing specific needs by means of the RεL architecture devised in TIRAN . The case reported in the rest of this section originated by a requirement of one of the TIRAN partners , ENEL SpA . In present day's fault-tolerance systems at ENEL , a hardware watchdog timer is available and integrated in several of their automation applications . Such device is a custom ( non-COTS ) hardware component that is capable of guaranteeing both high availability and high integrity . This allows its use in contexts where safety is the main concern . As mentioned in Chapter 3 , ENEL has started an internal plan that aims at renewing and enlarging their park of automation systems , also with the goal of improving their efficiency and quality of service . Within this plan , ENEL is investigating the possibility to substitute this hardware device with a software component , exploiting the redundancy of COTS parallel or distributed architectures , in such a way as to guarantee acceptable levels of safety and availability for their applications . While taking part in TIRAN , CESI posed the above problems to the consortium . The TIRAN consortium proposed the solution described in this section , based on the RεL approach . 4.1 An Industrial Problem : The Redundant Watchdog Requirements Technicians of energy automation systems typically express requirements in textual form , capturing the main dependability needs of the applications . Considering the Primary Substation Automation System a list of dependability requirements has been collected and addressed in the TIRAN project ( Botti et al. , 1999 ) . In this section the focus will be on two of those Application Requirements ( referred as AR1 and AR2 below ) that lead to the need of an enhanced watchdog mechanism . They are formulated as follows : AR1 : "" If an erroneous situation can not be recovered according to required mode and within given time constraints , then a mechanism for the auto-exclusion of the system should be provided which , if not reset before the expiration of a pre-fixed time-out , disconnects the system from the plant , leaving the plant in an acceptable state , forcing the output to assume a pre-defined secure configuration , providing appropriate signalling to the operator and to the remote systems ( as automation system failures should not affect the plant ) . "" AR2 : "" The auto-exclusion should guarantee a high availability , integrity and security – e.g. by a redundant and periodically tested mechanism , with auto-diagnostics . "" The auto-exclusion functionality ( as required by AR1 and AR2 ) has been traditionally supported by the so-called plant's watchdog ( plantWD ) mechanism , a dedicated hardware device with high integrity and availability degrees . In most cases the plantWD mechanism is used as an ultimate action of a fault tolerant strategy to detect un-recovered processing errors and to avoid their propagation . Errors are typically run-time violations occurring during the execution of an application process due to , e.g. , a process that has crashed or is slowed down . The watchdog mechanism ( WD ) cyclically sets a timer requiring an application process to explicitly reset it by sending an "" I am alive "" message before it reaches its deadline . If , for any reason , the application process is not able to send the message , the watchdog raises an error condition that has to be treated by some entity in some way . Depending on the global fault tolerance strategy adopted our plantWD is set to count either the double of or the same time of the basic application cycle . In support of the migration to flexible software dependability services running on COTS platforms , the goal of developing a robust , software-based WD mechanism has been addressed by the TIRAN Project . A watchdog basic tool has been implemented characterized by the following Watchdog Requirements ( WR ) and Properties ( WP ) : WR1 : "" The WD has to survive at system reboot or reset , i.e. the memory it allocates for its counter is not to be cleared . "" WR2 : "" In a distributed software architecture the application node's signals have to be put in a logic AND to actually signal the WD , i.e. the WD effectively stops to countdown only if on each node the execution has terminated correctly . "" WR3 : "" The WD has to survive at node failures , i.e. whatever node faults the WD mechanism should be not compromised . "" WR4 : In order to guarantee correct operation of the WD mechanism , it is mandatory that the WD task is running at a higher priority than the tasks ( that run on the same node ) it supervises . WD tasks supervising tasks on other nodes must have appropriate priority to ensure proper operation . It is the responsibility of the application writer to ensure correct partitioning and priority allocation . WP1 : The watchdog task can be placed either on the same node where the application tasks run on or on a different node . WP2 : Placing the watchdog task on the same node where the application task runs on minimizes overhead and detection latency . WP3 : Placing the watchdog task on a different node with respect to the application node lowers the probability of a common failure for both application and watchdog task that would go undetected . WP4 : Detection latency is under the control of the application writer . The higher the frequency of sending "" I 'm alive "" messages , the lower the detection latency . WP5 : Overhead is under the control of the application writer . The lower is the frequency of sending "" I 'm alive "" messages , the lower is the overhead paid by the application task and the communication system . WP6 : WD is just one task which receives system clock ticks and application "" I 'm alive "" messages . Both types of messages are received through interprocess communication and are asynchronous to WD task . WP7 : Being the WD in a distributed software architecture it is able to receive multiple signals and to apply a logical operation on them ( i.e. in the case of the logical operation AND required by WR1 the WD will fire if at least one node does not produce its signal ) . In Section 4 it will be shown how the requirement WR3 above may be fulfilled by instantiating more WD mechanisms and by applying different voting mechanisms to their firings . Such Redundant WatchDog ( RWD ) mechanism is characterized by the following design properties : RWP1 : Processing errors affecting WD replicas can be detected and recovered transparently by the RWD RWP2 : The number of WD replicas and the voting mechanism chosen determine a different improvement of the RWD dependability : e.g. Nreplica = 3 , allows a 2-out-of-3 voting ( which can correct up to 1 fault ) ; the selection of the suitable Nreplica and voting is a compromise among dependability and performance overhead , left to the application writer's experience . RWP3 : WD replicas can be placed all on the same node . This minimizes overhead and detection latency but does not increase the RWD dependability . RWP4 : WD replicas can be placed on different nodes . This minimizes the chance of a common failure affecting each WD replica . 4.2 The Strategy and Its Key Components The strategy proposed within TIRAN exploits the following components : • The Basic Services Library , and specifically its function TIRAN Send , which multicasts a message to a logical , i.e. , a group of tasks . • The configuration support provided by ARIEL . • The TIRAN BB and its DB . • The recovery language ARIEL . • The watchdog Basic Tool , i.e. , a node-local software component in level 1.1 of the TIRAN architecture ( see Chapter 6 for a description of the TIRAN architecture . ) The latter , which executes on a single processing node , can not guarantee the required degree of availability when used as a substitute of the ENEL hardware watchdog . This notwithstanding , the adoption of the above components allowed composing – rather than programming – a new prototypic DM , the so-called Redundant Watchdog ( RW ) . This composition is made in terms of the above elements of the TIRAN framework , with ARIEL playing the role of coordinator . In order to introduce the strategy , the following scenario is assumed : • A distributed system is available , consisting of three nodes , identified as N1 , N2 and N3 . • On each node of this system , a number of application tasks and an instance of the TIRAN watchdog are running . The design goal to be reached is enhancing the dependability of this basic scheme by means of a technique that does not overly increase , at the same time , the complexity of the overall software tool . The adopted strategy is now explained – each step has been tagged with a label describing the main RεL feature being exploited . Configuration : Define and configure the three watchdogs by means of the provisions described in Chapter 6 . In particular , • Assign them the unique-ids W1 , W2 , and W3 . • Specify that , on a missed deadline , a notification is to be sent to the TIRAN BB . • Deploy the watchdogs on different nodes . Configuration : Define logical L , consisting of tasks W1 , W2 , and W3 . Recovery : Define in ARIEL an "" AND-strategy "" , that triggers an alarm when each and every watchdog notifies the BB , an "" OR-strategy "" , in which the alarm is executed when any of the three watchdog expires , and a "" 2-out-of-3 strategy "" , in which a majority of the watchdogs needs to notify the BB in order to trigger the alarm . In the current prototype , the alarm is a notification to the task the unique-id of which is A. The configuration step is coded as in Table 4 . Table 5 lists the recovery actions corresponding to the AND-strategy . When a watched task sends "" watchdog L "" its heartbeats , the Basic Services Library relays these messages to the three watchdogs on the three nodes . In absence of faults , the three watchdogs5 process these message in the same way – each of them in particular resets the internal timer corresponding to the client task that sent the heartbeat . When a heartbeat is missing , the three watchdogs expire and send a notification to the BB , one at the time . The reply of the BB to these notifications is the same : RINT is awoken and the r-codes are interpreted . The difference between the three strategies is then straightforward : • The OR-strategy triggers the alarm as soon as any of the watchdog expires . This tolerates the case in which up to two watchdogs have crashed , or are faulty , or are unreachable . This intuitively reduces the probability that a missing heartbeat goes undetected , hence can be regarded as a "" safety-first "" strategy . At INCLUDE "" watchdogs . h "" TASK { W1 } IS TASK { W2 } IS TASK { W3 } IS NODE { N1 } , TASKID { W1 } NODE { N2 } , TASKID { W2 } NODE { N3 } , TASKID { W3 } WATCHDOG { W1 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG WATCHDOG { W2 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG WATCHDOG { W3 } HEARTBEATS EVERY { HEARTBEAT } MS ON ERROR WARN BACKBONE END WATCHDOG LOGICAL { L } IS TASK { W1 } , TASK { W2 } , TASK { W3 } END LOGICAL Table 4 : Configuration of the Redundant Watchdog . IF [ PHASE ( TASK { W1 } ) == { EXPIRE } AND PHASE ( TASK { W2 } ) == { EXPIRE } AND PHASE ( TASK { W3 } ) == { EXPIRE } ] THEN SEND { ALARM } TASK { A } REMOVE PHASE LOGICAL { L } FROM ERRORLIST FI Table 5 : The AND-strategy of the Redundant Watchdog . Action REMOVE resets the phase corresponding to the tasks of logical L. the same time , the probability of "" false alarms "" ( mistakingly triggered alarms ) is increased . Such alarms possibly lead to temporary pauses of the overall system service , and may imply costs . • The AND-strategy , on the other hand , requires that all the watchdogs reach consensus before triggering the system alarm . It decreases the probability of false alarms but at the same time decreases the error detection coverage of the watchdog Basic Tool . It may be regarded as an "" availability-first "" strategy . • Strategy 2-out-of-3 requires that a majority of watchdogs expire before the system alarm is executed . Intuitively , this corresponds to a trade-off between the two above strategies . More sophisticated strategies , corresponding to other design requirements , may also be composed . Other schemes , such as meta-watchdogs ( watchdogs watching other watchdogs ) can also be straightforwardly set up . 5 Cactus Cactus is a design framework and runtime system for implementing and executing configurable services based on an event-driven execution model . As mentioned in Chapter 2 , configurable services such as configurable communication protocols , file systems , database systems , and middleware are a useful approach to explicitate the system and fault model requirements and a useful tool to reach truly portable services , that is systems characterized by dynamic and adaptive system and fault models . One such system is the Configurable Transport Protocol . The Cactus programming model is a clever improvement on the classical layered system design principle : Systems have a macroscopic structure , that is , the traditional layers , called services in the Cactus terminology , and a microscopic structure , that is a web of modules representing the atoms constituting the services and connected non-hierarchically into a network of so-called "" micro-protocols "" . Non-hierarchically means here that there is no communication restriction between modules , which can exchange information and cooperate regardless their macroscopic position ( that is , even though the corresponding services are not contiguous to each other ) . This structuring technique is said to provide the designer with a model coupling enhanced flexibility with the required separation of design concerns . In Cactus micro-protocols communicate through an even-driven execution model . In the above mentioned Configurable Transport Protocol , for instance , all service properties and functional components are implemented as micro-protocols , each of which is a list of event handlers in the familiar form of guarded actions , i.e. , statements structured like in g : a , where g is an event stating a significant change such as the arrival of a message and a is one or more event handler assocuated to the guard g . When g occurs , a is executed . This is clearly the same principle used in the recovery language Ariel discussed in Chapter 6 . The Cactus designers did not choose to develop a custom event-based programming language such as Ariel to specify its guarded actions – instead , they preferred to come up with a set of conventions and a software library . This allowed produce Cactus implementations in several languages , such as C and Java . As explained in ( Hiltunen , Taı ̈ ani , & Schlichting , 2006 ) , Cactus has been used to build services ranging from low-level communication protocols to group membership and group remote procedure call . Application-level services such as a configurable distributed system monitoring service have also been developed with Cactus . The clever design choices of Cactus place it in between a system like Ariel and library-based approaches ; moreover , several similarities between Cactus and aspect-oriented programming have been pointed out in ( Hiltunen et al. , 2006 ) . One concludes by assessing SC as bad ( the system requires the explicit coding and intertwining of the protocols ) , SA as limited ( by Condor's model and structure ) , and A as potentially good ( though dynamic trading of event handlers , e.g. , appears not to be part of Condor . ) 6 CONCLUSIONS The reported experiences demonstrate how RεL allows fast-prototype complex strategies by composing a set of building blocks together out of those available in the TIRAN framework , and by building system-wide , recovery-time coordination strategies with ARIEL . This allows set up sophisticated fault-tolerance systems while keeping the management of their complexity outside the user application . The compact size of the ARIEL configuration scripts is one of the arguments that can be used as evidence to this claim . Transparency of replication and transparency of location are also reached in this case . No similar support is provided by the application-level fault-tolerance approaches reviewed in Chapters 4 – 6 . As a final remark let us observe how SC is guaranteed here by a custom , separate composition language ( ARIEL ) , that SA is limited to the single class of addressed provisions , and that the possibility to trade off strategies or compose new ones at run-time brings to an excellent degree of A.

Notes 1A read-only tuple is one that can only be read via either rd ( ) or rdp ( ) . rationale behind this decision is that , this way , the user can not produce mock error notifications , which would increase the risk of Byzantine failures ( Lamport , Shostak , & Pease , 1982 ) . 3 If available , error detection support at driver or kernel level may be also instrumented so to emit ENs . 4 This way , also software design faults would be addressed . 5 In this case study , three instances of the same software component have been used . Clearly this does not protect the system from design faults in the watchdog component itself . Using NVP when developing the watchdogs may possibly guarantee statistical independence between failures . 2 The page MEASURING AND ASSESSING TOOLS 1 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES As mentioned in Chapter 1 , a service's dependability must be justified in a quantitative way and proved through extensive on-field testing and fault injection , verification and validation techniques , simulation , source-code instrumentation , monitoring , and debugging . An exhaustive treatment of all these techniques falls outside the scope of this book , nevertheless the author feels important to include in this text an analysis of the effect on dependability of some of the methods that have been introduced in previous chapters . 2 RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE TIRAN DISTRIBUTED VOTING MECHANISM As mentioned in Chapter 9 , a number of applications are structured in such a way as to be straightforwardly embedded in a fault-tolerance architecture based on redundancy and consensus . Applications belonging to this class are , for instance , parallel airborne and spaceborne applications . The TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism provides application-level support to these applications . This section analyses the effect on reliability of the enhancements to the TIRAN Distributed Voting mechanism described in the mentioned chapter , that is , management of spares , dealt with in Sect . 2.1 , and fault-specific recovery strategies supported by the α-count feature , analysed in Sect . 2.2 . 2.1 Using ariel to Manage Spares This section analyses the influence of one of the features offered by ariel – its ability to manage spare modules in N - modular redundant systems – that has been introduced and discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 9 . Reliability can be greatly improved by this technique . Let us first consider the following equation : R ( 0 ) ( t ) = 3R ( t ) 2 − 2R ( t ) 3 , ( 1 ) i.e. , the equation expressing the reliability of a TMR system with no spares , R ( t ) being the reliability of a single , non-replicated ( simplex ) component . Equation ( 1 ) can be derived for instance via Markovian reliability modeling under the assumption of independence between the occurrence of faults ( Johnson , 1989 ) . With the same technique and under the same hypothesis it is possible to show that , even in the case of non-perfect error detection coverage , this equation can be considerably improved by adding one spare . This is the equation resulting from the Markov model in Fig. 1 , expressed as a function of error recovery coverage ( C , defined as the probability associated with the process of identifying the failed module out of those available and being able to switch in the spare ( Johnson , 1989 )) and time ( t ) : R ( 1 ) ( C , t ) = ( − 3C 2 + 6C ) × [ R ( t ) ( 1 − R ( t )) ] 2 + R ( 0 ) ( t ) . ( 2 ) Appendix A gives some mathematical details on Eq. ( 2 ) . Adding more spares obviously implies further improving reliability . In general , for any N ≥ 3 , it is possible to consider a class of monotonically increasing reliability functions , ( R ( M ) ( C , t )) M > 0 , ( 3 ) corresponding to systems adopting N + M replicas . Depending on both cost and reliability requirements , the user can choose the most-suited values for M and N. Note how quantity ( 2 ) is always greater than quantity ( 1 ) as R ( 0 ) ( t ) and ( − 3C 2 + 6C ) are always positive for 0 < C ≤ 1 . Figure 2 compares Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the general case while Fig. 3 covers the case of perfect coverage . In the latter case , the reliability of a single , non-redundant ( simplex ) system is also portrayed . Note furthermore how the crosspoint between the three-and-one-spare system and the non-redundant system is considerably lower than the crosspoint between the latter and the TMR system – R ( t ) ≈ 0.2324 vs. R ( t ) = 0.5 . The reliability of the system can therefore be increased from the one of a pure NMR system to that of N-and-M-spare systems ( see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ) . 2.2 Using the α-count Feature As it has been already mentioned , the TRANSIENT clause of ariel , exploiting the α-count fault identification mechanism introduced in Chapter 6 , can be adopted to associate different recovery or reconfiguration strategies : • To the detection of a permanent or intermittent fault , in general requiring reconfiguration and redundancy exhaustion , • and to the detection of a transient fault , that could be tolerated with a recovery technique such as resetting the faulty component . This section describes a simple Markov reliability model of a TMR system discriminating between these two cases . Figure 4 shows the model . T is the probability that the current fault is a transient one and R is the probability of Figure 1 : Markov reliability model for a TMR-and-1-spare system . λ is the failure rate , C is the error recovery coverage factor . A "" fail safe "" state is reached when the system is no more able to correctly perform its function , though the problem has been safely detected and handled properly . In ' Fail unsafe , ' on the contrary , the system is incorrect , though the problem has not been handled or detected . Every other state is labeled with three digits , d1 d2 d3 , such that d1 is the number of non-faulty modules in the TMR system , d2 is the number of nonfaulty spares ( in this case , 0 or 1 ) , and d3 is the number of undetected , faulty modules . The initial state , 310 , has been highlighted . This model is solved by Eq. ( 2 ) . Figure 2 : Graphs of Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as functions of C and of R. Note how the graph of ( 2 ) is strictly above the other . successful recovery for a component affected by a transient fault . To simplify the model , recovery is assumed to be instantaneous . The system degrades only when permanent faults occur . Solving the model brings to the following equation : α Rtmr ( t ) = 3 exp − 2 ( 1 − RT ) λt − 2 exp − 3 ( 1 − RT ) λt . ( 4 ) Eq. 4 can be written as α Rtmr ( t ) = 3R ( t ) 2 ( 1 − RT ) − 2R ( t ) 3 ( 1 − RT ) , ( 5 ) with R ( t ) the reliability of the simplex system . Note how , in a sense , the introduction of the α-count technique results in a modification of the exponents of Eq. 1 by a factor equal to 1 − RT . In general , the resulting system shows a reliability that is larger than the one of a TMR system . Figure 5 compares these reliabilities . As it is evident from that image , the crosspoint between the reliability graphs of the simplex and that of the TMR system extended with the α-count technique is in general lower . Its exact value is given by the function crosspoint ( R , T ) = 0.51 / ( 1 − RT ) , which is drawn in Fig. 6 . 1 0.8 0.6 Reliability 0.4 0.2 0 TMR-and-1-spare TMR non-redundant system 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Simplex Reliability 0.8 1 Figure 3 : Graphs of Eq. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) when C = 1 ( perfect error detection coverage ) . The reliability of a single , non-redundant system is also portrayed . 3 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF REDUNDANT VARIABLES In Chapter 4 the concept of redundant variables was introduced : Data structures in which the degree of replication is not fixed once and for all at design time , but changes dynamically with respect to the disturbances experienced during the run time . Here it is shown how the performance of our approach was analyzed . In order to analyze our system , a simulator , called "" scrambler "" was developed . Our scrambler tool allows to simulate a memory , to protect it with redundant variables , to inject memory faults ( bit flips or "" bursts "" corrupting series of contiguous cells ) , and to measure the amount of redundancy actually used . Scrambler interprets a simple scripting language consisting of the following commands : SLEEP s , which suspends the execution of the scrambler for s seconds , SCRAMBLE n , p , which repeats n times action "" scramble a pseudo-random memory cell with probability p "" , BURST n , p , l , which repeats n times action "" scramble l contiguous cells with probability p "" , Figure 4 : The Markov reliability model of a TMR system that gracefully degrades in the presence of a permanent or intermittent fault and "" cleans up "" ( that is , rejuvenates ) the components affected by transient faults . 1 0.8 0.6 Reliability 0.4 0.2 0 simplex tmr tmr + α-count 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Simplex Reliability 0.8 1 Figure 5 : Reliability of a simplex system , of a TMR system , and of a modified TMR system exploiting the α-count fault identification technique . In this case T is 50 % and R = 0.6 . Figure 6 : The crosspoint between the graph of the reliability of the simplex α system and that of Rtmr as a function of R and T. END , which terminates the simulation . The above commands can be used to compose a complex sequence of fault injections . As an example , the following script , corresponds to the following configuration : no faults for 1 second , then various disturbances occurring with Gaussian distribution1 , then no disturbances again for 5 seconds : SLEEP 1 // sleep 1 sec SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.1053992 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( - 3 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.3678794 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( - 2 ) BURST 2000 , 0.7788008 , 10 // execute 2000 bursts of 10 // contiguous cells // with probability f ( - 1 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 1 // scramble 2000 random cells BURST 2000 , 0.7788008 , 10 // execute 2000 bursts of 10 // contiguous cells // with probability f ( 1 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.3678794 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( 2 ) SCRAMBLE 2000 , 0.1053992 // scramble 2000 random cells // with probability f ( 3 ) SLEEP 5 // sleep 5 secs END // stop injecting faults The idea behind these scripts is to be able to represent executions where a program is subjected to environmental conditions that vary with time and range from ideal to heavily perturbed . Scenarios like these ones are common , e.g. , in applications servicing primary substation automation systems ( Deconinck , De Florio , Dondossola , & Szanto , 2003 ) or spaceborne applications ( Oey & Teitelbaum , 1981 ) . In the following a few experiments are described , together with the results obtained with scrambler . All our experiments have been carried out with an array of 20000 redundant 4-byte cells and an allocation stride of 20 ( that is , replicas of a same logical cell are spaced by 20 physical cells ) . In all the reported experiments the following script was run : SLEEP 1 SCRAMBLE SCRAMBLE SLEEP 3 SCRAMBLE SCRAMBLE END 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 10000 , 0.9183156388887342 Concurrently with the execution of this script , 1500000 read accesses were performed in round robin across the array . The experiments record the number of scrambled cells and the number of read failures . Scrambler makes use of standard C function "" rand "" , which depends on an initial seed to generate each pseudo-random sequence . In the reported experiments the same value has been kept for the seed , so as to produce exactly the same sequences in each experiment . 3.1 Experiment 1 : Fixed , low redundancy In this first experiment scrambler was executed with fixed ( non adaptive ) redundancy 3 . Table 1 shows the setting of this experiment . The main conclusion one can draw from this run is that a statically redundant data structures provision in this case fails 193 times : In other words , for 193 times it was not possible to find a majority of replicas in agreement , and the system reported a read access failure . The total number of memory accesses is proportional to 3 × 1500000 × k , where k > 0 depends on the complexity of the redundant read operation . 3.2 Experiment 2 : Fixed , higher redundancy Also experiment 2 has fixed redundancy , this time equal to 5 . Table 2 shows the setting of this new experiment . Main conclusion is that the higher redundancy is enough to guarantee data integrity in this case : No read access failures are experienced . The total number of memory accesses is proportional to 5 × 1500000 × k . $ scrambler faults . in 3 scrub noadaptive Scrambler :: sleep ( 1 ) run 1 run 50001 run 100001 run 150001 Scrambler :: scramble ( 10000 , 0 . 918316 ) Scrambler :: scramble ( 10000 , 0 . 918316 ) Scrambler :: sleep ( 3 ) run 200001 run 250001 ... lines omitted ... run 650001 Scrambler :: scramble ( 10000 , 0 . 918316 ) Scrambler :: scramble ( 10000 , 0 . 918316 ) Scrambler :: END run 700001 run 750001 ... lines omitted ... run 1500001 36734 scrambled cells , 193 failures , redundance == 3 redundance 3 : 1500001 runs redundance 5 : 0 runs redundance 7 : 0 runs redundance 9 : 0 runs redundance 11 : 0 runs Table 1 : Experiment 1 : Scrambler executes the script in file "" faults . in "" .

No failures are observed , but the employed redundancy is mostly of degree 3 . 3.3 Experiment 3 : Adaptive Redundancy In this last experiment adaptive redundancy was enabled and initially set to 5 . Table 3 shows the resulting setting . Most worth noting is the fact that also in this case no read access failures show up , but the actual amount of redundancy required to reach this result is much lower . Consequently , also the total number of memory accesses , proportional to ( 3 × 1455404 + 5 × 6054 + 7 × 28967 + 9 × 9576 ) × k , is considerably lower . Figure 7 shows how redundancy varies during the first 100000 read cycles . During this time frame no fault injection takes place . This is captured by our adaptation strategy , which decreases redundancy to 3 after 1000 cycles . Figure 8 depicts an interval where several fault injections do take place . These events are detected and trigger several adaptations . 3.4 Conclusions The analysis of the performance of one of the application-level approaches introduced in Chapter 4 , namely redundant variables , was described . The Figure 7 : The first 100000 cycles of experiment 3 ( Sect . 3.3 ) . Note how redundancy drops to its minimum after the first 1000 cycles . Figure 8 : A section of experiment 3 in which fault injection takes place . Note how redundancy changes accordingly . main focus here was on the methods and tools used to assess , in a quantitative way , the properties of our tool . 4 A TOOL FOR MONITORING AND FAULT INJECTION To conclude this chapter a distributed , multimedia application for monitoring and fault injection is described . Such application was developed in the framework of Project EFTOS ( Embedded Fault-Tolerant Supercomputing , already introduced in Chapter 3 ) . It dynamically sets up a hierarchy of HTML pages reflecting the current status of an EFTOS-compliant dependable application running on a Parsytec CC system . These pages are fed to a WWW browser playing the role of hypermedia monitor . The adopted approach allows the user to concentrate on the high-level aspects of his / her application so as to quickly assess the validity of their dependability assumptions . This view of the system lends itself well for being coupled with a tool to interactively inject software faults in the user application . 4.1 Introduction As systems get more and more complex , the need for a one-look snapshot of their activity is indeed ever increasing . This need has been strongly felt by the people involved in Project EFTOS ( Deconinck , De Florio , Lauwereins , & Varvarigou , 1997 ) , whose aim was to set up a software framework for integrating fault-tolerance into embedded distributed high-performance applications in a flexible and easy way . Through the adoption of the EFTOS framework , the target application running on a parallel computer is plugged into a hierarchical , layered system whose structure and basic components have been described in detail in Chapter 3 : • at the lowest level , a set of parameterizable functions managing error detection ( Dtools ) and error recovery ( Rtools ) . EFTOS supplies a number of these Dtools and Rtools , plus an API for incorporating user-defined EFTOS-compliant tools ; • at the middle level , the DIR net ( detection , isolation , and recovery network ) is available to coherently combine Dtools and Rtools , to ensure consistent strategies throughout the whole system , and to play the role of a backbone handling information to and from the fault-tolerance elements . To fulfill these requirements , the DIR net makes use of processes called Manager , Agents , and Backup Agents ; • at the highest level , these elements are combined into dependable mechanisms e.g. , methods to guarantee fault-tolerant communication , voting methods and so on . As explained in Chapter 3 , during the lifetime of the application the EFTOS framework guards the service from a series of possible deviations from the expected behavior ; this is done by executing detection , isolation , and reconfiguration tasks . For instance , a memory access exception caught in a thread by a trap handling Dtool may trigger a relocation of that thread elsewhere in the system . As another example , if an error is detected which affects a component of the DIR net itself , say a Manager , then the system will isolate that component and elect another one ( actually , one of the Backup Agents ) as the DIR Manager . In order to allow the user to keep track of events such as those sketched above , the DIR net continuously prints on the system console short textual descriptions . Evidently such a linear , unstructured listing of events pertaining to different aspects of different actions taking place in different points of the user application , does not make up the best of mechanisms to gain insight in the overall state of the fault-tolerant system . On the contrary , a hierarchical , dynamic view of the structure and behavior of that system , including : • Its current shape ( on which node which components are running , and their topology ) , • the current state of its components ( for instance , whether they are regarded to be correct , faulty , or are being recovered ) , • each component's running history , appeared much more attractive . Two main advantages from the adoption of such a strategy were expected to be : • ( At design and system validation time ) the possibility to assist the user assessing and / or validating his / her EFTOS-based fault-tolerance design , • ( at run time ) the possibility to shorten the latency between the occurrence of the event , its comprehension , and a proper reaction at user level2 . This text describes the architectural solution that was successfully adopted within EFTOS to easily and quickly develop a tool fulfilling the above stated needs – a portable , highly customizable hypermedia monitor for the EFTOS applications making use of cheap , ready available off-the-shelf software components like e.g. , an Internet Browser . It also shows how our monitor supplies the user with the needed structured information , and how it proved its usefulness within EFTOS . In particular an extension is described by means of which our monitor can be turned into a versatile tool for fault-injection . 4.2 Design Requirements In order to quickly deliver human-comprehensible information from the gigantic data stream produced by an EFTOS application , two needs have been assessed : • Deriving a hierarchical representation of the data . ( Most of the produced data is available , but it has to be organized and made browsable in "" layers "" : – At the highest level , only the logical structure of the application should be displayed : Which nodes are used , the EFTOS components executed on each node , and their overall state ; – at a medium level , a concise description of the events pertaining to each particular node should be made available ; – at the lowest level , a deeper description of each particular event may also be supplied on user-demand ) , • the use of multimedia . "" An image is worth a thousand words "" , they say , and maybe even more insight can be derived from the extensive use of colors , sounds , video-clips and so on . For instance , re-coloring a green image to red may lead the user into realizing that a previously fault-free state has turned into a problem . The use of colors traditionally associated to meanings , or whose meaning can be borrowed from well-known everyday situations ( e.g. , those of traffic lights ) further speeds up the delivery of the information to the user . Both aspects were already available in Internet browsers available at the time of EFTOS , such as Netscape , which were able to render hierarchies of dynamically produced HTML ( Berners-Lee & Connolly , 1995 ) pages . Therefore it was decided to develop a distributed application piloting an Internet browser that in turn plays the role of a hypermedia renderer for the EFTOS system activity . This product , called the EFTOS Monitor , is described in the following sections . 4.3 The Architecture of the EFTOS Monitor The EFTOS Monitor basically consists of three components ( see Fig. 9 ) : 1 . A client module , to be run by the DIR net ; 2 . an "" intermediate "" module , to be run by a number of Common Gateway Interface ( Kim , 1996 ) ( CGI ) scripts ; 3 . the "" renderer "" i.e. , an Internet browser . • The client part , together with the DIR net and the user application , runs on a Parsytec CC system ( Parsytec , 1996b ) , a distributed-memory MIMD supercomputer consisting of powerful processing nodes based on PowerPC 604 at 133MHz , dedicated high-speed links , I / O modules and Figure 9 : The architecture of the EFTOS Monitor : the CGI scripts and the EFTOS application share the same file system and communicate via a socket stream : Each time a new event takes place , the DIR net updates a special database ( 1 ) and sends a notification to the main CGI script ( 2 ) . The latter reads the database ( 3 ) on the arrival of the notification and converts it into a HTML hypertext , which is then fed back ( 4 ) to a Netscape or another Internet browser for hypermedia rendering . The client part of the Monitor is integrated in the DIR net Manager process . routers . The system adopts the thread processing model ; as mentioned in Chapter 3 , threads communicate via a proprietary message passing library called EPX ( Parsytec , 1996a ) ( Embedded Parallel extensions to uniX ) . The main tasks of the client module are the set up and management of a database maintaining an up-to-date snapshot of the system activity , including the current mapping of the DIR net's components onto the processing nodes and the state and current activity of each component . This module also connects to the intermediate part via TCP sockets ( as described for instance in ( Comer , 1993 )) and sends it signals at the very beginning and on each state transition . • The intermediate module consists of a hierarchy of CGI scripts spawned by an Apache HTTP ( Berners-Lee , Fielding , & Frystyk , 1996 ; Fielding et al. , 1997 ) server , all running on the workstation hosting the CC system . The root script of this hierarchy connects with the client module and acts as a TCP server : for each new stimulus , the snapshot file is read over and a HTML document is produced and fed to the renderer . A connection is also started up with this latter so as to be able to interact with it without the intervention of the HTTP daemon : Having done so , one CGI script may stay alive and produce multiple HTML requests . This special feature is known as "" non-parsing header "" ( NPH ) mode ( Kim , 1996 ) . Logically speaking , one may say that the intermediate module acts as a gateway between the CC system and the hypermedia renderer . Like mythical Janus ( the god of gates , doors and doorways ( Janus , n.d. ) ; in Italian , Giano ) , one "" face "" of the system is turned to the client module and gathers its requests , while a second one is turned to the renderer and translates those requests in HTML . Because of this its main component has been called cgiano . • The third component , the renderer , is a browser playing the role of a server able to display HTML data . The application is started in two steps via a shell script whose first task is to run the renderer ( or to reconnect to a previously run renderer : This latter is possible using e.g. , remote control extensions ( Zawinski , 1994 ) or an approach based on the Common Client Interface mechanism . The renderer is run with a uniform resource locator ( URL ) pointing to the root-level CGI script , which connects to Netscape in NPH-mode and starts listening for a TCP connection . As a second step , the shell script spawns the parallel application on the CC system . Then the application launches the DIR net and the Monitor's client module . The latter initializes the snapshot files , connects to the CGI script and sends it the first signal . The script reacts to that stimulus by translating the main snapshot file in HTML and requesting the renderer to display it . The top-left image in Fig. 10 shows a typical output of this phase : The EFTOS application appears to the user as an HTML table depicting the processing nodes in the user partition . The state of each module is illustrated by means of colors ( green is "" OK "" , red is "" not OK "" , yellow means that the module is currently being recovered , and so on ) . In this way the user can immediately perceive whether a node is ready or not and which actions are carried out on it , as asked for in the requirements ( Sect . 4.2 . ) Information displayed in this HTML document only covers the logical structure of the application . If the user "" clicks "" any icon on this page , a high-level hypertextual description of the DIR net-events pertaining to that specific node is displayed in a separate browser ( see Fig. 10 , Window "" Node-specific Information "" ) . To keep this page up to date , an automatic reload is periodically performed . This technique is explained e.g. , in ( Kim , 1996 ) . This secondary document is in turn a hypertext whose links point to in-depth descriptions of each specific event ( see Fig. 10 , Window "" Attached Information . "" ) 4.4 Architecture Assessment A number of observations may be drawn upon the above presented architecture ; in particular : • Our architecture is based on unmodified , low-cost , off-the-shelf hypermedia components . • It is open , in the sense that the architecture is based on wide-spread standards e.g. , the use of uniform resource locators within a World-Wide Web interconnection , the HTML language , TCP / IP sockets , the MIME classification , and so on ; • It is distributed , and in particular the renderer may run on any X11-compliant Display Server , including remote PCs running Cygwin / X11 . A possible alternative was to develop a custom application to play as a tailored monitoring tool . As an example , Scientific Computing Associates' TupleScope visual debugger is a custom X-based visualization and debugging tool for parallel programs using the LINDA approach introduced in Chapter 4 . This may result in higher performance and possibly be more flexible but of course : • It reasonably requires more time to develop even for a simple prototype ; • it requires custom design and development choices that may impact portability and supported features e.g. , which software development environment and specifically which language and which libraries to use , or whether to restrict the hypermedia rendering to images or to use sounds as well – these choices may be simply skipped in our approach ; • distribution and hypermedia issues call for specific support which turn into higher costs and longer times . For instance , TupleScope runs with the user application by adding a special linking option at compile time to the user application ; this means it has been developed on purpose as a custom X11 application . Though it perfectly addresses its own goals , it has limited rendering capabilities ( it only deals with static images ) and would certainly require non-negligible efforts to adapt it towards other media . Moreover , TupleScope is available on a number of platform , though the costs of this portability and consequent support are certainly not negligible as well . 4.5 A Tool for Fault Injection The same approach used to monitor the state of an EFTOS-compliant application is also effective in order to actively interact with it . Considering once again Fig. 9 , a control path may be drawn starting from the user at his / her browser , then crossing a CGI script , and eventually reaching the user application . It is therefore fairly possible to add a layer to the hierarchy of HTML pages dynamically created by the intermediate modules so that the user may freely choose among a certain set of malicious actions to bring against an EFTOS application , including for instance : • An integer division-by-zero , • a segmentation violation , Figure 10 : The three windows of the EFTOS Monitor . In window 1 ( "" Global view "" ) , the visual column contains graphical hyperlinks pointing to second-level information about the corresponding processing node at the same row . Configuration is the DIR net-role . Status may be one of the following values : OK , Faulty , Isolated , Recovering , and Killed . Some minor information is also displayed at the bottom of the page . The right-hand hypertext ( window "" Node-specific information "" ) is the result of "" clicking "" on the top circular icon and enumerates the actions that have just taken place on node 0 , fresher-to-older . The elapsed time ( in seconds ) corresponding to each event is displayed . Underlined sentences may be further expanded by clicking on them e.g. , the bottom-left image reports about action number 115 of the hypertext . Figure 11 : The recursive loop of fault injection and monitoring . • a link failure , • rebooting a processing node , • killing a thread . These requests would then reach a CGI script , be translated in appropriate system - or application-level actions , which would then be executed or turned into fault-injection requests to be fulfilled by the DIR Manager . As an example of system-level action , the CGI script may directly execute a system command to reboot one node in the CC system . As of application-level actions , the Manager may for instance ask the trap handler tool ( see Chapter 3 ) to trigger a specific signal like SIGSEGV ( segmentation violation ) on a certain thread ; or it may request a watchdog timer tool ( again , described in Chapter 3 ) on a particular node to behave like if it had detected a time-out . As a direct consequence of the injection of these faults , a number of detection , isolation , and recovery actions take place on the system according to the EFTOS-based fault-tolerance strategies adopted by the designer in his / her application . These actions will then be reported in the snapshot files and displayed by the Monitor . This process , summarized in Fig. 11 , may be modeled after a recursive loop like follows : do { Inject fault ; Observe feed-back ; Derive conclusions ; Correct the fault tolerance model ; } while ( model is unsatisfying ) . This procedure should result in a useful tool for rapidly assessing a design , trying alternative fault-tolerance strategies , and overloading the system with malicious attacks aiming at verifying its resilience , with a quick and meaningful feed-back from the system . 4.6 Conclusions A distributed application has been presented , for monitoring the fault tolerance aspects of an embedded parallel application and for interactively injecting faults into it . The overall system makes up an integrated environment in which • the application , • a graphical rendering of the results , and • real-time interactions cyclically evolve . By doing so the researcher is made able to verify the hypothesis he / she is formulating about the system . The design choice to adopt low-cost , off-the-shelf components for hypermedia rendering revealed to be cost-effective , speed up the development process , match the design requirements , and pave the way towards more ambitious capabilities and features . In particular , the use of an Internet browser as hypermedia renderer allows inherit the benefits of the volcanic evolutions of web services , HTML languages , HTTP protocol , multimedia capabilities of the browsers , and so on . The high degree of openness proven by this heterogeneous application basing itself on uniform communication mechanisms and standardized access interfaces guarantees portability and makes it also a good starting point towards the development of similarly structured applications ranging from remote equipment control to hypermedia multi-user environments . The deeper insight gained from the EFTOS Monitor on the run-time aspects of our dependable applications has turned it into an invaluable tool to speed up the development of our application-level fault-tolerance provisions . 5 CONCLUSION We have described three examples of approaches used to assess the dependability of application-level provisions : Reliability analysis is used to quantify the benefits of coupling an approach such as recovery languages to a distributed voting mechanism ( De Florio , Deconinck , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) ; a custom tool is used to systematically inject faults onto the adaptively redundant data structure discussed in Chapter 4 ( De Florio & Blondia , 2008 ) ; a hypermedia application to watch and control a dependable service is then used for monitoring and fault-injection ( De Florio , Deconinck , Truyens , Rosseel , & Lauwereins , 1998 ) . A MATHEMATICAL DETAILS RELATED TO EQ . 2 The basic steps leading to Eq. 2 , i.e. , are described in what follows . The Markov reliability model of Fig. 1 brings to the following set of equations : The above equations can be written as follows : For any state s , let us now call Ls = L ( ps ( t )) , where L is the Laplace transform . Furthermore , as ( 310 ) is the initial state , it is reasonable to assume that p310 ( 0 ) = 1 and ∀ s 6 = ( 310 ) : ps ( 0 ) = 0 . Then taking the limit of the above equations as ∆ t goes to zero and taking the Laplace transform brings to Inverting the Laplace transform , the following probabilities can be found : ( only useful states have been computed ) . Let us denote with R the reliability of the basic component of the system , i.e. , exp − λt , and Rtmr as the reliability of the TMR system based on the same component . The reliability of the three and one spare system , R ( 1 ) ( C , t ) , is given by the sum of the above probabilities : which proves Eq. ( 2 ) . References Berners-Lee , T. J. , & Connolly , D.

Enjoy ! A TOOLS FOR TRANSLATORS AND COMPILERS : LEX AND YACC This section describes two well-known tools for crafting efficient translators and compilers : The LEX lexical analyzer and the YACC syntactical analyzer . A. 1 Introduction The capability to compose valid sentences in a given language , as well as to verify that a given string represents a valid sentence in a given language builds upon two lower-level capabilities : 1 . Classification , which is the ability to turn a stream of characters into a stream of lexical entities ( words , punctuation , delimiters ) , and 2 . Verification , that is , the ability to recognize the syntactical correctness of a sentence , starting from a stream of lexical entities . The first capability is also known as lexical analysis , the second as syntactical analysis . Given , for instance , the mathematical expression : p sin ( a + ( 0 . 4 )) , the first capability means translating the stream of characters representing the above expression , i.e. ( ' s ' , ' i ' , ' n ' , ' ' , ' ( ' , ' a ' , ... ) , into a stream of tokens , or syntactical atoms : ( "" sin "" , ' ( ' , "" a "" , ' + ' , "" sqrt "" , ... ) ; Syntactical analysis is indeed the tool that allows us to verify the syntactical correctness of a sentence , given a certain set of rules , called "" grammar "" – in the above example , the grammar of well-formed mathematical formulae . The above mentioned capabilities are experienced by human beings as inherent and natural abilities , of which one has not even full awareness . When one has to set up , e.g. , an interpreter of a computer language , or any other software module that needs recognize a given structure in its input stream , then it is useful to set up a hierarchical structure at the base of which there are tools for lexical and syntactical analysis . Such tools are software systems that ease the development of lexical and syntactical analyzers . Two well known standard utilities for this are LEX and YACC ( or their GNU counterpart , Flex and Bison ) . LEX and YACC allow to speed up considerably the development of parsers , translators , compilers , interpreter , conversion tools and have been used for more than 20 years by the author of this book to craft various tools , including those described in this chapter and in chapters 7 , 10 , and 11 . LEX and YACC have been especially designed for combined use and for hosting user-defined C routines . Custom versions supporting C ++ and Java also exist . In what follows we strictly follow the following two sources : ( Levine , Mason , & Brown , 1992 ) and ( Johnson , 1975 ) . A. 2 The LEX Lexical Analyzer LEX may be defined as a "" tokenizator "" : Given a stream of chars , LEX performs a classification of groups of contiguous characters . These groups are called tokens , i.e. , words and symbols that are atomic from the viewpoint of syntactical analysis . For instance , LEX can translate string sin ( a + sqrt ( 0 . 4 )) in a set of couples "" ( token , token number ) "" , e.g. , as follows : • "" sin "" , FUNCTION • "" ( "" , ' ( ' • and so forth . The token number identifies the class the token belongs to . LEX can be used • either as a stand-alone tool , so to perform simple translations or compute statistics on the lexical atoms , • or in conjunction with a parser generator . YACC is the natural choice , but it is always possible to choose another parser . LEX writes a deterministic finite state automaton from a list of regular expressions . Regardless the number of rules supplied by the user , and regardless their complexity , the LEX finite state automaton breaks the input stream into tokens in a time that is proportional to the length of the input stream . The number of rules and their complexity only influence the size of the output source code . The general structure of a LEX program is as follows : [ Definitions ] %% [ Rules ] [ %% User functions ] Definitions and User functions can be missing . Hence , the minimum size LEX program is the following one : %% LEX performs its classification via a list of regular expressions ( regex ) that the user needs to supply through a standard language . Regex describe patterns of characters to be located in the text . LEX reads these regular expressions and produces a finite state machine that recognizes those patterns . Finite state machines are indeed the simplest conceptual tool with which to recognize words expressed by regex . LEX uses the same regular expressions recognizer used by most of those UNIX tools that offer pattern matching services : vi , sed , awk , find , grep , for instance , adopt a similar set of agreement based on a similar set of "" meta-characters "" , including "" \ [ ] ^ - ? . * + | { } $ / ( ) % < > . ( Perl , archie , and others , adopt slightly different sets ) . In what follows we provide a brief description of the most important among the meta-characters : "" the quotation mark operator is the simplest meta-character : all the characters of a string between quotation marks are interpreted as plain ( non-meta ) characters . [ ... ] Squared parentheses ( pair [ ] ) specify classes of characters . For instance , [ xyz ] means : "" a single x , y or z char "" The hyphen sign between any two chars a and b means that all the chars between ord ( a ) and ord ( b ) are specified . For instance , [ A-Z ] means "" any uppercase letter "" , while [ A-Za-z ] means : "" any letter "" . Furthermore , [ \ 40 - \ 176 ] for instance selects a range of characters , that is , the one between octal ( 40 ) and octal ( 176 ) . [ ^ ... ] Character "" ^ "" , within the squared parentheses , means "" complementary set "" . For instance , [ ^ 0-9 ] means "" any character but the digits "" . \ ( Backslash ) has the same meaning it has , e.g. , in the C language function printf : It turns a meta-character into a plain character .. ( Dot ) means "" any character but ' \ n ' "" . ? The question mark goes after optional strings of characters . For instance , ab ? c means : "" either ' ac ' or ' abc ' "" . * Postfix operator "" star "" means zero or more instances of a given class . As an example , [ ^ a-zA-Z ] * means "" zero or more instances of non-alphabetic chars "" . + Postfix operator "" plus "" means one or more instances of a given class . For instance , [ xyz ] + means "" any non-empty string , of any size , consisting of any of the characters ' x ' , ' y ' and ' z ' "" , such as e.g. xyyyyyyzz . Operators ( ) and | . Parentheses group a set of characters into one object . For instance , in ( xyz ) + , operator + is applied to string xyz . Within a group , the OR between entities is specified via meta-character | . For instance , ( ab | cd + ) ? ( ef ) * means "" zero or more instances of string "" ef "" , possibly preceded either by string ab or by cd + ( c followed by one or more instances of d ) "" . ^ : This char , if not within square parentheses , means "" at begin-of-file or right after a newline . "" $ : This means "" at the end of a line "" or "" at end-of-file "" , i.e. , if the following char is either ' \ n ' or EOF . For instance , ( riga | row ) $ means "" string riga or string row followed either by \ n or by EOF . / : Infix operator slash checks whether an entity is followed by another one . For instance , a / b means "" character a , only when followed by character b "" . Note that ab / \ n is equivalent to ab $ . { } : Curly brackets have two meanings : • When grouping two comma-separated numbers , as in ( xyz ) { 1 , 5 } , they represent a multiple instance . The above example means "" from one to five instances of string xyz "" . • When grouping letters , they represent the value of a regex alias ( see further on ) . % Character % is reserved character , not a meta-character . A LEX source file may include up to three sections ; the first one is the one including the LEX definitions . Definitions include a list of regular expressions : letter letters [ a-zA-Z ] { letter } + This is , so to say , the grammar of the LEX definitions : 1 . At column 1 , an identifier is supplied , 2 . then some blank or tab chars , 3 . and finally a regular expression . After its definition , the identifier becomes an alias for its regular expression . To dereference an alias one has to put curly brackets around it . The Rules section is mainly a list of associations in the form r ⇒ a where r is a regular expression and a is a list of actions , i.e. , user defined C language statements that are executed when the corresponding regular expression is recognized . An example follows : %% begin end printf ( "" { "" ) ; { putchar ( ' } ' ) ; } When no rule is verified , a default rule is executed : ECHO , meaning "" print the current character "" . For readers accustomed to thinking in C , this means that the finite state automaton produced by LEX has a switch statement ending with "" default : ECHO ; . "" Practical consequences of this include , e.g. , that there is no need to supply rules for the so called "" literal tokens , "" i.e. , single characters whose token number is equal to their ASCII code . Another consequence is that in order to "" sift out "" some portion of text from the input stream , one needs recognize it explicitly and to associate a null action to it . As an example , to remove newline characters , one needs write this simple program : %% \ n ; Some simple transformations can be useful in order to facilitate the import of a file . For instance some word processors , such as TEX , regard paragraphs as multiple lines of text separated by two or more line feed characters , while other programs such as Word regard paragraphs as a single line and separate paragraphs with one or more line feed character . When one wants to import some TEX text into Word the following simple script may be useful : %% \ n \ n \ n ECHO ; putchar ( ' ' ) ; It converts every single \ n into a character space . When a regular expression is recognized , the corresponding string ( the token ) is copied in a string pointed by a char * called yytext . This is true also for literal tokens . The corresponding script is similar to the previous one : %% [ ^ \ n ] \ n [ ^ \ n ] { putchar ( yytext [ 0 ] ) ; putchar ( ' ' ) ; putchar ( yytext [ 2 ] ) ; } It is sometimes interesting to take a look at the source code of the program produced by LEX ; for instance , on my system running cygwin and flex , action ECHO turns out to actually be this simple macro : # define ECHO puts ( yytext ) Variable int yyleng is set by LEX to the number of characters of the string that verifies the current rule ; in other words , yyleng == strlen ( yytext ) . The following excerpt shows an example of how to use yyleng : %% [ 0-9 ] + [ a-zA-Z ] + ( . | \ n ) dig + = yyleng ; alp + = yyleng ; oth ++ ; Clearly the above excerpt is not a completely meaningful LEX program : 1 . Variable dig etc. have not been declared . 2 . No output message is provided at the end . Nevertheless , this is not a buggy LEX program : The objective of LEX is to produce a C program , not necessarily an error free one : No checks are done on the syntactic correctness of the output program . Typical situations are that some syntax errors slip in the actions ( indeed , actions are simply copied as strings into the output program ) . Later on we will describe how to introduce C text into the output program so as to declare variables and produce output messages at end of processing time . A number of functions are available to the LEX user : yymore ( ) instructs LEX so that the next matched string is attached to the current value of yytext . An example follows : %% \ "" [ ^ "" ] * { if ( yytext [ yyleng-1 ] == ' \\ ' ) yymore ( ) ; else do_that ( yytext ) ; } yyless ( ) "" sends back "" a given number of characters . This can be very useful in some cases . For instance , in the early days of the C programming language , a = - b had the same meaning of a - = b ( that is , subtract b from a ) . This is no more the case , so the first form could result in a hidden bug when current compilers deal with "" old dusty deck "" software . To detect possible problems one may use the following filter : %% = - [ a-zA-Z ] { printf ( "" Operator = - is ambiguous : "" ) ; printf ( "" not recognized . \ n "" ) ; yyless ( yyleng-2 ) ; manage_assignment ( ) ; } The form yyless ( x ) pushes back onto the input yyleng − x characters . int input ( ) reads the next input character . Character NULL ( bitwise equivalent to ( int ) 0 ) is interpreted as the end-of-file condition ) . void output ( char c ) writes c onto the output stream . void unput ( char c ) "" pushes back "" c into the input stream . The user can choose between a standard version of these functions or make use of his or her own versions of those functions , which must have the same name and prototype . int yywrap ( void ) This system ( or user - ) function is called when an EOF is encountered . The system version of this function returns 1 , which means "" end of processing . "" The user can substitute this function with a new version which , if it returns 0 , lets the execution continue until a new EOF is encountered . By doing so it is possible , e.g. , to process more than one input file during the same run . Another use of yywrap ( ) is to allow the user to specify end-of-job functions ( for instance , printing the final output ) , which is one of the requirement we highlighted for the code fragment at page 319 . LEX adopts two steps to select which user rule to apply : 1 . The rule that recognizes the largest string is always preferred . 2 . If more than one rule recognizes largest strings , it is chosen the rule the user has specified first in the LEX script . Within a same rule , LEX returns the largest possible string : %% \ ' . * \ ' { yytext [ 0 ] = ' [ ' ; yytext [ yyleng-2 ] = ' ] ' ; printf ( "" % s "" , yytext ) ; } produces a program that , when reading an input string such as ' hi ' - he said - ' how are you ? ' , writes the following string on the output : [ hi ' - he said - ' how are you ? ] . When LEX selects which rule to execute , it creates an ordered list of possible candidates . The one to be executed is the one at the top of the list . When that action includes macro REJECT ; the following two actions take place : 1 . The input string is sent back onto the input stream . 2 . The rule is removed from the list . The rule that is selected is therefore the new top one . REJECT is useful , e.g. , to count all the "" digrams "" ( that is , all the couples of contiguous alphabetic characters ) in a given text : %% [ A-Z ] [ a-z ] { ( . | \ n ) digram [ yytext [ 0 ]] [ yytext [ 1 ]] ++ ; REJECT ; } ; Each digram in the text is located by the first rule , as it returns a string of two characters while the second one returns a string of just one character . REJECT writes back the two characters of the digram onto the standard input stream and rejects the first rule . The second one is then executed . As a result , a character is removed from the input stream . LEX allows to include in the output C source code any useful information ( header files , declaration of global variables and so forth ) . An example follows : %% [ a-z ] [ a-z ] { extern int dig [ 26 ] [ 26 ] ; dig [ yytext [ 0 ] - ' a ' ] [ yytext [ 1 ] - ' a ' ] ++ ; REJECT ; } ( . | \ n ) ; %% int dig [ 26 ] [ 26 ] ; int yywrap ( ) { int i , j ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 26 ; i ++ ) for ( j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j ++ ) if ( dig [ i ] [ j ] ) printf ( "" digram [ % c % c ] = % d \ n "" , ' a ' + i , ' a ' + j , dig [ i ] [ j ] ) ; return 1 ; } Inclusion can be done in three "" zones "" of the output source file : 1 . At the end of the file ( as it is done in the above example ) . 2 . At the beginning of the file , that is , before any of the functions . 3 . At the beginning of function yylex ( ) . The three zones in the output source code correspond to the following zones of the LEX script : 1 . In User Functions . 2 . In Definitions , 3 . On top of Rules , i.e. , right after the first %% ; Case 1 is trivial – one has just to write the required C code , as shown in the above example . For 2 and 3 , we need to distinguish the text to be processed by LEX from the text that needs be copied verbatim in the output file . To do so , one can follow any of these ways : • [ t ] + . * ( at least a blank space or tab character at column zero , then the data to be flushed onto the output file . ) • Anything between % { and % } . In most UNIX environments , in order to process a LEX source code available in file source . l , one needs execute the following commands : 1 . lex source . l ( that is we use LEX to translate source . l into the C program lex . yy . c ; the same syntax is used with GNU flex . ) 2 . cc - o output lex . yy . c - ll ( that is we use the C compiler to read the C program produced by LEX and compile it with the assistance of the LEX library , producing an executable file called output . ) 3 . . / output ( that is , we execute the output file . ) File lex . yy . c includes function yylex ( ) i.e. , the actual scanner . Compiling lex . yy . c with the system library libl . a ( or libfl . a in the case of FLEX ) a main ( ) function is automatically supplied , which calls function yylex ( ) . The user can substitute this default main ( ) with one of his or her own design . Doing this , one can choose between either automatically generating an executable or "" pipelining "" LEX output to other programs – for instance , a syntactical analyzer such as YACC . A. 3 Syntactical Analysis with YACC YACC , whose name stands for "" Yet Another Compiler-Compiler , "" has been defined by its authors as a system for describing the input structure of a program . Indeed , the YACC programmer is required to supply : 1 . The syntactical structure of the input , and 2 . C code to be executed when the syntax rules are recognized . On the basis of the above input data , YACC produces a C program with a parsing routine . The parsing routine calls a lower level routine , called yylex ( ) , in order to get the next lexical atoms in the input stream . It goes without saying that LEX produces exactly one such routine . YACC works with grammars of type LALR ( 1 ) , plus rules to solve ambiguities . As its names tell , YACC is just one of many "" compiler compilers "" , and many new powerful syntactical analyzers have been designed , a noteworthy example being ANTLR ( Parr , 2007 ) . Some of them are open software and can be easily downloaded and compiled from the Internet . YACC ( or its GNU sibling , Bison ) is likely to be available on any UNIX distribution , so we decided to focus on its syntax . Another reason to go for YACC with respect to other tools is that its syntax has been designed so as to make it very easy to master its functions for someone who knows LEX already . A. 3 . 1 Structure of a YACC Script The general structure of a YACC script strictly follows the one of a LEX script : [ Definitions ] %% Rules & Actions [ %% User functions ] In particular , the structure of Rules & Actions is similar to the corresponding section of a LEX script : It includes a set of grammar rules , plus actions that are associated to each rule . Each time a rule is recognized , the corresponding actions are executed . Actions may return values and use the values returned by other actions . YACC rules have the following structure : lhs : rhs ; where lhs is a non-terminal symbol and rhs is a sequence of zero or more terminal or non-terminal symbols , "" literals "" ( see below ) , and actions . Identifiers for terminal and non-terminal symbols follow the rules of the C language , with the addition that character ' . ' is considered as a letter . A literal is a constant character defined as follows : literal : QUOTE char QUOTE | QUOTE BACKSLASH char QUOTE | QUOTE BACKSLASH od od od QUOTE ; where in this case QUOTE is character "" and od is an octal digit . The pipe character "" | "" is the YACC way to represent alternative definitions – it reads out as "" or "" . It is used when more than one rule has the same lhs . As with LEX , the parentheses % { and % } allow to include in the output of YACC any C source code . This code is global with respect to the parser function and to the user functions . YACC uses a number of identifiers starting with "" yy "" for internal purposes . As a consequence it is a good idea to avoid that prefix : While the YACC syntax is more or less standard , clearly its implementations may be completely different from each other or from future ones . A variable starting with "" yy "" may translate in a hidden design fault . Lexical atoms ( the tokens ) must be explicitly declared in Definitions . This is done , for instance , by writing one or more lines such as the following one : % token name1 name2 ... All the symbols that have not declared as tokens are implicitly declared as non-terminals ( non-terminals ) . An important property that must be guaranteed for any YACC source program is that each non-terminal must be the lhs of at least one rule . The declaration of the start symbol of the grammar may be done as follows : % start name in Declarations . If this specification is missing , it is assumed that the start symbol is the lhs of the first grammar rule specified by the user . A special token marks the end-of-input . This is called end-marker in YACC lingo . If the tokens encountered between the start of processing and the end-marker ( not including the latter ) verify the start symbol , then the parsers successfully stops processing after having read the end-marker . Reading the end-marker before the start symbol is verified leads to an error . Within each rule , the programmer can specify some actions to be executed each time that rule is recognized while analysing the input stream . Actions may return values and use the values returned by other actions . Also the tokens returned by yylex ( ) may have values . Actions are a group of C statements between curly brackets . Each action can return a value by setting variable $$ . For instance : { action ( ) ; $$ = 1 ; } returns 1 . Also the rules may return values . This value is either the value of the first component or the value of variable $$ . For instance : A : B ; is equivalent to A : B { $$ = $ 1 ; } ; The following example shows how it is possible to use the values returned by previous rules : expr : ' ( ' { expr ' ) ' $$ = $ 2 ; } ; In other words , $ i is the value returned by RHS [ i ] . An example follows : Let us suppose we wanted to build a syntax analysis tree and for that we are using a function node ( ) that allocates a new syntax object and returns its address . Then such functions could be called in rules such as the following one : expr : expr infix_op expr { $$ = node ( $ 2 , $ 1 , $ 3 ) ; } ; Values returned by rules and actions are integers by default . As we mentioned in previous section , function yylex ( ) returns an integer – the token number . This number is either a literal ( when in [ 0 , 255 ] ) or a symbolic constant s > 256 that describes the lexical "" class "" the recognized string belongs to . One such class could be , for instance , NUMBER , identifying all numerical symbolic constants . Function yylex ( ) also returns the actual string that was found in the input . That string is kept in variable extern X yylval ; where X is either int or can be defined by the user . An example follows : %% [ 0-9 ] + { yylval = atoi ( yytext ) ; return NUMBER ; } The choice of which integers to use with tokens can be done automatically by YACC , which associates the integers from 256 one by one to the tokens that have been declared with the % token keyword ; or implicitly for literals , to which it is associated their ASCII code ; or explicitly by the YACC programmer , who can associate an integer greater than 0 after the name of a token or a literal in section Declarations . Token numbers must be different . When executing yacc with the - d option , a header file is created , called y . tab . h , which contains all the token numbers . This file can be included , e.g. , in the LEX script , through a statement such as the following one : % { # include "" y . tab . h "" % } Note that the C program produced by LEX can be either compiled separately or even included in the YACC output program by specifying in User functions the following statement : # include "" lex . yy . c "" A. 3 . 2 Associativity rules Some arithmetical operators have their own associativity rules , and by agreement there are priorities between them . Therefore a method is required in order to set a priority among operators and to choose beforehand the type of associativity that is required . The kind of associativity of an operator can be defined in YACC by the three directives : % left % right % nonassoc Such directives also represent an alternative way to declare tokens and literals with respect to % token . For instance , % right % left ' = ' ' - ' ' + ' selects right association for the assignment operator ( that is , a = b = c is interpreted as a = ( b = c )) and left association for ' + ' and ' - ' . Each row defines a priority level . The earlier the specification appears in the source file , the lower its priority : ' = ' ≺ ( ' + ' , ' - ' ) ≺ · · · For instance , a = b = c ∗ d − e − f / g ; is interpreted as a = ( b = ((( c ∗ d ) − e ) − ( f / g ))) ; Keyword % nonassoc specifies that a certain operator must not be applied more than once . For instance , in Fortran the following expression A. LT . B. LT . C is not valid . The % nonassoc tokens catch such conditions . There are cases in which a same sign , for instance ' - ' , has two different meanings and priorities : expr : | | | expr ' = ' expr expr ' * ' expr expr ' - ' expr ' - ' expr Unary "" minus "" has greater priority than that of diadic "" minus "" . In such cases one can make use of a fictitious token and operator % prec : % left ' + ' ' - ' % left ' * ' ' / ' % left UMINUS %% expr : expr ' - ' expr | .... | ' - ' expr % prec UMINUS / * same priority of UMINUS * / As we have seen already , the value stack of YACC is by default based on short integers . The user can override that choice and choose any other type . In this case the value stack is organized as a vector of union's . The programmer can declare such union and associate the name of its members with the tokens and non-terminals that return a value . When the user does declare the union , the following string is attached to any reference like $$ or $ i : . field-name This is a possible example % union { char * String ; double Real ; int Integer ; } An equivalent way to shape this union is by defining explicitly type YYSTYPE : typedef union { char * String ; double Real ; int Integer ; } YYSTYPE ; After that definition one can associate a field-name to a token like follows : % left % right <Integer> <Real> ' + ' ' = ' ' - ' It is even possible to associate a field-name to a non-terminal : % type % type <String> <Real> expr number Another possibility is to associate a field-name to an action : expr : ' ( ' strexp ' ) ' { $ <Real> $ = atof ( $ <String> 2 ) ; } ; that is , "" $ < "" , followed by a field-name , followed by "" > $ "" References Johnson , S.

Art is built by compiling the Lex source code "" Ariel . l "" and the YACC source code "" Ariel . y "" , together with several ancillary C source codes . Art takes as input an Ariel script and produces as output : 1 . 2 . A number of configuration files describing a distributed application and an execution platform . An error recovery specification , expressed in the form of a pseudo-code for the Ariel virtual machine . The configuration files are to be compiled with the sources of the distributed application , while the error recovery specifications are compiled with the Ariel virtual machine , which then executes concurrently with the distributed application . Each time a fault is detected in the system , the Ariel virtual machine executes the error recovery specification interpreting the pseudo-code . This pseudo-code is called "" r-code "" ( recovery code ) and represents the "" virtual machine language "" for a stack machine called RINT . More details on this can be found in Chapter 7 . We begin with the Ariel's scanner , "" ariel . l "" , then we provide an excerpt of some ancillary source code used by Ariel's parser , and we conclude with an abridged view to the latter . Ariel's scanner Source code Ariel . l starts with a "" % { "" ... "" % } "" section , within which a few comment lines introduce the source code , its version and so forth . C header files are included and some global variables are declared . An example is "" lines "" , an integer starting at 1 and counting the number of lines being processed : % { / ************************** ** ** File : ariel . l ** ** Description : scanner ** ** Language : lex ** ** History : ** Version 2 . 0d 08-Feb-2006 ** - added "" Watchdog "" ... lines omitted ... *************************** # include int lines = 1 ; % } Ariel . l continues with its definitions . These include : Ariel's keywords , such as "" IF "" or "" THEN "" ; generic lexical atoms such as "" NUMBER "" or "" REAL "" ; atoms such as "" THREAD "" or "" NODE "" , defining the Ariel identifiers for Ariel's "" entities "" , in this case respectively processes or computers ; atoms such as "" AGENT "" or "" MANAGER "" , defining the roles that are to be assigned to certain processes : IF FI ELSE THEN ( [ Ii ] [ Ff ] ) ( [ Ff ] [ Ii ] ) ( [ Ee ] [ Ll ] [ Ss ] [ Ee ] ) ( [ Tt ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Nn ] ) ... lines omitted ... THREAD ( [ Tt ] ( [ 0-9 ] + ) GROUP ( [ GgLl ] ( [ 0-9 ] + ) NODE ( [ Nn ] ( [ 0-9 ] + ) DIGIT [ 0-9 ] NUMBER ( "" - "" ) ? [ 0-9 ] + REAL ((( { NUMBER } ) ? { DOT } ) ? { NUMBER } ) AGENT ( [ Aa ] [ Gg ] [ Ee ] [ Nn ] [ Tt ] [ Ss ] ? ) BACKUPAGENT (( [ Bb ] [ Aa ] [ Cc ] [ Kk ] [ Uu ] [ Pp ] [ Ss ] ? ) { AGENT } ? ) | ( [ Aa ] [ Ss ] [ Ss ] [ Ii ] [ Ss ] [ Tt ] [ Aa ] [ Nn ] [ Tt ] [ Ss ] ? ) MANAGER ( [ Mm ] [ Aa ] [ Nn ] [ Aa ] [ Gg ] [ Ee ] [ Rr ] ) ROLE ( { AGENT } | { BACKUPAGENT } | { MANAGER } ) Other definitions specify Ariel's guards or pre-conditions . Such guards are to check whether a given entity has been stopped or restarted , or detected as faulty , or isolated , and so forth : KILLED RESTARTED PRESENT RUNNING ISOLATED FAULTY "" - "" ? (( [ Kk ] ( [ Ii ] [ Ll ] [ Ll ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] ) ? ) | ( [ Ss ] [ Tt ] [ Oo ] [ Pp ] [ Pp ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] )) "" - "" ? [ Rr ] ( [ Ee ] [ Ss ] [ Tt ] [ Aa ] [ Rr ] [ Tt ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] ) ? "" - "" ? [ Pp ] ( [ Rr ] [ Ee ] [ Ss ] [ Ee ] [ Nn ] [ Tt ] ) ? "" - "" ? ( [ Rr ] [ Uu ] [ Nn ] [ Nn ] [ Ii ] [ Nn ] [ Gg ] ) "" - "" ? [ Ii ] ( [ Ss ] [ Oo ] [ Ll ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Ee ] [ Dd ] ) ? "" - "" ? [ Ff ] ( [ Aa ] [ Uu ] [ Ll ] [ Tt ] [ Yy ] ) ? There follow some definitions for the configuration of single version and multiple version fault-tolerance provisions . As an example , these are the Lex definitions corresponding to a watchdog timer : WATCHDOG KEYW_AT WATCHES HEARTBEATS EVERY MS US REBOOT EndWatchdog [ Ww ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Cc ] [ Hh ] [ Dd ] [ Oo ] [ Gg ] ( [ Aa ] [ Tt ] ) [ Ww ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Cc ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Ss ] [ Hh ] [ Ee ] [ Aa ] [ Rr ] [ Tt ] [ Bb ] [ Ee ] [ Aa ] [ Tt ] [ Ss ] [ eE ] [ vV ] [ eE ] [ Rr ] [ Yy ] [ Mm ] [ Ss ] [ Uu ] [ Ss ] [ Rr ] [ Ee ] [ Bb ] [ Oo ] [ Oo ] [ Tt ] ( [ Ee ] [ Nn ] [ Dd ] (( [ ] + ) ? ( { WATCHDOG } ))) Then the Ariel's rules are listed . As an example , when art encounters the token "" GID "" ( in Ariel , the identifier of a group of tasks , e.g. "" G42 "" ) , the corresponding actions set the return value , yylval , with the group number ( 42 ) and with the role of the given entity ( in this case , ID_NORMAL | ID_GROUP , which means "" a user-defined group of tasks "" ) . Note how yylval is in this case is not a scalar value but a complex data type defined by the YACC "" % union "" statement ( see Section 3 ) : %% { GID } { yylval . id . role = ID_NORMAL | ID_GROUP ; sscanf ( yytext + 1 , "" % d "" , & yylval . id . id ) ; return GID ; } Another few examples of Ariel rules . Some of them set yylval ( e.g. "" NUMBER "" , corresponding to an integer input , or "" REAL "" , namely a real number ) ; some others simply return a token number to the calling parser ( e.g. , definition "" WATCHDOG "" returns the token number represented by the symbolic constant having the same name ) . Token numbers are created automatically by YACC in this case . The last rule catches unrecognized characters , which are printed on the output and ignored : { NUMBER } { sscanf ( yytext , "" % d "" , & yylval . integer ) ; return NUMBER ; } { { REAL } sscanf ( yytext , "" % f "" , & yylval . real ) ; return REAL ; { WATCHDOG } { WATCHES } { HEARTBEATS } { EVERY } { MS } { US } { REBOOT } { EndWatchdog } { THRESHOLD } { ALPHACOUNT } { FACTOR } { EndAlpha } . } return WATCHDOG ; return WATCHES ; return HEARTBEATS ; return EVERY ; return MILLISEC ; return MICROSEC ; return REBOOT ; return KEYW_ENDWATCHDOG ; return THRESHOLD ; return ALPHACOUNT ; return FACTOR ; return KEYW_ENDALPHA ; fprintf ( stderr , "" Lex : unrecognized char : % s \ n "" , yytext ) ; Ariel's r-code As we mentioned already , the output of the art translator include the translation of the Ariel script into rcode . To explain in more detail how this is done , we provide here an excerpt of the header files and source codes that create the r-code . Finally , we briefly describe the main loop of RINT , the run-time executive of the r-code . 1 . R-code . h Header file "" rcode . h "" defines the opcode of the RINT virtual machine . These are organized as a series of integer numbers between 0 and LAST_RCODE ( in the current implementation , 56 ) . The opcodes are organized into classes , consisting of one or more opcode . The header file also defines a number of predicates , such as isstoprcode or issetrcode , returning a non-zero value when the argument satisfies the predicate . Rcode . h consists of a compile-time section , used when compiling the Ariel translator "" art "" , and a run-time section , used when compiling the r-code virtual machine RINT . / * The R-opcodes * / # define R_STOP # define isstoprcode ( x ) 000000 ( ! x ) # define R_SET_ROLE # define R_SET_DEF_ACT 1 2 # define issetrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_SET_ROLE && x < = R_SET_DEF_ACT ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 R_AND R_OR R_NOT R_INC_NEST R_DEC_NEST R_STRVAL R_STRPHASE # define is1operandrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_AND && x < = R_STRPHASE ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_FALSE R_GOTO R_PUSH R_FUNCTION_CALL R_OANEW R_CLEAR R_PAUSE 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # define is2operandrcode ( x ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_KILLED R_RESTARTED R_PRESENT R_ISOLATED R_FAULTY R_FIRED R_PAUSED R_REINTEGRATED # define R_STRERRN # define R_STRERRT # define R_COMPARE ( x > = R_FALSE && x < = R_PAUSE ) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 # define isclause ( x ) ( x > = R_KILLED && x < = R_REINTEGRATED ) # define istestrcode ( x ) ( x > = R_KILLED && x < = R_COMPARE ) # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define # define R_KILL R_WARN R_ANDWARN R_START R_RESTART R_REBOOT R_CHKERR R_ENABLE R_REMOVE R_REMOVE_ALL R_SEND R_GET R_SET R_CONST R_ADD R_SUBTRACT R_MULTIPLY R_DIVIDE R_COMPLEMENT R_LOGS R_LOGI R_LOGC R_LOGV R_EVENT R_ISOLATET R_ISOLATEG R_ISOLATEN R_SETPHASE 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 # define isactionrcode ( x ) # define R_DEADLOCKED # define LAST_RCODE // // // // // // // VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , VdF , Oct 2002 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 30 Oct 2002 13 Oct 2002 ( x > = R_KILL && x < = R_REMOVE_ALL ) 56 R_DEADLOCKED There follow the definition of type rcode_t , which is a triplet of integers consisting of an opcode and two arguments . The rcode translation of the Ariel script is stored into an array of rcode_t triplets , called compile_time_rcode : typedef int rcode_t [ 3 ] ; # ifdef COMPILETIME static rcode_t compile_time_rcode [ RCODE_MAX_CARD ] ; # endif The rcode . h header file then defines the data structures for the management of Ariel nested IF statements , which need to be translated into their rcode equivalent by means of conditional and unconditional branch instructions ( R_FALSE and R_GOTO ) . Their meaning is explained in Sect . 2 . struct goto_t { int pc ; / * pc is the value of the RINT program counter * / struct goto_t * next ; } ; typedef struct { int pc ; struct goto_t * gotos ; } if_t ; static if_t ifs [ RCODE_MAX_NEST ] , * iftop ; static int ifp ; This concludes the compile-time section of header file rcode . h . There follow the declarations for the r-code functions , i.e. , the functions that are executed by RINT when interpreting the opcodes . All these functions read the three integers corresponding to an r-code and return an integer exit value : # ifndef COMPILETIME int int int int int int R_Stop ( int , int , int ) ; R_And ( int , int , int ) ; R_Or ( int , int , int ) ; R_Not ( int , int , int ) ; R_OArenew ( int , int , int ) ; R_Clear ( int , int , int ) ; ... lines omitted ... int int int R_IsolateGroup ( int , int , int ) ; R_IsolateNode ( int , int , int ) ; R_Deadlocked ( int , int , int ) ; An extra function called R_Nop ( for "" no operation "" ) is also declared . Such function corresponds to outdated opcodes still to be reorganized . Finally , rfunc , an array of function pointers is defined statically ( that is , at compile time ) . Note that entry rfunc [ i ] corresponds to the i-th opcode : int R_Nop ( int a , int b , int c ) ; // { return 0 ; } static int ( * rfunc [ ] ) ( int , int , int ) = { R_Stop , // 0 R_Nop , // 1 R_Nop , // 2 R_And , // 3 R_Or , // 4 R_Not , // 5 R_NestIn , // 6 R_NestOut , // 7 R_StoreVal , // 8 ... lines omitted ... R_IsolateGroup , R_IsolateNode , R_Deadlocked , } ; // 54 // 55 // 56 2 . R-code . c Source file rcode . c defines , among others , the functions to generate the rcode-equivalent of an Ariel recovery script . Some of these functions are very simple , such as rcode_stop : / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_STOP R-code , which closes an R-code object file * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_stop ( ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] = R_STOP ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 1 ] = -1 ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = -1 ; pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } Some others are complex and intertwined , such as those corresponding to the IF THEN ... ELSE / ELIF ... FI statements : / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_FALSE R-code , corresponding to the beginning of * / / * ' if / then / elif / else / fi ' statements . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_if ( ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { if ( iftop == NULL ) { iftop = & ifs [ 0 ] ; ifp = 0 ; } else { ifp ++ ; iftop = & ifs [ ifp ] ; } / * top-level if * / / * non top-level if * / iftop - > gotos = NULL ; iftop - > pc = pc ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ DEST ] compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = R_FALSE ; = 0 ; = -1 ; / * new R_FALSE statement * / / * goto value initially set to 0 * / / * unused * / pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code ( unconditioned branch ) . It is used to * / / * jump to the next ' elif ' or the ' else ' part of an ' if ' statement . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_goto ( int where ) { if ( pc < RCODE_MAX_CARD ) { compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 0 ] = R_GOTO ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 1 ] = where ; compile_time_rcode [ pc ] [ 2 ] = -1 ; pc ++ ; return pc ; } return 0 ; } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code statement which closes the current section * / / * of an ' if ' statement , together with the R_FALSE R-code which starts a * / / * new ' elif ' section . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_elif ( int goto_address ) { / * when we encounter an ' elif ' statement , three things have to be managed : 1 . first , a goto_t block has to be allocated and linked to the list , and an incomplete goto statement has to be added to rcode list ; 2 . secondly , compile_time_rcode [ iftop - > pc ] [ 3 ] i.e. , the running value , has to be updated with the current value of the pc register ; 3 . third , a new ' false ' statement has to added , and iftop - > pc should be updated with the current value of the pc register . * / ... lines omitted ... } / ***************************************************************************** / / * generates the R_GOTO R-code , corresponding to the beginning of * / / * an ' else ' section of an ' if ' statement . Ends the R_FALSE R-code * / / * R-code corresponding to previous section . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_else ( int goto_address ) { / * when we encounter an ' else ' statement , two things have to be managed : 1 . first , a goto_t block has to be allocated and linked to the list , and an incomplete goto statement has to be added to rcode list ; 2 . secondly , compile_time_rcode [ iftop - > pc ] [ 3 ] i.e. , the running value , has to be updated with the current value of the pc register ; No new ' false ' statement has to be added , nor iftop - > pc should be updated with the current value of the pc register , as it was the case with rcode_elif ( ) . * / ... lines omitted ... } / ***************************************************************************** / / * ends the pending R_GOTO's , corresponding to all sections of the * / / * current ' if ' . Ends also the top R_FALSE . * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rcode_fi ( ) { / * Once we encounter a ' fi ' it obviously means that a whole ' if ' statement is over ; when this happens we still have to adjust the whole list of goto's so as to point to this statement . When everything is done for each and every goto , then it 's time to pop the ' if ' statement off the stack . When we reach the bottom we also have to reset iftop to NULL . * / ... lines omitted ... } Rcode . c also defines rflush , the function that , at the end of processing time , flushes the contents of compile_time_rcode into the output files . One such file is "" trl . h "" , an example of which is available in Table 6 of Chapter 7 . Function rflush is called by the main function of the Ariel . y parser . / ***************************************************************************** / / * flushes the R-codes to the object file , resets counters accordingly * / / ***************************************************************************** / int rflush ( ) { extern FILE * f ; n = fwrite (( void * ) & compile_time_rcode [ 0 ] [ 0 ] , sizeof ( rcode_t ) , pc , f ) ; fflush ( f ) ; 3 . Rint . c This section briefly sketches the source code of the RINT virtual machine , the interpreter of the r-code generated by the art translator . Its main function is rather simple : int main ( void ) / * RINT main module * / { rdump = fopen ( "" rdump . txt "" , "" w "" ) ; / * rdump logs all the executed rcodes * / if ( BSL_InitLibrary ( ) == BSL_ERROR ) { / * connects to the BSL ( re : Chap . 7 , Sect . 3 . 2 ) * / fprintf ( stderr , "" RINT : failed to initialise BSL \ n "" ) ; BSL_CloseLibrary ( ) ; return -1 ; } dowhile ( ) ; / * executes a loop in function "" dowhile "" * / if ( BSL_CloseLibrary ( ) == BSL_ERROR ) { / * and disconnects * / fprintf ( stderr , "" RINT : failed to close BSL . Clean up the system manually ! \ n "" ) ; return -1 ; } return 0 ; } Clearly the greater part of the complexity of RINT lies in its dowhile function , which just waits continuously for a waking message after which it executes the rcodes one by one : dowhile ( ) { int line ; extern int rcode_card ; size = sizeof ( message_t ) ; while ( 1 ) { RINTGetMessage ( ) ; / * "" Wake up ! "" * / printf ( "" Recovery starts ( % d r-codes ) . \ n "" , rcode_card ) ; BSL_ResetTimerBase ( ) ; / * Zero time counters * / line = 0 ; while ( line < rcode_card ) { / * line ( program counter ) is zeroed * / / * while there are rcodes ... * / ... lines omitted ... / * execute the function corresponding to the current rcode * / rfunc [ rcodes [ line ] [ 0 ] ] ( rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] , rcodes [ line ] [ 2 ] , line ) ; line ++ ; } The execution of the rcodes implies the use of a run-time stack for the evaluation of arithmetical and Boolean expressions . Such stack is accessed through function R_Push and R_Pop , defined elsewhere . After the execution of any arithmetical or Boolen operation , the result is pushed onto the stack . This is for instance the execution of R_False , _the function corresponding to recovery opcode R_FALSE : if ( R_Pop ( ) == FALSE ) // check the top of the stack { fprintf ( rdump , "" % d \ tConditional GOTO , fulfilled , % d . \ n "" , line , line + rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] ) ; line + = rcodes [ line ] [ 1 ] ; // if FALSE , execute jmp continue ; } Another simple example is given by function R_Or ( the run-time executive for opcode R_OR ) : int R_Or ( int op1 , int dummy , int rline ) { / * RCODE : R_OR ARIEL : part of the expressions within IF statements * / int t = R_Pop ( ) ; int s = R_Pop ( ) ; R_Push ( t || s ) ; fprintf ( rdump , "" % d \ tOR statement ( popped % d and % d , pushed % d ) . \ n "" , rline , t , s , t || s ) ; return t || s ; } After having described the Ariel scanner and Ariel's compile-time and run-time components , we can now focus our attention on the Ariel parser . Ariel's parser The Ariel parser is the program that actually instructs the translation from the high-level Ariel source into the lower-level rcodes and configuration header files . A thorough description of this section would be inappropriate , so we concentrate on a few particularly meaningful fragments . As already mentioned , the structure of a YACC parser closely resembles that of LEX scanners . For instance , like Ariel . l , also Ariel . y begins with a "" % { "" ... "" % } "" section . Among other things , in that section we include header file "" rcode . h "" , described in previous section , and define the type of yylval through the "" % union "" statement : % { ... lines omitted ... # include "" rcode . h "" typedef struct { unsigned int role ; / * a bit pattern with one or more of these bit positions turned on : ID_GROUP , ID_THREAD , ID_NODE , ID_ENTITY , ID_NORMAL , ID_STAR , ID_DOLLAR * / int id ; } / * an integer identifying the entity * / ident_t ; % union { float real ; int integer ; ident_t id ; struct { char name [ 64 ] ; int rcode ; } string ; char quoted_string [ 64 ] ; int status ; // // // // value of value of role and symbolic the just scanned real number the just scanned integer number id of an entity name of an rcode opcode // value of a quoted string // status info } Ariel also defines 26 integer variables , each for each letter of the English alphabet . The Definitions section of YACC also makes room for them : static int var [ 26 ] ; / * Ariel's 26 pre-defined and pre-initialised variables * / Several sections follow , which describe the data structures for the configuration of some of the "" Basic Tools "" ( see Chapter 7 , Sect . 2.3 for more detail on this ) . One such tool is the watchdog timer , a Singleversion software fault-tolerance provision that would normally be configured in the functional source code of the user application . Ariel allows configuring such tools in the Ariel ( non-functional ) source code . Here is the YACC section of the watchdog : ... lines omitted ... / ************************** watchdogs ***************************** / typedef struct { int watching , / * id of the watching task * / watched , / * id of the watched task * / rate , unit , action , target , running ; } watchdog_t ; # define MAX_WDOGS 32 watchdog_t watchdog [ MAX_WDOGS ] ; int w_sp = 0 ; # define INCWATCH ++ w_sp ; # define WATCHTOP watchdog [ w_sp ] # define BADWATCH ( w_sp > MAX_WDOGS ) # define MAX_WD_FNAME 80 # define MAX_WD_NAME 40 int watchdog_flush ( watchdog_t * , int ) ; // creates the source codes for the watchdogs / *********************** end watchdogs **************************** / Another section defines a restoring organ ( see Chapter 4 , Section 3 on the EFTOS Voting Farm , the source of which was used here ) . Note that this is a software fault-tolerance provision that would normally require a non-negligible amount of code intrusion , which is considerably reduced in this case : / ************************* nversion ****************************** / typedef struct { int version , // version id task , // task id timeout , // max duration of task unit ; // millisecs or microsecs } version_t ; # define MAX_VERS 7 // up to 7 versions ( 7-MR system ) typedef struct { int running , // parsing flag task ; // task id of the restoring organ version_t va [ MAX_VERS ] ; // the versions int va_num ; // running number of encountered versions int voting ; // voting algorithm char * metric ; // name of the metric function int success , error ; int versmin , versmax ; // versions can be given in any order } nversion_t ; # define MAX_NVERS 16 // up to 16 restoring organs nversion_t nversion [ MAX_NVERS ] ; int nv_sp = 0 ; // stack pointer for nversion [ ] # define INCNVERS ++ nv_sp ; # define NVERSTOP nversion [ nv_sp ] # define BADNVERS ( nv_sp > MAX_NVERS ) # define MAX_NV_FNAME 80 # define MAX_NV_NAME 40 int nversion_flush ( nversion_t * , int ) ; // creates the sources of the restoring organs / *********************** end nversion **************************** / Another section defines the tokens , ( optionally ) their type , and precedence / associativity rules : % token % token % token % token ROLE <integer> NUMBER VAR <real> REAL <id> GID NID TID % token % token % token % token % token % token % token % token % token IF ELSE ELIF FI THEN KILL RESTART START ISOLATE KEYW_TASK KEYW_TASKID KEYW_NODE KEYW_IS KEYW_ALIAS KEY KEYW_LOGICAL KEYW_ENDLOGICAL WATCHDOG WATCHES HEARTBEATS EVERY REBOOT KEYW_ENDWATCHDOG NVERSION KEYW_VERSION TIMEOUT VOTING MAJORITY ALGORITHM METRIC SUCCESS KEYW_ENDNVERSION ... lines omitted ... % token <integer> LET VAL % token <integer> EQ NEQ GT GE LT LE % token <integer> MILLISEC MICROSEC % left AND OR % left NOT % token KILLED RESTARTED PRESENT % token ISOLATED FAULTY DEADLOCKED % token REINTEGRATED FIRED PAUSED % type % type % type % type % type status <id> id <integer> compare <integer> seconds <integer> expression linexp / * precedences / associativity * / % left ' + ' ' - ' % left ' * ' ' / ' % left UMINUS We get then to the main YACC section , that of Rules & Actions . The start symbol is "" rlstats "" , which states that an Ariel script consists of one or more "" rlstat "" or erroneous lines : %% rlstats : | rlstats rlstat | error ' \ n ' { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : syntax error . \ n "" , lines ) ; errors ++ ; } ; It is the definition of "" rlstat "" that lists all possible cases for a valid Ariel statement . Here it follows its ( abridged ) specification : rlstat : ' \ n ' | definition ' \ n ' { if ( rec ) { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" Ca n't define roles in strategy section "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } | section ' \ n ' | include ' \ n ' | timeouts ' \ n ' | definitions ' \ n ' | identifiers ' \ n ' | alphacounts ' \ n ' | aliases ' \ n ' | logicals ' \ n ' | entrypoints ' \ n ' | stacksizes ' \ n ' | watchdog ' \ n ' | nversiontask ' \ n ' | injection ' \ n ' ; An exhaustive description not being appropriate here , we decided to focus our attention on some of the above mentioned statements . We begin with an example of a configuration statement : this is the syntax of statements for the configuration of watchdogs . watchdog : ; watchdog_args : | | | ; watchdog_start watchdog_args watchdog_end on_error watchdog_args heartbeats watchdog_args w_alphacount watchdog_args watchdog_start : WATCHDOG KEYW_TASK NUMBER WATCHES KEYW_TASK NUMBER ' \ n ' { WATCHTOP . running = 1 ; / * flag : we 're within a watchdog * / WATCHTOP . watching = $ 3 ; WATCHTOP . watched = $ 6 ; taskram [ $ 3 ] . actor = RE_WD ; } ; w_alphacount : ALPHACOUNT KEYW_IS THRESHOLD ' = ' REAL ' , ' FACTOR ' = ' REAL KEYW_ENDALPHA ' \ n ' { alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . used = 1 ; alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . threshold = $ 5 ; alphas [ WATCHTOP . watching ] . k = $ 9 ; } ; seconds : ; MILLISEC | MICROSEC heartbeats : HEARTBEATS EVERY NUMBER seconds ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) { WATCHTOP . rate = $ 3 ; WATCHTOP . unit = ( $ 4 == MILLISEC ) ? 0 : 1 ; } else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ; on_error : | | ON ERROR WARN KEYW_TASK NUMBER ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) { WATCHTOP . action = 0 ; WATCHTOP . target = $ 5 ; } else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ON ERROR REBOOT ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) WATCHTOP . action = 1 ; else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ON ERROR RESTART ' \ n ' { if ( WATCHTOP . running ) WATCHTOP . action = 2 ; else { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" bad use of ON ERROR . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ; watchdog_end : KEYW_ENDWATCHDOG ' \ n ' { WATCHTOP . running = 0 ; INCWATCH ; if ( BADWATCH ) { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" Too many watchdogs have been defined . "" ) ; errors ++ ; } } ; Apart from converting configuration statements into configured header files and source code fragments , the other important task of the Ariel translator is producing the rcode equivalent of the Ariel recovery script . As an example , herein we describe how the IF THEN ... ELSE ... FI statements are dealt with : section : if elif else fi ; if : { / * each IF increments the IF nesting counter * / rcode_single_op ( R_INC_NEST ) ; ... lines omitted ... } IF ' [ ' expr ' ] ' Sepp / * Sepp is whitespaces * / { / * at first we issue an incomplete R_FALSE statement that is meant to jump to the ELSE clause or to the FI statement if the expression will be evaluated as false * / rcode_if ( ) ; ... lines omitted ... } THEN Sepp actions { / * No maintenance is required by THEN * / } else : ; | / * else may be missing * / { / * at first , before ELSE , we issue an incomplete R_GOTO corresponding to the Beginning of the ELSE clause and we record where we are * / goto_pc = rcode_goto ( 0 ) ; } ELSE { / * after ELSE , we complete the R_FALSE R-code issued at the closest IF statement . * / rcode_else ( goto_pc ) ; } Sepp actions { / * there go the else actions ... * / } ; fi : FI { rcode_fi ( ) ; / * each FI implies decrementing the nesting counter * / rcode_single_op ( R_DEC_NEST ) ; ... lines omitted ... } ; The possibility to have nested IF is expressed very simply : actions : | actions action ; action : ' \ n ' | section | recovery_action ; Sepp Sepp The actual error recovery actions are defined as follows : recovery_action : KILL { id / * This means "" KILL * "" , which is not likely to be a sensible recovery action , hence is not allowed * / if ( $ 2 . role & ID_STAR ) { fprintf ( stderr , "" \ tLine % d : semantical error : "" , lines ) ; yyerror ( "" Ca n't use ' * ' with KILL "" ) ; errors ++ ; } / * GENERATE_RACTION is , in its simplest form , a rcode_raction ( $ 1 , $ 2 . role , $ 2 . id ) * / GENERATE_RACTION ( R_KILL , $ 2 ) ; } | RESTART TID { GENERATE_RACTION ( R_RESTART , $ 2 ) ; } | RESTART GID { GENERATE_RACTION ( R_RESTART , $ 2 ) ; } | RESTART NID { GENERATE_RACTION ( R_REBOOT , $ 2 ) ; } | CALL NUMBER { / * CALL takes its argument from the stack ; first argument is arg counter , 0 in this case * / rcode_twoargs ( R_PUSH , 0 ) ; / * the available function calls are identified by integers * / rcode_twoargs ( R_FUNCTION_CALL , $ 2 ) ; } | CALL NUMBER ' ( ' list ' ) ' { for ( i = card_list-1 ; i > = 0 ; i -- ) { rcode_twoargs ( R_PUSH , list [ i ] ) ; } rcode_twoargs ( R_PUSH , card_list ) ; rcode_twoargs ( R_FUNCTION_CALL , $ 2 ) ; } | LET VAR ' = ' linexp { rcode_twoargs ( R_SET , $ 2 ) ; / * linexp pushes its result on top of the evaluation stack ; then The code for R_Set is very simple : int R_Set ( int index , int dummy1 , int dummy2 ) { int t = R_Pop ( ) ; return var [ index ] = t ; } * / } | LOG NUMBER { rcode_twoargs ( R_LOGI , $ 2 ) ; } | LOG CLOCK { rcode_single_op ( R_LOGC ) ; } | LOG VAR { rcode_twoargs ( R_LOGV , $ 2 ) ; } ; ... many lines omitted ... The last section of the YACC source code Ariel . y includes the whole scanner and defines the main function : %% # include "" lex . yy . c "" main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) After a long list of definitions , the management of the art's command arguments , and the opening of the input files , the main function executes yyparse , i.e. , the actual parser . As a result – provided that the parsing concluded successfully – several data structures are filled with configuration data and the actual output rcode . The processing ends with a series of "" flush "" calls : yyparse ( ) ; rflush ( ) ; if ( w_sp > 0 ) { watchdog_flush ( watchdog , w_sp ) ; fprintf ( stderr , "" Watchdogs configured . \ n "" ) ; } if ( nv_sp > 0 ) { nversion_flush ( nversion , nv_sp ) ; fprintf ( stderr , "" N-version tasks configured . \ n "" ) ; } ... lines omitted ... }"	3

CIPD ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION October 27th - 29th , Harrogate - For all people management and development specialists - the latest thinking and business strategies , debate topical issues , explore new ideas , and network with your fellow professionals . For further information : training . h otline @ cipd . c o . u k TRAINING SERVICES INDEX - PUBLICATION - Latest issue Work is well under way for the new edition of the Index , which will be published in early October . SNIPPETS - from providers : CAPITA : Bite-sized Learning Would Attract ' Switched Off ' People , Study Disadvantaged individuals from 19-24 years old are often "" switched off "" when it comes to learning , and thus ill equipped for the modern workforce . But they would be receptive to learning offered in bite-sized chunks in an informal environment and a short-term commitment , concludes a new study from the Campaign for Learning and Ufi . This so-called "" rejector "" group represents 16 percent of the population and is largely untouched by government learning campaigns , it claims . The research , entitled First Steps into Learning , recommends that the government speed up the creation of a credit framework which incorporates bite-sized learning , enabling the accumulation of credits towards recognised qualifications from a wider range of courses . It also recommends that a variety of learning styles be offered to the group . Increase in Stress-Related Absences is Cited by CIPD . Stress-related absences are on the rise within UK workplaces , but many employers are addressing the problem with training and other initiatives , according to the latest survey on employee absence from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) . The organisation's fifth annual report on employee absence found that 52 % of surveyed employers reported an increase of stress-related absences due to workload , management , organisational change and other reasons . Efforts in response include management training , improvement of work-life balance , stress audits , and employee assistance programs . "" A large part of managing stress is about good people management "" says report author Ben Willmott "" It is about providing employees with well-defined job roles , challenging , but realistic targets and the support , training and recognition to help them achieve these targets "" he says . Legislation Employers face hefty fines or even imprisonment if they fail to comply with the new duty to manage asbestos . What 's more , staff , former staff and even contractors could bring compensation claims for personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos . Company directors run the risk of being prosecuted if an offence has been committed with their consent , connivance or neglect ( pleading ignorance will be no defence ) . If the employer is the person responsible for the maintenance or repair of non-domestic property ( the ' relevant duty holder ' ) it must take active steps to identify , record and manage any asbestos that is or may be p resent . This duty will be enforced by HSE inspectors and any breach is likely to be treated very seriously - premises may even be shut down if an asbestos hazard is identified . Under the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 ( which should have been complied with by 21 May 2004 ) this ' duty to manage ' requires duty-holders to pay for making safe or removing any asbestos that is in a poor condition or is likely to be disturbed by planned building work or routine maintenance . If it can be established that the asbestos is in a sound state and not likely to be disturbed , then it can be left there , although its location must be recorded and the record retained on site for the lifetime of the building . From 1 October 2004 new forms will have to be used where the questionnaire procedure is used in cases of disability discrimination . These can be found in the Disability Discrimination ( Questions and Replies ) Order 2004 . Currently employers have to respond to such questionnaires ' within a reasonable period ' ( unless they have a good excuse ) to avoid a tribunal drawing an adverse inference from the failure to reply . As of 1 October employers will have to respond within 28 days of receiving such a questionnaire ( unless they have a reasonable excuse ) to avoid any such inferences being drawn . Holiday pay Is a worker who has n ' t taken all the holiday to which he is entitled during a year entitled to pay in lieu of the untaken holiday ? The answer under the Working Time Regulations 1998 ( WTR ) is generally ' No ' . But , in Canada Life v Gray and Farrar , the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that , on termination , workers are entitled to backdate their claims for holiday pay to when the WTR were introduced ( 1 October 1998 ) . Whilst under the WTR no entitlement to holiday can be carried forward from one year to the next , post termination the position is different . The WTR specifically provide , on termination , for a payment to be made in lieu of leave to which a worker was entitled , but had not taken . Provided the claim is made within 3 months of termination , this can include unpaid holiday dating back to October 1998 ( regardless of whether the worker actually took holiday or not ) .

47	"The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly , and about three o ' clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme . de Restaud . On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement . Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers ; they see success in every direction ; imagination has free play , and turns their lives into a romance ; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy . If youth were not ignorant and timid , civilization would be impossible . Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition , but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme . de Restaud and what he should say to her . He equipped himself with wit , rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation , and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand , conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future ; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud , and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed . "" If I were rich , "" he said , as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen , "" I would take a cab , then I could think at my ease . "" At last he reached the Rue du Helder , and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud . He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants , who had seen him cross the court on foot , with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day . He understood the meaning of their glances at once , for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court , where a smart cab was waiting . All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance . A fine horse , in magnificent harness , was pawing the ground , and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself . Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast ; he grew positively stupid . He sent up his name to the Countess , and waited in the ante-chamber , standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court ; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash , and stared before him . The time seemed long ; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded . "" Madame is in her boudoir , and can not see any one at present , sir , "" said the servant . "" She gave me no answer ; but if you will go into the dining-room , there is some one already there . "" Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word ; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber , meaning , no doubt , to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house ; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers , where lamps were standing , and hot-water pipes , on which towels were being dried ; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it . Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion . "" This way to the drawing-room , sir , "" said the servant , with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense . Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath . By good luck , he managed to keep his hat on his head , and saved it from immersion in the water ; but just as he turned , a door opened at the further end of the dark passage , dimly lighted by a small lamp . Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss ; one of the speakers was Mme . de Restaud , the other was Father Goriot . Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room ; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard , and stood there for a while . He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew . His heart beat unwontedly fast ; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations . A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it , saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door : "" I am going , Maurice . Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her . "" Whereupon this insolent being , who , doubtless , had a right to be insolent , sang an Italian trill , and went towards the window where Eugene was standing , moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard . "" But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer ; madame is disengaged , "" said Maurice , as he returned to the ante-chamber . Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate ; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase . The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury , in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated . Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself . The horse took fright at the umbrella , swerved , and dashed forward towards the flight of steps . The young man looked round in annoyance , saw Father Goriot , and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy , such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services , or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon , so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance . Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile . All this happened with lightning speed . Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice . "" Oh ! Maxime , were you going away ? "" she said reproachfully , with a shade of pique in her manner . The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury . Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him , coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there ; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head , as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning ; there was a soft fragrance about her--doubtless she was fresh from a bath ; -- her graceful form seemed more flexible , her beauty more luxuriant . Her eyes glistened . A young man can see everything at a glance ; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air ; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness . He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown ; it had fallen slightly open , giving glimpses of a bare throat , on which the student's eyes rested . The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets ; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist ; her throat was a challenge to love ; her feet , thrust into slippers , were daintily small . As Maxime took her hand and kissed it , Eugene became aware of Maxime's existence , and the Countess saw Eugene . "" Oh ! is that you M. de Rastignac ? I am very glad to see you , "" she said , but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart . Maxime , as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing , looked from Eugene to the lady , and from the lady to Eugene ; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter . An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words : "" Look here , my dear ; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business . "" The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart , and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently . To begin with , the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other 's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous ; Maxime's boots , moreover , were elegant and spotless , while his own , in spite of all his care , bore some traces of his recent walk ; and , finally , Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully , he looked like a pretty woman , while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two . The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall , slender dandy , with the clear gaze and the pale face , one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple . Mme . de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak ; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight , so that she looked like a white butterfly , and Maxime hurried after her . Eugene , in a fury , followed Maxime and the Countess , and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room . The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way , and even at the risk of displeasing Mme . de Restaud , he meant to annoy the dandy . It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme . de Beauseant's ball ; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme . de Restaud ; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success , he said to himself , "" This is my rival ; I mean to cut him out . "" Rash resolve ! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted , so as to fire first and kill his man . Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot , but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty-two . The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth , took up the tongs , and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily , that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over . She turned to Eugene , with a cool , questioning glance that asked plainly , "" Why do you not go ? "" a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit . Eugene assumed an amiable expression . "" Madame , "" he began , "" I hastened to call upon you ---- "" He stopped short . The door opened , and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared . He had left his hat outside , and did not greet the Countess ; he looked meditatively at Rastignac , and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial "" Good morning , "" that astonished Eugene not a little . The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance . "" M. de Restaud , "" said the Countess , introducing her husband to the law student . Eugene bowed profoundly . "" This gentleman , "" she continued , presenting Eugene to her husband , "" is M. de Rastignac ; he is related to Mme . la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball . "" _Related to Mme . la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ! _ These words , on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis , by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house , produced a magical effect . The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow . "" Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance , "" he said . Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance , and suddenly dropped his insolent manner . The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand ; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again ; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned . It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris , and he began to see , though everything was indistinct as yet . Mme . Vauquer's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts . "" I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct , "" the Comte de Restaud said , addressing Eugene . "" Yes , they are extinct , "" answered the law student . "" My great-uncle , the Chevalier de Rastignac , married the heiress of the Marcillac family . They had only one daughter , who married the Marechal de Clarimbault , Mme . de Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side . We are the younger branch of the family , and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle , the Vice-Admiral , lost all that he had in the King's service . The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated . "" "" Was not your great-uncle in command of the _Vengeur_ before 1789 ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather , who commanded the _Warwick_ . "" Maxime looked at Mme . de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders , as who should say , "" If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow , it is all over with us . "" Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her . With a woman's admirable tact , she began to smile and said : "" Come with me , Maxime ; I have something to say to you . We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the _Warwick_ and the _Vengeur_ . "" She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her , mirth and mischief in her whole attitude , and the two went in the direction of the boudoir . The _morganatic_ couple ( to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent ) had reached the door , when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene . "" Anastasie ! "" he cried pettishly , "" just stay a moment , dear ; you know very well that ---- "" "" I am coming back in a minute , "" she interrupted ; "" I have a commission for Maxime to execute , and I want to tell him about it . "" She came back almost immediately . She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice , and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir ; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands' characters in order to have their own way , and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding , she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life . It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident ; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation . M. de Trailles addressed the Count , the Countess , and Eugene with the pointed remark , "" You are busy , I do not want to interrupt you ; good-day , "" and he went . "" Just wait a moment , Maxime ! "" the Count called after him . "" Come and dine with us , "" said the Countess , leaving Eugene and her husband together once more . She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room , where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave . The law student heard their laughter , and their voices , and the pauses in their talk ; he grew malicious , exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud , flattered him , and drew him into discussions , to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot . This Countess with a husband and a lover , for Maxime clearly was her lover , was a mystery . What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman ? This mystery he meant to penetrate , hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian . "" Anastasie ! "" the Count called again to his wife . "" Poor Maxime ! "" she said , addressing the young man . "" Come , we must resign ourselves . This evening ---- "" "" I hope , Nasie , "" he said in her ear , "" that you will give orders not to admit that youngster , whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you . He will make you a declaration , and compromise you , and then you will compel me to kill him . "" "" Are you mad , Maxime ? "" she said . "" A young lad of a student is , on the contrary , a capital lightning-conductor ; is not that so ? Of course , I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him . "" Maxime burst out laughing , and went out , followed by the Countess , who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage ; he shook his whip , and made his horse prance . She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him . "" What do you think , dear ? "" cried the Count , her husband , "" this gentleman's family estate is not far from Verteuil , on the Charente ; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted . "" "" Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common , "" said the Countess , with a preoccupied manner . "" More than you think , "" said Eugene , in a low voice . "" What do you mean ? "" she asked quickly . "" Why , only just now , "" said the student , "" I saw a gentleman go out at the gate , Father Goriot , my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging . "" At the sound of this name , and the prefix that embellished it , the Count , who was stirring the fire , let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers , and rose to his feet . "" Sir , "" he cried , "" you might have called him ' Monsieur Goriot ' ! "" The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation , then she reddened ; clearly she was embarrassed , her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural , and with an air of assumed carelessness : "" You could not know any one who is dearer to us both ... "" She broke off , glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind , and asked , "" Are you fond of music , M. de Rastignac ? "" "" Exceedingly , "" answered Eugene , flushing , and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly . "" Do you sing ? "" she cried , going to the piano , and , sitting down before it , she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end . R-r-r-rah ! "" No , madame . "" The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro . "" That is a pity ; you are without one great means of success . -- _Ca-ro , ca-a-ro , ca-a-a-ro , non du-bi-ta-re_ , "" sang the Countess . Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name , but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula "" related to Mme . de Beauseant . "" His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities , when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures , and three or four heads , imperfectly secured , fall at the shock . He wished the earth would open and swallow him . Mme . de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly , her eyes had grown indifferent , and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law . "" Madame , "" he said , "" you wish to talk with M. de Restaud ; permit me to wish you good-day ---- "" The Countess interrupted him by a gesture , saying hastily , "" Whenever you come to see us , both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you . "" Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave , followed by M. de Restaud , who insisted , in spite of his remonstrances , on accompanying him into the hall . "" Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls , "" the Count said to Maurice . As Eugene set foot on the steps , he saw that it was raining . "" Come , "" said he to himself , "" somehow I have just made a mess of it , I do not know how . And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain . I ought to stop in my corner , grind away at law , and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate . How can I go into society , when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs , varnished boots , gold watch chains , and all sorts of things ; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning , and primrose kid gloves every evening ? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot ! "" When he reached the street door , the driver of a hackney coach , who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door , and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer's knowledge , saw that Eugene had no umbrella , remarked his black coat , white waistcoat , yellow gloves , and varnished boots , and stopped and looked at him inquiringly . Eugene , in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss , as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths , nodded in reply to the driver's signal , and stepped into the cab ; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party . "" Where am I to drive , sir ? "" demanded the man , who , by this time , had taken off his white gloves . "" Confound it ! "" Eugene said to himself , "" I am in for it now , and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing ! -- Drive to the Hotel Beauseant , "" he said aloud . "" Which ? "" asked the man , a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion . This young man of fashion , species incerta , did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant ; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him . "" The Vicomte de Beauseant , Rue ---- "" "" De Grenelle , "" interrupted the driver , with a jerk of his head . "" You see , there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique , "" he added , drawing up the step . "" I know all about that , "" said Eugene , severely . -- "" Everybody is laughing at me to-day , it seems ! "" he said to himself , as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat . "" This escapade will cost me a king's ransom , but , at any rate , I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion . Goriot has cost me ten francs already , the old scoundrel . My word ! I will tell Mme . de Beauseant about my adventure ; perhaps it may amuse her . Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail . It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman , who seems to me to have very expensive tastes . Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me , when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect . Let us look higher . If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven , you must face God . "" The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases . He grew calmer , and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain . He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him , the money was well laid out in preserving his coat , boots , and hat ; and his cabman's cry of "" Gate , if you please , "" almost put him in spirits . A Swiss , in scarlet and gold , appeared , the great door groaned on its hinges , and Rastignac , with sweet satisfaction , beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning . The driver , in a blue-and-red greatcoat , dismounted and let down the step . As Eugene stepped out of the cab , he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle . Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle . In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity ; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris ; a coachman , with powdered hair , seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses , who stood chafing the bit . In Mme . de Restaud's courtyard , in the Chaussee d ' Antin , he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty ; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank ; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it . "" Who can be here ? "" said Eugene to himself . He began to understand , though somewhat tardily , that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated , and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed . "" Confound it all ! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime . "" He went up the steps , feeling that he was a blighted being . The glass door was opened for him ; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb . So far , Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant ; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation , that he had not had time to call on his cousin , and had therefore never seen Mme . de Beauseant's apartments ; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life . He was the more curious , because Mme . de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison . At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible . Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin , but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris . He was conducted up the wide , white-painted , crimson-carpeted staircase , between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants , to Mme . de Beauseant's apartments . He did not know the rumor current about Mme . de Beauseant , one of the biographies told , with variations , in whispers , every evening in the salons of Paris . For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles , the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto . It was one of those innocent _liaisons_ which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable . The Vicomte de Beauseant , therefore , had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting , with as good a grace as might be , this morganatic union . Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto there . As , under the circumstances , Mme . de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors , she gave them such a cold reception , and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling , that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her ; and when it became known in Paris that Mme . de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o ' clock , she was left in perfect solitude during that interval . She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto ; and M. de Beauseant , like a well-bred man of the world , always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them . But M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto must marry , and a Mlle . de Rochefide was the young lady . In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement , and that was Mme . de Beauseant . Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility , and she had laughed at them , believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief . And now , though the bans were about to be published , and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse , he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery . How was it ? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind . There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who , after two hours of lamentations and reproaches , falls into a dead swoon and requires salts . At this moment , therefore , M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns , and anxious to take his leave . He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme . de Beauseant ; he would write , it would be much better to do it by letter , and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart . So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac , the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy . To be sure , a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness ; and when she is about to be forsaken , she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze . It was impossible , therefore , that Mme . de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction ; slight though it was , it was appalling in its artlessness . Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner , and of its owner's wife and family , so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation , "" Harness five bullocks to your cart ! "" probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you . If , down to the present day , our language has no name for these conversational disasters , it is probably because they are believed to be impossible , the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious . After the awkward incident at Mme . de Restaud's , no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme . de Beauseant's drawing-room . But if Mme . de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way , M. d ' Ajuda hailed his coming with relief . "" Good-bye , "" said the Portuguese , hurrying to the door , as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room , where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste . "" Until this evening , "" said Mme . de Beauseant , turning her head to give the Marquis a glance . "" We are going to the Bouffons , are we not ? "" "" I can not go , "" he said , with his fingers on the door handle . Mme . de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return . She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene , who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him ; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real , and did not know where to hide himself , when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence . The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand , and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her . The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture ; he came back towards her . Eugene watched him , not without a feeling of envy . "" That is the owner of the brougham ! "" he said to himself . "" But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses , servants in livery , and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris ? "" The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart , greed burned in his veins , his throat was parched with the thirst of gold . He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter . His father , mother , brothers , sisters , and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them . This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties . "" Why not ? "" the Vicomtesse was saying , as she smiled at the Portuguese . "" Why can not you come to the Italiens ? "" "" Affairs ! I am to dine with the English Ambassador . "" "" Throw him over . "" When a man once enters on a course of deception , he is compelled to add lie to lie . M. d ' Ajuda therefore said , smiling , "" Do you lay your commands on me ? "" "" Yes , certainly . "" "" That was what I wanted to have you say to me , "" he answered , dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman . He took the Vicomtesse's hand , kissed it , and went . Eugene ran his fingers through his hair , and constrained himself to bow . He thought that now Mme . de Beauseant would give him her attention ; but suddenly she sprang forward , rushed to a window in the gallery , and watched M. d ' Ajuda step into his carriage ; she listened to the order that he gave , and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman : "" To M. de Rochefide's house . "" Those words , and the way in which M. d ' Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage , were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her ; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart . The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights . The Vicomtesse went to her own room , sat down at a table , and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper . "" When , instead of dining with the English Ambassador , "" she wrote , "" you go to the Rochefides , you owe me an explanation , which I am waiting to hear . "" She retraced several of the letters , for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct ; then she signed the note with an initial C for "" Claire de Bourgogne , "" and rang the bell . "" Jacques , "" she said to the servant , who appeared immediately , "" take this note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d ' Ajuda . If M. d ' Ajuda is there , leave the note without waiting for an answer ; if he is not there , bring the note back to me . "" "" Madame la Vicomtess , there is a visitor in the drawing-room . "" "" Ah ! yes , of course , "" she said , opening the door . Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable , but at last the Vicomtesse appeared ; she spoke to him , and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart . "" Pardon me , monsieur , "" she said ; "" I had a letter to write . Now I am quite at liberty . "" She scarcely knew what she was saying , for even as she spoke she thought , "" Ah ! he means to marry Mlle . de Rochefide ? But is he still free ? This evening the marriage shall be broken off , or else ... But before to-morrow I shall know . "" "" Cousin ... "" the student replied . "" Eh ? "" said the Countess , with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene ; he understood what that "" Eh ? "" meant ; he had learned a great deal in three hours , and his wits were on the alert . He reddened : "" Madame ... "" he began ; he hesitated a moment , and then went on . "" Pardon me ; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm . "" Mme . de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile ; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain , the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst . "" If you knew how my family are situated , "" he went on , "" you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege . "" "" Well , cousin , "" she said , laughing , "" and how can I be of service to you ? "" "" But do I know even that ? I am distantly related to you , and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me . You have confused my ideas ; I can not remember the things that I meant to say to you . I know no one else here in Paris .... Ah ! if I could only ask you to counsel me , ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress , who would lay down his life for you . "" "" Would you kill a man for me ? "" "" Two , "" said Eugene . "" You , child . Yes , you are a child , "" she said , keeping back the tears that came to her eyes ; "" you would love sincerely . "" "" Oh ! "" he cried , flinging up his head . The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him . The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time . Between Mme . de Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme . de Beauseant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris , although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence , and , when well understood , is a highroad to success of every kind . "" Ah ! that is what I meant to say ! "" said Eugene . "" I met Mme . de Restaud at your ball , and this morning I went to see her . "" You must have been very much in the way , "" said Mme . de Beauseant , smiling as she spoke . "" Yes , indeed . I am a novice , and my blunders will set every one against me , if you do not give me your counsel . I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young , beautiful , and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me , what you women can explain so well--life . I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere . So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle , to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning . I mentioned an old man ---- "" "" Madame la Duchess de Langeais , "" Jacques cut the student short ; Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture . "" If you mean to succeed , "" said the Vicomtesse in a low voice , "" in the first place you must not be so demonstrative . "" "" Ah ! good morning , dear , "" she continued , and rising and crossing the room , she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters ; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way . "" Two intimate friends ! "" said Rastignac to himself . "" Henceforward I shall have two protectresses ; those two women are great friends , no doubt , and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin . "" "" To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune , dear Antoinette ? "" asked Mme . de Beauseant . "" Well , I saw M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door , so I thought that if I came I should find you alone . "" Mme . de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten , her color did not rise , her expression did not alter , or rather , her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words . "" If I had known that you were engaged ---- "" the speaker added , glancing at Eugene . "" This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac , one of my cousins , "" said the Vicomtesse . "" Have you any news of General de Montriveau ? "" she continued . "" Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now ; has he been to see you to-day ? "" It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau , and that he was a faithless lover ; she felt the question in her very heart , and her face flushed as she answered : "" He was at the Elysee yesterday . "" "" In attendance ? "" "" Claire , "" returned the Duchess , and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme . de Beauseant ; "" of course you know that M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle . de Rochefide ; the bans will be published to-morrow . "" This thrust was too cruel ; the Vicomtesse's face grew white , but she answered , laughing , "" One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with . What should induce M. d ' Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides ? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday . "" "" But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year , they say . "" "" M. d ' Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money . "" "" But , my dear , Mlle . de Rochefide is a charming girl . "" "" Indeed ? "" "" And , as a matter of fact , he is dining with them to-day ; the thing is settled . It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it . "" Mme . de Beauseant turned to Rastignac . "" What was the blunder that you made , monsieur ? "" she asked . "" The poor boy is only just launched into the world , Antoinette , so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of . Be merciful to him , and let us finish our talk to-morrow . Everything will be announced to-morrow , you know , and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation . "" The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot , and leave him crushed and annihilated . "" Madame , I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme . de Restaud's heart ; unwittingly--therein lies my offence , "" said the student of law , whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well , for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk . "" You continue to receive , possibly you fear , those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict ; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities , and every one despises him . "" Mme . de Beauseant gave the student a glance , one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude . It was like balm to the law student , who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny ; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value . "" Imagine , too , that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud ; for I should tell you , madame , "" he went on , turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner , "" that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student , very much alone in the world , and very poor ---- "" "" You should not tell us that , M. de Rastignac . We women never care about anything that no one else will take . "" "" Bah ! "" said Eugene . "" I am only two-and-twenty , and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life . Besides , I am confessing my sins , and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional ; you commit your sins in one drawing-room , and receive absolution for them in another . "" The Duchess' expression grew colder , she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks , and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with -- "" This gentleman has only just come ---- "" Mme . de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both . "" He has only just come to Paris , dear , and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste . "" "" Mme . la Duchesse , "" said Eugene , "" is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us ? "" ( "" Come , now , "" he said to himself , "" my language is superfinely elegant , I 'm sure . "" ) "" But Mme . de Restaud is herself , I believe , M. de Trailles' pupil , "" said the Duchess . "" Of that I had no idea , madame , "" answered the law student , "" so I rashly came between them . In fact , I got on very well with the lady's husband , and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase , a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage . "" "" Who was it ? "" both women asked together . "" An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau , where I , a poor student , lodge likewise . He is a truly unfortunate creature , everybody laughs at him--we all call him ' Father Goriot . ' "" "" Why , child that you are , "" cried the Vicomtesse , "" Mme . de Restaud was a Mlle . Goriot ! "" "" The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer , "" the Duchess added ; "" and when the little creature went to Court , the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day . Do you remember , Claire ? The King began to laugh , and made some joke in Latin about flour . People--what was it ? -- people ---- "" "" _Ejusdem farinoe_ , "" said Eugene . "" Yes , that was it , "" said the Duchess . "" Oh ! is that her father ? "" the law student continued , aghast . "" Yes , certainly ; the old man had two daughters ; he dotes on them , so to speak , though they will scarcely acknowledge him . "" "" Did n't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name ? "" the Vicomtesse asked , turning to Mme . de Langeais , "" a Baron de Nucingen ? And her name is Delphine , is it not ? Is n't she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera ? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons , and laughs loudly to attract attention . "" The Duchess smiled and said : "" I wonder at you , dear . Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind ? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was , to be infatuated with Mlle . Anastasie and her flour sacks . Oh ! he will not find her a good bargain ! She is in M. de Trailles' hands , and he will ruin her . "" "" And they do not acknowledge their father ! "" Eugene repeated . "" Oh ! well , yes , their father , the father , a father , "" replied the Vicomtesse , "" a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs , it is said , to secure their happiness by marrying them well ; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself , thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters , thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again , that in their houses he should find two homes , where he would be loved and looked up to , and made much of . And in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts . "" Tears came into Eugene's eyes . He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs , he had just left home , pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him , and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris . Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence . "" _Eh , mon Dieu ! _ "" said Mme . de Langeais ; "" yes , it seems very horrible , and yet we see such things every day . Is there not a reason for it ? Tell me , dear , have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is ? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up , you and I , a dear little one , bound to us very closely in innumerable ways ; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family , its ' white soul , ' as Lamartine says , and suddenly she will become its scourge . When HE comes and takes her from us , his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart , and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed . But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father , as we had no thought that was not for her ; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger . The tragedy is always going on under our eyes . On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son , and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence . On the other hand , it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house . I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days ; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling , to say nothing of our marriages , which have come to be very poor farces . I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker's case . I think I recollect that Foriot ---- "" "" Goriot , madame . "" "" Yes , that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution . He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain , and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost . He had as much flour as he wanted . My grandmother's steward sold him immense quantities . No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation , as that sort of person always did . I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security , because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism . Well , then , this Loriot , who sold corn to those butchers , has never had but one passion , they say--he idolizes his daughters . He settled one of them under Restaud's roof , and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree , the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist . You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor , the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three ; but after the restoration of the Bourbons , M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society , and the banker was still more tired of it . His daughters were still fond of him ; they wanted ' to keep the goat and the cabbage , ' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there , under pretence of affection . ' Come to-day , papa , we shall have you all to ourselves , and that will be much nicer ! ' and all that sort of thing . As for me , dear , I believe that love has second-sight : poor Ninety-three ; his heart must have bled . He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him , that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief . So he immolated himself . He made the sacrifice because he was a father ; he went into voluntary exile . His daughters were satisfied , so he thought that he had done the best thing he could ; but it was a family crime , and father and daughters were accomplices . You see this sort of thing everywhere . What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms ? He would only have been in the way , and bored other people , besides being bored himself . And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best ; if her love grows tiresome , he will go ; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her . It is the same with all love and friendship . Our heart is a treasury ; if you pour out all its wealth at once , you are bankrupt . We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left . Their father had given them all he had . For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them ; then , one day , he gave them all his fortune too . The lemon was squeezed ; the girls left the rest in the gutter . "" "" The world is very base , "" said the Vicomtesse , plucking at the threads of her shawl . She did not raise her head as she spoke ; the words that Mme . de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick . "" Base ? Oh , no , "" answered the Duchess ; "" the world goes its own way , that is all . If I speak in this way , it is only to show that I am not duped by it . I think as you do , "" she said , pressing the Vicomtesse's hand . "" The world is a slough ; let us try to live on the heights above it . "" She rose to her feet and kissed Mme . de Beauseant on the forehead as she said : "" You look very charming to-day , dear . I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before . "" Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin . "" Father Goriot is sublime ! "" said Eugene to himself , as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night . Mme . de Beauseant did not hear him ; she was absorbed in her own thoughts . For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment , and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word . "" The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured , "" said the Vicomtesse at last . "" No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle . Epigrams and sarcasms already ! Ah ! I will defend myself ! "" She raised her head like the great lady that she was , and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes . "" Ah ! "" she said , as she saw Eugene , "" are you there ? "" "" Still , "" he said piteously . "" Well , then , M. de Rastignac , deal with the world as it deserves . You are determined to succeed ? I will help you . You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman ; you shall measure the extent of man's pitiful vanity . Deeply as I am versed in such learning , there were pages in the book of life that I had not read . Now I know all . The more cold-blooded your calculations , the further you will go . Strike ruthlessly ; you will be feared . Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses ; take a fresh relay , and leave the last to drop by the roadside ; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition . You will be nothing here , you see , unless a woman interests herself in you ; and she must be young and wealthy , and a woman of the world . Yet , if you have a heart , lock it carefully away like a treasure ; do not let any one suspect it , or you will be lost ; you would cease to be the executioner , you would take the victim's place . And if ever you should love , never let your secret escape you ! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart . Learn to mistrust every one ; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet . Listen , Miguel "" -- the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake -- "" there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead , and that is a rivalry between two sisters . Restaud comes of a good family , his wife has been received into their circle ; she has been presented at court ; and her sister , her wealthy sister , Mme . Delphine de Nucingen , the wife of a great capitalist , is consumed with envy , and ready to die of spleen . There is gulf set between the sisters--indeed , they are sisters no longer--the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other . So Mme . de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon . She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay ; she has made herself de Marsay's slave , and she bores him . De Marsay cares very little about her . If you will introduce her to me , you will be her darling , her Benjamin ; she will idolize you . If , after that , you can love her , do so ; if not , make her useful . I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes , but I will never receive her here in the morning . I will bow to her when I see her , and that will be quite sufficient . You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot's name . Yes , my good friend , you may call at her house twenty times , and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home . The servants have their orders , and will not admit you . Very well , then , now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you . The beautiful Mme . de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle . As soon as she singles you out , other women will begin to lose their heads about you , and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her . There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him ; like the city madams , poor things , who copy our millinery , and hope thereby to acquire our manners . You will have a success , and in Paris success is everything ; it is the key of power . If the women credit you with wit and talent , the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself . There will be nothing you may not aspire to ; you will go everywhere , and you will find out what the world is--an assemblage of fools and knaves . But you must be neither the one nor the other . I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth ; make no unworthy use of it , "" she said , with a queenly glance and curve of her throat ; "" give it back to me unsullied . And now , go ; leave me . We women also have our battles to fight . "" "" And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you ---- "" "" Well ? "" she asked . He tapped his heart , smiled in answer to his cousin's smile , and went . It was five o ' clock , and Eugene was hungry ; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner , a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris . This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him . A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage ; he shakes his fist at society , and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken . Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words , "" You have shut the Countess' door against you . "" "" I shall call ! "" he said to himself , "" and if Mme . de Beauseant is right , if I never find her at home -- I. .. well , Mme . de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris . I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice , and kill that Maxime of hers ! "" "" And money ? "" cried an inward monitor . "" How about money , where is that to come from ? "" And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes . That was the luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well , the gilding , the ostentatious splendor , the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu , the riotous extravagance of a courtesan . Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant . As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris , innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart ; his ideas widened , and his conscience grew more elastic . He saw the world as it is ; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion , and found in success the _ultima ratio mundi_ . "" Vautrin is right , success is virtue ! "" he said to himself . Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman , and went in to dinner . He glanced round the squalid room , saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls , and the sight filled him with loathing . The transition was too sudden , and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant ; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds . On the one hand , he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms , of quick-pulsed youth , of fair , impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry , framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art ; and , on the other hand , he saw a sombre picture , the miry verge beyond these faces , in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism . Mme . de Beauseant's counsels , the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady , her petulant offer , came to his mind , and poverty was a ready expositor . Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success ; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion . Clearly he was still a child ! Those two lines are asymptotes , and will never meet . "" You are very dull , my lord Marquis , "" said Vautrin , with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind . "" I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ' my lord Marquis , ' "" answered Eugene . "" A marquis here in Paris , if he is not the veriest sham , ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least ; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite . "" Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal , half-contemptuous . "" Puppy ! "" it seemed to say ; "" I should make one mouthful of him ! "" Then he answered : "" You are in a bad humor ; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success . "" "" She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table , "" cried Rastignac . Glances were exchanged all round the room ; Father Goriot looked down . "" You have sent some snuff into my eye , "" he said to his neighbor , turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face . "" Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me , "" said Eugene , looking at the old man's neighbor ; "" he is worth all the rest of us put together . -- I am not speaking of the ladies , "" he added , turning in the direction of Mlle . Taillefer . Eugene's remarks produced a sensation , and his tone silenced the dinner-table . Vautrin alone spoke . "" If you are going to champion Father Goriot , and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain , you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils , "" he said , banteringly . "" So I intend , "" said Eugene . "" Then you are taking the field to-day ? "" "" Perhaps , "" Rastignac answered . "" But I owe no account of myself to any one , especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night . "" Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac . "" If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets , my boy , you must go behind and see the whole show , and not peep through holes in the curtain . That is enough , "" he added , seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion . "" We can have a little talk whenever you like . "" There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint . Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers , nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution . "" Then , M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess , "" said Mme . Vauquer in a low voice . "" And of a baroness , "" answered Rastignac . "" That is about all he is capable of , "" said Bianchon to Rastignac ; "" I have taken a look at his head ; there is only one bump--the bump of Paternity ; he must be an _eternal father_ . "" Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke . He determined to profit by Mme . de Beauseant's counsels , and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money . He grew grave . The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes ; all things lay before him , nothing was his . Dinner came to an end , the others went , and he was left in the dining-room . "" So you have seen my daughter ? "" Goriot spoke tremulously , and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugene's dreams . The young man took the elder's hand , and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes . "" You are a good and noble man , "" he said . "" We will have some talk about your daughters by and by . "" He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer , and went to his room . There he wrote the following letter to his mother : -- "" My Dear Mother , -- Can you nourish your child from your breast again ? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune , but I want twelve hundred francs--I must have them at all costs . Say nothing about this to my father ; perhaps he might make objections , and unless I have the money , I may be led to put an end to myself , and so escape the clutches of despair . I will tell you everything when I see you . I will not begin to try to describe my present situation ; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully . I have not been gambling , my kind mother , I owe no one a penny ; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me , you must send me the sum I mention . As a matter of fact , I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauseant ; she is using her influence for me ; I am obliged to go into society , and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves . I can manage to exist on bread and water , or go without food , if need be , but I can not do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country . I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way , or stick in the mire for the rest of my days . I know that all your hopes are set on me , and I want to realize them quickly . Sell some of your old jewelry , my kind mother ; I will give you other jewels very soon . I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means , and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it ; I should be a monster if I could . You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity . Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign , for life in Paris is one continual battle . If you can not otherwise procure the whole of the money , and are forced to sell our aunt's lace , tell her that I will send her some still handsomer , "" and so forth . He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings--would they despoil themselves for him , and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family ? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly , and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures . Yet when he had written the letters , he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition ; his heart beat fast , and he trembled . He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house ; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters , and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris . Visions rose before his eyes ; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store , devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him _incognito_ , essaying , for the first time in their lives , a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness . "" A sister's heart is a diamond for purity , a deep sea of tenderness ! "" he said to himself . He felt ashamed of those letters . What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts ; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer ! What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice ! What a pang for his mother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for ! And this noble affection , these sacrifices made at such terrible cost , were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen . A few tears , like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth , fell from his eyes . He walked up and down , and despair mingled with his emotion . Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door . "" What is the matter , sir ? "" he asked from the threshold . "" Ah ! my good neighbor , I am as much a son and brother as you are a father . You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie ; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles , who will be her ruin . "" Father Goriot withdrew , stammering some words , but Eugene failed to catch their meaning . The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters . Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted , but he ended by flinging them into the box . "" I shall succeed ! "" he said to himself . So says the gambler ; so says the great captain ; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few , have been the ruin of many more . A few days after this Eugene called at Mme . de Restaud's house ; she was not at home . Three times he tried the experiment , and three times he found her doors closed against him , though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there . The Vicomtesse was right . The student studied no longer . He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name , and after thus attesting his presence , departed forthwith . He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students . He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations ; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year , when he meant to begin to work in earnest , and to complete his studies in law with one great effort . In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris , to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune . Twice during that week he saw Mme . de Beauseant ; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d ' Ajuda drive away . Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady , the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; and the marriage of the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle . de Rochefide was postponed . The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before , but the end was only so much the nearer . The Marquis d ' Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing ; Mme . de Beauseant ( so they hoped ) would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage , and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d ' Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career , exigencies which she must have foreseen . In spite of the most solemn promises , daily renewed , M. d ' Ajuda was playing a part , and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived . "" Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window , she is falling headlong down the staircase , "" said her most intimate friend , the Duchesse de Langeais . Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin . She had a half-superstitious affection for him . Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity , no real comfort in any eyes ; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries , it is because he has an interested motive . Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history ; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen . The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows : -- In the days before the Revolution , Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker . He was a skilful , thrifty workman , sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789 . Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne , close to the Corn Exchange . His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section , so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch . This prudent step had led to success ; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity ( real or artificial ) , when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris . People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors ; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it . It was during this year that Goriot made the money , which , at a later time , was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer ; he had , moreover , the usual luck of average ability ; his mediocrity was the salvation of him . He excited no one's envy , it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over , and all his intelligence was concentrated , not on political , but on commercial speculations . Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn , flour , and "" middlings "" ; and the production , storage , and quality of grain . He could estimate the yield of the harvest , and foresee market prices ; he bought his cereals in Sicily , and imported Russian wheat . Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain , who had seen his grasp of the subject , his clear insight into the principles involved , his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked , would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made . Patient , active , and persevering , energetic and prompt in action , he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye . Nothing there took him by surprise ; he foresaw all things , knew all that was happening , and kept his own counsel ; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation ; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march . But beyond this business horizon he could not see . He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop , leaning against the framework of the door . Take him from his dark little counting-house , and he became once more the rough , slow-witted workman , a man who can not understand a piece of reasoning , who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures , and falls asleep at the play , a Parisian Dolibom in short , against whose stupidity other minds are powerless . Natures of this kind are nearly all alike ; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection . Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling ; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature , as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade . He had regarded his wife , the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie , with a devout admiration ; his love for her had been boundless . Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature , which , in its delicate strength , was the very opposite of his own . Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection , a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature ? Join love thereto , the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures , and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature . After seven years of unclouded happiness , Goriot lost his wife . It was very unfortunate for him . She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways ; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation , she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts . But when she was dead , the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania . All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters , and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them . More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time ; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again ; but he determined to remain a widower . His father-in-law , the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship , gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory . The frequenters of the Corn Exchange , who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly , joked about it among themselves , and found a ridiculous nickname for him . One of them ventured ( after a glass over a bargain ) to call him by it , and a blow from the vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin . He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned ; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious ; and this was so well known , that one day a competitor , who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself , told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab . The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale , left the Exchange at once , and did not return for several days afterwards ; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm . This time , however , the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder ; at a critical moment in the man's affairs , Goriot drove him into bankruptcy , and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange . As might have been expected , the two girls were spoiled . With an income of sixty thousand francs , Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself , and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls . The best masters were engaged , that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education . They had a chaperon--luckily for them , she was a woman who had good sense and good taste ; -- they learned to ride ; they had a carriage for their use ; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live ; they had only to express a wish , their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires , and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss . Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels ; and , quite naturally , he himself was left beneath them . Poor man ! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him . When the girls were old enough to be married , they were left free to choose for themselves . Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry ; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty , her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere . Delphine wished for money ; she married Nucingen , a banker of German extraction , who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire . Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before . His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur ; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade , though his whole life was bound up with his business . For five years he stood out against their entreaties , then he yielded , and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years . It was this capital that Mme . Vauquer , in the early days of his residence with her , had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year . He had taken refuge in her lodging-house , driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses , but even to see him no more except in private . This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot's business , information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions , and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end ."	6
496	"Dominic Fifield at Darius and Girenas Stadium Wednesday July 27 , 2005 The Guardian Liverpool supporters have seen it all now . Most are still pinching themselves after seeing their side lift the European Cup in May . Some , perhaps unjustly , are flinching at the £ 7m paid to Southampton for Peter Crouch . But all must have reeled in disbelief here last night at the sight of Jamie Carragher scoring a goal . The centre-half's reward , his first in six years and only the third goal of his career , helped establish a lead in this tie which should see Liverpool safely through to the third qualifying stage . It was timely , too . The holders trailed briefly and , on an awkward surface against spirited opponents , flirted with disaster before , eventually , their class told . Article continues A two-goal advantage going into next week's return should prove sufficient to ensure progress , with the draw for the final qualifying phase to be made on Friday . The possibility of facing Everton at that stage looms large , though for the moment Liverpool can take heart at a job half done . Rafael Benítez leaves the Baltic encouraged that , if he can prise a goal from Carragher , he is a miracle worker indeed . "" It 's been such a long time it 's a little bit embarrassing really but I 'm delighted to get that monkey off my back , "" admitted the 27-year-old , whose last goal had come in the 7-1 thrashing of Southampton in January 1999 . "" Hopefully I can add to that now . The manager said after the game he wants another three or four this season . That 's the target . I probably deserve the match ball after that . Me scoring one is like someone else getting a hat-trick . "" Liverpool needed him to break that long duck . Preparation , by Benítez's standards , had been sketchy for this tie and , confronted by the Lithuanians' eager early aggression , the holders briefly teetered . For six minutes embarrassment threatened after Arturas Rimkevicius gathered from a throw-in and flummoxed the ponderous Sami Hyypia near the touchline . The striker tore towards the area and pulled back to the top of the six-yard box where Giedrius Barevicius' mis-hit shot wrong-footed José Reina and dribbled in . The giddy reality of their lead took time to sink in with the locals and , had their striker Andrius Velicka been fit , they might have prospered further . Yet it always looked a temporary upset of the natural order . By the interval Liverpool were ahead . First Boudewijn Zenden's looping cross was nodded down by the debutant Crouch , a signing of real stature who provided no little elegance in his ground-play . Mindaugas Baguzis could have cleared but he dithered near the penalty spot and Djibril Cissé spun and thumped the equaliser into the corner . Kaunas's spirit momentarily drained and , while heads were down , Steven Gerrard's corner was headed in for Carragher's rare party piece . Cissé should have added a third before the interval , bursting on to Xabi Alonso's threaded pass and skimming a shot beyond Eduardas Kurskis only for Irmantas Zelmikas to scramble the ball from the line . The Frenchman missed again when clean through near the end but Liverpool's dominance had long since been established . There was real promise in the combination of Crouch and Cissé , the reassurance of Fernando Morientes emerging from the bench and Alonso's clever passing alongside Gerrard's purring menace in midfield . The hapless Baguzis tripped the galloping captain in the area nine minutes into the second period and Gerrard dispatched the penalty himself , his 15th European goal . "" We 're strong favourites and 90 % certain of going through after that but we 'll still need to find the other 10 % now , "" added Carragher . "" We 'll show them respect because we always do . "" Even so , a professional performance in what should prove a formality of the return next Tuesday and Liverpool , seeded and warming up nicely , will be one stage away from the Champions League proper ."	8
1146	"The Grinning Man , Bristol Old Vic , review : ' blackly comic brilliance ' G iven the phenomenal worldwide success of Les Miserables , it 's surprising how few of Victor Hugo ' s novels have been cannibalised and turned into musicals . Aside from Disney's relatively recent screen-to-stage version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame , which did n't really go places , there has n't been much . Now , though , as part of Bristol Old Vic's 250th anniversary season , comes a very free adaptation of L ' Homme qui rit ( 1869 ) , a work written by Hugo while he was living in exile on the Channel Islands . A ghoulish tale of a man whose mouth was carved into a permanent smile as a child , it has been adapted before , mostly for the screen : a 1928 silent version was credited with inspiring the Joker in Batman while Gerard Depardieu starred in a 2012 French adaptation as Ursus , the mountebank who has turned the grinning Gwynplaine into a freak side-show attraction to keep them in body and soul . The Old Vic's account has been five years in development and has had £ 370 , 000 poured into it . Directed by Tom Morris , a driving force behind War Horse , the hope must be that they 're onto a winner . Louis Maskell as Grinpayne Credit : Simon Annand I wish I could cheer The Grinning Man straight into the West End but my response is the critical equivalent of a natural smile-for-camera that turns into a pained grimace . At its best , it displays a blackly comic brilliance and inventive daring that 's a joy to behold ; at its worst , it feels like rambling , convoluted storytelling that craves parental levels of indulgence , like Tim Burton on an off-day . At almost three hours , it starts to flag . Adaptor Carl Grose has shifted the action from the original setting of Queen Anne-era England and relocated it to a more period-fluid and fictionalised Bristol – the whole thing exquisitely rendered by designer Jon Bausor , converting the proscenium arch itself into a bloodied rictus grin . Our host for the evening is the cadaverous clown-figure of Barkilphedro , miserable resident goon at the court of King Clarence . He 's played with creeping , leering , frighten-the-kiddies aplomb by Julian Bleach ( a tour de force to match his treasured turn in the runaway hit "" junk opera "" Shockheaded Peter ) . Julian Bleach as Barkilphedro Credit : Simon Annand W ith tattered ruff and tipsy bearing , Barkilphedro introduces us to Clarence's three children – one of whom will become the sour-faced queen , the other two , Lord David and Duchess Josiana , will become enchanted by the scar-faced hero , now renamed Grinpayne . How this benighted youth ( sporting ear-to-ear bloodied bandage for much of the time by Louis Maskell ) came to suffer his disfigurement is told in flashback form in the circus-show within the show , using a boy-puppet and shadow-play . But is that version of events reliable ? Grinpayne's suffering is alleviated by a special potion that fogs his memory . We gradually discover more about Ursus , the pretty blind girl he 's also got in tow ( Audrey Brisson's Dea ) and Barkilphedro's sinister hand in everything . The heart of this "" cracked fairytale "" has pertinent points to make about psychological as well as physical abuse , the restrictive stories children are told about themselves , but the knotty plotting can leave you more bothered than bewitched . Musically , though , the piece ( composed by Tim Phillips and Marc Teitler , performed live ) shows tremendous promise . At times it hits chilling highs reminiscent of Sondheim ' s Sweeney Todd , at other points resembling more conventional musical fare , even getting a touch Les Mis-like . The cruelty and macabre wit needs more continuity , but that sweet-sour contradiction just about works . With some sharp trimming , the whole thing could fly . And any show that closes its first half with a maniacal choral number ( celebrating the anti-hero's bizarre newfound messianic appeal ) called A Scar is Born has got to be worth a look ."	5

How many times does it change hands ( The thing that changes hand - contract that is ' the future ' ' option - WTH IS IT ? ) before final destination ? Then when it reaches what the end what is it 's cost ? If the number is never static can I get a historical ' list ' If that is too much to answer .... With no one in "" the middle "" how much does a freshly filled barrel of oil cost today ? Is there an average "" X "" less than the ' delivered ' ? Answer There is some variability in the price of oil depending on where it is drilled , what the quality of the oil is , and other factors . Here 's a great place to find info on oil prices : http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.Fil... This is from Valero's investor relations webpage . Valero is the largest US refinery company . The spread between gas prices and oil prices is very important to Valero because Valero buys raw oil , refines it , and then sells it as gas . The difference in these two prices is Valero's profit . The chart shows several different grades of crude oil and how much they cost by location . It also shows different refined products and their prices ( including gasoline , diesel , residential fuel oil , etc. ) . http://www.valero.com/InvestorRelations/... -------------------------------------- ... Oil futures generally track the average price of oil across the globe pretty well . The futures contracts will specify what grade of oil is being delivered and when . Oil futures that are very near expiration are going to reflect very closely to actual oil prices . Futures contracts are financial contracts that have their roots in the medieval ages . Originally the idea was that buyers would purchase a commodity from a seller before the seller had the commodity . For example a cloth maker might purchase 100 bags of wool before the farmer's sheep had any wool . Why would they do this ? Because the farmer would then have the money to feed the sheep so that there would be wool in the future . The farmer would get paid in advance and earn a profit , and the cloth maker would provide financing to the farmer ( often reaping an additional financing profit similar to earning interest ) . However in this case the cloth maker runs the risk that the price of wool might drop in the future . If so , the cloth maker might have been able to purchase the cloth at a lower price . On the other hand , if wool prices rise , the cloth maker gets a better price and can sell higher priced cloth for an even higher profit . Naturally this lends itself to speculator activity . Some people do n't have any intention of purchasing an underlying commodity , but they buy the futures contract ( providing financing to the commodity seller ) , wait for the commodity price to go up , and then sell the contract to somebody else later for a profit . It has actually gotten to a point where the futures contracts do n't even represent real commodities , instead speculators just bet on commodity prices in a zero sum game . The winner pays the loser and that 's it ! I would read some books on futures and options . Futures are complicated , but it is interesting and valuable information to have ."	7

1631	"As illustrated by the graph on the left , the basic symptoms of autism are often accompanied other medical conditions and challenges . These , too , can vary widely in severity . While autism is usually a life-long condition , all children and adults benefit from interventions , or therapies , that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities . Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible , the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life . Social Challenges Typically developing infants are social by nature . They gaze at faces , turn toward voices , grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age . By contrast , most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions . By 8 to 10 months of age , many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names , reduced interest in people and delayed babbling . By toddlerhood , many children with autism have difficulty playing social games , do n't imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone . They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in typical ways . It is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions . This can take the form of seemingly "" immature "" behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations . It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior . The tendency to "" lose control "" may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar , overwhelming or frustrating situations . Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging , hair pulling or self-biting . Communication Difficulties By age three , most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language . One of the earliest is babbling . By the first birthday , most typically developing toddlers say a word or two , turn and look when they hear their names , point to objects they want or want to show to someone ( not all cultures use pointing in this way ) . When offered something distasteful , they can make clear – by sound or expression – that the answer is "" no . "" By contrast , young children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling and speaking and learning to use gestures . Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors . Others experience significant language delays and do n't begin to speak until much later . With therapy , however , most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate . Many nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures ( image at left ) , sign language , electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices . When language begins to develop , the person with autism may use speech in unusual ways . Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences . They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over . Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim ( echolalia ) . Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation . Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject , giving others little chance to comment . In other words , the ordinary "" give and take "" of conversation proves difficult . Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors , failing to pick up on the "" kid-speak "" that 's common among their peers . Conversely , someone affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language . Facial expressions , movements and gestures may not match what they are saying . Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings . Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat , robot-like voice . This can make it difficult for others know what they want and need . This failed communication , in turn , can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior ( such as screaming or grabbing ) on the part of the person with autism . Fortunately , there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs . As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants , challenging behaviors often subside . ( See section on Treatments . ) Repetitive Behaviors Unusual repetitive behaviors and / or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism . Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping , rocking , jumping and twirling , arranging and rearranging objects , and repeating sounds , words , or phrases . Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating , such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes . The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys . Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play . Similarly , some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place . It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order . Along these lines many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine . Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations , or obsessions . These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content ( e.g. fans , vacuum cleaners or toilets ) or depth of knowledge ( e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy ) . Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers , symbols , dates or science topics . Associated Medical Conditions Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into the causes and treatment of the medical conditions associated with ASD . You can explore these studies here . This research is reflected in the comprehensive care model at the heart of our Autism Treatment Network ( ATN ) clinics . To find out if there is an ATN clinic close to you , click here . For in depth information on medical conditions , please see our website's related pages : "" Treatments for Associated Medical Conditions "" and "" What Treatments are Available for Speech , Language and Motor Impairments , "" in addition to the information below . Genetic Disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development . These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome , Angelman syndrome , tuberous sclerosis and chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders . While further study is needed , single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20 percent of those with ASD . Some of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories , the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing . The results can help guide treatment , awareness of associated medical issues and life planning . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Disorders GI distress is common among persons with autism , and affects up to 85 percent of children with ASD . These conditions range in severity from a tendency for chronic constipation or diarrhea to inflammatory bowel disease . Pain caused by GI issues can prompt behavioral changes such as increased self soothing ( rocking , head banging , etc ) or outbursts of aggression or self-injury . Conversely , appropriate treatment can improve behavior and quality of life . Please see our treatment section on "" Gastrointestinal Disorders . "" It includes discussion of popular dietary interventions . Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into causes and treatments . Seizure Disorders Seizure disorders , including epilepsy , occur in as many as 39 percent of those with autism . It is more common in people with autism who also have intellectual disability than those without . Someone with autism may experience more than one type of seizure . The easiest to recognize is the grand mal , or tonic-clonic , seizure . Others include "" petit mal "" seizures ( when a person temporarily appears "" absent "" ) and subclinical seizures , which may be apparent only with electroencephalogram ( EEG ) testing . Sleep Dysfunction Sleep problems are common among children and adolescents with autism and may likewise affect many adults . For more information and helpful guidance , see our ATN Sleep Strategies Tool Kit ( available for free download ) . Sensory Processing Problems Many persons with autism have unusual responses to sensory input . They have difficulty processing and integrating sensory information , or stimuli , such as sights , sounds smells , tastes and / or movement . They may experience seemingly ordinary stimuli as painful , unpleasant or confusing . ( Explore our donor-funded research on causes and treatments here . ) Some of those with autism are hypersensitive to sounds or touch , a condition also known as sensory defensiveness . Others are under-responsive , or hyposensitive . An example of hypersensitivity would be the inability to tolerate wearing clothing , being touched or being in a room with normal lighting . Hyposensitivity can include failure to respond when one's name is called . Many sensory processing problems can be addressed with occupational therapy and / or sensory integration therapy .

274	"' The sooner we dispatch the snobbery that "" West is best , "" the better . ' You must have had your head buried in a mountain of Big Macs this year not to know that obesity is killing us . Accusations are piling up alongside our collective fat mountain . Politicians , schools , hospitals and food manufacturers are to blame . And those of us not of broom handle stature are lazy , uneducated or just plain greedy . Such irresponsibility is threatening the very heart of our nation . The war on fat is upon us , as are weapons of mass hysteria . Diet this , fit club that . But is anybody actually tackling the real issues ? Why do we have such a problem with food ? What is a healthy body image ? How come we are overeating when millions die from food shortages ? Well the good news is , there are actually a fair number of books to help us savour all issues regarding food . Here are five to give you some fibre to chew on . Fat is a Feminist Issue Susie Orbach , Arrow £ 7.99 Rightly , Orbach's classic has been selling for over 25 years . It blows from the table the myth that if only we remembered the millions starving in Africa we would n ' t over indulge . Rather , she suggests that parents chastising children for leftovers on their plate and reminding them of starving children , are the problem . Accordingly our society has become obsessed with engulfing all in our way and incapable of telling when our bodies are full . Not convinced ? Try her exercise of leaving a mouthful of food on your plate and throwing it away - not for the faint stomached ! Add to that , psychological pressures leading to "" comfort eating "" and it 's no wonder we are in a mess . The expectations on women especially , to smile passively , lead us to swallowing our anger and depression . Again there are numerous exercises to help us take control of our bodies and minds . A far more useful book than those proscribing foods , which often lead to cravings followed by guilty bingeing . What Would Jesus Eat ? Dr Don Colbert , STL £ 16.99 WWJD bracelets are out . What you really need is a WWJE fridge magnet . Well you do if you go along with Dr Don Colbert anyway . If you want a decent book on the whys and wherefores of healthy food then this is as good as any . There is nothing too groundbreaking however with the mantra of wholegrains - good , French Fries - bad , forming the general advice . The Christian physician also takes a welcome look at the need for free range cattle and kosher meats rather than intensive farming . But , and with such a title there has to be a but , to justify good eating Colbert relies on the often spurious use of bible verses . For example , Jesus referring to God being like a mother hen , points to the fact that he ate chicken - apparently . What is in essence a useful book , becomes a sad reflection of the fact that some Christians will only follow common sense if preceded by "" Jesus said ... "" PS . If you are really keen there is an accompanying cookbook . Fat Land Greg Critser , Penguin £ 6.99 Critser like so many of us , was overweight . It was only when he nearly caused an accident and was called "" fatso "" he decided to do something about it . This decision led to a journey into the world of fat reduction and a discovery of some of the real causes behind America's obesity problem . Critser was quick to realise that obesity is intricately linked to class and wealth . The book is full of frightening figures showing how poor communities are more likely to suffer obesity related health problems than the rich . The availability of decent education that is not sponsored by Pizza Hut , MacDonalds or other such health aficionados is limited . As is good proactive , preventative healthcare . These are not exactly revolutionary claims but Crister's exploration of how "" bad foods "" such as sugar and fats are subsidised more than healthy foods is illuminating . Do n't be put off by the American slant as much of the book has relevance in the UK too ; not least because we are fast following in their footsteps , both culturally and in body shape . We are provided with a well researched , readable book that exposes some of the real causes of Western obesity . It is not just individual greed and lack lustre will power that is to blame . So We Shall Reap Colin Tudge , Penguin £ 8.99 Highly critical of the short termism and lack of diversity in our food production , Tudge argues that instead of starvation being a reality for the majority world , all people should be able to eat for time immemorial . That is , if we change our attitudes . Tudge , a zoologist and a Research Fellow at the Centre of Philosophy at LSE does not eschew science . He is not an organic fetishist with simplistic answers , but he does rigorously examine the need for more regional farming and learning from traditional methods . The sooner we dispatch the snobbery that "" West is best , "" the better . Alongside his historical account of humanity's ability to farm , he writes that we are spiritual beings and therefore have a need to look after the land and wildlife around us . Our status as intelligent beings also brings with it the compunction to design sustainable farming methods that will provide food for tens of thousands of years . Sadly he does not examine fully these claims . I passionately believe he is right , but on a daily basis , humanity refuses to live its responsibility . Let's just hope that some people may start to act on this important book . The Apologist Jay Rayner , Atlantic Books £ 10 After discovering one of his columns has led to the suicide of a restaurateur , food critic Marc , decides to apologise . This leads to an all-consuming desire to apologise to everybody he has sinned against - ever . The UN are quick to pick up on his passion and make him Chief Apologist and task him with leading countries to apologise to each other for historical hurts . A new life starts for this man who has struggled with the meaning of a healthy body image since childhood . As weight is lost , Marc discovers that gluttony and greed affect far more than a person's feeding cycle . Is love of good food a crime ? Do we assume that only rich people have sophisticated taste buds ? How do we learn to love one another and ourselves ? All these questions and more are tackled with dark humour interspersed with descriptions of food , which are almost erotic in detail . Forget diets , forget health gurus , Jay Rayner has the answer to our obesity ; we are broken human beings . We might sort out one problem but are just too good at simply causing another . A superb morality tale for all those who think greed is simple issue ."	0
1517	Have you heard about Form-Based Codes - New Zoning Tool to be Utilized with Plan Build Live Cincinnati's great neighborhoods originally were built as pedestrian-oriented , mixed-use communities . Residents could walk to restaurants , groceries , retail and meet their daily needs in their vibrant neighborhood business districts . Originally zoning focused on the quality of the places we designed and built and not solely on specific uses , as current zoning does . A major focus of the Plan Build Live project is the creation of a powerful new zoning tool called a Form - Based Code . Form-Based Codes reinforce strong neighborhoods , business districts , and downtowns by focusing on the physical character of buildings , and the relationship of buildings to each other and to the street . By concentrating on the form , rather than the use , of buildings , form-based codes also address the streets and sidewalks – the ' public living rooms ' of our neighborhoods . Most traditional zoning codes are auto-oriented and produce patches of similar use , forcing long distances between the things we all need to do . Many of Cincinnati's walkable , mixed-use neighborhood business districts would not be able to built today under traditional zoning . Form based codes are a powerful new tool that will permit neighborhoods to reinforce their character and their competitive advantage by once again concentrating on the physical massing of buildings , the relationship of the buildings to the sidewalks and street , and the character of the community . The vision and hope of every neighborhood to be a vibrant place where all residents can live , work and play is made possible through the adoption of a form-based code . As the City wraps up the Urban Design Workshop , which is crucial to creating the Form-Based Code , we 've got lots of information on this site . Check here for blog entries , including video of some of the presentations , and here for the schedule of events . For more information on what a Form-Based Code is and how it works , check our documents section here .	2
482	"1.1 The Library Association is the professional body that represents some 25,000 librarians and information workers in the United Kingdom . Under the terms of its Royal Charter , The Association has a duty to promote high quality library and information services and to advise government , employers and others on all aspects of library and information provision . 1.2 Therefore we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Department for Culture , Media and Sport review of the British Library 1.3 The Library Association response is formed by expressions from our membership and is based on their views as both library and information professionals and users of British Library services . The overall impression of the membership is that they appreciate the services provided , they believe the services are of a reasonable standard and that the relationship between the British Library and the library and information profession is good . 1.4 Within that context we offer the following comments for your consideration . 2 . Purpose , aims and objectives 2.1 The British Library meets the aims stated in the Department for Culture , Media and Sport background paper supplied with the review questionnaire . However , we are unable to comment fully on the purpose , aims and objectives of the British Library because we are insufficiently aware of them . We are surprised by this lack of awareness within the profession and we would suggest this carries an important message for the British Library . In order to address this apparent problem The Library Association would welcome working with the British Library on a strategy to improve communication throughout the profession . 2.2 The agenda of the British Library should be as broad as that of Government . Therefore the Library should focus on its contribution to lifelong learning , social inclusion , literacy , information skills and employability . Key areas are access , regionalism and partnership . This requires the British Library to work closely with Government departments that carry forward these agendas . 2.3 A further objective for the British Library should be developing formal professional collaboration and partnership . The Library has a role to play in ' joined-up ' library and information provision . By working with other libraries , professional library and information associations , key professional organisations and commercial partners the British Library can provide an important focus for the library and information profession in the UK . 3 . Organisation , efficiency and effectiveness 3.1 Establishing and maintaining links with departments and personnel at the British Library is sometimes confusing and difficult . There are often apparent overlaps in the titles and responsibilities of different departments . Communication on a theme , topic or project will sometimes appear to stem from several departments , with no underlying staff responsibility clearly discernible . This can create an impression of bureaucracy : streamlining departmental responsibilities and clarifying job titles and contact routes would improve the effectiveness of the Library's communications . 3.2 In general it is felt that the British Library's services offer good value for money , although it must be reiterated that members often do not have an understanding of all of the products and services available . 3.3 The Co-operation and Partnership Programme is a welcome development particularly as it encourages innovation and cross-sectoral partnership . However , the themes for which bids are invited do not reflect the themes in Government policy . 3.4 We welcome the Library's new premises in St Pancras . We also welcome an attitudinal change over the past year , with a move towards greater openness and willingness to "" look beyond St Pancras "" . Access to the building has become easier and the building itself has contributed to the regeneration of one of London's most deprived areas . 3.5 However , there is a developing concern about space within the Euston Road building . One anxiety is the availability of reader seats , particularly in the Humanities Reading Room , as the number of members increase . Another concern is the way in which the role of the British Library as a comprehensive archive is slowly being eroded as a result of the lack of space . This highlights a dilemma for the British Library , that is , the tension between widening access to the collections and maintaining the role of preservation . 4 . Customer relations and responsiveness 4.1 Most Library Association members have experience of BLDSC services and their overall impression of these services is favourable . The inter-library loan service is regarded as effective and efficient and , since going on-line , the speed of service has vastly improved . However , one drawback is cost , which many regard as too expensive . In fact it has been pointed out that the most effective communication from the British Library seem to relate to changes in pricing structures . 4.2 As far as customer relations and the quality framework is concerned there seems to be a lack of a coherent mechanism for taking the views of service users , and non-users , into account . Formal evaluation of the services provided should be transparent and the British Library should benchmark its activities against Charter Mark headings . 4.3 The main market for British Library services seems to be the post-18 education and research community . The Library should be looking for ways of engaging a much wider audience . Key areas for consideration are family learning , information skills training , literacy , IT literacy and adult basic skills . 4.4 The collection policy of the British library should also reflect the complex multicultural UK population . Many perceive the British Library as an institution of cultural and heritage significance . Providing access to materials in the mother tongue or concerning the mother country of many UK citizens may be regarded as important for the British Library in fulfilling its cultural role . 5 . Links with other organisations 5.1 The directional role of the British Library within the UK library profession can not be overemphasised . However , there is a need for the Library to redefine its image to a wider audience placing itself at the heart of a national library network , enhancing the image of libraries in general . 5.2 In order to fulfil its role within the context of Government policy the British Library must develop partnerships with a variety of organisations : libraries in all sectors ; museums and archives ; government departments and bodies ; professional associations , commercial companies and the voluntary sector . There is considerable scope for developing creative partnerships , for example , becoming involved with the Children's Laureate initiative or World Book Day . 5.3 The withdrawal of the British Library cataloguing and conservation grants programme some years ago is still regretted , particularly as the BL Co-operation and Partnership Programme specifically excludes funding for retrospective conversion . It is hoped that the Full Disclosure initiative will address this omission , as the ability of UK libraries to share responsibility with the British Library for coverage of research material depends to a large extent on such material being catalogued . 6 . New Technology 6.1 New technology has the potential to allow the British Library to offer services that contribute to , and underpin , lifelong learning . It will facilitate the distribution of services to the network of libraries in the UK ; to schools , colleges and universities ; to the workplace ; and to the home . The British Library can contribute to the national competitiveness and skills agenda by promoting literacy , numeracy and information skills . 6.2 Interoperability and bandwidth issues need careful consideration in the context of achieving inclusion . In view of the bandwidth and computers available to many users , the British Library should concentrate on delivering ' simple ' services as well as bandwidth-hungry digitisation projects . The services provided should be robust and reliable . 6.3 New technology will enhance the worldwide standing of the British Library . By studying best practice among the world's national library providers and embedding their own technology-based services within an international framework the British Library could open a gateway that would allow global access to resources at a local level . 6.4 At present there seems to be inadequate provision for the preservation of non-book materials . As more materials are produced in non-print format the British Library , as the national library , should be given the resources to preserve the literary and information heritage of the non-print materials produced in the UK . 6.5 BLDSC should minimise the paper-based aspects of the request and supply process . ' Digital signatures ' will obviate the need for signed copyright declarations and will facilitate a seamless supply model of document delivery . 7 . Other comments 7.1 The British Library must identify its contribution to an inclusive lifelong learning system by : enhancing access to learning ; enhancing the generation of content to learning networks ; enhancing networked access to resources . 8 . Conclusion 8.1 The Library Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department for Culture , Media and Sport review of the British Library . The suggestions we have made are in the spirit of support for the overall aims of the British Library . 8.2 We fully recognise that many of our suggestions have resource implications and we would stress the need for the British Library to be funded adequately to fulfil its important national role . Within that context the Library must reassess its priorities between its traditional roles and the broader challenges of current Government policy . 8.3 We hope that our comments prove useful and welcome the possibility of further engagement in this debate .

1475	"American politics has always been defined by sex . This is not to say that the American system is inherently corrupt ; sex has played a role in the politics of all civilizations . From Caesar , who consented to an alliance with ancient Egypt out of lust for Queen Cleopatra , to Louis XIV , who allowed his personal prostitutes to determine which citizens could be present at court , sex has effectively shaped the political "" haves "" and "" have nots "" for centuries . Does the omnipresence of sex in politics mean that Americans should accept some amount of sexual deviancy in their political candidates ? The answer is far from simple . There is a tendency amongst Americans to ascribe unreasonable amounts of idolatry to politicians . Often times , we hold them to standards of perfectionism we ourselves do not adhere to . Although they are responsible for running the country , there is no inherent need for politicians to be moral dynamos , at least in terms of sex . Certainly no one would advocate electing amoral politicians , but there is a distinction between different moral ideals . For example , while being dishonest is both a moral hazard and a political hazard , overt sexuality is at best only a moral hazard . Dishonesty may cause politicians to do their jobs less effectively because they may launder money or fix elections . The same can not be said for politicians who engage in sexual acts ; unless they are engaging in sexual activities while at work , there is no reason their sexual conduct would interfere with their ability to make intelligent political decisions . I am neither arguing that politicians should engage in sexual acts unreservedly nor that there are no concerns with allowing politicians to approach sex more casually . Rather , I am calling on American citizens to re-evaluate their expectations . Holding humans , inherently flawed creatures , to ideals aligned with godliness is a strategy that is and will continue to be a failure . What is more shocking about America than the number of politicians who are caught sending sexts or naked photos is the unfailing reaction of surprise by its citizens each time a new scandal occurs . Each scandal , be it as severe as the Clinton scandal , or as minor as the Anthony Weiner scandal , is met with the same call to rally the pitchforks by the media and the public . Reacting with this level of severity every time a new scandal breaks diminishes the ability of the public to look objectively at a scandal and evaluate its true level of severity . In response to this inability of the public at large to remain objective when evaluating sex scandals , I have devised a scale designed to measure the severity of current and future scandals . Basic Assumptions and Workings of the Walker Scale The purpose of the Walker scale is to serve as an objective scale that can be used to score the severity of sex scandals . There is only one qualification : the person who is being ranked is either a politician or a figure who wields political power . In no way will this scale be applicable to athletes or actors because the acts for which a person could receive points on the scale are tied to holding office . The Walker scale is theoretically infinite-this is because a person has an infinite capacity to commit sexual "" transgression , "" all of which would be assigned a point value . The various sexual misdeeds are each given a value of 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , or 1 , with one being highly nefarious and zero being negligibly nefarious . In an effort to give the scale some kind of tangible end , Caligula , the Roman Emperor , serves as infinity , representing the pinnacle of political debauchery . The Thirteen Transgressions There are fifteen broad categories for which the political figure in question will be ranked : 1 . Prostitution Prostitution is illegal , and so a political figure being involved in some way with prostitutes is one of the few ways in which sex could interfere with a politician's ability to do his job . Since a politician seeks to make laws or carry them out to some extent , involving himself in this illegal activity negates his function in society . Being involved in some way with prostitution include : A. Paying for services from a prostitute B. Running or financially supporting a prostitution ring Point Value : 0.75 2 . Using Your Position to Acquire Sex and possibly Covering it Up Being a political figure generally affords opportunities to both obtain sex and cover up sexual activities because of the amount of resources political figures have at their disposal that ordinary citizens do not . The second portion of the category , using one's status as a political figure to cover up a scandal , is generally more severe because there is an implication that government resources are aiding in the cover up . Acts that would warrant points in this category include : A. Using campaign funding to acquire sex B. Using campaign funding to hide a sexual misdeed C. Requiring a subordinate to cover up a sexual misdeed D. Diverting funds from a philanthropic or political organization to obtain sex Point Value : 0.75 3 . Sexual Relations with Youth This category does not address rape , but rather refers to situations in which political figures would engage in sexual relations with a younger member of their staff , such as an intern or a page . Engaging in sexual relations with someone less than ten years younger is not assigned a point value . At the 10 year mark , 0.5 points are awarded . The ten year difference was chosen as a landmark because 10 years old is the earliest age , in general , that a person will go through puberty , and is an adolescent rather than a child . The idea is that if the political figure would have entered a new phase of life , adolescence , while the younger partner was still a child , they exist in a distinct generational gap , and would not ordinarily mate . Sexual relations with youth include : A. Sexual relations with an intern B. Sexual relations with a page C. Sending explicit content to an intern D. Sending explicit content to a pageFor each subsequent decade they are separated by , the scale adds 0.5 points . For instance , if the age difference was 30 years , the political figure will get a point value of 1.5 added to his total score . Point Value : 0.5 ( X ) 4 . Extra-Marital Affairs If a political figure is married and has extramarital sexual relations , he is in violation of both civil law and divine law . Extramarital relations include : A. Sexual relations of any kind with a non-spouse B. Sending explicit content of any kind with a non-spouse The point value is derived from the two different kinds of laws being broken in this instance . Breaking civil law has a point value of 0.5 , and breaking divine law has a point value of 0.5 for a combined total of 1 point . If the political figure was not married in a religious ceremony , he should only be awarded 0.5 points for extramarital sex . Point Value : 0 . 5-1 5 . Multiple People Cheated With This category is a subset of the marriage category , but is specifically designed to address repeat offenders . Multiple people cheated with include : A. Two or more persons with whom a political figure has committed sexual acts with For each additional person a political figure has been confirmed to have an affair with , 1 point should be added to his score . In addition to confirmed infidelity , there are often instances in which rumored affairs are pinned to politicians . While it would be unfair to award 1 point for each rumored affair , political figures' propensity to lie to protect their image warrants 0.25 points per rumored affair , as these rumors often develop into confirmations later . The only stipulation here is that a rumored affair must be tied to a specific person , it can not be based on conjecture on infidelity in the abstract . Point Value : 0 . 25-1 6 . Children Committing sexually deviant acts when responsible for a child or children should be treated with more severity than simply committing them while single or married because a political leader who is a parent is responsible for the well being of a child . Extramarital sexual acts would not be limited to the individual political leader ; these acts could have psychological ramifications on the children . Having children constitutes : A. Children that are biologically the children of the political figures B. Children that are adopted or legally under the guardianship of the political figure C. Unborn children ( If the political figure knows their spouse to be pregnant ) Unborn children are factored into the point system because the political figure has knowledge that they will be responsible for a child within 9 months , and the child in question does technically exist despite being literally unborn . For each child the political figure has , 1 point should be added to his total score . Point Value : 1 ( X ) This category is most applicable in the aftermath of a political figure committing a sexual act . Breaking a non sex-related law includes : A. Lying to a court about sexual interactions B. Being linked to a criminal act of a sexual partner i.e. a prostitution ring of drug business C. Having knowledge of illegal activities conducted by a sexual partner and failing to hold them accountable D. Being linked to the disappearance , murder , or assault of a sexual partner E. Being convicted of or charged with a felony Point Value : 1 8 . Denial of Allegations Denying allegations of sexual misconduct is something of a knee-jerk reaction for political figures , and is less severe than other offenses because it is merely an attempt to uphold their public images . Denial includes : A. Refusing to comment on whether or not a political figure perpetrated a sexual act B. Claiming allegations of sexual misconduct to be rumor and then later confessing C. Claiming photographic or video evidence is falsified or does not belong to the political figure in question Point Value : 0.25 9 . Presidential Clause Presidents have three intelligence managing institutions at their disposal : The CIA , The FBI , and the Secret Service . Since Presidents have by far the best means to filter what information about themselves is leaked , a president who still fails to keep sexual deeds private should be awarded 0.25 points since failure to maintain secrecy was certainly not due to a lack of resources . The presidential clause is applicable : A. Only during the years a politician served as president ( i.e. any scandals they engage in post-presidency are not awarded points ) B. Being caught in a sexual act in office C. Text , photographic , video evidence being leaked to the media or public Point Value : 0.25 10 . Text , Photographic , or Video Evidence Since the world is interconnected , political figures , like ordinary citizens , are acutely aware that any sexually explicit text messages , photos , or videos have the potential to be transferred instantaneously . This category is given a more severe point value because blatantly documenting a sexual act is irresponsible given the level of societal information sharing . Text , photographic , or video evidence includes : A. Sexually explicit photographs sent by the political figure B. Sexually explicit photographs being requested by the political figure C. Sexually explicit photographs being received by the political figure with his consent D. Sexually explicit videos made by the political figure that feature him E. Sexually explicit text messages being sent by the political figure F. Sexually explicit text messages being received by the political figure Point Value : 0.75 11 . Fathering Illegitimate Children Any children resulting from an extra-marital affair qualify a political figure for points in this category . For each illegitimate child , 1 point is awarded , and each rumored illegitimate child that has not been genetically confirmed to belong to the political figure adds 0.25 points to the political figure's total score . 12 . Diverting Government Funds to Commit or Cover Up Sexual Acts Any action that directly results in a political figure using governmental funds or campaign funds to engage in or cover up a sexual act falls into this category . Diverting funding constitutes : A. Using campaign funds to buy prostitutes B. Using campaign funds to bribe people to buy silence about sexual misconduct C. Using governmental funds to buy prostitutes D. Using governmental funds to buy silence about sexual misconduct Point Value : 1 13 . Rape or Using Political Office to Force Intercourse This is certainly the most severe and subjective category of sexual misdeeds . Actually committing rape affords a political figure 1 point on to their total score , and any allegations that a political figure has committed rape afford him 0.25 points . Accusations of rape are not given the same point value because false accusations of rape are possible , and assigning truth to rumors about an issue as serious as rape is dangerous . Rape or misusing political office for intercourse includes : A. Threatening members of staff if they refuse to engage in intercourse He claims his scandal was politics at a new low , the Walker Scale agrees 1 . Asked Wife to Have Sex in Public Places While Others Watched . 0 Have political figures become more scandal-prone with time ? It is telling that three of the top five scoring figures saw the height of their political power fifty or more years ago . While this trend does not prove that sexual deviancy has become less severe in recent history , it demonstrates that in politics , sexual transgressions , like diamonds , are forever ."	0
404	T5 : The Excavation Archaeological excavation began at T5 in April 2002 , with the construction work on the Terminal itself beginning in December 2002 ; the terminal is due to open in spring 2008 . The site is the largest ever excavated in Britain . It has also been innovative in the way that the archaeology has run alongside major construction work by BAA and in the way that interpretation of finds has taken place on site . No single archaeological unit had enough staff to tackle the project alone . Instead , two long-established practices , Oxford Archaeology and Wessex Archaeology , formed a joint venture called Framework Archaeology to work at T5 and all other BAA airports . The excavation was a major challenge to the staff , who worked amid the noise and fumes of the world's busiest international airport . The project was unique in the way that it integrated the archaeological and the commercial . Framework's staff spent seven years designing and planning the project and working in the Heathrow area . The result was a focussed way of carrying out archaeology which allowed the excavators to know which areas were important and so avoid wasting time and money . BAA encouraged the best archaeology possible . They hired archaeological consultant Gill Andrews and Professor John Barrett , from Sheffield University , who , together with Framework Archaeology , developed a unique working method at T5 . By analysing and recording finds on site during excavation , rather than waiting until the end as is usual , staff were able to interpret their findings as they were made as well as ensuring that their work followed the most interesting and important directions . The excavation was rare in having computer terminals onsite and its own post-excavation department . The excavation suggested that people first began to create fields owned individually , as opposed to farming communally on open land , as early as 2 , 000BC , some five hundred years earlier than has been thought . Some of the Bronze Age field boundaries remained in use until the airport was built in the 20th century . The excavation : revealed objects including the only wooden bowl found dating to the Middle Bronze Age ( 1 , 500BC-1 , 100BC ) ; one of only two wooden buckets from the same period ; and a log ladder leading down into a pit dug during the Middle Bronze Age containing a wooden axehaft and a Neolithic stone axe , itself 2,000 years old when it was placed there . Two beautiful Iron Age pottery cups were also found . shed new light on the development of farming during the Bronze Age . Farming began during the Neolithic - New Stone Age - period ( 4 , 000BC - 2 , 400BC ) when forests were gradually cleared and crops were planted and gathered communally . It had been thought that communal farming continued on open land until the Middle Bronze Age ( 1 , 500BC-1 , 100BC ) . However , at Terminal 5 , pollen found from hedges used as field boundaries showed that people here were creating fields with boundaries from around 2 , 000BC , during the Early Bronze Age , 500 years earlier than archaeologists have previously thought . revealed how the religious focus of people changed over the centuries . The excavation looked at the Stanwell Cursus , a four-kilometre ( 2 . 5 mile ) pathway about 20 metres wide and flanked by ditches , which was built as early as 3 , 800BC and cuts across the Terminal 5 site . The cursus was a pathway with religious significance which linked important sites . Archaeologists believe that processions took place of important members of tribes along the Stanwell Cursus and along several other shorter cursuses in the area . The excavation revealed that when the first field boundaries were created in the Early Bronze Age ( around 2 , 000BC - 1 , 500BC ) , they ran around the cursus and not across it , as a mark of respect for its religious significance . But during the Middle Bronze Age , from 1 , 500BC , field boundaries were created across the cursus itself , a sign that it was no longer venerated , and that people now had to live within a world defined by hedges and fields rather than communal living . At the same time , access to the local rivers for people's livestock was harder because it would mean driving them across others' land , so waterholes were dug instead . These then became the focus of religious rituals , with important objects such as pottery and wooden objects placed in them as a sign of their religious significance . These changes show how man changed the religious significance of sites according to how useful they were to early farming . charted the changes in the landscape made by man from 6 , 000BC . These included : pits where meat was cooked by hunter gatherers during the Mesolithic ( Middle Stone Age ) period , c6 , 000BC , when the landscape was heavily forested ; large cursuses created during the Neolithic era ( New Stone Age , 4 , 000BC-2 , 400BC ) ; fields and boundaries and the first small permanent settlements in the Bronze Age ( 2 , 400BC-700BC ) ; and a small village in the Iron Age ( 700BC-AD43 ) and Roman times . The excavation reveals how the settlement died out at the end of the Roman era , but another settlement appeared in the mid-12th century . Some of the field boundaries created in the Bronze Age are still visible on maps and were still in use in the 20th century .	3

522	Voluntary Repo Explained by Liz Khan on September 23 , 2011 Voluntary repossession is once you are incapable to go on having to pay your mortgage loan , so you offer your keys to the home loan lending institution with no encountering the regular repo court docket proceedings . Though you may be avoiding the emphasize of authorized proceedings , this could only be thought of as a endure resort . rentepercentage hypotheek Which are the benefits of voluntary repo ? If you are going through real financial problems and the likelihood of you being able to pay off your mortgage arrears is more and more slim , your home loan loan provider may point to that voluntary repossession is an alternative which can help you steer clear of emphasize and credit score dark listing . A voluntary repossession is much prefer a normal repossession except you steer clear of heading to court and when the kys are handed at the time of you will put an end to the stream of calls for and threats from the lending company . Though you may conserve yourself some hassle , the actuality is voluntary repo is probably to get rid of you cash and go away you in even far more financial debt . hypotheek lenen What are the negatives of voluntary repossession ? The place to start ! The main downside of voluntary repossession is which the financial debt is most likely to increase . Although you possess handed at the time of the keys to the home you remain liable to pay the home loan till the lender trades your house , whilst getting to pay for other accommodation for on your own . After you hand over your keys the decision of voluntary repo is last and you possess no management at the time of the sale of the residence so the longer it takes , the far more prices could be increase in up that you are anticipated to pay . On top of doing so once the house is sold it is most likely to be offered for much less compared to its marketplace value if a low offer you is recognized or it is offered at auction . If it is offered for much less that the overall amount that you owe , you have to pay the difference . What charges will I need to pay if my mortgage financial institution trades my home ? Students have plenty of costs related with marketing a house , all of that you will need to pay . These might involve auctioneer expenses , estate representatives costs and expenses for fixes just before the deal . Due to the fact the mortgage financial institution is aware of which you have to include these fees these folks may not be looking for the least expensive and very best cope for you . From the sale of the house you will be anticipated to pay the first overall amount you rented from the lender , perk interest , properties insurance , arrears and penalty prices and council tax . Using these prices mounting up it is very likely that the deal of the house will not be the end of the debt-problems , solely the starting . Which are my various options ? If you possess exhausted remortgaging or distinct payment objectives to halt the repo of your house , you could look at marketing the house on your own . As you can see from the facts above , voluntary repo should solely be regarded as as a endure resort . You have no control over the sale of the home but you remain liable to pay the fees incurred and the home loan until it is offered . Promoting your house quickly yourself to a cash-buyer suggests which you remain in control of what present you accept . Moreover after acknowledged the procedure can consider much less compared to 28 days , once that time your mortgage and financial debt could possibly be purchased off .	7
1456	Those Xbox One and PS4 preorders went by pretty fast , huh ? If you overslept the day that retailers put them out , then good news : Walmart 's going to have a new stock of preorders available this Saturday , August 24 . So maybe South Park was wrong and Walmart 's not that evil after all . These are n't your average $ 5 minimum preorders , though . You 'll need to give a 10 percent down payment in order to reserve a shiny new console . So that means you 'll need to pay $ 40 for the PS4 and $ 50 for the Xbox One . But do n't fret if you ca n't immediately pay the rest . You have the option of paying in full when you preorder . This is pretty smart on Walmart's part , given that many people want these consoles but do n't have the $ 399-499 up front . The store will hold your console for you from launch date ( November 15 for the PS4 , the Xbox One's is still unknown ) until December 13 , and throughout that period you 'll be able to make payments to cover the cost of the system .	7
325	"The National Biodiversity Network ( NBN ) is home to all information on the nation's biodiversity . You can find the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) for your area from www . b iodiversityscotland . o rg or www . s earchnbn . n et The involvement of the people of Scotland is essential if we are to conserve biodiversity for today and the future . Across Scotland , people are taking action for biodiversity in their own ' back yard ' . Local Biodiversity Action Plan partnerships have been set up , involving government agencies , national and local voluntary bodies and community groups all working together . Local wildlife sites are being managed , greenspace networks established and gardens made more wildlife friendly . Public bodies are looking to include action for biodiversity in their everyday activities . Wherever you live in Scotland , there are opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation locally . Twenty-four Local Biodiversity Action Plans ( LBAPs ) cover the country from Shetland in the north to Galloway in the south and from the Western Isles / Na h-Eileanan Siar in the west to Aberdeen in the east . Each LBAP is overseen by a partnership of national and local organisations , some of which also contribute funding to the project . In most cases core funding is provided by SNH and the Local Authority , with a variety of other organisations contributing in different circumstances . One or more LBAP Officers may be employed ( usually by one of the partner organisations - most often the Local Authority ) to promote and co-ordinate activities . In some areas , the additional post is a Community Biodiversity Officer , with a specific remit to encourage community involvement in the LBAP . The work of LBAPs contributes in many ways to fulfilling the objectives of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy , particularly in terms : of halting the loss of biodversity and bringing about the recovery of threatened habitats and species ; increasing people's awareness , enjoyment and understanding of biodiversity and getting more people involved in its conservation ; integrating and co-ordinating consideration of biodiversity into all decision making ; and ensuring that the most up-to-date knowledge of biodiversity is available to decision-makers . Local Authorities have a duty to achieve "" best value "" in delivering the services which they provide , Guidance on "" Best Value and Biodiversity in Scotland "" is available via the Scottish Executive website . In addition , all public bodies have a duty under the Nature Conservation ( Scotland ) Act to further the conservation of biodiversity in carrying out their functions . An important function of LBAPs is to raise people's awareness of their local biodiversity and what they can do to help . This applies to all sectors of society , and LBAPs may work with schools , youth groups , ethnic minorities , special-interest groups , businesses - in fact , anybody at all ! This type of work can include arts projects , story telling , production of leaflets , websites or CDs , and a whole range of activities several steps removed from hands-on habitat or species management . Greenspace Scotland Eco-schools Biodiversity Stories Business & biodiversity project So what do LBAPs actually do ? Most have by now completed the initial stage of drafting their own Local Biodiversity Action Plan . The Plan includes an assessment of which species and habitats are of particular importance in the local area . These will include species or habitats on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority list which occur locally , and also species and habitats considered important by local people . The Plan then sets out what needs to be done , and by whom , to improve the status of the chosen species and habitats . Some LBAPs may take on the function of identifying local sites of importance for biodiversity , which can then be taken into account by the authorities in decision-making . Information on species distribution can be obtained from the National Biodiversity Network Gateway however , this is not comprehensive . The umbrella organisation BRISC ( Biological Recording in Scotland ) is working to improve the availability of data on the distribution of Scottish habitats and species through projects such as "" Wildlife Counts "" . In some areas Local Biodiversity Records Centres hold this information at a local level . Links to these Centres can be obtained from the BRISC website . After deciding what needs to be done to improve the status of local biodiversity , resources must be found to do it . This may mean money , manpower or specialist expertise . Funding for project implementation can be sought from SNH under our "" Supporting Biodiversity "" or "" Involving People "" grant schemes , from locally-applicable European funds ( e . g . Leader + ) , Landfill Tax Credit Schemes , Lottery funds , charitable trusts and a variety of other sources , including of course the LBAP partner organisations . Lottery funding is also currently available through the BBC Breathing Places campaign .

1674	A eulogy of the Soviet Union would read that the 74-year-old superpower succumbed to a prolonged illness on December 31 , 1991 . During its final months , increasingly desperate measures were used in an attempt to stave off the demise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , but these served only to delay the inevitable . The bureaucratic structures that had governed one-sixth of Earth's landmass crumbled , and a succession of former Soviet republics declared their independence . The Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania became independent in September , and the sovereignty of Ukraine was confirmed via plebiscite in December . Although the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) was intended to serve as something of a successor to the Soviet Union , the bulk of the Soviet state's geopolitical weight – as well as its nuclear arsenal – shifted to Russia . On December 25 Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president , and six days later the U.S.S.R. ceased to exist . The Cold War had largely defined international relations in the latter half of the 20th century , but despite the ever-present threat of nuclear war , there existed a degree of stability . Although the arsenals controlled by Moscow and Washington , D.C. , were capable of destroying the world many times over , the promise of mutually assured destruction meant that cooler heads prevailed , even in tense confrontations such as the Cuban missile crisis . The détente that had prevailed through the 1970s ended abruptly with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 , and the subsequent quagmire hastened the decline of the Soviet empire and provided a fertile breeding ground for the Taliban and al-Qaeda . As casualties mounted in Afghanistan , the Soviet government faced internal and external threats that it was ill-equipped to combat . Dissidents such as Andrey Sakharov spoke out against the political oppression that was rampant in the Soviet Union , while American initiatives such as Radio Free Europe broadcast Western ideas and music behind the Iron Curtain . The Soviet economy was in an uncontrolled downward spiral ; agricultural output was down ; and bureaucratic reforms adopted by Nikita Khrushchev had devolved administrative power to the republics . These regions now agitated for increased autonomy . The early 1980s also saw a succession of deaths among the top echelons of the Communist Party : Aleksey Kosygin ( 1980 ) , Mikhail Suslov ( 1982 ) , Leonid Brezhnev ( 1982 ) , Yury Andropov ( 1984 ) , and Konstantin Chernenko ( 1985 ) . When Gorbachev took power in March 1985 , he attempted to reverse the economic decline that had begun under Brezhnev . Efforts to transition away from a command economy were only minimally successful , however , and it became increasingly obvious that Moscow could no longer project the sort of military power that had crushed the Prague Spring . Warsaw Pact countries shook off their communist governments : Solidarity swept into power in Poland in June 1989 ; Hungary opened its border with Austria in September ; and the Berlin Wall was toppled in November . Eastern Europe was rapidly escaping Moscow's orbit , although it seemed possible , even at this late stage , that the U.S.S.R. might be preserved . Gorbachev's attempts at top-down reform , however , had been too ambitious from a political standpoint and not ambitious enough economically . Shortages and rationing reached levels not seen since Stalin ' s day , and Russia began to assert its sovereignty over that of the Soviet state . In a final violent spasm , Soviet troops killed more than a dozen civilian protesters in Vilnius , Lithuania , in January 1991 . The willingness of these troops to fire on civilians led those at the top level of the military , the KGB , and the Communist Party to assume that similar methods could be used in Moscow . They were wrong . An attempted coup against Gorbachev in August 1991 failed spectacularly when dispirited Russian troops refused to move against fellow Russians . Although Gorbachev remained in power , a fatal blow had been dealt to the Soviet state , and within months both he and it would be relegated to the annals of history .	0

1457	"Artist impression of the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft releasing its impactor towards comet Tempel-1 in July 2005 . The flyby spacecraft has been re-christened EPOXI and will begin its new assignment to hunt for super-Earth exoplanets . Image : NASA . EPOXI is a combination of two separate science investigations , one consisting of the Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterisation ( EPOCh ) and the other of the flyby of comet Hartley-2 , planned for 2010 , called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation ( DIXI ) , which follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Deep Impact mission in July 2005 which revealed in unprecedented detail the surface of a comet and the effects of impact into such a finely powdered surface . For the majority of May , EPOXI was trained on the red dwarf star GJ436 , 32 light years from Earth . This star has a Neptune sized planet circling it every 20 to 30 days in an unusually eccentric orbit . "" Tidal forces from the star should have made the orbit circular , unless there is another planet whose gravitational tug pulls the orbit into an oval shape , "" says Drake Deming , EPOXI's Deputy Principal Investigator . "" If that second planet lies in the same orbital plane as the Neptune-sized planet then we should see it transit . The transit would be too shallow to be spotted by ground-based telescopes , and EPOXI is the only space mission that can look at GJ436 nearly continuously for several weeks . "" Deming and his team are in the process of analysing the results of these data . In addition to targeting the red dwarf star , EPOXI imaged the Earth over three 24-hour periods , measuring its rotational light curve at visible wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared . These observations will help to calibrate future observations of Earthlike exoplanets . EPOXI obtained a particularly interesting view of the Earth on May 29 , when the Moon passed in front of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft . Transit events such as this will help planetary scientists to deduce the nature and composition of exoplanetary systems . Deep Impact captured this beautiful image of the impact into Comet Tempel-1 three summers ago . Dust and gas streaming from the point of impact is lit up in the impact flash . Image : NASA ."	8

630	"Story 2 - Taking a GAP year after being rejected This person decided to remain anonymous but wanted to tell their story to let people know taking a forced gap year can be a ' blessing in disguise ' ... In my previous application , I was n't 100 % certain that I really wanted to study medicine , and I was n't fully prepared . I think this showed in my PS ( personal statement ) . As the year went on , I was able to confirm that medicine is what I really want to do . Last year , I applied to 4 med schools with no backup choices . I was rejected after 2 interviews ( I was put on a waiting list at one ) . Obviously I was disappointed , but it did n't come as a surprise . I started to make plans for the next round , and by May , I was looking for jobs on the NHS website and it took about 4 months to find what I wanted to do - porter at my local hospital . ( This takes time so do n't leave it until the summer holidays ! ) I also started to look for GAP year medical volunteering opportunities abroad . Once I finished school , I started to volunteer at my local old people's home , 2 or 3 times a week , and I also started working for the NHS . My PS was more interesting the second time around , because I had more to write about . This time , I chose 3 different UNIs from my previous application , but I put down 1 UNI that I was rejected from last year , after interview . This was mentioned at my interview this time , and I was able to explain what I had been doing in my GAP year and what I was intending to do for the remainder of my GAP year . I also put down two back-up choices . I ended up with 4 offers after 3 interviews for medicine , and 1 offer for physiology . I withdrew from the last option ( another physiology course ) because they were taking too long to decide . This "" forced gap year "" has been a blessing in disguise for me ( except for the increase in the fees , of course ) . For one , I am now sure about my choice of course . Plus , I really enjoyed working as a porter in the NHS , and the extra cash that I 've saved up will be useful when I start Uni . So all in all , I 'm very pleased with the outcome . My advice would be to make the most of your GAP year by working or volunteering in medical environment , to strengthen your PS , but mainly , to make sure that medicine is what you really want to do . I am sure that you will be a stronger candidate the second time around , so best of luck to everyone !"	1

The more active you are , the more energy you need from food . The energy food gives you is measured in calories . Hector says : "" If we eat more food than we need to make energy , the extra food turns to fat and this is stored in our bodies . "" Children are much smaller than adults but they are usually very active and still growing . They usually need between 1000 and 2000 calories every day .

1092	Normalizing Flows on Riemannian Manifolds arXiv : 1611 . 02304v1 [ stat . ML ] 7 Nov 2016 Mevlana C. Gemici Google DeepMind mevlana@google.com Danilo J. Rezende Google DeepMind danilor@google.com Shakir Mohamed Google DeepMind shakir@google.com Abstract We consider the problem of density estimation on Riemannian manifolds . Density estimation on manifolds has many applications in fluid-mechanics , optics and plasma physics and it appears often when dealing with angular variables ( such as used in protein folding , robot limbs , gene-expression ) and in general directional statistics . In spite of the multitude of algorithms available for density estimation in the Euclidean spaces Rn that scale to large n ( e.g. normalizing flows , kernel methods and variational approximations ) , most of these methods are not immediately suitable for density estimation in more general Riemannian manifolds . We revisit techniques related to homeomorphisms from differential geometry for projecting densities to sub-manifolds and use it to generalize the idea of normalizing flows to more general Riemannian manifolds . The resulting algorithm is scalable , simple to implement and suitable for use with automatic differentiation . We demonstrate concrete examples of this method on the n-sphere Sn . In recent years , there has been much interest in applying variational inference techniques to learning large scale probabilistic models in various domains , such as images and text [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . One of the main issues in variational inference is finding the best approximation to an intractable posterior distribution of interest by searching through a class of known probability distributions . The class of approximations used is often limited , e.g. , mean-field approximations , implying that no solution is ever able to resemble the true posterior distribution . This is a widely raised objection to variational methods , in that unlike MCMC , the true posterior distribution may not be recovered even in the asymptotic regime . To address this problem , recent work on Normalizing Flows [ 7 ] , Inverse Autoregressive Flows [ 8 ] , and others [ 9 , 10 ] ( referred collectively as normalizing flows ) , focused on developing scalable methods of constructing arbitrarily complex and flexible approximate posteriors from simple distributions using transformations parameterized by neural networks , which gives these models universal approximation capability in the asymptotic regime . In all of these works , the distributions of interest are restricted to be defined over high dimensional Euclidean spaces . There are many other distributions defined over special homeomorphisms of Euclidean spaces that are of interest in statistics , such as Beta and Dirichlet ( n-Simplex ) ; Norm-Truncated Gaussian ( n-Ball ) ; Wrapped Cauchy and Von-Misses Fisher ( n-Sphere ) , which find little applicability in variational inference with large scale probabilistic models due to the limitations related to density complexity and gradient computation [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] . Many such distributions are unimodal and generating complicated distributions from them would require creating mixture densities or using auxiliary random variables . Mixture methods require further knowledge or tuning , e.g. number of mixture components necessary , and a heavy computational burden on the gradient computation in general , e.g. with quantile functions [ 15 ] . Further , mode complexity increases only linearly with mixtures as opposed to exponential increase with normalizing flows . Conditioning on auxiliary variables [ 16 ] on the other hand constrains the use of the created distribution , due to the need for integrating out the auxiliary factors in certain scenarios . In all of these methods , computation of low-variance gradients is difficult due to the fact that simulation of random variables can not be in general reparameterized ( e.g. rejection sampling [ 17 ] ) . In this work , we present methods that generalizes previous work on improving variational inference in Rn using normalizing flows to Riemannian manifolds of interest such as spheres Sn , tori Tn and their product topologies with Rn , like infinite cylinders . Figure 1 : Left : Construction of a complex density on Sn by first projecting the manifold to Rn , transforming the density and projecting it back to Sn . Right : Illustration of transformed ( S2 → R2 ) densities corresponding to an uniform density on the sphere . Blue : empirical density ( obtained by Monte Carlo ) ; Red : Analytical density from equation ( 4 ) ; Green : Density computed ignoring the intrinsic dimensionality of Sn . These special manifolds M ⊂ Rm are homeomorphic to the Euclidean space Rn where n corresponds to the dimensionality of the tangent space of M at each point . A homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces with a continuous inverse ( bijective and bicontinuous ) . It maps point in one space to the other in a unique and continuous manner . An example manifold is the unit 2-sphere , the surface of a unit ball , which is embedded in R3 and homeomorphic to R2 ( see Figure 1 ) . In normalizing flows , the main result of differential geometry that is used for computing the density updates is given by , d ~ x = | det Jφ | d ~ u and represents the relationship between differentials ( infinitesimal volumes ) between two equidimensional Euclidean spaces using the Jacobian of the function φ : Rn → Rn that transforms one space to the other . This result only applies to transforms that preserve the dimensionality . However , transforms that map an embedded manifold to its intrinsic Euclidean space , do not preserve the dimensionality of the points and the result above become obsolete . Jacobian of such transforms φ : Rn → Rm with m > n are rectangular and an infinitesimal cube on Rn maps to an infinitesimal parallelepiped on the manifold . The relation between these √ volumes is given by d ~ x = det G d ~ u , where G = JφT Jφ is the metric induced by the embedding φ on the tangent space Tx M , [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] . The correct formula for computing the density over M now becomes : Z Z ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) f ( ~ x ) d ~ x = M ⊂ Rm √ Z ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) det G d ~ u = Rn Rn q det JφT Jφ d ~ u ( 1 ) The density update going from the manifold to the Euclidian space , ~ x ∈ Sn → ~ u ∈ Rn , is then given by : q q p ( ~ u ) = ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) det JφT Jφ ( ~ u ) = f ( ~ x ) det JφT Jφ ( φ − 1 ( ~ x )) ( 2 ) As an application of this method on the n-sphere Sn , we introduce Inverse Stereographic Transform and define it as : φ ( u ) : Rn → Sn ⊂ Rn + 1 , 2u / ( uT u + 1 ) ~ x = φ ( ~ u ) = ( 3 ) 1 − 2 / ( uT u + 1 ) which maps Rn to Sn in a bijective and bicontinuous manner . The determinant of the metric G ( x ) associated with this transformation is given by : 2n 2 T ( 4 ) det G = det Jφ ( x ) Jφ ( x ) = xT x + 1 Using these formulae , on the left side of Figure 1 , we map a uniform density on S2 to R2 , enrich this density , using e.g. normalizing flows , and then map it back onto S2 to obtain a multi-modal ( or arbitrarily complex ) density on the original sphere . On qthe right side of Figure 1 , we show that the density update based on the Riemannian metric , i.e. det JφT Jφ ( red ) , is correct and closely follows the kernel density estimate based on 500k samples ( blue ) . We also show that using the generic volume transformation formulation for dimensionality preserving transforms , i.e. | det Jφ | ( green ) , leads to an erroneous density and do not resemble the empirical distributions of samples after the transformation . 2 References [ 1 ] D.

1411	What Teeth Do Kids Lose and When ? If all your kids want for Christmas ( or Halloween , or Easter ) is their two front teeth , chances are , they 're about six years old . While the timing and order of losing teeth varies , there are a few basics you should know about what teeth kids lose – and when . There may be a few exceptions , but for the most part , kids lose teeth in the order that they received them in the first place . If you remember taking photos of little Tommy's first tooth , you may already have a pretty good idea of which baby tooth will be the first to go . For most kids , the first baby teeth lost are the lower central incisors and the upper central incisors . These , for the non-dental world , are known as the two upper front teeth and the two lower front teeth . While the incisors will fall out around six to seven years of age , you may be wondering the timing of the other teeth . The other teeth , including the first and second molars , will fall out by age 11 or twelve . What Teeth do Kids Lose ? Well , all of them – all of their baby teeth , that is . Kids get 20 baby teeth , starting from infancy . Most kids will have all 20 baby teeth by the time they 're three years old . And once those choppers are in , you may wonder how important it is to properly care for these temporary residents . Answer – pretty important ! Even though you know what teeth your kids will lose , there are some compelling reasons for keeping those baby teeth in ship-shape . Improper care of baby teeth can lead to gum disease , jaw and teeth spacing issues , and even painful chewing , which may create poor nutritional habits . When it 's time for the baby teeth to drop out , make sure your kids ( or you ! ) do n't yank them out prematurely . While it 's okay to gently wobble and loosen a loose tooth , yanking one out before it 's ready to go can lead to root infection . Got any questions about baby teeth ? Give us a call today ! Unless , of course , you 're asking about the tooth fairy , in which case we 've been sworn to secrecy !	7
864	Despite the Iraq precedent , the odds are against a US attack on Iran any time soon . Philip Gordon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Allies at War : America , Europe and the Crisis over Iraq Other articles in the Prospect online symposium on the Iranian nuclear crisis : Mark Fitzpatrick examines Iran's nuclear process Michael Rubin argues that diplomacy is not enough Alastair Crooke says that the west are trampling over Iran's rights Nazenin Ansari suggests that the Iranian state may be susceptible to sanctions Esther Herman on her encounters with everyday Iranians As I discovered on a recent trip to London , it 's not easy for an American these days to convince his European colleagues that the US is unlikely to attack Iran's nuclear sites any time soon . Given the Iraq precedent , and with senior US officials now regularly coming forward with similarly dire warnings about the Iranian threat , Europeans are understandably inclined to believe reports such as those recently published by Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker that Washington is getting ready to bomb Iran , possibly even with tactical nuclear weapons . It would be foolish to take these concerns lightly . President Bush has vowed never to ' permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons , ' and he has proven to be a leader willing to implement his threats even in the face of considerable international and domestic opposition . He may be convinced that only he has the courage to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat and that only an American military attack can reliably do so once diplomatic efforts have been tried and failed . With presumed Democratic presidential candidates like Senators Hilary Clinton and Evan Bayh already attacking the administration for its failure to do anything about Iran , and the increasingly unpopular Republican party in need of a boost , the politics of the 2008 presidential election might also push America in the direction of a military confrontation with Iran . But I do n't think so . When all the political and strategic pros and cons of an American military strike on Iran are taken into account , there is good reason to believe that the US will stick to diplomacy even as Iran continues what looks like an inexorable march toward a nuclear-weapons capability . What is striking about the US approach is not the degree to which Washington is eschewing diplomacy in favour of military force , but the opposite . During Bush's first term , the administration criticised European engagement with Iran , predicted that the ' EU-3 ' approach of Britain , France and Germany would fail , and insisted that it would not ' reward bad behaviour ' by dealing with the Iranians . Since then , however , the approach has changed entirely . In March 2005 , Bush announced that the US would support the EU-3 , and even throw some of its own ' carrots' aeroplane spare parts and support for World Trade Organisation accession negotiations with Iran into the mix . More recently , the administration has patiently worked with the IAEA and the UN security council , agreed to support a Russian offer to enrich uranium on Iran's behalf , and now even announced that it is ready to negotiate directly with Tehran if it suspends uranium enrichment . This is a dramatic departure from its earlier insistence that talks with Iran would legitimise the regime . Bush's declaration , in his 2006 state of the union address , that the US would ' continue to rally the world ' to confront the Iranian threat was a far cry from earlier suggestions of how the US might deal with a charter member of the ' axis of evil . ' It is true , of course , that the current emphasis on diplomacy could be a set-up , designed to help justify a later resort to military force . On Iraq , after all , the US also went through the motions of diplomacy for more than a year before it sent in the troops . But there is a key difference . In the case of Iraq , as was already clear at the time , many influential Americans were certain that an invasion would be easy , successful , and a step toward a safer world , and thus actually preferred the use of force to a diplomatic ' success . ' On Iran , I know of almost no one who denies that an attack would have serious negative consequences and who sees it as anything other than a last resort . Clearly , there are people in the administration who would ultimately pull the trigger if an Iranian bomb seemed inevitable , but there is no parallel to the Iraqi case in which many were hoping and even working for diplomatic failure in order to pave the way to war . Moreover , just as it 's possible that the diplomatic approach is only being conducted to make the military strike viable , it is conversely possible that the hawkish rhetoric is being deployed to help make the diplomacy work . Insisting that ' all options are on the table ' is a useful way of making Iranians think carefully about how badly they want nuclear weapons . If you really want to know why the US is unlikely to attack Iran , however , just consider the final Oval Office set of briefings President Bush would receive before making the decision to attack . From the CIA : ' Mr President , we can not tell you with certainty how far along the Iranians are towards a bomb , nor can we tell you where all the key nuclear facilities are . We know they convert uranium ore to nuclear fuel at Esfahan , that they enrich uranium at Natanz and that they are building a heavy-water research reactor at Arak . But there may well be dozens of other secret facilities scattered around the country we do n't know about . We do n't have good sources in Iran , and we did n't even know about these sites until Iranian dissidents told us about them in 2002 . Our best estimate , in any case , is that Iran will not be able to produce a bomb for at least five years . ' From the military : ' Mr President , we can certainly do serious damage to Iran's known nuclear facilities . The above-ground targets are easy to hit , and even the buried centrifuge facilities at Natanz reportedly about 30 feet underground and covered by at least 10 feet of concrete can probably be destroyed with our GBU-28 ' bunker-busters . ' But we might have to strike it many times or possibly even consider using tactical nuclear weapons to be certain . Moreover , to do this job right , we 'd need to hit dozens of different facilities scattered around the country , many of which are in built-up civilian areas and / or protected by air-defence sites that would have to be destroyed . So there would be considerable collateral damage . ' From the state department : ' Mr President , we would have almost no international support for an attack on Iran and our image throughout the world especially the Muslim world would be seriously damaged . But the real problem would be Iran's potential retaliation . This would almost certainly include efforts to destabilise Iraq and Afghanistan ( including attacks on our 150,000 troops in those two places ) , support for terrorist attacks against US citizens and interests and threats to the free passage of oil through the straits of Hormuz . We must also recognise that an attack would likely strengthen Iranian extremists and undermine reformers , that any setback to the program would likely only be temporary , and that any debate within Iran about the utility of a nuclear weapons programme would end . From domestic political advisers : ' Mr President , unlike three years ago on Iraq , we would not have widespread public support , and there is almost no chance that we could get a congressional resolution supporting the use of force . So you and the Republican party would have to accept full political responsibility for what comes next . And by the way , oil would probably shoot up to over $ 100 per barrel . ' Under these circumstances , does the president say , ' Thank you for your briefings . But I 'm going to do it anyway ' ? Anything is possible , and maybe Bush agrees with John McCain's assertion that the only thing worse than exercising the military option on Iran is a nuclear-armed Iran . But I would n't bet on it . Although it is unlikely to deploy military force , Washington will not quietly acquiesce to an Iranian nuclear weapon , nor should it . One of the greatest benefits of Bush's decision to pursue diplomacy and back the EU-3 approach on Iran has been that it is now Iran that is isolated and blamed for the current crisis , not the US . British , French and German leaders , long suspected of being soft on Tehran , are now themselves fed up with Iranian obfuscation and belligerence , and will find it hard not to go along with at least some form of sanction if Iran continues to rebuff the international community . With an Iranian bomb still years away , the administration will have time to continue to work to persuade not only the Europeans but also China , Russia , India and Japan none of whom want to see an Iranian bomb to isolate Iran politically and economically unless it gives up its nuclear weapons ambitions . Despite Iran's apparent determination to develop its nuclear programme , such efforts are not hopeless , and international agreement to deny Iran the investment , technology , weapons and income it badly needs would certainly have an effect on Tehran's cost-benefit analysis . If , on the other hand , America's allies decide that even economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation are too much to ask for in the effort to bring Iran back to the table , then Bush's options will in effect be reduced to a very clear choice between doing nothing and bombing Iran . I still do n't think he 'd want to do the latter , but America's allies and counterparts on the security council ought at least to realise that refusing to support sanctions on Iran would be the best way to find out .	0
189	Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women Twenty-seventh session 3-21 June 2002 Item 5 of the provisional agenda * Implementation of article 21 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Report provided by specialized agencies of the United Nations on the implementation of the Convention in areas falling within the scope of their activities ** The document was submitted late to the conference services without the explanation required under paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 53 / 208 B , by which the Assembly decided that , if a report is submitted late , the reason should be included in a footnote to the document . Note by the Secretary-General ** Addendum World Health Organization On behalf of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women , on 17 April 2002 , the Secretariat invited the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to submit to the Committee a report on information provided by States to WHO on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , in areas falling within the scope of its activities , which would supplement the information contained in the reports of the States parties to the Convention to be considered at the twenty-seventh session . Other information sought by the Committee refers to activities , programmes and policy decisions undertaken by WHO to promote the implementation of the Convention . The report annexed hereto has been submitted in compliance with the Committee's request . Annex Report of the World Health Organization to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women at its twenty-seventh session Comments on the health of women in States parties presenting initial reports : the Congo , Saint Kitts and Nevis , and Suriname Introduction Women's health is an issue given some prominence both directly and indirectly in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the potential negative effects of discrimination on the health of women is a theme that appears in various places . Article 12 explicitly sets forth the obligation of States Parties to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure , on a basis of equality of men and women , access to health-care services , including those related to family planning . Other articles strengthen and broaden this article , calling for the elimination of discrimination against women in a number of health-related fields , for example , articles 10 ( education ) , 14 ( rural women ) and 16 ( marriage and family relations ) . The General Recommendations , likewise , have expanded and specified other issues which the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) also believes it is important to monitor for discrimination and which are related to health , for example , Nos. 12 ( 1989 ) and 19 ( 1992 ) on violence against women , No. 14 ( 1990 ) on female circumcision , No. 15 ( 1990 ) on avoidance of discrimination against women in national strategies for the prevention and control of AIDS , No. 18 ( 1991 ) on disabled women and No. 24 ( 1999 ) , the Committee's most extensive comments on women's health . General Recommendation No. 24 , completely related to health , is of particular importance . This recommendation places the health of women in a comprehensive framework and takes a lifespan approach , recognizing the importance of the age-specific needs of women at various points throughout life . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is pleased to submit this report with information which may complement the reports of States parties and draw attention to some issues related to women's health that may merit the special attention of the Committee . Information for each country is grouped under various headings – basic data , children , adolescents , women , older women and conclusions – selecting , in each case , information particularly relevant to the health of women of all ages . It is to be regretted that data on a number of issues important to the health of women , particularly poor women , tends to be inadequate or absent altogether from much of the standard published information about women in many countries . For example , • While WHO and a number of other United Nations agencies are deeply concerned about the issues of trafficking in women and children and there are suggestions it may be an important issue to some of the countries reporting to CEDAW , there is little systematic country-specific information available about either the volume or the threats to the health and well-being of women who are victims of trafficking ; • Two other important issues which are underrepresented are the overall incidence , impact and male-female distribution of child labour and occupation-related health problems of women in both formal and informal work settings ; • Data is scarce on women with disabilities and other women who live or work under circumstances that place them at particularly high risk of disease or disability , such as , inter alia , migrant workers , refugees and other socially displaced women , and sex workers . These are issues which could usefully be raised in connection with every country . Finally , it would be extremely useful if the Committee should wish to emphasize the importance of women's health beyond the long-standing concern with reproductive health . For example , many countries have little systematic disaggregated data available on women's health issues such as : • Communicable diseases , including malaria and tuberculosis ; • Cardiovascular diseases ( increasingly important as killers of women ) ; • Mental health problems ; • Lifestyle-related disability and death including substance abuse ( smoking and alcohol ) ; • Osteo-arthritis , auto-immune diseases and others which are particularly important as contributors to disability and death of older women . WHO , as a member of the United Nations system , takes the CEDAW reporting process seriously and considers it to be an important opportunity to strengthen work related to women's health . With a view to strengthening this work , the Department of Gender and Women's Health of WHO is preparing a publication intended to help staff working with counterpart Governments in the preparation of the health aspects of the country report to the Committee . The document has been developed with input from all WHO regional offices and technical departments and in collaboration with Rights and Humanity . It is hoped the members of CEDAW will also provide input to the draft during the twenty-seventh session . The Congo General The Congo ( Brazzaville ) has a total population of 3 million people1 and a population growth rate of 3.1 per cent . 2 The population is almost equally divided between women and men , with the women making up 51 per cent of the total . Life expectancy at birth is comparatively low . However , as in many other countries , women have longer life expectancy ( 53 years ) than men ( only 50 years ) . 3 The majority of the people of the Congo live in urban areas ( an estimated 65.4 per cent in 2000 ) . 4 The urban population growth rate for 2000-2005 was estimated to be 3.96 per cent per year , slightly lower than the regional ( Middle Africa ) figure of 4.40 per cent per year for the same period . 5 According to World Bank figures , the Congo falls in the low income category . 6 In 1999 , the gross national product per capita was US $ 670.7 Total expenditure on health in 1998 was estimated to be 3 per cent of the gross domestic product , slightly higher than in 1997.8 The overall situation of the Congo is challenging in terms of health and all aspects of human development . This fact was commented upon in some detail in the concluding observations of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 9 Civil war led to massive population displacement as well as the disruption of the national economy and the production and marketing of food . This had a profound , negative impact on the situation of daily life . Health and health systems , likewise , have been affected . Children Nearly half of the population of the Congo ( 46 . 3 per cent ) is under 15 years of age . 10 Almost one quarter ( 23 per cent ) are adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19.11 The infant mortality rate ( probability of an infant dying before 1 year of age ) is 87.2 per 1,000 live births for girls and 100 for boys . 12 The child mortality rate ( probability of a child dying before reaching his or her fifth birthday ) is estimated to be 122 for girls and 134 for boys . 13 For children who survive , problems of health and nutrition continue and are serious . Malnutrition runs high , immunization coverage is low and the impact of AIDS is increasing . The proportion of children below 5 years of age suffering from wasting is about the same as the regional average of 10 per cent . 14 However , 45 per cent suffer from moderate and severe stunting , 8 points higher than the regional levels and 13 points higher than the world levels . 15 Immunization levels reach only 50 per cent or lower . Unfortunately , neither nutrition nor immunization figures offer data disaggregated by sex . Table 1 Child immunization rates in the Congo , 1995 and 200016 HIV / AIDS is having a devastating impact both directly and indirectly on the children of the Congo . At the end of 1999 , 4,000 children below 15 years of age were living with HIV and 35,103 had been orphaned by the epidemic , losing either their mother or both parents to AIDS . 17 One must assume that the numbers have increased significantly since then . Comment These data have important implications for national policy as well as for the design and development of public services , particularly in fields such as education and health . With little disaggregated data available it is difficult to know whether there are problems of particular seriousness for girls as contrasted with boys . The Committee may therefore wish to emphasize to the representatives of the Congo the importance of ensuring equity and equality in the promotion of child health and the necessary infrastructure . The impact of stunting , now affecting 45 per cent of the children under 5 , is lifelong and can be irreversible . Similarly , the low immunization levels mean that the majority of Congolese children are exposed to avoidable and , in some cases , fatal disease and disability . The cost of these low immunization rates is high for both the individual and the nation in premature death and loss of dignity and productivity through lifelong disability . In view of this fact , any discussion of health should emphasize the urgency of appropriate management of health and nutrition in the early years of a child's life , both male and female . Adolescents In the field of health , early pregnancy and HIV / AIDS are the two most conspicuous issues about which there is solid data indicating the need for attention and action . During the period 1995-2000 , there were 141 births per 1,000 females from 15 to19 years of age , 18 about the same as the regional figures ( 143 per 1,000 ) 19 but considerably higher than desirable in terms of the health and development of both the mothers and the children . Figures are not available on adolescents with HIV , but it is noteworthy that in the 15 to 24 age group , an estimated 6.5 per cent of girls / women are HIV positive , while only 3.2 per cent of boys / men are so . 20 The data on teen pregnancy , HIV infection and disparity in rates of infection between boys and girls all demonstrate the urgency of action to improve the availability of and access to appropriate health information and services , particularly addressing the reproductive health needs of adolescent girls . Bearing in mind that the gross secondary school enrolment ratio of girls is only 45 per cent , 21 such action would need to be focused on mapping the activity of adolescent girls to determine where and how best to reach them and help them to be empowered to take appropriate measures . The issue of the impact of civil war and its effect on many aspects of life has been highlighted in discussions of the Committee on Social , Economic and Cultural Rights . Related to this , an additional issue relevant to the health of adolescent girls in the Congo is the question of their involvement in past or present military activity as combatants or part of the support system for combatants . Unfortunately , there is little relevant hard data available . Comment Threats to the health of adolescent girls are many , but among the most serious are those related to sexual and reproductive health and behaviour . Data related to teen pregnancy and HIV infection suggests that gender-prescribed roles place girls at disproportionate risk of pregnancy and ill health and leave them little latitude to protect themselves . In this connection and in line with paragraph 18 of General Recommendation No. 24,22 the Committee may wish to pursue discussion with the representatives of the Congo , focusing on availability of gender and age-specific reproductive health information and services . Activity to promote the evolution and acceptance of more equitable and balanced relations between the sexes could contribute to the effectiveness of such programmes . In line with the stipulations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the healthy development of girls , all involvement of girls in military activity should be firmly discouraged . The Committee may therefore wish to explore the availability of programmes of rehabilitation and efforts to prevent the involvement of girls in military or quasi-military activity which may be damaging to their mental or physical health and development . Women Women share with the whole community the burdens resulting from life under conditions of poverty , insecurity , civil war and social disruption . Women are , in fact , disproportionately affected by all these conditions , which place their mental and physical health at great risk . Reports of both the Human Rights Commission and the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights have called attention to widespread problems of domestic violence , women's victimization by armed men , serious disruptions of food production and the paucity of health services in both urban and rural areas . All of these must be assumed to contribute to the generally high fertility rates ( 6 . 3 for the Congo in 200023 as compared with a global level of 2.68 ) 24 and low levels of health among women . However , specific data is seriously limited . Added to this already difficult situation , HIV / AIDS is moving rapidly through the population . At the end of 1999 , it was estimated that 6.43 per cent of the population was infected , 45,000 women and 37,000 men . 25 Women at risk of special health problems are those among the population of concern ( refugees , asylum-seekers and returned refugees ) . As of the end of 1999 , they totalled more than 63,000 ( 53 . 8 per cent of the total population of concern ) . 26 Comment Serious attention is needed to find ways progressively to address the special health risks , needs and vulnerabilities of women in the Congo , both in the general population and in refugee and other temporary living situations . Wherever they are located , the women are entitled to reasonable access to basic health information and services and adequate protection to ensure preservation of their dignity and their physical integrity . The Committee may , therefore wish to enquire about both immediate and longer-term plans to carry out programmes and build community-based infrastructure and the necessary support systems to ensure that the women of the Congo have access to increasingly effective health services in accordance with standards set forth in the General Recommendation on health . Given the extreme hardships that much of the population has undergone in recent years , it would be important to ensure inclusion of the views of the women themselves in the design , priority-setting and development of health services . Saint Kitts and Nevis Statistics on Saint Kitts and Nevis are not easy to come by and the country report had not yet been posted on the Internet at the time the present report was written . Because of this , the following analysis is limited in detail and only a few issues are raised for the consideration of the Committee . General Saint Kitts and Nevis has a total population of 38,000 people27 and , during the decade 1990-2000 , had a negative population growth rate ( - 0 . 8 ) . 28 Sixty-six per cent of the people live in rural areas . 29 Life expectancy at birth is 72 years for women and 66.1 years for men . 30 The proportion of urban population to total population ( 34 . 1 per cent ) 31 is considerably lower in Saint Kitts and Nevis than in the rest of the Caribbean ( 63 per cent ) . 32 According to the World Bank , Saint Kitts and Nevis falls in the upper middle income category with an annual GNP per capita of $ 6 , 420 . 33 Children and adolescents Figures on both infant and child mortality reflect the biological advantage of girls over boys . The infant mortality rate is 17 for girls and 23 for boys ; 34 the child mortality rate is 22 for girls and 25 for boys . 35 Although , unfortunately , the data is not disaggregated for boys and girls , immunization rates are good : 99 to 100 per cent of the children are fully immunized by one year of age . 36 However , notwithstanding the relatively good economic circumstances of the country , nutritional levels , at least during the five-year period 1995-2000 , were not good in either absolute or relative terms ; they ran the same or higher than world levels and markedly higher than regional levels . Table 2 Prevalence of child malnutrition in Saint Kitts and Nevis ( Percentage of children under five years of age ) 37 Such high malnutrition levels must be a matter of concern . Comment The Committee may wish to encourage the State party to investigate the causes of malnutrition , giving particular attention to establishing if and what kind of differences there may be in the nutritional status of boys and girls and whether there are any discriminatory feeding patterns which negatively influence a girl's chances of being well nourished . Women Little data on specific health conditions of women in Saint Kitts and Nevis are generally published . There are , however , data on maternal mortality indicating the 1998 rate was 130 per 100,000 live births . 38 Comment In global terms , the maternal mortality rate is comparatively high . The Committee may therefore wish to enquire what factors led to this rate and the State party may be encouraged to take action to improve available services and information , including through community-based health services , with a view to improving this situation for women . The Committee may also wish to call attention to the special needs of older women and those with disabilities . Suriname General The population of Suriname totals 417,000 people , 39 almost equally divided between men and women ( women = 50.36 per cent ) . The annual population growth rate is 0.4 per cent . 40 Thirty-one per cent of the population is below the age of 15 years ( 127 , 200 people ) . 41 Nearly one quarter of the population ( 23 per cent ) is made up of adolescents from 10 to 19 years of age . 42 There is some difference in life expectancy at birth between women and men , with women expecting longer lives ( 73 . 5 years ) than men ( 68 years ) . 43 Nearly three quarters of the people of Suriname live in urban areas ( 74 . 2 per cent ) . 44 According to World Bank classifications , Suriname fell in the lower middle income group of nations in 2000.45 Although there is data in the public domain about health in Suriname , including information specifically about women's health , much of it refers to studies in a particular institution or locality . Much of it was also found to be six or more years old . For these reasons , it is hard to draw informed , overarching conclusions about the status , trends and challenges facing the people of Suriname in the field of women's health . These notes attempt to suggest areas of interest or concern but , of necessity , are limited in scope . Children and adolescents As is true in most of the world , infant mortality rates , the proportion of children who die before they reach the age of one , are different between girls and boys , with the situation being better for girls . The rate for girls is 19 per thousand live births ; for boys , it is 27 per thousand live births . 46 This is also the case for child mortality rates ( the proportion of children who die before reaching the age of 5 per thousand live births ) . The rate was 27 for girls and 29 for boys , 47 an improvement over 1997 when they were considerably higher ( respectively , 39 and boys 51 ) . 48 Unfortunately , good , comprehensive , disaggregated data on child nutrition seemed unavailable for Suriname . Data on education shows equity between girls and boys , with girls making up 49.5 per cent of the primary school students ( equal to their percentage of that age population ) . 49 General concerns about children have been well covered in the Suriname report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and in the concluding observations of the Committee . 50 Health-related issues of particular concern , which are rooted in discrimination , are violence and sexual exploitation of girls , beginning with young children and continuing into adolescence . While some variation exists among different ethnic communities , there is no question that HIV / AIDS is a serious problem that has an impact on children and older adolescents . The female-male distribution of HIV , particularly among adolescents and young adults , highlights the difficulty girls have protecting themselves . It is estimated ( 2001 ) that among the population from 15 to 24 years of age , 0.79 per cent of boys are HIV positive , while the corresponding figure for girls is 1.33 per cent , nearly twice that of boys . 51 At the end of 1999 , there were also 110 children below 15 years of age living with AIDS ( sex not reported ) . 52 Furthermore , 352 children had been orphaned by AIDS . 53 Although recent figures were hard to come by , it is likely that smoking is a serious and growing problem among girls . Already in 1987-1988 , smoking prevalence among young people from 10 to 19 years of age was estimated to be 12 per cent for girls and 36 per cent for boys . 54 If Suriname has followed patterns common elsewhere , the advertising industry will have actively targeted young people and those figures are likely to have grown significantly . Knowing that the process of addiction grows more quickly among young girls than boys , one must assume many of these girls will be lifelong smokers , with negative health effects accumulating throughout later years of life and , should the girls become pregnant , smoking will have a negative impact on the health of the baby they will bear . Comment Three issues of particular importance which would benefit from the Committee's attention are domestic violence , with particular attention to abuse , including sexual abuse of girls ; information , care and service related to HIV among adolescents , particularly adolescent girls ; and smoking . Activities are needed to encourage , particularly among younger adolescents , empowerment of girls , more sexual responsibility among boys and more equitable and mutually respectful relations . Such activity would have a positive impact in both the short and long run , including a positive intergenerational impact , as children are less likely to be raised in families affected by violence or the HIV pandemic . Additionally , the Committee may wish to encourage the State party to attempt regular nationwide updates of disaggregated data on issues such as nutrition , smoking and domestic violence as the basis for gender and situation analysis leading to interventions to promote and protect the health of young people . Women Access to health-care services among minority and poor women is limited , a negative factor related to women's health . Problems of access appear to stem from poverty , uneven distribution of service ( urban and interior areas ) and population . Gender-based violence is a serious problem , one which has been noted for at least the last decade , but progress in addressing it has been limited . A study carried out in 1990 found that 95 per cent of all sexual offences registered by the Emergency Department of the Academic Hospital were women : 20 per cent of the victims were below 10 years of age . 55 While the Government has taken modest steps to improve the official response to domestic violence , including some training for police , the availability of a social worker in some places , the coverage has been limited and girls and women of all ages continue to be subject to abuse . The women's movement has also been active and by the late 1990s some progress was reported . A police study ( 1996-1997 ) indicated some decline in violence , 56 although women were still victims in 76.7 per cent of the incidents of domestic violence reported in 1997.57 Debate , nonetheless , continues about the appropriateness of public policy entering an area of private relations such as domestic violence . This may slow official action in this field and permit continuing violence against women . HIV is an increasingly serious problem in Suriname . Problems of poverty and changes in some norms and values have contributed to an increase in prostitution . 58 Moreover , men's continuing decisive power over the use of condoms has meant that activity to control and treat sexually transmitted infections , including HIV , have had limited benefits for women . 59 In the late 1990s , the Dermatological Service indicated 1 in 5 street sex workers tested to be HIV positive . 60 The overall infection rate of adults was 1.26 per cent in 1999,61 considerably higher than the regional ( Latin America ) rate of 0.5 per cent in 2001.62 Exhibiting a pattern common to many parts of the world , among younger people from 18 to 25 years of age , the majority of those who are HIV positive are female , while among those over 25 years of age , more males are infected . 63 By the end of 1999 , women made up 33 per cent of all people aged 15 to 49 living with AIDS . 64 The maternal mortality ratio for Suriname was estimated to be 230 per 100,000 live births for the early 1990s , well below the global average of 400 per 100,000 live births . 65 A preliminary WHO analysis for 2000 suggests it is now much lower , around 112 per 100,000 live births . Nonetheless , given the fact that 98 per cent of deliveries are attended by trained health personnel , 66 further investigation would be in order as to the distribution and causes of maternal mortality as well as options for affordable , acceptable interventions to reduce that figure . Comment The multi-ethnic make-up of Suriname and unequal distribution of population complicate the implementation of public policy and the achievement of equity among women with regard to access and utilization of public services . Inequities in power relations between men and women also make maintenance of good health difficult for some women who are in relationships which place their sexual , mental and physical health at risk and leave them little recourse . The Committee may wish , therefore , to encourage the State party to give particular attention to the development and implementation of stronger public policy in these areas as well as to issues of equity in the accessibility and utilization of public services . Data and reports on HIV infections and domestic violence indicate continuing , unresolved challenges related to gender relations . It is regrettable that no recent data has been found on smoking among adolescents or adults . This has long-term health impacts and advertisers often capitalize on and reinforce negative gender stereotypes to promote their product . The Committee may therefore wish to encourage the State party to investigate and take action to monitor and control rigorously access to and use of smoking material . Nutrition and mental health are two other fields of considerable impact related to women's health and well-being on which little current data was found . Older women Women over 60 years of age make up 9 per cent of the female population of Suriname . 67 As elsewhere in the world , they outnumber men of the same age by a considerable number – there are 127 women for every 100 men 60 years of age or older and there are 132 women for every 100 men 80 years of age or older . 68 While most people have access to some form of health insurance , the elderly and the poor have suffered most from the country's economic problems , which have eroded the availability of services . Suriname is a country which has experienced a considerable outflow of population , especially those persons of productive age , and benefits from remittances and , sometimes , medicines sent home by family members employed abroad . Older women who do not have such networks , particularly those suffering from chronic diseases who need regular medical care or treatment , are particularly disadvantaged . 69 Comment The State party is to be congratulated on its efforts to have insurance coverage for its people . However , the Committee may wish to encourage special efforts in times of hardship to identify people , particularly older women and the poor , who may need priority support and attention .	9

162	"Good morning . How are you ? It 's been great , has n ' t it ? I 've been blown away by the whole thing . In fact , I 'm leaving . ( Laughter ) There have been three themes , have n ' t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what I want to talk about . One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we 've had and in all of the people here . Just the variety of it and the range of it . The second is that it 's put us in a place where we have no idea what 's going to happen , in terms of the future . No idea how this may play out . I have an interest in education -- actually , what I find is everybody has an interest in education . Do n't you ? I find this very interesting . If you 're at a dinner party , and you say you work in education -- actually , you 're not often at dinner parties , frankly , if you work in education . ( Laughter ) You 're not asked . And you 're never asked back , curiously . That 's strange to me . But if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , "" What do you do ? "" and you say you work in education , you can see the blood run from their face . They 're like , "" Oh my God , "" you know , "" Why me ? My one night out all week . "" ( Laughter ) But if you ask about their education , they pin you to the wall . Because it 's one of those things that goes deep with people , am I right ? Like religion , and money and other things . I have a big interest in education , and I think we all do . We have a huge vested interest in it , partly because it 's education that 's meant to take us into this future that we ca n ' t grasp . If you think of it , children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 . Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that 's been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years' time . And yet we 're meant to be educating them for it . So the unpredictability , I think , is extraordinary . And the third part of this is that we 've all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . I mean , Sirena last night was a marvel , was n ' t she ? Just seeing what she could do . And she 's exceptional , but I think she 's not , so to speak , exceptional in the whole of childhood . What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent . And my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents . And we squander them , pretty ruthlessly . So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity . My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status . ( Applause ) Thank you . That was it , by the way . Thank you very much . ( Laughter ) So , 15 minutes left . Well , I was born ... no . ( Laughter ) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson . She was six and she was at the back , drawing , and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention , and in this drawing lesson she did . The teacher was fascinated and she went over to her and she said , "" What are you drawing ? "" And the girl said , "" I 'm drawing a picture of God . "" And the teacher said , "" But nobody knows what God looks like . "" And the girl said , "" They will in a minute . "" ( Laughter ) When my son was four in England -- actually he was four everywhere , to be honest . ( Laughter ) If we 're being strict about it , wherever he went , he was four that year . He was in the Nativity play . Do you remember the story ? No , it was big . It was a big story . Mel Gibson did the sequel . You may have seen it : "" Nativity II . "" But James got the part of Joseph , which we were thrilled about . We considered this to be one of the lead parts . We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts : "" James Robinson IS Joseph ! "" ( Laughter ) He did n't have to speak , but you know the bit where the three kings come in . They come in bearing gifts , and they bring gold , frankincense and myrhh . This really happened . We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence , because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said , "" You OK with that ? "" And he said , "" Yeah , why ? Was that wrong ? "" They just switched , that was it . Anyway , the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , "" I bring you gold . "" And the second boy said , "" I bring you myrhh . "" And the third boy said , "" Frank sent this . "" ( Laughter ) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance . If they do n't know , they 'll have a go . Am I right ? They 're not frightened of being wrong . Now , I do n't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative . What we do know is , if you 're not prepared to be wrong , you 'll never come up with anything original . If you 're not prepared to be wrong . And by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity . They have become frightened of being wrong . And we run our companies like this , by the way . We stigmatize mistakes . And we 're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make . And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities . Picasso once said this . He said that all children are born artists . The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . I believe this passionately , that we do n't grow into creativity , we grow out of it . Or rather , we get educated out if it . So why is this ? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago . In fact , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles . So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was . ( Laughter ) Actually , we lived in a place called Snitterfield , just outside Stratford , which is where Shakespeare's father was born . Are you struck by a new thought ? I was . You do n't think of Shakespeare having a father , do you ? Do you ? Because you do n't think of Shakespeare being a child , do you ? Shakespeare being seven ? I never thought of it . I mean , he was seven at some point . He was in somebody's English class , was n ' t he ? How annoying would that be ? ( Laughter ) "" Must try harder . "" Being sent to bed by his dad , you know , to Shakespeare , "" Go to bed , now , "" to William Shakespeare , "" and put the pencil down . And stop speaking like that . It 's confusing everybody . "" ( Laughter ) Anyway , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles , and I just want to say a word about the transition , actually . My son did n't want to come . I 've got two kids . He 's 21 now ; my daughter's 16 . He did n't want to come to Los Angeles . He loved it , but he had a girlfriend in England . This was the love of his life , Sarah . He 'd known her for a month . Mind you , they 'd had their fourth anniversary , because it 's a long time when you 're 16 . Anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , "" I 'll never find another girl like Sarah . "" And we were rather pleased about that , frankly , because she was the main reason we were leaving the country . ( Laughter ) But something strikes you when you move to America and when you travel around the world : Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects . Every one . Does n ' t matter where you go . You 'd think it would be otherwise , but it is n't . At the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and the bottom are the arts . Everywhere on Earth . And in pretty much every system too , there 's a hierarchy within the arts . Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance . There is n't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics . Why ? Why not ? I think this is rather important . I think math is very important , but so is dance . Children dance all the time if they 're allowed to , we all do . We all have bodies , do n't we ? Did I miss a meeting ? ( Laughter ) Truthfully , what happens is , as children grow up , we start to educate them progressively from the waist up . And then we focus on their heads . And slightly to one side . If you were to visit education , as an alien , and say "" What 's it for , public education ? "" I think you 'd have to conclude -- if you look at the output , who really succeeds by this , who does everything that they should , who gets all the brownie points , who are the winners -- I think you 'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors . Is n't it ? They 're the people who come out the top . And I used to be one , so there . ( Laughter ) And I like university professors , but you know , we should n ' t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement . They 're just a form of life , another form of life . But they 're rather curious , and I say this out of affection for them . There 's something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them , but typically -- they live in their heads . They live up there , and slightly to one side . They 're disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way . They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads , do n't they ? ( Laughter ) It 's a way of getting their head to meetings . If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences , by the way , get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics , and pop into the discotheque on the final night . ( Laughter ) And there you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably , off the beat , waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it . Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability . And there 's a reason . The whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century . They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism . So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas . Number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top . So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . Is that right ? Do n't do music , you 're not going to be a musician ; do n't do art , you wo n ' t be an artist . Benign advice -- now , profoundly mistaken . The whole world is engulfed in a revolution . And the second is academic ability , which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence , because the universities designed the system in their image . If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance . And the consequence is that many highly talented , brilliant , creative people think they 're not , because the thing they were good at at school was n ' t valued , or was actually stigmatized . And I think we ca n ' t afford to go on that way . In the next 30 years , according to UNESCO , more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history . More people , and it 's the combination of all the things we 've talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work , and demography and the huge explosion in population . Suddenly , degrees are n ' t worth anything . Is n't that true ? When I was a student , if you had a degree , you had a job . If you did n't have a job it 's because you did n't want one . And I did n't want one , frankly . ( Laughter ) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games , because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA , and now you need a PhD for the other . It 's a process of academic inflation . And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet . We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence . We know three things about intelligence . One , it 's diverse . We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it . We think visually , we think in sound , we think kinesthetically . We think in abstract terms , we think in movement . Secondly , intelligence is dynamic . If you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive . The brain is n't divided into compartments . In fact , creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things . The brain is intentionally -- by the way , there 's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum . It 's thicker in women . Following off from Helen yesterday , I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking . Because you are , are n ' t you ? There 's a raft of research , but I know it from my personal life . If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often , thankfully . ( Laughter ) But you know , she 's doing -- no , she 's good at some things -- but if she 's cooking , you know , she 's dealing with people on the phone , she 's talking to the kids , she 's painting the ceiling , she 's doing open-heart surgery over here . If I 'm cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone 's on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed . I say , "" Terry , please , I 'm trying to fry an egg in here . Give me a break . "" ( Laughter ) Actually , you know that old philosophical thing , if a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it , did it happen ? Remember that old chestnut ? I saw a great t-shirt really recently which said , "" If a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? "" ( Laughter ) And the third thing about intelligence is , it 's distinct . I 'm doing a new book at the moment called "" Epiphany , "" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent . I 'm fascinated by how people got to be there . It 's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of , she 's called Gillian Lynne , have you heard of her ? Some have . She 's a choreographer and everybody knows her work . She did "" Cats , "" and "" Phantom of the Opera . "" She 's wonderful . I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet , in England , as you can see . Anyway , Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said , "" Gillian , how 'd you get to be a dancer ? "" And she said it was interesting , when she was at school , she was really hopeless . And the school , in the '30s , wrote to her parents and said , "" We think Gillian has a learning disorder . "" She could n ' t concentrate , she was fidgeting . I think now they 'd say she had ADHD . Would n ' t you ? But this was the 1930s , and ADHD had n ' t been invented at this point . It was n ' t an available condition . ( Laughter ) People were n ' t aware they could have that . Anyway , she went to see this specialist . So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on a chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school . And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people , her homework was always late , and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said , "" Gillian , I 've listened to all these things that your mother 's told me , and I need to speak to her privately . "" He said , "" Wait here , we 'll be back , we wo n ' t be very long . "" and they went and left her . But as they went out the room , he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk . And when they got out the room , he said to her mother , "" Just stand and watch her . "" And the minute they left the room , she said , she was on her feet , moving to the music . And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said , "" Mrs. Lynne , Gillian is n't sick , she 's a dancer . Take her to a dance school . "" I said , "" What happened ? "" She said , "" She did . I ca n ' t tell you how wonderful it was . We walked in this room and it was full of people like me . People who could n ' t sit still . People who had to move to think . "" Who had to move to think . They did ballet , they did tap , they did jazz , they did modern , they did contemporary . She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School , she became a soloist , she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet . She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber . She 's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history , she 's given pleasure to millions , and she 's a multi-millionaire . Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down . Now , I think ... ( Applause ) What I think it comes to is this : Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology , and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson . I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology , one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity . Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth : for a particular commodity . And for the future , it wo n ' t serve us . We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we 're educating our children . There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk , who said , "" If all the insects were to disappear from the earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end . If all human beings disappeared from the earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish . "" And he 's right . What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination . We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely , and that we avert some of the scenarios scenarios that we 've talked about . And the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are , and seeing our children for the hope that they are . And our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future . By the way -- we may not see this future , but they will . And our job is to help them make something of it . Thank you very much . </content"	0
501	"Several hundred people have been killed since September The United Kingdom has warned a UK company against recruiting mercenaries to work in Ivory Coast . Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said such an enterprise would seriously undermine the Ivorian peace process . He said he was gravely concerned at reports that Northbridge Services Group - a security company - was recruiting ex-servicemen from Britain , South Africa and France . But a release denied that they were a mercenary firm . "" This contract was to provide humanitarian support and increased governmental security "" , the statement said . Services the company website says it offers , includes demilitarisation of warring factions , mine clearance , and special forces to counter terrorists and narcotics .

588	"Posted : Sun Oct 20 , 2013 11 : 48 am Hi guys . It has been brought to my attention that some folks can not find sections 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 of ' the Age of Dusk . Instead of scouring the various forums and sub-forums this story has been pasted during its transition fromt he BL forums to the Bolthole , I have elected to simply re-post the missing sections in this thread . Additional Background Information 2 : The Greater Good drives on . By the dawn on the 61st Millennium , the Tau had truly learned their place in the great tumult of the galaxy . Spread across a thousand sectors , and hundreds of sept colonies and systems , the Tau were an industrial powerhouse of the like not seen in almost ten thousand years . Their technology had reached beyond what the original Tau , in their naive ignorance , believed was possible , and client races by the dozens have integrated into Tau culture ( with varying degrees of success . The Hu ' sta Gue ' Vesa Colonies of To ' Kann had become almost identical to most Sept worlds , filled with beautiful white cities and wondrous technologies , while the Kroot worlds remain semi-civilised auxiliaries , still on the fringes of society despite their ancient pedigree . ) The furious process of Terra-forming enacted throughout the second Age of Strife has worked in their favour ; while other cultures faltered and disintegrated , the Tau fashioned themselves into an ever harder force . Their cutting edge weaponry was awe-inspiring to behold ; it was noted during the protracted war with the Zaffian independent human league ( in 473 . M55 ) , how their newest gunships could move to fast and strike so lethally , entire battalions of foes were vanquished before the order to retaliate could be given , their armoured columns instantly shattered into molten slag by a hundred thousand simultaneous missile barrages , followed up by direct engagement by agile battlesuits who never seemed to miss . Yet , as we have seen , all this technology was painfully necessary simply for the Tau Meta-Empire to survive . In the Northern and Eastern sept clusters of the empire , and beyond , titanic forces were arrayed against them . A great silver tide threatened to drown them all , and undo their bitterly difficult expansion before it could be completed . The Necrons ( or the Mont ' Ka ' Vesa , as they were known by the Tau ) were at full gold mobilisation . Titanic spider constructs bestrode worlds , drinking them dry of life , before spewing green oblivion into their fleets . Endless tides of Necrons warriors and Immortals lived up to their undying titles ; the constructs repaired almost all damage , and those necrons truly destroyed were ripped from the very air , repaired by a million machines upon their tomb worlds , and spat back to another war front to fight again , all in the space of hours ! In early phases , the Tau lost hundreds of worlds to these terrors , entire planetary populations vanquished before they could be evacuated to safety . Billions died , and the Tau empire wept for these horrendous losses . The Water Caste propaganda machine had a pitifully easy task uniting their entire empire against this nightmare ; made all the simpler when even the most secure sept-dwelling Tau from the safest most peaceful septs , only had to look into the sky and notice that stars were vanishing from the skies before their own eyes . For this menace was not some petty dynast looking for land and a galaxy to rule . It was a force of utter oblivion , led by the personification of such nightmarish ideals ; the Nightbringer himself . Many times had the Tau mobilised full battlefleets of the new ' Avenger ' class warships and millions of Fire Caste warriors , to fight the Necrons in open war , only for a great black cloud to enter the system , and drink the local star dry . This doomed a system , and made defending such places pointless . Many were the solemn poems written at this time upon Elsy ' eir , about the terrible agonising decisions Sphere-Maintainence Commanders had to face by leaving so-called ' dark-septs ' to their doom . Yet , by 972 . M55 , the Tau had somewhat found a method of holding the darkness at arms length . Munitions were developed that burrowed into Necron constructs , and continually burned no matter how many times they were repaired . This forced Tomb Worlds to abandon seriously damaged Necrons and to build entire new Necron bodies for the consciousnesses stored in the nodal grid . This took time , and allowed Tau Sept colonies to summon aid through the immense waystation grid network . When Necron forces transported their swarming monoliths upon a planet or station , they found the Tau were ready with all the fearsome weaponry their Empire could fashion . Fighting in such wars , with such hideous and unthinkable powerful weapons was always a harrowing experience , and Earth Caste specialist hospitals were set up by the thousands to deal with the influx of battle-damaged and mentally scarred soldiers evacuated from such warzones . In many cases , these hospitals became euthanasia centres , due to the unnatural and sometimes impossible conditions of some soldiers . The things they saw could not be unseen , and their bodies and minds were consumed by the revelations that gnawed upon their very souls . The Tau had also made a grand alliance with their old foes , the diverse and fickle Thexian Trade Empire , which had also suffered painfully at the Necrons ' silvered hands . The Concord between the two great rivals was binding so long as the Necrons remained ' a credible and pressing danger to the survival of the overall galactic community ' . Little could the two factions realise how many thousands of years this would remain the case . One must also note that though the Thexian Elite did sign this treaty , many of their less controllable elements still cause problems in northern Sept districts , where the rule of the Tau is lax ... The great Necron wars affected a great many aspects of the Empire throughout its history . There was much desperation amongst the corporate leaders of the Grand Septs ( such as T ' au and Bork ' an in particular ) . New weapons and means of combating the silver dread were demanded at all times . In particular , the dreadful loss of life resulting from the war ( an attrition rate of almost 80 % throughout the years 387 . M54-999 . M57 ) was widely decried by most non-military elements of the Empire . Bork ' an made tentative attempts to develop pilot-less drone controlled Battlesuits for mass-production . However , such machines had slow reactions , and were generally deemed useless . Reluctantly , the secret projects which had de = populated the ancient world of N ' dras were ordered by the council of Aun ' Va to continue their old research into hyper-sophisticated drone processing and development . This led to the terrible events of the N ' dras conflagration in 555 . M57 , but we shall come back to this at some future date . However , before that date , the N ' drasian ' Cold-suits ' became an essential element in future Tau conflicts ; they could be deployed by the millions directly from Demiurg factory vessels , into combat . The distinctive blue-grey form of the N ' drasian XV333-78 combat battlesuits were far more slender and manoeuvrable than their predecessors due to their lack of a pilot . They could accelerate more quickly and were more agile , as they did n't risk the well-being of their occupants . Also , each suit could contain greater payloads and more weapons and more complex targeting systems , and had extensive sophisticated drone networking systems , allowing drones to become an extension of their own minds . What was more was that rather than being mere programs , the CPUs of the XV333's could actually think for themselves ; Artificial Intelligences . A whispered abomination in the old spluttering cultures of the Gue ' Vesa , the Tau did not fear these thinking machines . Their arrogance and ignorance would later serve as a warning to all . Beware the Ghost in the Machine ... On 397.893 . M58 , the single most important development in Tau culture and their wider society came to pass . It wa son this day , upon the world of Jaa ' Vorl , that a Tau child known to history as Kor-Pivin , was the first Tau to undergo experimental Earth Caste genetic tests . These long and gruelling tests had be begun barely seven kai ' rotaa ( each equivalent to 50 Terran Days ) previously , after reports across the empire spoke of strange Tau who could perceive the world in a way never before seen , and could even manipulate local physical constants to a minor degree . On some of the more far distant Sept colonies , such talents would often go unexplored , but the pattern began to reoccur within the more metropolitan sept worlds and sept-dominated colonies . Once the tests were completed , the results were revealed to the Earth caste much to their astonishment . They had confirmed the existence of the first ever Tau psyker . This information was of course withheld from the majority of Tau society for almost a hundred years . By the time the Ethereals had properly ' prepared ' society for this revelation , Vior ' la and several other military academies across the Empire had already performed their own hunts for psykers ( or ' vortex singularities ' as the Tau propaganda machine hurried to call them to avoid unpleasant associations with the destructive and insane warp-user strains of humanity , who had caused so much destruction of the millennia ) , and had gathered them together into secret breeding programs . In typical Tau fashion , these psykers began to be developed into a distinct caste , the M ' yen caste ( aptly translated as ' the unforeseen ' caste , as one could easily argue none amongst the Tau predicted such a development ) . Clad in strange purple robes , and utilising odd energy focussing crystals in their ornamentation and armaments , these figures became a strange and unsettling presence within Tau society . Most were hastily deployed to the eternal Necron front , bolstering the other psychic races of the grand alliance , who were essential in keeping the silver menace at bay . The rest were used by the Ethereals , to ensure the compliance and adoration of sept worlds and those living within them , to the Greater Good . The M ' yen ' Vre were the perfect tools for the Ethereals to enact their dominion over all living being beneath their united facade . And dissidents would give themselves away simply by thinking against the system . Such dissidents were taken from their homes and taken to re-education centres , where a combination of M ' yen hypnosis techniques and powerful chemical olfactory were employed to re-align the loyalties of the discordant elements . They returned to their home worlds speaking of the beautiful verdant lands they had visited , and how they had spoke personally to Aun ' Va , who told them the true meaning of the greater good . So far , not one of the re-educated citizens of the Empire has ever been known to re-offend . Such is the destiny of unity . On the western borders of the Tau Meta-Empire , things are rather different , throughout this period . Growing mobilisation on the eastern borders meant the Tau could not afford to supply these colonies and distant Septs with the latest technology and weaponry . On some worlds , they were even still using old devilfish chassis and gunship variants , as well as the old battlesuit designs . These colonies shared greater trading and cross-cultural exchange with outside societies than the very insular inner colonies of the Empire . Numerous human Imperiums and civilisations trading ideas and technology with these colonies , or , more often , would raid or make war upon these weaker Tau societies , thinking they were unable to defend themselves . Sometimes this was accurate ; most of the time it was not . Many were the foolish brigand-captains who , clad in their stolen finery and armed with pillaged vessels , who try to blast the Tau into submission . Their rail guns and Hero-class cruisers often demonstrated with defiant clarity just who was the real power in the area . The semi-independent Enclave known as the Farsighted Enclave , is a rare example of a truly independent Tau civilisation , completely distinct from their authoritarian neighbours . It is a bizarre feudal culture centred around archaic battlesuit-wearing Kasar-princes , who maintain personal armies and vie with one another for influence . There 's is a bastard culture of many different origins , which can only really unite when under threat by a faction more powerful than all of the princes combined . Such a foe reared its head in 222 . M53 . In this year , the outer waystations of the Enclave picked up the distinctive signature of a large battlefleet entering realspace from the warp . Accordingly , Kais ' Kasar ' Koilgu , the local Kasar-prince , gathered his forces and his battlefleet and thundered to intercept this fleet . Over the moon of Jubza , the two fleets met . The enemy fleet did n't even attempt to communicate with Koilgu . Instead , the vast fleet of boxy , bulky vessels , each distinctive and colourful in its livery and decoration , opened fire upon Koilgu's armada . The battle raged for days , until the flagship of the mysterious fleet fired boarding torpedoes directly into Koilgu's own command vessel . The Enclave Tau fought hard with pulse rifle and bloody-minded determination , but they were easily cut down by the arrogant giants who rampaged through the ship , accompanied by flocks of adoring human worshippers who fired lasguns and cried prayers to their masters . Eventually , the leader of the foe burst onto Koilgu's bridge . Koilgu was armoured in a beautifully maintained battlesuit , covered in honour markings and inscriptions of glory . Before him , God-Captain Flaegren , Astartes-Under Lord for the seventeenth crusade of Grand Sicarium stood in ornate power armour with glittering power fist , his shoulders swathed in a thick lion pelt , his head covered by ostentatious jewellery of the most garish kind . The two opulent and corrupt figures stared each other down for but an instant before the charged . Bolter and melta raged against plasma rifle and burst cannon , crackling power fist clattered against a sparking Mechanicus power glaive , granted to Koilgu by a captured Adept long ago . Though the battlesuit made Koilgu fiendishly strong , Flaegren was a veteran of almost a millennia of bloodshed and warfare . His skill was phenomenal , and the duel ended which the psychotic marine carving opn Koilgu's chassis , before having his sycophantic minions pour molten gold inside the suit with the screaming Tau still inside . Koilgu's gilded corpse was delivered to the Grand Kassar of the Enclave scant months later . The retainer who brought the grizly trophy to the Kassar arrogantly recited the God-Captain's message . "" Here is a valuable gift to the great Kassar of the Farsighted Enclave . A token of the benevolence of Lord King Sicarius and the Grand Sicarium . You shall receive more of these mighty gifts , should your foolish peoples choose to oppose the dominion of the true master of the Galaxy , and the King of all Astartes ! "" Needless to say , but the remains of the retainer , after the Kassar was done with him , would have barely filled a small paper cup . The challenge of Flaegren had bee accepted , and it would be many years before his crusade could be stopped by the Enclave . Over a dozen worlds and a hundred battlefronts , the insane Marines of Grand Sicarium and their men at arms fought bitter world to world wars with the Enclaves . Each side fought like smoke , fluidly attempting to out manoeuvre their opponents before delivering a killing blow . Guerilla campaigns were launched by desperate or hate-fuelled enclavers , and the Astartes responded with vast bombing runs over civilian population centres . The sheer number and variety of conflicts that raged for decades throughout the lawless border regions could fill a library themselves , but eventually both sides were exhausted , numbers dwindling to but a fraction of their previous forces . Bitter and driven by a blinding arrogance , Flaegren continued his campaign , initiating a blistering and penetrative offensive with his remaining fleet , which plunged like a spear deep into the soft tissue of the farsighted Enclave . The capital world itself was besieged by two great battlebarges . These massive floating cityscapes were almost impossible to destroy ; time and again dedicated bands of battlesuits and drones would sally forth on covert missions to infiltrate and destroy the colossi , but to no avail . Then , something truly disastrous occurred . In his hubris and mania , Flaegren had neglected to maintain his stocks of ordnance throughout the war . His logistical lines were stretched to breaking point , and this breaking point came sixteen months into the final siege . A vast Astartes supply vessel , the bride of Sicarius , burst into the system without escort , hoping to resupply the vast barges who had been constantly pounding any large cities or settlements they could find upon the surface . Before it could reach Flaegren's vessels however , the Kassar's men finally leapt into action . Over seven hundred battlesuits , three hundred orcas filled with loyal fire warriors , supported by a tribe of the mercenary Kroot , boarded the vessel , and destroyed all the munitions in a great storm of gunfire and screams . Now helpless and unarmed , the battle-barges were easy meat for the reinforcements that came to wreak their terrible vengeance upon the hated Astartes . Kasar-princes from across the Enclave burst into the system with their attendant fleets , spewing glistening arcs of blue and purple energy into the stricken behemoths . Missiles and ion batteries of a dozen different configurations and designs pumped their destructive force into breaking apart the ancient Terran constructs . Armour plates splintered and blistered , men and women howled as the void reached in to snatch away their lives in a fiery instant , and slowly but surely , both the great ships collapsed under the pressure , tumbling into pieces like the decomposing corpses of whales . It was said Flaegren went down with his ship , insanely ordering his men to stop dying , as the air was sucked from the bridge . He died hacking apart his own minions as they treasonously asphyxiated on the floor at his gilded boots . This is , of course , but a brief glimpse into the actions of the Tau of this period , as destiny called out to all races in the wake of building giants in both the void and the warp . Soon enough , the Tau , the young race turned into a cynical monstrosity by grief , were forced to reassess their place in the galaxy , and to choose a side in the final great and enduring conflict of our ( and indeed all ) times . For it was coming , and no dynasty would be secure from it in the end . Additional Background Information 3 : The Asur Revenant : The actions of the Eldar . It would be remiss of this history to ignore one of the prime movers throughout the Eternal War . By the close of the second Age of Strife , to an outside observer , the Eldar race would have seemed utterly extinct , save for those last few burning embers . Indeed , most of the vast Craftworlds were naught but ghost ships , rumbling silently with the souls of the countless dead Eldar slain in the hopeless task of awakening their god of the Dead , while others were victims of the great Chaos Empires and Necron uprisings in the ascent throughout that darkest of times . Of the Craftworlders , only Biel-Tan remained active and defiant , attracting those few outsiders and rogues of their race to them , and forging a moderate empire of hundreds of worlds ( though these remained scattered across the galaxy , thus making their empire seem impossibly diffuse and hard to notice ) . Yet , this is but a fragment of the Eldar race in total . For , running through the veins of the webway like black Tar was a realm which had never stopped , and never repented of their actions . Commorragh . The Second Age of Strife had a different name in the Dark City of Sin . It had been considered a golden age . With the fall of the Imperium , all order vanished and collapsed . Once secure worlds across the galaxy were now helpless before the Dark Kin and their ever-draining souls . Worlds were repeatedly ravaged by the Dark Eldar Kabals . Slaves souls and tortured screams filled the City in a great tumult . Yet , for all their building prosperity , the drain upon their own gangrenous souls grew too . Their raids were ever more frequent as the coiling embrace of slannesh tightened as her power built in the anarchy of the wider galaxy . The Dark Eldar continued on as they had always done , driven by insanity and malice and utter evil . They continued to conspire against one another and the dark pits were ever-filled with the shrieks of the damned and the dying . And at the centre of this all , was Vect . The Overlord of Commorragh , however , was truly mad . One of the eldest beings alive , the Dark Lord's life drew on long beyond his ability to rejuvenate his soul ; millions upon millions of slaves and minions had to perish every day to keep his soul from being drained away like bile in rainwater . He grew desperate and ever-more dangerous as his mind began to slip from him . To begin with , this mania was merely a deception ; a lure to draw out conspirators against his position . But after thousands of years , deception became truth , and Asbruael Vect became something far worse than a monster and a Tyrant to the dark Eldar ; he became a liability and a threat to all Archons . Kabals who did n't bring back sufficient souls were destroyed as they entered the Port of Lost Souls , and their ruins were picked over by the parched and rival Archons alike . His punishments for perceived slights and threats against him were brutal even by his own standards . Some Archons were carved up into a thousand parts , re-grown through the oceans of agony generated by the Haemonculi , and each one was then butchered and tortured , before being deposited upon Slanneshi daemonworlds . Yet , there was but one Archon who could hope to challenge Vect's entrenched position . Lady Malys . Disgruntled Kabals flocked to her banner secretly , and the old Noble houses slithered to her throne with tributes of the caged screams of billions of wailing infants and the hearts of an entire race made extinct in her name . And it was not just they who had her ear . The Harlequins , it was rumoured , came secretly to her chambers , and danced the secret dances that nobody knew . Secrets and prophesies and words uttered only once and never uttered in all the countless eons of existence before or since . ( The rumours of bladed shadows that descended upon worlds assailed by the Nightbringer's forces during the eastern campaigns are perhaps not so far-fetched as once believed ... but this is another story ... ) Yet the Dark Lord was not without his own allies ; his sycophants and those Eldar who truly wished to see the world sicken and misery to reign , simply to see what would happen , and how it could be rebuilt in a vile manner of their own choosing . At every level of the twisted Hierarchies of Commorragh , a new division was brewing , amidst the various and multifaceted feuds and ambition which was normal and encouraged across the twisted realm . Of course , to the outside galaxy , this was an unseen war , but it was not unfelt . The Dark Eldar were being bred on an unprecedented scale , and the Haemonculi rejoiced as they could breed more eventual fodder for their labs . Abominations were released on millions of worlds across the galaxy , and no one could comprehend what these misshapen things were , or why they so desperately tortured , raped and destroyed them . Raids became even more frequent , as the raw material that formed Commorragh's bedrock was in ever greater demand . While ambition brewed in the dark city , the rest of the Eldar race was not idle . Biel-Tan engaged in a war against the Eastern Chaos Imperium . The realm of renegades and brigands was vast , bordering both Vulkan's new Imperium and the western domains of Abaddon himself . Yet , it was a cumbersome beast , with little order beyond the great fleets of Huron Blackheart , the rotting heart of the Chaos Imperium . The war was predominantly a naval conflict , as the Eldar made up for their lack of numbers by using Waystones and spirit gems to guide and control the massive numbers of orphaned craftworld fleets , greatly bolstering the numbers available to Yriel . Yriel was a genius in void warfare , yet Huron , despite his age and his increasing chaotic taint , was also a master of fleets . There were far too many naval actions , spread across centuries upon centuries , to document in their entirety here . For Yriel was a persistent threat and nuisance to Huron . His ships were arrow-swift and they only fought battles when they had no other choice . Most of the time , they avoided his great Corsair armadas . When they did strike , it was while Huron's armies were occupied in other wars against lesser Imperiums and against Abaddon and his Legions or the Astartes Commanderies of Vulkan . Whenever Huron was weakest , Yriel struck . It is testament to the skill of Huron and his Lieutenants that these battles were rarely one-sided ; they always knew of some means to reply to the Eldar . Indeed , Huron's familiar whispered of coming threats weeks before they arrived . One such battle was in the system of Maniforge , where Yriel came close to being destroyed . The world was a Dark Mechanicus forge world ; a world infested with the Obliterator plague right to its very core . Huron's vessels , limping back to an allied port after a failed campaign against the Lead Bastion , one of Grand Sicarium's core worlds , were attacked by Yriel's hidden Void Stalkers , cruisers and wraithships as they burst into reality . Like daggers through silk , the Eldar engaged the chaotic vessels , laying waste to hundreds of vessels within hours . But Huron had picked the Maniforge for a very particular reason . He had made a pact with the Deep Entity known as Valchocht the Maker , the Ravager of Terra , Lord of the Obliterator contagion . These great Daemon was promised all of maniforge , as well as the sanctified sacrifices of two hundred betrayed Red Corsairs . But what really sealed the pact was the promise of bright Eldar souls to devour . Eldar were so very rare , and it would please Valchocht to deny the young upstart God Slannesh some of her prize delicacies . When Yriel destroyed the first wave of chaos vessels , he sealed the deal , and maniforge opened . Valchocht and his ilk were daemons from the deep warp ; ancient and vast beyond all imagining . When he was reborn upon the plane of flesh , he bodily possessed all of the wrecked hulks at once . Vine sof sulphurous daemonflesh and churning technologies flowed between the ruins , knitting them together into an behemoth as vast as a star fort . Huron eventually arrived hours later , and the battle of Maniforge began anew . Both sides were heavily battered and brutalised and not one vessel escaped unscathed . Yriel's flagship was almost consumed by a great destroyer-wide maw which burst from Valchocht's stolen flesh of steel and souls , but skilful piloting and the spear of twilight spared him of this end . Another engagement in the long war led the two enemies to almost be destroyed by a third force , when they became becalmed in the dead warp around the Angylworld of Zone . Their engines failed and their crews became sluggish and weak , as the cold influence of the perfectly symmetrical world of order and obedience spread out from it like a vile halo . Luckily , they managed to repair their vessels just as their sensors picked up the great silver pinions of the Angyls of the Star Father , come to break their spirit and enslave their minds . Biel-Tan would never bow . The hollow tombworlds that were once the craftworlds echoed with the sounds of skirmishing and violence . Bands of looters and pirates attempted to ransack these ancient worldships for their hidden technologies and the secrets that lay within them . They often learned too late that the capering ones in their cloaks of many colours still defended their kins' graves . And yet , Craftworld after Craftworld was pillaged by some great force , which could evade the defenders easily . They did not cause damage though , and they only took one thing . Each craftworld found their Avatars spirited away . Only gory offerings and broken spirit stones marked their passing . When the war of Commorragh finally came , there was carnage ( which will be detailed further in later parts ) . Yet , soon , the two rivals found that a far greater war had come to the galaxy , and for once , they could not hide from it , for it came for them . The full extent of this war will become apparent in later sections , but the Dark Eldar experienced their first real taste of this conflict when the great Jackal God began in earnest , his war upon the webway . Though the deceiver had little power there , the greater war had begun to awaken his more ... esoteric allies from their slumber / imprisonment / banishment . The Ophilim Kiasoz , that great unknowable terror , had dimensions that bisected the webway in certain sections . What is more , it had allies amongst the Dark Eldar themselves ; creatures that had bonded themselves to the anomaly through some means mortals were not meant to know . The dark Kin would fight in the war for existence , in the inky blackness of the Mandrake's trap , or they too would perish . And of course , all true Eldar grew to fear and despise those who rose from the Crone worlds , led by that mongrel fend , whose name was twice-antagonist ; Ysgar Oppugnant . Those eldar who were favourites of the Deepest Warp , brought back to drink deep of the fall of flesh and the ascent of excess . The Chaos Eldar , who would attempt to bring the galaxy to its knees , at the head of the impossible Draziin-Maton , whom gathered for the End . Additional Background Information 4 : The Blind Eagle ; The Empire of the Theologian Union . At the close of the Second Age of Dusk , the very heart of the Ophelian Imperium was suddenly and violently ripped out by the sudden and thunderous birth of the Star Father . The entire world was dragged into the warp and becalmed by legions of Angyls . It became the Angylworld of the ArchAngyl Malcador , and reappeared as a world of thoughtless drones deep within the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath , many thousands of light years removed from its former location . This loss was a near fatal blow to the Ophelian Imperium . In one fell swoop , over half the Sisters Thanatine ( the Elite monastic Military Order which formed the elite core of the petty Imperium's colonial forces ) , as well as the Ecclesiarch and most of the Cardinals versed in Saint Karamazov the Martyred's Doctrines of the faith , enforced as the official faith in the manic realm . The Imperium's precarious administrative organisation was compromised and rendered inoperative . Within ten years of M51 , the Ophelian Imperium had descended into anarchy , as the Governor-Kings of the thousand-strong Empire fought and bickered in bitter conflicts of succession between each other , sometimes besieging their own fellow Imperial worlds with their PIFs ( Planetary Invasion Forces ) and what ships they could spare . Though trade continued betwixt the realms , it was carried out with paranoid wariness ; much revenue being expended on simply defending cargo fleets from attack during their long short-warp jump journeys between the strongholds of each individualistic despot . Some Governor's were utterly unscrupulous , hiring outside human and alien mercenaries ( even Krieg Serf soldiers ) to overcome their rivals , often entering into surprisingly disadvantageous alliances in order to assert their claim Capital-status for their own world , and desperately each tried to get their own candidates elected by the Cardinals to become Eccliesiarch . This of course meant that the Ophelian Imperium was much weakened at this time , and many of the border worlds were sacked by opportunistic enemies , such as the carnivorous amphibious Cythenan empire , and the Vazineren Imperium , with its cadres of Psychons , terrible soldiers recruited solely from the mounting Psyker population of that particular Imperium ( which was formed around an unstable warp rift known as the Kazid ) . It was at this point , after years of anarchy , that the Tallern Imperium really began to take an increased interest in their troublesome neighbour . While the Ophelians had been laid low by the events of the Age of Strife , the Tallarn Emperors and their Nobles ruling over their many thousands of worlds managed to endure the terrors which destroyed many of their weaker neighbours . Through a combination of cunning and logistical might , they fought off hundreds of major invasions during the first century of the Age of Dusk . The rise of the Vulkan Imperium was fortunately timed , its expansion drawing their hateful eyes of many of the worst and most powerful nations and races of the galaxy , including the Twin behemoths of the Eastern and western Chaos imperiums . Thus , they were in a strong position to take advantage of the Ophelian Imperium , orphaned of its former Capital . It began under Emperor al-Fonze Ma ' karib II of Tallarn , in 132 . M52 , during his campaigns of reconstruction in the northern fringes of the Ophelian Imperium . He besieged and took these worlds forcibly , but was incredibly merciful in his treatment of these worlds after their defeat . He permitted the terrified Lords of the Hive cities to buy their passage of retreat from the worlds , and he did not install massive colonisation forces on the captured worlds , but instead sent preachers and supplies to help rebuild the smashed and in some cases starving populations of these worlds . Forced conversion was kept to a bare minimum . Yet , al-Fonze's assassination by one of the mysterious ' Heracles' Faction of ex-Temple assassins meant his campaigns were halted after only seven years . Nevertheless , the impression was made upon the Ophelian population ( at least in the outer worlds ) . In the 160s of M52 , the Governors of the outlying Ophelian worlds began to cooperate to a greater degree against the old guard of the Inner worlds , who still looked inwards in despair of their lost capital world . They looked to the Tallarns to aid them in this task . They offered the Tallarn ruling aristocrats trading privileges and even lands and estates upon their worlds , in exchange with funding and weapons in order to face the inner worlds , who maintained most of the Ophelian Imperium's manufacturing worlds and subordinate Forge Worlds . The many fleet engagements , pitched planetary sieges and raids that ensued could fill a dozen history books themselves , but in the end , the core worlds were driven into a corner and forced to sue for a truce . The Thrarantine Guard ( who had expanded to a massive size during this period , as they were seen as the most Theologically ' pure ' force in the secular conflict ) arbitrated the terms of the treaties , and their was a semblance of peace . Nevertheless , the Tallarn were now intrinsically involved in the diffuse and fractious politics of the Ophelians . Over the centuries , the two Imperiums began to merge , via dense trading corridors that ( though they took many years to traverse ) provide wealth and prosperity to the rulers and their magnates . At the council of Thezibebe , hundreds of Tallarn-orthodox , Ophelian Kazamarovite and Ascensionist Cardinals gathered to discuss the election of a new Ecclesiarch to once more unite the faith of the ' true ' Imperium . The debate was not a success , and had to be called off after many of the lesser radical sects tried to set fire to the debate podiums , and the Ascensionists caused a planet-wide riot in which four hundred thousand acres of industrial sprawl became a mangled warzone as vast hordes of zealots and fanatics battled like insane animals in the streets . Between 100 . M53-200 . M53 , it was said that at any one time , five Ecclesiarches and ' anti-Ecclesiarches ' were in place on Pontifical thrones from Tallarn itself to at one point a small mining colony in an unstable star system . Each claimed to be the true Ecclesiarch . Despite this schism amidst the clergy , the worlds themselves became closer , and their cultures began to merge and develop . Fear of the outsider and the xenos began to mutate into a creed of ' Humanism Absolutism ' ; that is , the creed of Human survival at all costs . Humanity must survive , and let everything else be damned . In 487 . M53 , Emperor Santargo III of Tallarn crowned himself ' Lord Protector of the Imperial Mysteries ' . This strategically side-stepped the theological issues of the newborn super-bloc of Imperiums , and allowed him to justify his secular campaigns , and to impose military tithes upon the worlds nominally under his thrall . Though the worlds of this Imperium were still bitter rivals for the most part , Santargo could still launch his huge crusade to expand the realm in 568 . M53 , gathering together a force of diverse colonial troops and mercinaries , held together by the Thrantine Orders , other growing religious warrior fraternities and sororities , and the iron will of the Emperor Santargo himself , who went to war in one of the perishingly-rare Leviathan Moving fortresses . Though he died before even his first crusade could be completed ( due to the monumental distances involved , and the poor quality and pitfalls of Astronomicon-less warp travel ) his sons and grandsons managed , over the next hundred years , to swallow up a dozen other Imperiums that bordered the Ophelian / Tallarn alliance , subsuming them into the great web of commerce and religious violence which codified the realm of ' Imperial Mysteries ' . Also , during this period of expansion and conflict , a centre of commerce built up around the ruins of a former Star Fortress known as Haanab the Ravaged . Here , trade from across the sprawling realm came , and the ruler of the space station was often a key figure in wider decisions on tithes and tax and what could be imported . Santargo XXII had this fortress massively expanded with subsidiary-stations and had asteroids towed into orbit with this expanding colossus of industry and trade . He then declared Haanab the new capital of the realm of Imperial Mysteries and himself its governor ( even though he was on campaign for his entire life , and never once visited the fort himself ) , with little objection from the powerful nobles and Governor-Lords of the Imperium , as it was relatively neutral . It would be a mistake to consider this realm of captured and consumed Imperiums to be a singular super power that that point . It was a huge area of space , covering a huge swathe of the south-west of the galactic plane . Such a realm could not be administered by a government with such slow FTL capable vessels , and for much of the time huge sections of the ' Empire ' were like lawless realms of border princes and robbing Wolf Packs of bandits , and squabbling Governor-Lords vying for advantage or pressing assumed claims of heritage . Amidst this anarchy and misery , there was the undercurrent of a building popular faith . The Emperor of the wasteland . There were no longer any survivors from the time before the Second Age of Strife , and no man had ever seen or heard of the Emperor's actions beyond vague recollections of priestly chroniclers , who had hastily scribbled down scripture from memory after the loss of all the written records of the Ministorum upon Ophelia . Thus , the image of the Emperor became horribly distorted . The vile concept of the Corpse-Emperor merged with the creed of human survival at all costs , turning the Emperor into some legendary undead figure of vengeance and pragmatic , who ruled a universe of broken worlds and failed systems , yet refused to relinquish them , like a jealous child . This creed was paradoxically both horribly cynical yet fervent in its prosecution and practices . A faith of nihilistic mania , where only suffering and miserable stubbornness could get one closer to your god . So what if his empire was of ashes and ruins ? It was still HIS . His ashes . His ruins . When a necrotic warp plague ravaged the allied Imperiums in M54 , the tenuous hold of the Tallarn Emperor's was undone , and a power vacuum was soon created with their failure . The Cardinal known as Ceylan was to be the very man to fill this void . His name would grow to be one whispered in awe and utter terror by his subjects . This cardinal began his life as a mere clerk in one of the priestly houses of sanctioned invention , where he made friends easily and swiftly , due to his serpent's tongue and charming demeanour . All of which hid his great pathological personality and truly evil ambition . Through a series of coincidences and sinister ploys , he manipulated his way into the priesthood , worming his way right into the meat of the Ecclesiarchy like a maggot in meat . He used his power and influence to place his friends into powerful offices and in particular patronised the work of his questionable-disciple Deng-Vaal . This man claimed to be a warp scientist , and made a major breakthrough in the method of warp travel . He found if one could torture psykers and witches sufficiently , and somehow captured and stored their torment and lingering death-screams , one could power a ship through the warp at tremendous speed . Ceylan quickly seized upon this idea , taking it as his own and tying it into the natural distrust for psykers prevalent in the realm . He turned this process into a form of benevolent penance ; the death of the psyker would purify both their soul , but also allow the Emperor's children to spread to the very furthest reaches of space . He managed to acquire Secular support from a number of prominent Tallarn old-born Noble houses , as well as the favour of some of the radical factions who desired to build a stronger Empire , under a powerful leader . As reward for his discovery , Ceylan was granted the position of Ecclesiarch by his fellow Cardinals . His exact theological leanings were always slightly in question , but the devious man could never be pinned down to a single definitive answer , and thus was elevated to the post without noticeable opposition . For the first time in a long time , there was only one Ecclesiarch of this Imperium . As the ' Excruciator ' Engines were being created and tested by the forge worlds under Vaal's watchful gaze , Ceylan subtly and smoothly began to undermine the central faiths of the Cardinals , playing them off against each other , but avoided any responsibility himself by claiming he was merely arbitrating between wronged parties . As he sowed discord there , he discreetly promoted the more popular faith of the Emperor of the wasteland . He stealthily inserted known rhetoric used by the Creed in his sermons and speeches . Just as the faith of the Imperium was becoming unified in religious wars and reform , the means to propagate this faith across the entire Imperium was finally completed and made widespread use of . His influence grew as the Imperium consolidated itself via the new cruel means of breaching the warp . Eventually , with this greater unity there came a chance for a new Emperor to take over . Naturally , Ceylan manipulated the processes of selection and influence , until a candidate of his preference was selected . Ceylon made sure never to publically claim leadership or secular power over the Imperium , but rather worked behind the scenes . The Tharantine and his own spy network , known unofficially as the Aquila-men , discreetly carried out his orders and kept the various other armies and factions within the Empire under control . As a final demonstration of the new focus of human unity of purpose , the Emperor renamed the Empire the Theologian Union . By M55 , the Theologian Union was the third largest human Imperium in the galaxy , able to hold its own in campaigns against the very largest of empires . Initially , the Union struggled to maintain a strong focus , for the source of direct outside enemies to attack were few . They were engaged with semi-persistent wars with Pirate nations , Hybrid Cults of strange aliens with bulging heads and snapping claws . And a large scale siege of the world of Rokfal , where the race of feral greenskins had made a sudden and unheralded resurgence , smashing the industry of the planet almost annually , as the force of barbarians continually threw itself against its attackers with mindless vigour , getting stronger every time , as if feeding upon warfare itself for nourishment . However , Ecclesiarch Ceylan the first Found the perfect foe when Vulkan sent his envoys to the Theologian Union , bearing banners of compromise and hope . When the envoys refused to show fealty to the Ecclesiarch ( the Emperor's representative ) , the Emperor cast the ambassadors out . Ceylan began to order the preachers of the Union to spread themselves amongst the people , and spread the word . There was no Primarch upon Armaggedon . There could n't be . They were dead . This ' Vulkan ' was a daemon disguised as a primarch , they claimed . And so it was that the blind men of the deluded realm of the Wasteland Emperor turned their hand ever against their own kind . In their own way , these vainglorious zealots brought upon themselves the terrible events that marked the Dusk of all things , in the final war of conclusion and defiance . Additional Background Information 5 : The War-race Tempered : The Ork Risen . In the opening years of the Second Age of Strife , the orks as a race battled their nemesis , the New Devourer , and in doing so were destroyed in that titanic struggled which raged across hundreds of sectors . Though they had not been aware of it , their actions had inadvertently saved the entire galaxy from the New Devourer . While their war had been futile , it had delayed the hybrid Tyranid-Ork menace , which eventually found itself drawn away to fight some unseen foe beyond the galaxy . In the midst of the horrors of the strife age , people dared to hope that perhaps the orks themselves were made extinct in this great conflagration . The audacity of hope is so easily quashed , for the Orks yet lived . Minute spores and fungal helixes were left behind on the millions of abandoned greenskin worlds . However , it would take many thousands of years before the spores could fully recover , and spread like a bacterial plague through the undergrowth and organic matter which flourished on their former worlds . One such planet was the world of Lexin Fidorich . The humans there had come from the nearby Feudal Technocracy known as Shunter-beerne , who had eagerly captured this nearby world , which was impossible fecund and fertile . By M52 , Lexin was a flourishing world of diverse environments made tame by the sterile crop-scienc eof the cybernetic humans who tended this veritable garden . However , soon the Feudal Hyper-lords of the Shunter-beerne found their woods and forests infested with strange red beasts with ugly tusks and a belligerent attitude . This was intolerable , and long-limbed game keeper constructs cleansed the biomes of these beasts with gunshot and flame . This was a mistake . Smaller green creatures began to appear in the woods . They watched and scurried through the woods . Occasionally they would steal children or set fires , and stole massive quantities of metal sheeting and cut down sections of woods . Again , the long-striding machines killed most of them ; but not all . Those who were birthed afterwards filled in for their fallen , and the building of crude settlements began . Within the space of a decade , Feral monstrous warbands were roaming across the planet . Tranquil glass cities were smashed by the tread of hundreds of vast squiggoth beasts , and the crude firearms of their riders . Throughout the now-infested woods , an ancient cry not heard in millennia rang out ; waaaaaagh ! More and more powerful constructs were deployed on the surfaceby the Shunters , with ever deadlier weapons , but this only speeded the advance of their foes . Soon they had to abandon their planet . They did not possess exterminates grade weaponry however , and thus they could not prevent the Feral ork spread . This story reoccurred on dozens of sectors and systems across the galaxy , followed by hundreds upon hundreds after that . In particular feral orks tended to thrive just on the cusp of the various inter-power struggles which were ongoing across the galaxy ; there were veritable masses of feral orks on the border with Grand Sicarium and the Kassars , as well as the unruly space between the Thexians and the Tau , and on the fringes of Maelstrom space . One of the Demiurge brotherhoods ( The collective of Hashut ) even began to enslave feral ork bands for use in their schism against their rival Brotherhoods . As the shattered galaxy had no singular authority to recognise this building force , every lesser faction assumed these were localised threats and barely contained them . However , these feral bands of barbarians were naught but the wisps of powdered snow before an avalanche . At the close of the 52nd Millennium , there were signs across the galaxy . Feral orks were driven into fits of prophetic madness , and weirdboys chanted and babbled insanely . Something churned up the warp , and the powers realigned , for they could sense what was coming back . The Orks were returning . But not simply orks ... It began on the planet of Galgoroth , a rich mining world which had the protection of a coalition of minor xenos and human enclaves . The year was 999 . M52 , and the world reported fearsome warpstorms ; the biggest seen since their records had begun ( in practice , their records had n't begun until M50 , during its founding ) . It was then that they detected that a space hulk had translated into the system , a Hulk known as St. Jollepur's Bane . Their Managing Governor-Director was not pleased . Hulks were dens where minor xenos ( perhaps even an isolated gang or feral orks had managed to survive in the warp upon the hulk ? ) and pirates infested the hideous amalgams of vessels and asteroids . He had experienced hulk-drift while on another core-wards world centuries before , and he disliked what they promised . The world's PDF and system ships would have to be diverted from guarding his planet from real threats , to mop up the degenerate scum that would surely be squatting within its haunted depths . So , reluctantly , he unleashed his large fleet to engage the hulk on its brief incursion into his planet's local area . His fleet was composed of old mass produced Tau cruisers re-fitted for human use , Vulkanian vessels traded with the rising human power , and even some antique Mars Cruisers were amongst this diverse and lethal armada . On board the transport vessels , Krieg Serf Soldiers , Kroot and Fremen were hired on Galgoroth's ruling Corporation's expense , alongside a Free Company of Obsidian Falcon Astartes and as much of the local PDF forces he could afford to send in support . Eventually , the fleet reached the hulk . Initial scans and intel gathered by the fleet showed that the hulk was like nothing they had ever seen before . The hulk was no longer merely a mass of weaponised ruins drifting through space ; it was a warship . Uniform , sturdy armour covered its colossal flanks , alongside thousands of rows of vast weapon batteries and gun emplacements . And jutting from its shark-like sides were great spurs and towers , from which it seemed an entire fleet was at dock . That was when the firing started , and communication was lost with Galgoroth . The skies were aflame as the battle raged for almost three days . Ships were blown apart , or pulled open by tractor beams and high explosive ordnance , as well as more arcane and strange weaponry deployed by the new foe . Enemy soldiers were teleported directly into enemy vessels , and proceeded to massacre everyone with extreme efficiency , barely a sonorous growl escaping the butchers' lips as they killed . Only a handful of vessels returned to the mining world , including the utterly-mauled Strike Cruiser of the Obsidian Falcons . Their leader , Captain Eregious , immediately deployed one of his squads to the surface of Galgoroth . The Governor demanded to know what was attacking them . Was it xenos ? Pirates ? Enemy Marines ? Orks ? Eregious responded with a simple phrase . "" Those are not Orks ... "" His squad attacked and broke into the treasure vaults of the world , securing their payment before deploying back to their Cruiser . Eregious refused to stay and defend the world , because he wished to preserve his brothers . For the foe arrayed before them was too powerful and too numerous to defeat ; not with such depleted resources . So , the Galgorothans waited and fortified their planet as the bulky , well-constructed warships of the enemy hurtled towards them . The Kill Cruisers and huge battleships of the enemy easily swatted away the System Defence Ships , and deployed their ground forces after a bombardment of all the centres of military resistance . City-scale factories were dropped directly upon the planet , and began to work as soon as they slammed to the ground with a thunderous rumble that resounded across the mountains themselves . The few pockets of resistance remaining were dealt with by hulking armoured figures that deployed right at the heart of their battlelines , stepping through warp portals with ease . They wielded weapons like bolters , but far more destructive , alongside strange weapons , such as a device which teleported not gretchin , but miniature plasma warheads inside the bodies of their opponents . After barely two days , the planet was conquered , and those humans not slain in the bombardments were rounded up and used as slave labour in the mining districts , which were expanded and enhanced by the mysterious foe , who deployed huge titan-scale excavators and walking machines to heft out vast quantities of raw material for the hundreds of factories deployed by the orbital fiends . This was the galaxy's first taste of the new greenskin race . Ten Hulks at least were reported with similar modifications , but that first hulk remained the largest of this new phenomenon . These creatures did not call themselves the orks , but rather merely called themselves ' War ' , or at most ' the War of the Krork ' . Few people have subsequently breached the armoured hides of the War-Hulks , but it is claimed that the Krorks are in fact the commanders and driving force behind this new breed of elite Ork . It is theorised that these new creatures are in fact modified gretchin or grots , altered to be tacticians and schemers beyond the ken of the larger breeds ; it has to be noted that no smaller greenskins have been sighted within the battle-hosts of ' the War ' . Who manipulated them or remade these intelligent creatures remained unknown for many millennia , during the age of intertwining fates , but we shall get to that in due course ... The warriors of the Krork were a distillation and perfection of previous ork concepts and natural abilities . Each warrior wore flexible powered armour , which captured the spores released by them and sealed them in flame-proof canister inside the suits . These canisters were collected after a battle , and were taken to their manufacturing shops or their hulks , and dozens more generations of orks were thus spawned , or the spores were carefully cultured and spread upon worlds deemed perfect for Ork-forming . The powered armour also further enhanced each ork's strength , and was flexible enough to expand as the ork expanded . Each soldier ork was first forced to fight against hundreds of its peers inside the war-hulks , and this swelled each beast to vast scales . Most were taller than even an Astartes warrior when they were finally allowed to construct their armour and weaponry , which each and every ork instinctive knew how to build , unconsciously building their gear according to the exact specifications of higher authority , tailoring their weaponry to be optimised for whatever battlefield they found themselves on . Though the unseen ' brainboys ' of the numerous hosts were never seen on the battlefield , powerful War-bosses led the armies of each Hulk , and were brilliant tacticians , as their size naturally made them more intelligent , each war making them more efficient and more intelligent . Each Hulk , though separated by lightyears , had some means of psychic communication with their fellow Hulks , due to either the psychic might of the brainboys , or their manipulation of psyker Orks placed upon modified warp-reading thrones as a form of telepathic network . Needless to say , these Krork hosts spread quickly , and created numerous huge empires . The thirsting Bloodknights of Baal were fought to a standstill around the Juerellian warp gate by the Krork , denied their prise of a whole world of mortals which they could taint and then drain to stave off the black rage . A task force comprising of two whole Commanderies had to be deployed to drive off an Armada of Krork who had managed to cripple the logistical supplies of dozens of Vulkan's systems . That war was known as the war of renewed vengeance , and eventually the forces of Vulkan ( only after the sacrifice of the legendary hero Lord Captain Hexatrin of the Silent Panthers Commandery ) prevailed , but the Krork could not be finally defeated , as they divided their fleet and began a guerrilla campaign which lasted for five hundred years . Numerous battles and wars were found against krorks across the Western and Eastern Chaos Imperiums , and both factions lost dozens of worlds to the disciplined invaders . Abaddon managed to defeat a Krork force by utilising the planet-killer's awesome firepower to destroy a war-hulk , which seemed to be the only method of permanently crippling a Krork Armada . The Krork had special hatred for their feral ork brethren surprisingly , and often accelerated asteroids into planets with them on , or made a special effort to exterminate the entire population of feral greenskins on the ground , before burning the mountains of corpses . The Krork were a menace to all factions , for they seemed to have declared themselves to be a war against all elements of the galaxy . From the Star Father's dread Angyl-worlds , to the blasted ruins of the Shatter-wake and their bone-feeders , the Krork were fearsome opponents . In particular , they seemed to lose some of their cold demeanour when fighting the necrons . On some instinctual level , they just knew what their eldritch function was , for it was encoded into every fibre of their green , war-forged flesh . It was not until the infamous Alliance of the Fringe , that even the notion of concordance with other children of this galaxy occured to them . Their faith was unknown . All that the world at large could decipher of their brutal , complex language spoke of ' awaiting the two , the facets of the god-mount ' . Some claimed , in those early years , that they were merely referring to their primitive ancestor gods , Gork and Mork . Alas , if only it had been that simple . The true relevance of their creed would not become evident until it was too late to stop what had been started . But that conflict shall be documented in a later section , once these chronicles have been properly reinforced to withstand the telling of the tale of the Nex - [ FILE CORRUPTED .

712	The key link between the base / infrastructure and the superstructure in societies is established by the class relationships of the given society . It is the class relationships which act as the link between the economy and the politics and culture of a society . Specifically , Marx invokes the idea of the ' class-struggle ' . The class-struggle is the driving force of human history for Marx . History is a series of Modes of Production and in each of these ' Modes ' there are two fundamental classes which are in conflict with each other . In the present Mode of Production - called Capitalism - the two important classes are the capitalists - who own the means of production - and the proletariat ( working class to you and I ! ) - who have to sell their labour-power . Marx suggested that it was important to recognise the inequalities of social power in the relationship between these two classes . The capitalists , as a result of their ownership of the means of production , are the dominant class . This power allows this class to exploit the other class - the proletariat . Importantly , because of this exploitation the working classes are said to be alienated . To be alienated means to feel distant from or to feel estranged from one's community or social world . For Marx the workers feel alienated from the production process by virtue of the fact that they do not own it and therefore do not make decisions regarding what to produce and how to produce it . In fact Marx suggests that even the capitalist class will be alienated . This is a result of the fact that the capitalist production process is geared to the goal of profit-making . Unlike any earlier MOP , argued Marx , which were at least based upon ( a limited notion of ) need , capitalism is the pursuit of profit alone .	0

1583	"The May / June ' 06 issue carried an article on the history of run-ins between morays and divers near Stingray City and the Sand Bar in Grand Cayman's North Sound ( "" It 's A Moray . . . You Do n't Always Get What You Feed "" ) . The run-ins have continued sporadically . Despite repeated requests by the Cayman Island's Department of the Environment ( DoE ) that watersports operators refrain from feeding or encouraging interaction with green morays , this practice continues . "" After all , divers and local operators have enjoyed this practice for many years , "" said a DAN Member who recently traveled to Cayman . "" Many of us feel that an occasional bite is worth the interaction . We 're dealing with wild creatures here ; that 's part of the thrill of diving with them . "" According to Cayman News Net , on Oct. 11 , 2006 , in an area off the Sand Bar known as "" the reef , "" a dive guide played with a moray for the entertainment of his diving customers . Apparently aware of possible danger , he reportedly told his group to cross their arms and clench their fists if the creature approached . The customer who recounted this incident noted that several of those on the tour were given squid to feed the eel . At some point , the guide , who was also the captain , was bitten on the arm severely enough to incapacitate him and require multiple surgeries and several days' hospitalization . The May 2006 article noted that the DoE was considering new approaches to manage such activities , including limiting the number of boats and people present at any one time , as well as restricting the amount of squid / bait per craft . To date , the DoE has n't publicized their specific proposed amendments to current marine conservation law . However , it has indicated that "" wildlife interaction zones "" are to be established wherein the feeding of marine animals would be tightly regulated . Feeding of underwater creatures outside of these zones would be prohibited . In the meantime , our earlier advice stands : Pay attention to your surroundings , do n't wear shiny objects , and do n't wave your hands or fingers or provoke marine life in any other way . To this we add , ask watersport operators about their policies regarding interactions with morays . Heed their rules and respect the wildlife , and you 'll enjoy your dive - we 'll all be happier for it . Know What to Do Accidents happen , no matter how cautious we are . Plus , there are those times we forget to be consistently vigilant . You might be searching in a rocky crevice for a lobster dinner ( in season , of course ) , or you might have inadvertently jostled a creature making way for your dive buddy near the reef . What happens if you or your buddies get bitten ? Could you handle the situation ? Would n't it be great to know right away the steps to first aid for this ? You can get that know-how by signing up for DAN's First Aid for Hazardous Marine Life Injuries course . You 'll learn how to identify the problem quickly and how to take immediate action . Here are some tips , however blunt , about getting along with marine life . They appear in DAN's Dive and Travel Medical Guide , a membership benefit when joining DAN . Avoid contact with the animal : This sounds simple , but it may not be if you have poor buoyancy control and / or are experiencing conditions of poor visibility , currents , confined areas or other environmental limitations . Do not attempt to handle , tease , feed or annoy any marine animal . Exploring a crevice with your hand is a good way to receive an injury from a hidden animal defending itself . Strive to develop excellent buoyancy control and be aware of what surrounds you . Do not allow a current to force you against a fixed object ; it may be covered with marine animals . Wear protective clothing . Make an effort to find out which animals you may encounter in your dive and learn about their characteristics and habitats before you begin the dive . This will help you enjoy your dive more and prevent possible injury from the animals you encounter ."	8
3	"The Roots of Chinese / Japanese Rivalry BOSTON – The anti-Japan protests that continue to roil China are just another indication of the rise of a potent Chinese nationalism . After a century slowly fomenting among Chinese intellectuals , national sentiment has captured and redefined the consciousness of the Chinese people during the last two decades of China's economic boom . This mass national consciousness launched the Chinese colossus into global competition to achieve an international status commensurate with the country's vast capacities and the Chinese people's conception of their country's rightful place in the world . Rapidly , visibly , and inevitably , China has risen . Indeed , our era will likely be remembered as the time when a new global order , with China at the helm , was born . Competitive national consciousness – the consciousness that one 's individual dignity is inseparably tied to the prestige of one's "" people "" – worked its way into the minds of China's best and brightest between 1895 and 1905 . In 1895 , China was defeated by Japan , a tiny aggressor whom the Chinese dismissively called wa ( the dwarf ) . China was already accustomed to rapacious Western powers squabbling over its riches , but had remained self-confident in the knowledge of these powers' irrelevance . However , the assault from Japan , a speck of dust in its own backyard , shattered this self-assurance and was experienced as a shocking and intolerable humiliation . Japan's triumph in 1905 over "" the Great White Power , "" Russia , repaired the damage to China's sense of dignity . From the Chinese point of view , Russia was a formidable European power , one feared by other Western powers . Its defeat , therefore , was seen as a successful Asian challenge to the West , in which China , its intellectuals felt , was represented by Japan . Japan thus became the focus of Chinese attention . Gentlemen-scholars , who would reform and staff the Chinese army and civil service in the early decades of the twentieth century , went to study in Japan . The Revolution of 1911 was inspired by the example of Japan's Meiji Restoration ; and , because early-twentieth-century Japan was stridently nationalistic , the new China that emerged from its image was constructed on nationalist principles as well . Thus Japan became the significant "" other "" for China , the model that was imitated and the anti-model that was resented . Chinese nationalism borrowed from Japan its concept of the nation , including the very word by which it was expressed ( kuoming , from the Japanese kokumin ) . The Kuomintang ( the Chinese Nationalist Movement ) was explicitly inspired by Japan and fueled by repeated Japanese aggression . Paradoxically , but not unexpectedly , Mao Zedong's struggle against the Kuomintang was inspired by anti-Japanese nationalism as well . As was the case virtually everywhere else , communism in China was nationalism incarnate . Mao's speech on the establishment of the People's Republic plainly expressed the nationalist agenda behind it . Calling the nation "" communist "" assured the new People's Republic of China of the Soviet Union's support , which was viewed by Mao as more reliable than that of the United States . But neither the Russian nor the Chinese Communists were ever unclear about the nationalist nature of their respective projects . The upper echelons of the bureaucracy and intelligentsia in Russia and China were self-consciously nationalist and , throughout Communist rule , shrewdly pursued the supreme nationalist goal : prestige – the power , naked and otherwise , to impose the nation's will on others . But national consciousness , particularly in China , was limited to a narrow elite , leaving the masses almost untouched . This changed dramatically with the Chinese government's restoration of a capitalist economy . Much like in Germany in the 1840's , when the appeal to private enterprise converted the entire middle class to nationalism , the explicit definition of economic power as the central pillar of China's greatness awakened ordinary Chinese to nationalism's appeal . Hundreds of millions now see themselves as sharing in the nation's dignity , and are eager to contribute to it , as well as to defend it from insult . Competition for prestige , even when the contest is economic , is not a purely rational undertaking . So it should be no surprise that old injuries are likely to resurface . Some Chinese , especially those who are not economically successful , harp bitterly on Japan's past depredations . Despite China's embrace of capitalism and Japanese investment , Japan remains China's reviled other . Indeed , a professor in Beijing told me not long ago , "" Two in every ten Chinese dislike the US , but nine in every ten hate Japan . "" For the West , there is a silver lining in this nationalist rivalry : neither China nor Japan is a rogue state , and , so long as their quarrels do not lead to the use of unconventional weapons , we may treat the friction between them as an internal Asian quarrel . Japan , moreover , is likely to let today's passions over disputed islands in the East China Sea cool down , despite the anti-Japanese outbursts in Chinese cities . But the West – and the US in particular – is new to dignity games à la Chinois . If it gets carried away and presumes to talk down to the 5 , 000-year-old culture of the Sages , the West could become the next object of China's nationalist resentment ."	0

271	The Science Park has announced that it will start construction early next spring on a new facility at its Queen's Island headquarters , Belfast . The four-story , 40,000 sq ft building will join the Innovation Centre , ECIT and a 20,000 sq ft building due to open in summer 2005 . The new facility will be known as White Star House in recognition of the shipping line which commissioned Harland & Wolff to build the Titanic at Queen's Island over 90 years ago . Project architects on the scheme are Ferguson McIlveen . Commenting on the announcement , Norman Apsley , CEO of the Science Park said : ' This is another landmark stage in the Science Park's development . With 75 % of the Innovation Centre already let or committed , White Star House is a logical progression in the workspace package we can offer . ' While the Innovation Centre has units available in multiples of 2,000 sq ft , White Star House will provide larger units - from c . 5,000 sq ft up to a maximum 35,000 sq ft - providing space for ventures which outgrow the Innovation Centre as well as larger businesses . ' As with all the facilities being developed by the Science Park , the emphasis is upon providing flexible and sustainable space that adapts easily to occupants' changing needs . According to John Beattie , the Science Park's Operations Manager and concept designer of the facility , White Star House represents advanced building design thinking . ' This is an intelligent building with several innovative features that will help White Star House meet the requirements of the Carbon Trust's ' Low Carbon Design ' initiative and make it one of the Province's most environmentally friendly facilities . ' We 're planning to make use of ground water with a constant temperature of around 12 ° C to cool the building in summer and pre-heat the air for ventilation during the winter . ' Raised floors will provide a generous service void and a flexible method of providing heating and ventilation throughout the work areas . The intentionally exposed underside of the floor slabs will enable occupants to customise their space with the minimum of disruption . ' John Beattie also believes that White Star House will give occupants and the wider Science Park an exciting built environment : ' Although this is very much a working building , extensive use of glass will make it an interesting experience for both those within and without . Apart from stunning views of the Thompson Graving Dock and Belfast Lough , the building's occupants will also appreciate internal reflections of changing weather conditions outside . ' It 's also anticipated that the external appearance of White Star will change throughout the day as the glass reacts to different light conditions . The external view will be further enhanced by the building's translucent design which will provide emerging views of the interior as night falls . ' Heritage Michael Graham , Director of Real Estate , emphasised that sustainability and heritage considerations also helped shape the plans : ' Although White Star House is n't going to save the planet , it does represent an environmentally friendly approach to building design which will hopefully become the norm rather than the exception . ' Despite this very modern approach , we 're also conscious of the site's historical legacy . To reinforce the Titanic memory , its entrance will be flanked by three exposed bow-shaped support pillars housing the building's elevators - each the same height as the bows of the Titanic and her sister ships , Britannic and Olympic . ' White Star Line will forever be associated with Belfast and the Olympic class ships built here . The building will be a permanent reminder of the technological excellence associated with Queen's Island and I 'm looking forward to it hosting a new generation of innovators when it opens in 2006 .

1272	"Announcing ... Lou Adler's Updated Rules for Winning the Talent Wars Lou Adler is known in HR departments and by recruiters nationwide as the thought leader who successfully transformed hiring into a systematic and scalable process that leaves little to chance . Financial companies , hospital and health care systems , name brand online companies and product manufacturers are among the numerous organizations that rely upon Adler's Performance-based HiringSM to win the talent wars . This summer , Adler has released the third edition of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD , Wiley & Sons , July 2007 ( $ 29 . 95 ) , featuring the time-tested approach and integrating it into today's online world . Every hiring manager and every outside recruiter knows Lou Adler and The Adler Group as the source for improving their hiring success . Through onsite seminars , workshops , keynote speeches and webinars , The Adler Group ( www.adlerconcepts.com ) trains thousands of people every year to help improve sourcing , interviewing , hiring and retaining talent to help companies prosper . In HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD , Lou explains why the traditional methods of hiring and interviewing simply do not work . When the fundamentally flawed hiring process is compared to the Performance-based Hiring approach , it becomes crystal clear which is the better way to go . "" To succeed today , any kind of organization must take pro-active control of the talent supply chain . This is as necessary in the hiring area as any other critical sector of a company , "" says Lou Adler . "" HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD shows how . "" This up-to-date and fully revised edition of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD features an in-depth look at the biggest change in the hiring arena since the introduction of the personal computer . Social networking sites , such as LinkedIn , MySpace , ZoomInfo and others have eliminated any secrecy in hiring and recruiting . Available positions that were once shared only with potential candidates are now two or three mouse clicks away from discovery by anyone - competitors as well as applicants . With changes in the hiring world happening at the rate of Internet innovations , keeping up with the rapid pace is a challenge . Knowing how to manage the information and the candidates who hold the same information cards as the hiring manager is critical . The same Wild West atmosphere that has put information on job openings on the fast track has also led to dramatic changes in the attitude of potential hires . There are fewer obstacles to keep employees in positions they find unfulfilling or unrewarding . The stigma of leaving companies has just about vanished , and changing jobs for short-term and superficial reasons and accepting counteroffers are now acceptable . Qualified candidates can easily find new jobs and new opportunities . Companies must address these changes and adapt their sourcing and hiring methods to maintain any competitive edge . HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD shows the reader how to find the best candidates , both active job seekers and passive browsers . Adler explores the use of multi-level sourcing , where pursuing a series of different channels ensures a constant flow of top candidates on an on-going basis . Identifying top candidates but failing to conduct good interviews condemns the hiring process to failure . Adler explains how two simple questions can be used to identify real performance potential , bringing the candidate into an authentic give-and-take discussion about the actual challenges and situations that the position entails , and determining how the person will perform , based on how they have handled similar situations in the past . Hint : the success is in the details . The methods described in HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD lead to a clear understanding of the candidate's problem-solving abilities , insights , intelligence , potential , vision and leadership skills . "" Hiring managers make mistakes when they allow presentation and emotion to overshadow performance , and this happens on a daily basis in offices around the globe , "" says Adler . "" The system that I have created and refined eliminates these mistakes by taking the candidate and the interviewers step by step through this simple , yet highly analytical process . "" For hiring managers , recruiters and anyone running a business or a department who wants to do a better job of finding , interviewing and hiring the best candidates , HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD is the only source they need . If you do not have a copy of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD or would like additional information on Lou Adler , call Shari Goldstein at 631-595-7150 or shari@goldsteinPR.com and please provide your name , mailing address , name of publication and all other contact information ."	2
1133	' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames Third adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp series feels like a trip to hell and back – and not in a good way ' Inferno , ' the third movie of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp novels starring Tom Hanks , feels like a trip to hell and back , says Peter Travers . ' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames More News Here 's the third futile attempt by director Ron Howard to turn the bestselling claptrap of author Dan Brown into something watchable . He comes close , but not close enough . This time Robert Langdon , the Harvard symbologist played as if against his will by Tom Hanks , suffers from retrograde amnesia . Lucky guy – I can remember all too well how the film's plodding predecessors , The Da Vinci Code ( 2006 ) and Angels & Demons ( 2009 ) , stubbornly refused to come to life . Howard , shooting in Florence and Istanbul , makes things look compellingly atmospheric . And Hanks is one of the most likable actors on the planet . But Inferno just lays there onscreen , pancake-flat and with no animating spark to make us give a damn . Related From awards-worthy dramas and controversial history lessons to a new ' Star Wars , ' what you need to see Which is strange , since the fate of the world hangs in the balance in David Koepp's surprise-free script . Extremist billionaire Bertrand Zobrist ( Ben Foster , a master at crazed stares ) has decided there are too many people in the world . He 's fired up to unleash a plague-like virus that will narrow the herd to a manageable few . Langdon ca n't let that happen : Who would buy Dan Brown novels with no herds around ? Dazed and confused , our hero wakes up in a Florence hospital , under the care of Dr. Sienna Brooks ( Felicity Jones ) , wondering why he 's even in Italy and why he has Jason Bourne disease . Something about a gunshot wound , head trauma , and clues that can be found in Botticelli's 15th-century painting The Abyss of Hell and Dante's Divine Comedy . Bad guys and one nasty woman , a carabinieri named Vayentha ( Ana Ularu ) , start chasing Langdon and the good doc . No romance here , for better or worse , though Langdon makes eyes with the age-appropriate World Health Organization director Elizabeth Sinskey ( the most excellent Sidse Babett Knudsen of Westworld ) . They have a history , you see . And while your mind wanders trying to make sense of this gibberish , the great Irrfan Khan shows up as the Provost , the head of a consulting group that 's up to no good . Happily , Khan chews into his villainous role like a ripe peach and gives Inferno a jolt of momentum that vanishes when he does . What remains is a stilted travelogue with fancy art references . In one early scene , a character takes a swan dive off a picturesque belltower . The fall , like everything else in this series of pretty pictures posing as cinema , is shot magnificently by Salvatore Totino . Still , there 's something wrong with a movie that makes you envy a squashed corpse . Do n't Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox .

1656	"With customizable management features , it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals . Moodle ( acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment ) allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community sourced plugins . Moodle was originally developed by Martin Dougiamas to help educators create online courses with a focus on interaction and collaborative construction of content , and it is in continual evolution . The first version of Moodle was released on 20 August 2002 . Nowadays the Moodle Project is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ , an Australian company of 30 developers which is financially supported by a network of eighty four Moodle Partner service companies worldwide . Moodle's development has also been assisted by the work of open-source programmers . Moodle as a learning platform can enhance existing learning environments . As an E-learning tool , Moodle has a wide range of standard and innovative features such as calendar and Gradebook . Moodle is a leading virtual learning environment and can be used in many types of environments such as education , training and development and in business settings . Plugins are a flexible tool set , allowing Moodle users to extend the features of the site . There are hundreds of plugins for Moodle , extending the features of Moodle's core functionality . Each plugin is maintained in the Moodle plugins directory . As of April 2015 , there are over 1,000 plugins available for Moodle with over 7 million downloads . Graphical themes for Moodle can be installed to change the look and functionality of a Moodle site or of an individual course . Moodle has been translated in over 100 languages , available for any site administrator to install . People in various countries maintain and contribute to the various language packs . Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards : Sharable Content Object Reference Model ( SCORM ) is a collection of elearning standards and specifications that define communications between client side content and a server side learning management system , as well as how externally authored content should be packaged in order to integrate with the LMS effectively . There are two versions : SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 . Moodle is SCORM 1.2 compliant , and passes all the tests in the ADL Conformance test suite 1.2.7 for SCORM 1.2 . SCORM 2004 is not supported in Moodle , however Rustici Software have a Moodle plugin which can turn any Moodle site into a fully compliant SCORM 2004 LMS . The AICC HACP standard for CMI was developed by the Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee ( AICC ) and is used to call externally authored content and assessment packages . AICC content packages are supported in Moodle 2.1 and later versions . IMS Content Packages can also be imported into Moodle . In addition , Moodle Book activities can be exported as IMS Content Packages . Learning Tools Interoperability ( LTI ) is a standard way of integrating rich learning applications ( often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services ) with educational platforms . Moodle uses the External Tool activity to act as an ' LTI consumer ' as standard , and will act as an ' LTI provider ' using a plugin . Users can download and install Moodle on a Web server , such as Apache HTTP Server , and a number of database management systems , such as PostgreSQL , are supported . Pre-built combinations of Moodle with a Web server and database are available for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh . Other automated installation approaches exist , such as installing a Debian package , deploying a ready-to-use TurnKey Moodle appliance , using the Bitnami installer , or using a "" one-click install "" service such as Installatron . Certified Moodle Partners provide other Moodle services , including hosting , training , customization and content development . This network of providers support development of the Moodle project through royalties . Moodle runs without modification on Unix , Linux , FreeBSD , Windows , OS X , NetWare and any other systems that support PHP and a database , including webhost providers . Moodle also has import features for use with other specific systems , such as importing quizzes or entire courses from Blackboard or WebCT . As of February 2010 , Moodle will not import Blackboard courses , apparently due to changes in php code-releases . In March 2012 Blackboard acquired two companies based on Moodle's software including Baltimore-based Moodlerooms Inc. and NetSpot of Adelaide , Australia . In August 2015 , Blackboard acquired Colombia-based Nivel7 , possibly the largest Moodle services provider in Latin America . The Red Hat site , Opensource.com , reports that Moodle will always be an open source project , with clear delineation between Blackboard and Moodle . For many schools , colleges and universities , SIMS integration is key to ensure a seamless data flow from the Management Information System through to the Learning Platform and back again . Many Learning Platforms do not enable write-back functionality , however this is often a key requirement from schools needing to write data onto their MIS and back again . Martin Dougiamas , who has graduate degrees in computer science and education , wrote the first version of Moodle . Dougiamas started a Ph.D. to examine "" the use of open source software to support a social constructionist epistemology of teaching and learning within Internet-based communities of reflective inquiry . "" Although how exactly social constructionism makes Moodle different from other eLearning platforms is difficult to show , it has been cited as an important factor by Moodle adopters . Other Moodle adopters , such as the Open University in the UK , have pointed out that Learning Management Systems can equally be seen as "" relatively pedagogy-neutral "" . The stated philosophy of Moodle includes a constructivist and social constructionist approach to education , emphasizing that learners ( and not just teachers ) can contribute to the educational experience . Using these pedagogical principles , Moodle provides an environment for learning communities . The acronym Moodle stands for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment . ( In the early years the "" m "" stood for "" Martin's "" , named after Martin Dougiamas , the original developer ) . As well as being an acronym , the name was chosen because of the dictionary definition of Moodle and to correspond to an available domain name . Moodle has continued to evolve since 1999 ( since 2001 with the current architecture ) . It has been translated into over 100 different languages and is accessible in many countries worldwide . Institutions can add as many Moodle servers as needed without having to pay license fees . The Open University of the UK currently uses a Moodle installation for their 200,000 users while the UK government uses a Moodle installation for their Civil Service Learning platform serving half a million employees . Grading improvements , auto-login , sign-up improvements and SSO , new notification preferences A MoodleMoot is a conference for Moodle community members , held to learn about Moodle , share experiences of the learning platform , discuss research in related educational technologies and contribute ideas to future Moodle development . Held around the world , MoodleMoots are organised by universities or other large organisations using Moodle , Moodle Partners , Moodle associations or Moodle HQ . In the higher education market in the United States as of fall 2013 , Moodle is the second largest provider with 23 % market share , following Blackboard ( 41 % ) , with Desire2Learn ( 11 % ) and Instructure as number three and four providers ."	4
815	Look at picture 15 . Part A shows the nucleus of a cell . The nucleus contains genetic material in the form of chromosomes . a ) How many chromosomes does the cell in picture A contain ? b ) Before mitosis , there is an increase in genetic material . Why do you think this happens ? c ) How many chromosomes would each of the new cells ( part C ) have ? d ) Why are the cells formed by motosis genetically identical ? e ) Explain why cancer cells keep growing even though the original mutation happened in only a single cell . What our experts say : a ) 6 . b ) Cell copies all its parts and this includes making a copy of the DNA in its nucleus . Just before a cell splits during mitosis it has double the normal amount of DNA . c ) 6 . d ) During the first stages of mitosis , the cell's DNA makes an exact copy of itself . One copy is passed onto each of the two new cells . This means the two new cells are genetically identical . e ) The cancer is caused by a mutation that happens in just one cell . This is a change in the original cell's DNA that triggers it to grow out of control . The mutation is copied when the DNA is copied during mitosis and so all of the cells that grow from the original cell will contain the mutation . This means that the new cancer cells continue to grow in an uncontrolled way .	4
96	"My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously , on a collective level . And what I mean by that , it 's the behaviors that we 're in denial about , and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness . And as individuals , we all do these things , all the time , everyday . It 's like when you 're mean to your wife because you 're mad at somebody else . Or when you drink a little too much at a party just out of anxiety . Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt , or whatever . And when we do these kind of things , when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors , then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants , and no one intended . And that 's what I look at with my photographic work . This is an image I just recently completed , that is , when you stand back at a distance , it looks like some kind of neo-gothic , cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution . And as you get a little bit closer , it starts looking like lots of pipes , like maybe a chemical plant , or a refinery , or maybe a hellish freeway interchange . And as you get all the way up close , you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups . And in fact , this is one million plastic cups , which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours . We use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled ; they just do n't do that in that industry . Now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day , and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages , most of which is coffee . I could n ' t fit 40 million cups on a canvas , but I was able to put 410,000 . That 's what 410,000 cups looks like . That 's 15 minutes of our cup consumption . And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life , that 's the size it would be . And there 's an hour's worth of our cups . And there 's a day's worth of our cups . You can still see the little people way down there . That 's as high as a 42-story building , and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference . Speaking of justice , there 's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling , and that is that America right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth . One out of four people , one out of four humans in prison are Americans , imprisoned in our country . And I wanted to show the number . The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005 . And that 's gone up since then , but we do n't have the numbers yet . So I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge . They 're tiny , they 're barely visible as a piece of material , and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print . And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide . This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York ; those are my parents looking at the piece . ( Laughter ) Every time I look at this piece , I always wonder if my mom 's whispering to my dad , "" He finally folded his laundry . "" ( Laughter ) I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction . And this particular one is about cigarette addiction . I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking . More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes . And so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes . And , as you slowly step back , you see that it 's a painting by Van Gogh , called "" Skull with Cigarette . "" It 's a strange thing to think about , that on 9 / 11 , when that tragedy happened , 3,000 Americans died , and do you remember the response ? It reverberated around the world , and will continue to reverberate through time . It will be something that we talk about in 100 years . And yet on that same day , 1,100 Americans died from smoking . And the day after that , another 1,100 Americans died from smoking . And every single day since then , 1,100 Americans have died , and today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking . And we are n ' t talking about it ; we dismiss it . The tobacco lobby , it 's too strong . We just dismiss it out of our consciousness . And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes , we continue to allow our children , our sons and daughters , to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking . And this is what the next piece is about . This is just lots and lots of cigarettes : 65,000 cigarettes , which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month , and every month in the US . More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under begin smoking every year . One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs . This is an image I 've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin -- well , actually I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times . ( Laughter ) And so as you stand back you see 213,000 Vicodin pills , which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States , attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications . One-third of all drug overdoses in the U. S. -- and that includes cocaine , heroin , alcohol , everything -- one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications . A strange phenomenon . This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon . And that is the phenomenon , this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery . 384,000 women , American women , last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery . It 's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift , given to young girls who are about to go off to college . So I made this image out of Barbie dolls , and so as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 32,000 Barbie dolls , which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U. S. each month . The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 . And strangely enough , the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction , and most of that is being done by men . Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples . I 'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues . They 're just examples . And the reason that I do this , it 's because I have this fear that we are n ' t feeling enough as a culture right now . There 's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment . We 've lost our sense of outrage , our anger and our grief about what 's going on in our culture right now , what 's going on in our country , the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world . They 've gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing . Our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen . And one of the causes of this , I think , is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of world view , this holoptical world view , this holographic image that we 're all trying to create in our mind of the inter-connection of things : the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy ; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers . As we try to build this view , and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trillions . Bush's new budget is in the trillions , and these are numbers that our brain just does n ' t have the ability to comprehend . We ca n ' t make meaning out of these enormous statistics . And so that 's what I 'm trying to do with my work , is to take these numbers , these statistics from the raw language of data , and to translate them into a more universal visual language , that can be felt . Because my belief is , if we can feel these issues , if we can feel these things more deeply , then they 'll matter to us more than they do now . And if we can find that , then we 'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : How do we change ? That , to me , is the big question that we face as a people right now : How do we change ? How do we change as a culture , and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of , and that is our own behavior ? My belief is that you do n't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues . I 'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way . I 'm simply saying , this is who we are right now . And if there are things that we see that we do n't like about our culture , then we have a choice . The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface , to bring to this question , the depth of character that we can summon as we show up for the question of how do we change . It 's already defining us as individuals and as a nation , and it will continue to do that on into the future . And it will profoundly affect the well-being , the quality of life , of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions . I 'm not speaking abstractly about this , I 'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room . Right now in this moment . Thank you and good afternoon . ( Applause )"	0

57	"III Chapter Three They were three full , exquisite days--a true honeymoon . They were at the Hotel-de-Boulogne , on the harbour ; and they lived there , with drawn blinds and closed doors , with flowers on the floor , and iced syrups were brought them early in the morning . Towards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the islands . It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels . The smoke of the tar rose up between the trees ; there were large fatty drops on the water , undulating in the purple colour of the sun , like floating plaques of Florentine bronze . They rowed down in the midst of moored boats , whose long oblique cables grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat . The din of the town gradually grew distant ; the rolling of carriages , the tumult of voices , the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels . She took off her bonnet , and they landed on their island . They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern , at whose door hung black nets . They ate fried smelts , cream and cherries . They lay down upon the grass ; they kissed behind the poplars ; and they would fain , like two Robinsons , have lived for ever in this little place , which seemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth . It was not the first time that they had seen trees , a blue sky , meadows ; that they had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves ; but , no doubt , they had never admired all this , as if Nature had not existed before , or had only begun to be beautiful since the gratification of their desires . At night they returned . The boat glided along the shores of the islands . They sat at the bottom , both hidden by the shade , in silence . The square oars rang in the iron thwarts , and , in the stillness , seemed to mark time , like the beating of a metronome , while at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water . Once the moon rose ; they did not fail to make fine phrases , finding the orb melancholy and full of poetry . She even began to sing -- "" One night , do you remember , we were sailing , "" etc. Her musical but weak voice died away along the waves , and the winds carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings about him . She was opposite him , leaning against the partition of the shallop , through one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in . Her black dress , whose drapery spread out like a fan , made her seem more slender , taller . Her head was raised , her hands clasped , her eyes turned towards heaven . At times the shadow of the willows hid her completely ; then she reappeared suddenly , like a vision in the moonlight . Leon , on the floor by her side , found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet silk . The boatman looked at it , and at last said -- "" Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day . A lot of jolly folk , gentlemen and ladies , with cakes , champagne , cornets--everything in style ! There was one especially , a tall handsome man with small moustaches , who was that funny ! And they all kept saying , ' Now tell us something , Adolphe--Dolpe , ' I think . "" She shivered . "" You are in pain ? "" asked Leon , coming closer to her . "" Oh , it 's nothing ! No doubt , it is only the night air . "" "" And who does n ' t want for women , either , "" softly added the sailor , thinking he was paying the stranger a compliment . Then , spitting on his hands , he took the oars again . Yet they had to part . The adieux were sad . He was to send his letters to Mere Rollet , and she gave him such precise instructions about a double envelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness . "" So you can assure me it is all right ? "" she said with her last kiss . "" Yes , certainly . "" "" But why , "" he thought afterwards as he came back through the streets alone , "" is she so very anxious to get this power of attorney ? """	6
643	Mark's Story ( Coverage : UK Wide ) I really do n't want people to think that I am blaming my parents , because what I 've done is my responsibility . But right from the start the most important people in my life had liberal views when it came to drug culture . And that makes a difference when you are growing up . Maybe if they had n't been so relaxed about drugs and made me work at school .... but then again who is to say that I would n't have rebelled ? I was about 14 the first time I got caught shoplifting little toys from a newsagents . I got a conditional warning from the police . Then a while later I broke into a bubble gum machine at 2am – I 'd blagged my mum saying I was stopping overnight with a mate . A passing taxi driver alerted the police and I got a caution . I did n't see myself as a criminal then . I did my first burglary when I was 15 – it was a scout hut . But did n't get caught . After a while I started experimenting with other drugs and associating with much older drug users . I was still going to school when I was n't coming down from the previous night's session . I do n't know how I never got myself suspended or expelled . At least then I could have blamed not getting any qualifications on that . By the time I left school I was taking anything I could get my hands on : speed , LSD , mushrooms , alcohol and prescription pills and potions . I nearly died on one occasion ; I 'd taken 160mg of Valium - probably enough to knock a horse off its feet . The next thing I knew was three days later being slapped and beaten by friends and family to get my adrenalin pumping through my body . I had been unconscious . I dread to think what could have happened if I had been on my own or if nobody had cared at the time . Heroin and crack were n't really around then like they are now . So I never contemplated trying either of them when I was younger . I had always perceived heroin and crack cocaine as a rich man's drug . I thought it was totally out of my league . In any case at the time I was enjoying how my life was going and I did n't realise then that I had a drug problem . I was n't going out committing crime to feed my drug use because most of it was given to me . So I was going through life in a permanently stoned state , not worrying about the future and thinking everything was okay . Little did I know what was ahead for me . I lived on and off with my mum . She and Dad split up when I was eight and she remarried when I was 19 . We moved up from the South to the Midlands . I started work as a trainee printer . I started hanging out with the well known criminal fraternity and made contacts . This is when I got into the heavy end of the drug scene and started with heroin . My first big crime was against a bank . I was done for theft and using a false instrument – I managed to cash cheques for £ 10 , 000 . I got two years probation and was ordered to pay £ 3 , 000 compensation . Then I got a 21 month prison sentence for a dwelling house burglary which I 'd done to get money to buy heroin . I got 84 days to run concurrently for not paying my compensation . But by then I was n't going to be able to pay off a fine while I was paying for heroin . It was scary in prison at first . On the first night I tried to hang myself with bed sheets . I was so frightened of coming off heroin and knew I would n't get any help in prison . I was put in a special cell where I was observed for 5-6 days , and then moved back into the general prison population . I did n't get assessed , or see a psychiatrist or get anti-depressants . I did feel better though once I 'd come off heroin after about two weeks . Although I did know what I was doing I was so in need of drugs I 'd almost do anything . It 's a difficult thing to explain to someone who is n't an addict . It makes you do things you know are wrong because somehow you just do n't seem to care about other people anymore . You see I 'd borrowed money and sold stuff , so I 'd exhausted all my options . I felt I had no option but to turn to crime . I went back to mum 's after prison . I stayed clean for two weeks and then started using again . Within four weeks I was back inside again for another burglary . I got two and a half years . I was never worried about doing the time – just coming off the heroin . I 'd work as a cleaner inside . I think I still had depressive and suicidal tendencies but never did anything again . I got a basic computer qualification while I was in prison . I did the lay prison programme twice too , a four-month rehabilitation package . Then I started thinking about my future . I did n't like being in prison . When I got out that time I was determined to socialise with a different set of people . I started working for a local building company , it was a good job and I earned good money legally . But I was n't used to it – and what did I spend it on ? Heroin and crack . My life took a major downward spiral as I got the sack and was unemployed with a massive habit . I did more burglaries and got caught again and was remanded in prison for eight months . Then in Crown Court I was given the opportunity to start a Drug Treatment and Testing Order ( DTTO ) run by the probation service . It has been helpful . At first I had to go in every day and also have my urine tested by nurses twice weekly to check if I was still using . I 've also had to see a doctor regularly and I 've had some counselling and treatment from psychiatric nurses which has helped . The probation staff got me on the 12 week Princes Trust Programme which involved a week-long residential team building exercise – we looked at issues around disability , health and safety , food hygiene , first aid and blind awareness . I led a community project with the Princes Trust , clearing an overgrown graveyard which was thought to be used by drug users . So now local people can use it again and feel safe . It felt good to be a leader on something so constructive . I want to experience that feeling again . My Probation Officer said I also had to attend an Enhanced Thinking Skills Programme . This involved working in a group with other offenders for 22 sessions . Although I knew a lot of it already , it 's conditioned me to put stuff into practice . Thinking things through before I act . Considering consequences , long-term and short-term . Taking responsibility . Considering others . I 'm sorry for what I 've done and who I 've hurt . I am going to get as many qualifications as I can and hope to go into youth and community work . I reckon with my experiences I can hopefully help others . Attending the Princes Trust Programme has really given me some confidence . I was surprised at how good it was . I have n't had a habit for 18 months now , and have been completely clean of heroin for 6 months now . I still have a few bad days . I visited a few old mates recently who are still taking the gear . I just feel cold towards heroin now . There 's no more crime in my life . I am on benefit – so things are tight . But I have a good girlfriend now and she knows all about my past and is prepared to stand by me . I 've got a decent flat from a housing association in a nice quiet area away from any drug users . Probation really have helped me a lot . I 'm so very grateful as my life has been turned around .	1
33	"Jude 1 1 Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James , To those who have been called , who are loved by God the Father and kept by [ a ] Jesus Christ : 2 Mercy , peace and love be yours in abundance . The Sin and Doom of Godless Men 3 Dear friends , although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share , I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints . 4 For certain men whose condemnation was written about [ b ] long ago have secretly slipped in among you . They are godless men , who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord . 5 Though you already know all this , I want to remind you that the Lord [ c ] delivered his people out of Egypt , but later destroyed those who did not believe . 6 And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home – these he has kept in darkness , bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day . 7 In a similar way , Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion . They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire . 8 In the very same way , these dreamers pollute their own bodies , reject authority and slander celestial beings . 9 But even the archangel Michael , when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses , did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him , but said , "" The Lord rebuke you ! "" 10 Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand ; and what things they do understand by instinct , like unreasoning animals – these are the very things that destroy them . 11 Woe to them ! They have taken the way of Cain ; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error ; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion . 12 These men are blemishes at your love feasts , eating with you without the slightest qualm – shepherds who feed only themselves . They are clouds without rain , blown along by the wind ; autumn trees , without fruit and uprooted – twice dead . 13 They are wild waves of the sea , foaming up their shame ; wandering stars , for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever . 14 Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied about these men : "" See , the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones 15 to judge everyone , and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way , and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "" 16 These men are grumblers and faultfinders ; they follow their own evil desires ; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage . A Call to Persevere 17 But , dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold . 18 They said to you , "" In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires . "" 19 These are the men who divide you , who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit . 20 But you , dear friends , build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit . 21 Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life . 22 Be merciful to those who doubt ; 23 snatch others from the fire and save them ; to others show mercy , mixed with fear – hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh . Doxology 24 To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy – 25 to the only God our Savior be glory , majesty , power and authority , through Jesus Christ our Lord , before all ages , now and forevermore ! Amen ."	0
862	"Disarmament Diplomacy Issue No. 38 , June 1999 Senate Rejects Measure to Allow Unilateral US Nuclear Reductions On 26 May , an amendment to the Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2000 Defense Authorization Bill ( S. 1059 ) designed to allow the United States to unilaterally reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal below the maximum levels specified in the Strategic Arms Reduction ( START ) I Treaty was defeated in the Senate by 56 votes to 44 . The measure , introduced by Robert Kerrey ( Democrat - Nebraska ) , was intended to break the logjam in the nuclear reduction process caused by the inability of the Russian Duma to ratify the START II Treaty . Introducing amendment 395 , Kerrey set out his case as follows : "" With great respect to the committee , there is one provision in subtitle D called ' Other Matters ' [ Section 1041 ] .. that I am proposing to strike . That language provides a 1-year extension of a requirement that I think causes the United States of America to be less safe than it would without this provision .... What this provision does is say that the United States of America must maintain a nuclear deterrent that is at the START I levels , that we have to have warheads deployed , land , sea , air , that are at START I levels ; that the President of the United States can not go below those START I levels . In the Cold War , perhaps even a few years after the Cold War was ended , when we were trying to err on the side of safety , this made sense because the No. 1 threat then was a bolt out of the blue , an attack by the Soviet Union that might occur when we least expected it . We had to maintain an active deterrence and prevent that . The capacity to survive that bolt-out-of-the-blue attack and counterattack was an essential part of our strategy . Today , the No. 1 threat is not a bolt-out-of-the-blue attack . The No. 1 threat today is an accidental launch , a rogue nation launch , or a sabotage launch of a nuclear weapon . One of the things that causes me a great deal of concern in this new era of ours is that I think we in Congress and the American people as well have forgotten the danger of these nuclear weapons . We have been talking about new threats to America . We have a threat in the form of chemical weapons , a threat in the form of biological weapons , a threat in the form of cyber warfare , lots of others things like that , terrorism , that cause people to be very much concerned . My belief is that the only threat out there that can kill every single American , and thus the threat that ought to be top on our list of concerns is nuclear weapons . The nation that possesses the greatest threat of all in terms of an accidental launch , a rogue nation launch , or a sabotage launch , is Russia .... One of the reasons , the biggest reason that I want to change this is that I believe we are forcing Russia today to maintain a level of nuclear weapons beyond what their financial system will allow them to maintain . They are currently required at START I levels to have 6,000 strategic warheads . Again , according to published accounts from their own military people , they would prefer to be at a level of 1,000 or lower , because they simply do n't have the resources . I can go into some rather startling problems that are created as a consequence of that inability , but they simply do n't have the ability , the resources to allocate to maintain those 6,000 warheads as we do . Ours are safe . Ours are secure .... I point this out not to be alarmist but to say that this is a real threat . This is not an imaginary threat . This weapons system exists . There are 6,000 of these in Russia today that were needed in the cold war ; they were needed in a deterrent strategy that the Russians had developed . We have drawn down , and they have drawn down to the 6,000 level - a bit higher than that still today . They are drawing down to that 6,000 level . But , again , if you ask either our intelligence or the Russians directly , they will tell you they do n't have the resources to maintain even 1,000 . They do n't have the resources to maintain 1,000 , let alone 6 , 000-plus ... Is such a scenario [ of possible accidental nuclear launch ] likely to happen ? It is less likely to happen than the sun coming up tomorrow , but it could happen . It is a scenario that we need to think about as we think about the danger of these nuclear weapons . And because we do n't think about them , it is not likely that we will consider an amendment like this terribly important . We will sort of drift along , as I think we are doing now , saying we are going to wait for the Duma to ratify START II . They are threatening not to ratify for every possible reason . I do n't know what the next anger point is going to be . I personally do n't believe that the ratification of START II by the Duma is necessarily terribly important . That we need to look for an alternative way to reduce these threats , to me , is painfully obvious if you examine the danger that this threat poses to us .... Let me put this another way : the bill we are debating allows a foreign legislative body the final say on US nuclear force levels . I do not believe this is how we should set our defense policies . Our military decisions should be based solely on what we need to protect and maintain our national security interests . While I understand this provision was originally intended to encourage Russian ratification of START II , I think it is time to begin to rethink our strategy . For the foreseeable future , START II is dead . We can all make the case that the Duma should have acted , that ratification was more in their interests than in ours , or that the reason it failed was domestic Russian politics . All that is true . But we now need to begin to ask ourselves if the current policy of waiting for Russian action on START II is the best way to confront the dangers presented by the Russian nuclear arsenal . I believe the answer is emphatically no . The provision in this bill I am trying to strike is forcing the United States to maintain an unnecessarily large nuclear arsenal . By keeping more weapons than we need to defend ourselves , we are encouraging the Russians to keep more weapons than they can control . That is the heart of the argument that I am making .... "" Opposing Kerrey's stance , John Warner ( Republican - Virginia ) , Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee , argued : "" At a time when our relations with Russia and China are quite uncertain , now is not the time to consider unilateral reductions in our nuclear forces . "" Robert Smith ( Republican - New Hampshire ) suggested that Kerrey's "" approach would amount to an abandonment of , or certainly a significant deviation from , the formal arms control process .

1624	Los Angeles TMJ pain relief a joint effort The joints at the back of the jaw are used in every oral activity . These joints slide from side to side to facilitate chewing and speaking . They open and close , and move forward and back to facilitate breathing as well . Under certain circumstances , such as tooth grinding or clenching , the temporomandibular joints , and the muscles that surround them , can become dysfunctional . For some , the symptoms of TMJ disorder are mild , and disappear within a few weeks . However , there are people for whom TMJ becomes chronic , often gradually worsening . We encourage our Los Angeles area patients to seek TMJ pain relief with a combination of self-care and professional treatment with a customized oral appliance . Steps that can be taken at home include : Applying both heat and ice , alternating between the two . Moist heat can alleviate pain and increase function of irritated joints and muscles . Periodic application of ice packs promotes decrease inflammation and slightly numbing sore muscles , while heat packs increase circulation and promotes healing . Neither heat nor ice should be applied directly to skin . Instead , wrap in a thin towel and keep it on for no more than 15 minutes at a time . Discomfort from TMJ disorder can be reduced with over the counter anti-inflammatory medication . These should not take the place of other remedies , which are aimed at relieving pressure and undue stress on affected joints .

766	Identification of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) Prostate Stem Cell Team Section : Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis The mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer that has failed radical local treatment is androgen deprivation therapy . This induces a remission in more than 90 % of advanced prostate cancer patients that lasts for a median of 18 months . With time , however , all patients relapse with hormone refractory disease with an overall median survival of 23-37 months . Our aim is to characterise stem cells within hormone refractory cancer and to determine differences between normal and cancer stem cells that may indicate potential therapeutic targets . We are collecting trans-rectal needle biopsies of the prostate from hormone refractory patients and deriving primary cultures from them . As for normal stem cells , CD133 can be used to isolate cancer stem cells and we are in the process of analysing differences in the gene expression profiles between HRPC stem cells and transit amplifying cells as well as between normal and cancer stem cells . We can then isolate stem cells for analysis and use the cultures and cell lines derived from them to screen for therapeutic targets and as testing tools for drug development . This project is being carried out in collaboration with Johann de Bono , Chris Parker and David Dearnaley in the Section of Medicine .	3

1488	"Jed Moffitt did n't expect his IT services director role for Puget Sound's King County Library System ( KCLS ) to extend to leading Agile Web-based software development projects . Yet , today , development project planning is about 30 % of his job . The journey to that point was loaded with challenges : high demand for rapid application and new feature delivery , staff resistance , the pains of being an early adopter and , of course , a tight budget . Jed Moffitt "" Since the likes of Amazon and Google have become competitors for readers , libraries have to offer Internet services to be relevant , "" said Moffitt . He had to buck library systems' history of slow changes to take the 47-branch library system relevant in a time when so much of the information libraries used to provide is going online . The decision to build and customize KCLS applications for the Web positioned Moffitt as a pioneer . "" You 'd be hard-pressed to find another public library that would go this route , "" Moffitt said . He quotes the usual reactions from his long-time colleagues around the country : "" You 're developing software ? You 've got to be kidding me ! "" A history with software leads to open source tools Necessity had pushed Moffitt into software development before . Back in 1986 , Moffitt started working on library systems , transferring old-style , paper-based card catalogs into software catalogs . "" I used dumb terminals and computers with a half a K of memory , "" he said . From there , he moved to implementing software for "" the more squishy parts of the library process , "" he said . That meant automating how books were selected , bought , cataloged and tracked , among other things . He began doing custom programming and fixing bugs when he could n't get needed help from library software vendors' technical support . As Internet providers' popularity in e-book and information services became evident , Moffitt began evaluations of new integrated library systems ( ILS ) for KCLS . An ILS is essentially an enterprise resource management suite that 's customized for libraries . The KCLS team chose The Evergreen Project's Evergreen software , an open source , Linux-based ILS for its scalability and broad feature set , which included tools for managing , cataloging and circulating materials , no matter how large or complex the libraries . Evergreen being open source was a primary attraction . "" Commercial software vendors are really only incented to sell multiple versions of the same thing and sell licensing fees for it , "" he said . In addition , using open source software gives users the opportunity to do fixes , a desirable option considering Moffitt's experience with vendor support failures . KCLS chose an Evergreen Project-related service provider for application development , customization and deployment . "" We are n't resourced as a library development shop , and that 's not our strategy , "" he said . "" I 'm the responsible party for the overall technology for the system , the network , and the central servers , telephones , the enterprise resource stuff , the business office , and the accounting stuff , that kind of thing . "" The library's applications and services are hosted entirely in-house . Early adoption proves to be risky business Problems with the new ILS cropped up quickly . "" We created some of our own problems , being overly aggressive in our commitment , "" said Moffitt . Adopting Evergreen too early in its lifecycle meant sacrificing features and functions in the software that the outgoing system had . Getting new features or customizing existing ones was a slow process , largely because the technology provider used waterfall development . The librarians at King County became frustrated , because feature deliveries came too infrequently and were never entirely in sync with their needs and expectations . KCLS evaluated seven open source software and service providers . Large open source vendors could n't address KCLS's need for a nimble team to learn the ILS , and to start producing results at a reasonable pace and price . A development services firm in Tucson was considered , but the lower-cost Baltimore-based Catalyst IT Services was chosen . Agile to the rescue Cost did n't clinch the decision . Catalyst IT 's development methodology , Agile , did . The Agile approaches of short iterations and soliciting and acting on user feedback fit KCLS well . "" No more waiting for new features and fixes , even the simple things , to get done , "" said Moffitt . "" On a weekly basis , we 're actually changing the system based on our specifications . "" King County librarians have changed from contrarians to supporters of the ILS . "" Seeing this regular progress has allowed us to win over these stakeholders and involve them in the process in a very collaborative way , "" said Michael Rosenbaum , CEO of Catalyst IT Services . "" They 're now invested in the outcome of our work and feel a sense of ownership over each completed phase . "" There were some bumps along the way , particularly when Moffitt and Catalyst IT 's team wrestled with the ILS's complex GUI and had a couple of failed iterations . As a team , however , they 've gained expertise with the ILS and become fluent in fixing bugs and delivering new features . "" Catalyst IT gets an ' A ' for commitment , "" Moffitt said . Currently , Moffitt works with Catalyst IT on planning application development projects , and the latter does the actual development , deployment and related tasks . Another service provider in Washington handles KCLS database optimization and does testing when KCLS is sandboxing new applications . Based on his experiences in the ILS project , Moffitt offers these tips to his peers : Be wary of getting locked in to a one-provider services and software situation . Be diligent in business analysis and specification development before purchasing or developing software . Unless the business is happy with moving at a snail's pace , choose Agile development . Thanks to Agile development , Moffitt said , "" we 've quickly gotten out of chaos to where we can get into larger , more visionary projects . """	0
1248	Follow-Up Cosmetic Treatment Following Braces Sometimes follow up cosmetic treatment is necessary after braces . There are some things that are not correctable with braces and followup treatment will quickly fix these defects . If you have cracks , uneven teeth or space between teeth , these can be corrected with veneers . Some times traditional braces cause damage to the teeth because you are not able to brush thoroughly . Cosmetic procedures may be necessary to make teeth defect free . Invisalign is a form of treatment with clear aligners . These alignment trays are almost invisible and can be taken out for pictures , eating or the prom . Many people are choosing to use these type of braces because there is no damage to the teeth . Tooth brushing can easily be completed and unsightly marks will not be left on the teeth when braces are taken off . One more way to have beautiful teeth without traditional braces is with a snap on smile . The snap on smile cost is a fraction of what braces cost . This new method for a great smile is created from impressions of your teeth . A custom made mouth piece is made for you creating the perfect smile . It takes about two weeks to complete , and then you will be able to snap it on when necessary . It is so realistic looking no one will know it is not your own .	2
145	"I 'm just going to play a brief video clip . Video : 50,000 pounds . On the fifth of December 1985 , a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record . Mr. Forbes . The buyer was Kip Forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century . The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century . Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar . Benjamin Wallace : Now , that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world . And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock . In 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery . Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784 . He would n ' t reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building . The mystery persisted for about 20 years . It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy . Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious . And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this . There 's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man , and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes . But for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles . I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world . I became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ? So , I decided to embark on a quest . With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes , I decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine . ( Laughter ) This was the first one . A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U. S. is not the real thing . It may come from Wagyu cattle , but it 's not from the original , Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan . There are very few places in the U. S. where you can try real Kobe , and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant , CUT , in Los Angeles . I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars . And it arrived , and it was tiny . And I was outraged . It was like , 160 dollars for this ? And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich . It 's like foie gras -- it 's not even like steak . I almost could n ' t finish it . I was really happy when I was done . ( Laughter ) Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character . Which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price . White truffles . One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world . To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto . The waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , "" Would Signore like the truffles ? "" And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma . It 's not in their taste , really . It 's not in their texture . It 's in the smell . These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up . 10 seconds passed and it was gone . And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so I 'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me . There were several -- several of these items were disappointments . ( Laughter ) Yeah . The magazine would n ' t pay for me to go there . ( Laughter ) They did give me a tour , though . And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet . It has 360-degree views . It has four balconies . It was designed by the architect I. M. Pei . It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver . It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from . When I took the tour , it actually included some Opus One , I was glad to see . 30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel . This is soap that 's made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties . I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this . And it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today . ( Laughter ) But then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans I 'm wearing . These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these . I do n't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value , but I think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that 's a reasonable benchmark . That said , a lot of work goes into these . They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times . But no compliments . ( Laughter ) Thank you . Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany . And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light . He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas . And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness . I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils . It tasted fine . It tasted interesting . It was very green , it was very peppery . But in the blind taste test , it came in last . The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months . ( Laughter ) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you 'll start to notice . I do n't play golf , so I could n ' t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them . Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean , they 'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they 'll say , look , you know , you 're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs . You 're paying for the bling , that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum . The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ... Oh , yeah , you know this one ? This is a coffee made from a very unusual process . The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet . It 's a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations . And apparently it 's a very picky eater and it , you know , homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries . And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form . That 's right . Unrelatedly -- ( Laughter ) Japan is doing crazy things with toilets . ( Laughter ) There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it . There 's one with a fragrance dispenser . There 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor . It 's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in . This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600 . And to try this -- I could n ' t get a loaner , but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , Toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which I used . It 's fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts . The seat is preheated . There 's a water jet that cleans you . There 's an air jet that dries you . You get up , it flushes by itself . The lid closes , it self-cleans . Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it 's a bit of a cultural leap forward . I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet . And I want to get one of these . ( Laughter ) This was another one I could not get a loaner of . Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed . There 's a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it . ( Laughter ) To try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom . Lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things . But anyway , we had a great night's sleep . And you spend a third of your life in bed . I do n't think it 's that bad of a deal . ( Laughter ) This was a fun one . This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car . I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway . And , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods . And it was really amazing . It was such a smooth ride . Most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle . I switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , "" You know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . "" And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth . And if I was a billionaire , I would get one . ( Laughter ) This is a completely gratuitous video I 'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology . This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "" Mission : Impossible III "" premiere . When he tries to open the door , you could call it "" Mission : Impossible IV . "" There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc . The ' 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century . And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape . And 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of Bordeaux . And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following . But it 's 60 years old . There 's not much of it left . What there is of it left you do n't know if it 's real -- it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world . Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist . So , I 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these . I 'd put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty . And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai . Bipin Desai is a UC Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , "" I 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' 47 Cheval Blanc . "" And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc , and 30 vintages of Yquem . And it was an invitation you do not refuse . I went . It was three days , four meals . And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the ' 47 . And you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil . And then I tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways . There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic . There were some people who were a little less impressed . And I was n ' t that impressed . And I do n't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it does n ' t necessarily mean something that I was n ' t impressed , but I was not the only one there who had that reaction . And it was n ' t just to that wine . Any one of the wines served at this tasting , if I 'd been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable . But drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience . And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech . And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags . A lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive . But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag . Thank you . </content"	1

51	"CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice . ' Who are YOU ? ' said the Caterpillar . This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . Alice replied , rather shyly , ' I--I hardly know , sir , just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then . ' ' What do you mean by that ? ' said the Caterpillar sternly . ' Explain yourself ! ' ' I ca n ' t explain MYSELF , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . ' ' I do n't see , ' said the Caterpillar . ' I 'm afraid I ca n ' t put it more clearly , ' Alice replied very politely , ' for I ca n ' t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . ' ' It is n't , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , perhaps you have n ' t found it so yet , ' said Alice ; ' but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day , you know--and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n ' t you ? ' ' Not a bit , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , perhaps your feelings may be different , ' said Alice ; ' all I know is , it would feel very queer to ME . ' ' You ! ' said the Caterpillar contemptuously . ' Who are YOU ? ' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation . Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who YOU are , first . ' ' Why ? ' said the Caterpillar . Here was another puzzling question ; and as Alice could not think of any good reason , and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind , she turned away . ' Come back ! ' the Caterpillar called after her . ' I 've something important to say ! ' This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again . ' Keep your temper , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Is that all ? ' said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could . ' No , ' said the Caterpillar . Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . For some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , ' So you think you 're changed , do you ? ' ' I 'm afraid I am , sir , ' said Alice ; ' I ca n ' t remember things as I used--and I do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! ' ' Ca n ' t remember WHAT things ? ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , I 've tried to say "" HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE , "" but it all came different ! ' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice . ' Repeat , "" YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM , "" ' said the Caterpillar . Alice folded her hands , and began : -- ' You are old , Father William , ' the young man said , ' And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head -- Do you think , at your age , it is right ? ' ' In my youth , ' Father William replied to his son , ' I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door -- Pray , what is the reason of that ? ' ' In my youth , ' said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , ' I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box -- Allow me to sell you a couple ? ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak -- Pray how did you manage to do it ? ' ' In my youth , ' said his father , ' I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life . ' ' You are old , ' said the youth , ' one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ? ' ' I have answered three questions , and that is enough , ' Said his father ; ' do n't give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I 'll kick you down stairs ! ' ' That is not said right , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Not QUITE right , I 'm afraid , ' said Alice , timidly ; ' some of the words have got altered . ' ' It is wrong from beginning to end , ' said the Caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes . The Caterpillar was the first to speak . ' What size do you want to be ? ' it asked . ' Oh , I 'm not particular as to size , ' Alice hastily replied ; ' only one does n ' t like changing so often , you know . ' ' I DO N'T know , ' said the Caterpillar . Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper . ' Are you content now ? ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , I should like to be a LITTLE larger , sir , if you would n ' t mind , ' said Alice : ' three inches is such a wretched height to be . ' ' It is a very good height indeed ! ' said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) . ' But I 'm not used to it ! ' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone . And she thought of herself , ' I wish the creatures would n ' t be so easily offended ! ' ' You 'll get used to it in time , ' said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again . This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again . In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself . Then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , ' One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . ' ' One side of WHAT ? The other side of WHAT ? ' thought Alice to herself . ' Of the mushroom , ' said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight . Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question . However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand . ' And now which is which ? ' she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot ! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ' Come , my head 's free at last ! ' said Alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . ' What CAN all that green stuff be ? ' said Alice . ' And where HAVE my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I ca n ' t see you ? ' She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves . As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings . ' Serpent ! ' screamed the Pigeon . ' I 'm NOT a serpent ! ' said Alice indignantly . ' Let me alone ! ' ' Serpent , I say again ! ' repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ' I 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! ' ' I have n ' t the least idea what you 're talking about , ' said Alice . ' I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ' the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; ' but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! ' Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished . ' As if it was n ' t trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the Pigeon ; ' but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day ! Why , I have n ' t had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! ' ' I 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning . ' And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ' continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , ' and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! ' ' But I 'm NOT a serpent , I tell you ! ' said Alice . ' I 'm a--I 'm a -- ' ' Well ! WHAT are you ? ' said the Pigeon . ' I can see you 're trying to invent something ! ' ' I--I 'm a little girl , ' said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . ' A likely story indeed ! ' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . ' I 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that ! No , no ! You 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! ' ' I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly , ' said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; ' but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . ' ' I do n't believe it , ' said the Pigeon ; ' but if they do , why then they 're a kind of serpent , that 's all I can say . ' This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , ' You 're looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? ' ' It matters a good deal to ME , ' said Alice hastily ; ' but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I should n ' t want YOURS : I do n't like them raw . ' ' Well , be off , then ! ' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest . Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height . It was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual . ' Come , there 's half my plan done now ! How puzzling all these changes are ! I 'm never sure what I 'm going to be , from one minute to another ! However , I 've got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done , I wonder ? ' As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high . ' Whoever lives there , ' thought Alice , ' it 'll never do to come upon them THIS size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! ' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high ."	6
1379	I feel that life has become too simplistic . - Why 's that ? Because the environment is no longer willing . We have an environment around us at home , and there 's an environment here that tends to your daily welfare . When you live in a tower block this environment is responsible for your well-being . But if it 's damaged you 'll also get damaged , and people go under if they do n't get out of it . If they just wait for it to go away . - Are things different here than at home ?

1393	Night vision scopes have been a quite significant tool for organizations like law enforcement and the military ever since the technology became available , and night scopes have turn into a big-name item amongst sportsmen as well due to advances and affordability with the tech . nighvision is provided in a number of of sizes and useage from portable products to mounted items . You can find Night scopes in almost every price range imaginable and with certain significantly nice options even . Of course , it is all going to depend on what you will use the scope for as to what you will purchase . Having night vision gives you the ability to see in a dark surrounding . experiencing in the dark is produced achievable by a combination of two approaches , namely : having good enough spectral range , and intensity range . Human vision is limited to a mini portion of the electromagnetic night vision spectrum called the Visible light Spectrum . By improving spectral range , a viewer can take benefit of non-visible possibilities of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared ( IR ) , or ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) . For Security useage , IR radiation is normally used . The military uses nighvision extensively do not should purchase their own gear , we will instead talk a little bit regarding law enforcement , since a number of law enforcement officers do buy their own gear . When an officer purchases a night scope , he has to think of the setting he is going to be operating in , target acquisition , observation , and intelligence gathering capabilities of his nighvision item . He will also have to pay focused to how sturdy the item is too as how it will react to different types of conditions , due to here reliability does count . enough intensity range is only the ability to see with really little quantities of light . Even though the human visual system can detect one photons ( under right conditions ) , this is far from adequate for great night time viewing . over the use of tech ( Electronics ) , the process of ' experiencing in the dark ' ( nighvision ) can be loosely grouped into two subsets : Passive and Active systems . Under these conditions there is so much light that an IR sensitive video Camera can be used without having to purchase any sort of Image Intensifier . alternative kinds of nighvision devices ( NVD ) such us : nighvision Goggles ( or NVG ) , and Thermal Imaging . NVG utilize two eye pieces . Although a number of security cameras employ night scope technology and are adapted regularly by a few security firms , they may also employ night scopes for night time surveillance . As a rule , these kinds of scopes are handheld or mounted on a tripod rather than installed on a firearm . Again , a number of of the facts that these firms require to appraise about when purchasing night units is how confident , sturdy , and conditions resistant they are . The greatest advantage to security firms utilizing nighvision gear is that these units will increase their option to interdict thieves prior to they can wreak their havoc . They can be configured with one Image Intensifier Tube , where the same image is sent to both eyes , or a divided intensifier tube for every eye .	7
1110	"22 shows to see this month across Asia and beyond in Shanghai , Nanjing , Colombo , Singapore , New York , Milan , San Francisco , Bangkok , and Kochi In the last issue ArtReview Asia began its previews by wondering what the collective noun for a group of biennials was . Having visited three in the past month , it 's decided that it must be a pestilence . It never ends : six biennials previewed in the last issue and two more opening up in the lifespan of this ... What 's that ? Well ... do n't shoot the messenger and stuff ... Oh ... sorry . Got it . Apparently this bit of the magazine is supposed to be about enticing you to go and see art , not putting you off . So , let 's start again . For those of you who ca n't get enough of the biennial experience , never fear . November sees the launch of the Shanghai Biennale and , continuing the theme of Indian artists curating Chinese jamborees ( which starts with the current Yinchuan Biennale , curated by Bose Krishnamachari ) , Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective has taken the helm for Shanghai's big contemporary art event , subtitled Why Not Ask Again : Arguments , Counter-arguments , and Stories . Works by 92 artists and artist groups from 40 countries will populate three floors of the Power Station of Art ( PSA ) , grouped around a series of ' terminals ' that aim to recognise the way in which artists act as the shapers of discourse and engineers of the imagination . Alongside the terminals are four other substructures : the Infra-Curatorial Platform ( seven subexhibitions organised by young curators within the main thematic display ) , 51 Personae ( created with the Dinghai Qiao Mutual Aid Society , and geared to bringing the spaces of everyday life to the biennial ) , Theory Opera ( an exploration of the ' sensuality ' of thoughts ) and City Projects ( which expands the biennale out of the PSA and into the fabric of the city ) . If all that – singing theories , flights of imagination , etc – sounds a bit Willy Wonka-ish in the context of the PSA's factory structure – then it 's only enhanced by the now familiar biennial gibber that constitutes the show's preopening materials , such as : ' Within the frameworks of the thematic exhibition are epiphytically folded the seven layers of the Infra-Curatorial Platform ' . Which sounds genuinely like the recipe for some sort of fantastic seven-layer cake . Still , the real proof of the pudding is in the eating , and Raqs's ambition to connect art to life is very en vogue ( see this summer's Manifesta in Zürich ) . More than that , for every Kendell Geers , Christine Sun Kim , SUPERFLEX or Peter Piller included in this biennial , there are two or three artists whose work ArtReview Asia , at least , has never encountered . And that alone makes this show worth a visit . Over in Nanjing , which this November hosts the third edition of its annual ( shortly to become a more fashionably biennial ) International Art Festival , it 's not the language that 's going to be baffling ( this one is called , rather shoutily , given the capping , HISTORICODE : Scarcity and Supply ) , but the more-than-400 artworks ( by 315 international and Chinese artists ) that will be crammed into the city's new Baijia Lake Museum . One of China's increasing number of private museums , it 's owned by property magnate and art collector Yan Lugen , who also founded the festival . As you might imagine , given their number , the works on show during the festival have been assembled by a committee ( comprising nine curators ) under the direction of chief curator Lu Peng and cocurator Letizia Ragaglia ( director of Museion in Bolzano , Italy ) , and offer up a definitely intriguing mix featuring the output of many of the best-known or most innovative figures in modern and contemporary art . From China there 's work by Wang Qingsong , Zeng Fanzhi and the Gao Brothers ; from the rest of Asia look out for Thailand's Pratchaya Phinthong , Japanese collective Chim ↑ Pom and South Korea's Minouk Lim , and expect them to be joined by international colleagues Francesco Vezzoli , Adel Abdessemed , Walid Raad and , naturally , Joseph Beuys . After all that , this year's Colombo Art Biennale is going to feel like a relatively modest affair . Which , you might say , suits its environment . Moreover , having read the title and advance information about the Shanghai Biennale , you 'll probably feel that Alnoor Mitha's title for this year's edition of the Sri Lankan extravaganza – Conceiving Space – is ludicrously straightforward . It gets worse , as we 're promised an examination of ' space as public and private ; space as protest ; space as tangible and imagined ; space as community , memory and legacy ; space as architectural , conceptual , performative , temporal , spiritual , symbolic , intuitive and rhythmic ; space as liminal and ritualistic ; space as embodied and meditative , virtual and transcendent ' . What is the founding artistic director of the Asia Triennial Manchester thinking by being so direct ? Does n't he know that any self-respecting biennial needs to epiphytically enfold things around its terminals ? Still , like Raqs , Mitha has grasped the idea that the work of artists can be a conduit for engagement and discourse , and is looking to get 40 of them , gathered from around the world , to energise the local artistic community in order to make Colombo one of South Asia's artistic hubs . The community outreach side of things will have a distinctly artistic flavour , with the inclusion of some of architecture 's more unconventional personalities , including Assemble , the collective that won the 2015 Turner Prize ; Will Alsop ; and Madelon Vriesendorp . Look out also for the work of Indian artist Mithu Sen. But you should go to Shanghai first , where the real excitement 's at this November . There 's the biennial , of course , and its opening coincides with not one but two art fairs . Art 021 sees over 80 international galleries crammed into the Shanghai Exhibition Centre ; West Bund Art & Design takes a more boutique approach , with 30 international galleries housed in a cavernous aircraft hangar in Shanghai's up-and-coming West Bund arts district ( next to the Yuz and Long museums ) . Even better , the latter event includes ArtReview Asia Xiàn Chǎng . Yes , we have been busy . Xiàn Chǎng , which roughly translates as ' site ' , ' scene ' ( of a crime ) or ' setting ' , features 24 solo presentations by Merlin James , Bosco Sodi , Laurent Grasso , Haroon Mirza , Shanzhai Biennial , Simon Dybbroe Møller , Bagus Pandega , Sion Sono , Philippe Parreno , Yutaka Sone , Imagokinetics , Wang Shang , Zhang Peili , Hao Jingfang & Wang Lingjie , Wang Yi , Zhang Ruyi , Bi Rongrong , Christopher Orr , Qiu Xiaofei , Jin Shan , Qiu Anxiong , Lu Zhengyuan , Sean Scully and Yi Xin Tong . The works , which are collectively focused on occupying and manipulating space and / or time are housed in a 1 , 000sqm tent and throughout the main fair and the West Bund complex . And obviously it will be so amazing that you wo n't want to soil your eyeballs by going to see anything else . But for those of you gluttons who still do , there 's London's Timothy Taylor Gallery , who in addition to exhibiting at West Bund Art & Design , and who 've recently opened a second space in New York , are expanding further with a pop up exhibition of works by Alex Katz . West Broadway and Spring , the largest-ever presentation of works by the eighty-nine-year-old painter in China , promises to bring some of the flavour of Manhattan , rendered in his typically spare yet iconic style , to Shanghai's Art and Culture Pilot Zone . Katz's paintings – portraits of family ( most famously his wife , Ada ) and friends , flowers and landscapes – offer a signature mix of the universal and the personal as part of the artist 's stated , if Sisyphean , ambition of representing the ' now ' . Maybe it 's as a result of the fallout from Brexit , and the UK capital's need to compensate for the country's referendum debacle by making new international friends , but the London – Shanghai route is one that 's seeing heavy art traffic at the moment , not least in the form of Guan Xiao's exhibition Elastic Sleep , first staged at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts ( ICA ) in the spring , which now returns to the artist's homeland to be showcased at the Chi K11 Art Space in Shanghai . The Beijing-based artist's output – in the form of mysteriously totemic sculptures and drifting , staccato videoworks – focuses on the emergence of a nonlinear sense of time and space , and the relationship between digital and material realities ( a subject that 's more ' now ' , even , than many of Katz's ) , as well as the internal and external sense of connectedness therein : a form of relational aesthetics without the cooking or the sliding , but with the search engine and instantly accessible archive as generators instead . Also at K11 is work by Neïl Beloufa ( he showed at the ICA , with whom K11 has a partnership , in late 2014 ) . Besides being a fashionable play on words , Soft ( a ) ware is the French-Algerian's first institutional solo show in China and will feature existing and newly commissioned works by an artist who combines technology , sculpture and video in immersive , performative environments , with , like Guan Xiao , a focus on the potential for active agency rather than passive viewership in the mix of them all . Welcome to now . Speaking of now , back at the West Bund , be sure to check out Shanghart's new space following its move from long-term digs in the gallery cluster at Moganshan Road . The inaugural show , which celebrates the gallery's 20th anniversary as well as its new home , is titled Holzwege , a term derived by philosopher Martin Heidegger to describe the overgrown , rarely trodden paths through forests that only those native to the environment will recognise . The exhibition looks back on the gallery's pioneering history through the work of 30 artists , ranging from Chen Xiaoyun to Zhang Enli , via Apichatpong Weerasethakul , Jörg Immendorff and Sean Scully . Meanwhile , over ( about six hours south and a little bit west as the airplane flies ) at Shanghart's Singapore outpost , multimedia art and its representations of the ' now ' take centre stage . The Dynamics is a group exhibition featuring Hu Jieming , one of the pioneers of video and multimedia art in China , as well as compatriots Jiang Pengyi , Lu Lei , Shao Yi , Xu Zhen , Yang Zhenzhong and Zhang Ding , in an orgy of time-based artworks . Not content with just having had a solo project ( which ended in September and apparently evoked wilted blooms , carcasses and crumpled paper ) in Paris's Palais de Tokyo or with being included in the current Singapore Biennale , Filipino artist Patricia Perez Eustaquio is also having a November solo exhibition ( Flowers for X ) in the city-state's Yavuz Gallery . Milking it ! Anyway , in Gillman Barracks ( where Yavuz is located ) the Manila-based artist will be continuing her meditation on objects that have reached the end of their useful lives , here via a series of painted tondos featuring flowers that have just passed their prime . Sound like something that belongs in sixteenth - or seventeenth-century interior design ? That 's part of the point . It 's not just flowers that fade , but also artistic styles and tastes . And love , of course , if you want to be romantic about things . The antique flavour is enhanced by the fact that the flowers are rendered in an ' unfashionable ' manner generally associated with classic Dutch still lifes . The result is both a memento to and warning about fashion , taste , consumption , ornament and the inevitable passing of time . Look out , Singapore . Also meditating on the vagaries of chance and deploying art's ' old-fashioned medium ' is Singaporean artist Heman Chong ( regular readers will know by now that it 's almost as compulsory for ArtReview Asia to mention Chong in every issue as it is for it to bandy about references to Rirkrit Tiravanija ) , who has a hometown solo show , titled Portals , Loopholes and Other Transgressions , at Fost . Alongside a series of four new large-scale paintings will be NO or ON ( 2016 ) , a sculpture that comes with the following instruction : ' You can show the work as "" NO "" or "" ON "" : it 's completely up to you ' . Rope , Barrier , Boundary ( 2015 ) – a sculpture that was part of Chong's 2015 exhibition at the South London Gallery – featured a rope and stanchions arbitrarily dividing the exhibition space into two parts , which visitors could cross if they wished : most wished not to . Chong's upcoming show extend this investigation into the nature of intentionality and decision making in art , and the general exercise of free will . Back in 2013 , self-taught Indonesian artist Jompet Kuswidananto ( he comes from a musical and performance background ) won the Prince Claus Award with his theatre group Teater Garasi ( a collective with whom he has worked since 1998 ) , and one year later he picked up the Prudential Asian Eye Award for his performative installation work , which generally deploys sound , video , sculpture and interactive mechanical parts . Both aspects of his output will be on show in his solo exhibition at Singapore's Esplanade . Jompet's work takes theatre as the stage upon which the swings and roundabouts of Indonesia's recent sociopolitical history ( from the colonial to the post-1998 democracy periods ) and the conflicts of globalisation are made manifest . That 's why this show is titled Theatre State . Jompet brings to light frictions of governmentality ( the governing and the governed ) , public and private space , and community dynamics in works that provide a less potentially kitsch alternative to the better-known ( and more art-fair friendly ) output of Javanese compatriots such as Heri Dono and Entang Wiharso . Talking of the better-known , this November Kishio Suga brings a recreation of his 1973 work Placement of Condition to Dia : Chelsea in New York ; almost incredibly it 's the influential Japanese artist's first solo show at a US institution . Perhaps it 's a sign of contemporary art's terrifying quest for ' nowness ' and novelty ( though more likely that 's the result of laziness ) that The Art Newspaper trialled the work under the headline ' Kishio Suga's 70s throwback at Dia : Chelsea ' , going on to describe how the artist was ' resurrecting ' the work , which comprises a series of marble columns leaning in different directions but linked by wire that coils around the columns so as to fix them in a network of what looks like mutual support , as if this founding member of what became known as Mono-ha ( the School of Things ) were some sort of modern-day Dr Frankenstein . Other people might say that the work ( fitting for Dia : Chelsea , housed as it is in a marble-cutting factory ) was an apt material summary of the immaterial connections that bind societies together . But go check it out for yourselves ; you should never trust journalists . Simultaneously , Suga has his first European retrospective , titled Situations , at Milan's Pirelli Hangar Bicocca , the cavernous spaces of which host more than 20 of the artist's installations . Look out among them for Critical Sections , which has been reconstructed for the first time since 1984 and features strips of black and of white fabric , hung from the ceiling and interwoven with tree branches found onsite , the whole connected to zinc plates on the floor . ' I bring a variety of things into the gallery , arranging them and giving them structure so that they occupy the entire space . The installations are never permanent and can be quickly disassembled or demolished . One might say that I create temporary worlds , ' the artist wrote in 2009 . Earlier on ArtReview Asia mentioned that Joseph Beuys would make a natural inclusion in the Nanjing International Festival . In part because his concept of artworks as social sculptures is having something of a resurgence of late ( to a greater degree even than the prevalence it has always had ) and partly as a response to the fact that we live in a time when large parts of the world ( Europe , the US and West Asia in particular ) are subject to a politics that seeks a certain social atomisation . Or , following the lead of some of ArtReview Asia ' s colleagues at T ** A ** N ******** , it might be because the artistic ' throwback ' is in fashion – take your pick . In any case , one of the more prominent figures to engage with notions of social sculpture is Japanese artist Koki Tanaka . This month his projects , which take the social as a central methodology , will be on show at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco . Including works from a series where people with a shared profession or interest are asked to collaborate to produce an artwork , the exhibition , Potters and Poets , gathers together A Poem Written by 5 Poets at Once ( First Attempt ) and A Pottery Produced by 5 Potters at Once ( Silent Attempt ) ( both 2013 ) , which will be here represented primarily by video documentation of the original performances . In the first project , five Japanese poets who write and compose in different styles work to produce a collaborative poem ; in the second , five potters make a series of vessels . The end results are a mixed bag , but that 's the participants' work , not Tanaka's . He documents the negotiation ( sometimes verbal , sometimes silent ) between the participants and the means by which they engineer a final product ( sometimes by one participant taking the lead , at other times through more egalitarian cooperation ) . One show that , despite the most obvious reading of its title , claims to be steering away from memorialising any artistic ' trends or phenomena ' is Tales of Our Time at the Guggenheim Museum in New York . Moreover , the seven Chinese artists and one artist group ( Chia-En Jao , Kan Xuan , Sun Xun , Sun Yuan & Peng Yu , TsangKin-Wah , Yangjiang Group and ZhouTao ) whose work is on show seek to challenge fixed notions of place and the truth of official histories . The exhibition's title derives from Lu Xun's last collection of fiction , Gushi xin bian ( Old Tales Retold , 1936 ) . In it , Lu Xun ( the pen name of Zhou Shuren ) , one of the leading figures of Chinese modern literature , recasts ancient fables to critique social norms and highlight the problems of his era . In the exhibition , organised by Xiaoyu Weng and Hou Hanru , the artists will deploy various types of narrative that blur fact and fiction in order to illuminate and investigate social and political tensions worldwide and in particular the notion of China as a fixed identity . Taking his own approach to notions of history and identity is Cambodian artist Sopheap Pich . Pich was born in Battambang , studied in Chicago ( his family fled to the US in 1984 , during Vietnamese occupation following the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge ) and has been based in Phnom Penh since 2002 ; trained as a painter , he is best known for creating sculpture out of local bamboo . The material qualities of a variety of local and found materials ( which also include burlap , stone and rattan ) remain central to Pich's work : ' They were the stuff of childhood memories , ' he has said in the past . As well as being the vehicles for an exploration of personal identity , these materials are , in this artist's hands , a means of exploring narratives surrounding the contemporary social and political history of his homeland , while grounding them in the reality of daily life . His solo exhibition at H Space in Bangkok provides an opportunity to review past work and preview new experiments . Next stop for Pich : Christine Macel's 2017 Venice Biennale . The relationship between art and life also features heavily in the work of Taipei-based Hong Kong artist Lee Kit , whose work , which began with his painting check patterns onto clothes , tablecloths and napkins ( which he used ) and has evolved into no less intimate installations and conceptual projects , operates on the borders of domestic / private and public space and confronts broader sociopolitical issues through objects that are right in front of him . Look for more of this mixing of the indirect with the direct in his third solo show ( alongside painter Wang Yi's first solo show at the gallery , featuring his colourful , trippy geometric abstractions ) at Aike-Dellarco , who 've recently moved to ... yes , you guessed it : Shanghai's West Bund . Now there 's a place that is beginning to have a fixed identity . And just to ram that last point home , MadeInGallery , founded in 2014 by influential multimedia artist Xu Zhen ( who also , since 2009 , has operated as MadeIn Company , with Xu Zhen as a subbrand ) , has moved from Moganshan Road to Longteng Avenue , on the fringe of the West Bund development . This November Xu Zhen ( the brand ) opens Store , a show retailing artworks , clothes and other objects created by the brand : all part of Xu Zhen ( the person ) ' s ongoing investigation into the ways in which art circulates in a world dominated by a digital culture in which , in his words , ' "" sharing "" provides the starting point for "" owning "" ' . Look out for African tribal sculptures fused ( at the groin ) with manga dolls ( new works from the artist's Evolution series ) and some similarly bizarre paintings from his Losing Control series ( both 2016 ) . And so , to the end of this month's art tour and the eternal return of the biennial : this time in India , at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale , curated by Indian artist Sudarshan Shetty and titled forming in the pupil of an eye . Shetty's concept focuses on the location of ' the contemporary ' through an examination of the notion of ' tradition ' as an evolving rather than a stable motif , and breaking down specialist notions of art by featuring contributions by practitioners from a diverse range of disciplines , from visual artists and musicians , to performers and poets . Central to all this , and to the ethos of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale itself , is the notion that art exists within , rather than apart from , a community . In terms of his own work , Shetty has previously described a tactic of trying ' to seduce with the familiar ' , and to a degree one can see similar tactics in the work of included artists such as Ahmet Öğüt , Stan Douglas , Paweł Althamer , Praneet Soi , T.V. Santhosh , Charles Avery and Yuko Mohri . They 'll be showing alongside a ' Student's Biennale ' involving 60 Indian art colleges and ' Art by Children ' , a ' children only ' event that aims at initiating the young in the appreciation of art , both as artists and as audience . With that kind of indoctrination , it looks like biennale-tourism will be an even bigger thing for generations to come . This article first appeared in the Winter 2016 issue of ArtReview Asia ."	5
500	"Friday , 16 August , 2002 , 02 : 36 GMT 03 : 36 UK Teachers get advice on violence Teachers are increasingly concerned about violent pupils A teachers' union is so concerned about the growing incidents of violence and disruption in schools , it has issued its members with new guidance for their own protection . For the first time , diaries sent to all National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers ( NASUWT ) members this week will outline how teachers can best tackle the problem . It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work Eamonn O ' Kane , NASUWT The guidelines urge teachers to report all incidents of actual or threatened assault or criminal damage to the police . The advice also recommends staff be given training in avoiding and managing dangerous situations . The NASUWT calls on head teachers to introduce a code of "" zero tolerance "" towards pupils who have been excluded And parents who have been abusive or violent towards staff should be banned from school premises . A failure by schools to put in place adequate protection for teachers may lead to risk assessments for violent and disruptive pupils and a refusal to teach those who pose a real danger , the union warns . Violent pupils NASUWT general secretary Eamonn O ' Kane said : "" It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work . "" "" NASUWT guidance highlights options available to limit the threat . By including this in the diary , every member can carry round details of the steps necessary to protect themselves in school . "" Although the numbers of pupils excluded last year went up for the first time in the past six years , NASUWT remains concerned that governing bodies continue to readmit violent and disruptive pupils . "" Last month the Department for Education issued posters to all schools in England warning parents they faced prosecution if they threatened or abused staff . The posters , similar to those found in hospitals and on public transport , were accompanied by a "" toolkit "" setting out the legal position on parental violence ."	8
1355	"Tax Office intensifies attack on cash economy tax avoiders Unless you 've been holed up in a bunker , you would probably have heard about the ATO's campaign to unearth the perpetrators of tax avoidance . Labelled their ' cash economy ' drive and launched in 2009 , the ATO is on a crusade to quash tax avoidance , collect back-taxes with penalties , and bring everyone up to speed as to their responsibilities as to record keeping and maintaining adequate records . The ATO said , "" The cash economy occurs when people in business deliberately use cash transactions to hide income and evade tax obligations . We are making it harder for them to get away with not reporting cash income – making it fairer for everyone . "" ATO's cash economy campaign was recently elevated to a new level as The National Tax & Accountants' Association reported , "" There is no question that the Tax Office is continuing to turn up the heat on the cash economy and has now risk-profiled certain accounting / tax practices which can expect special attention . "" "" Anyone who thinks that the Tax Office wo n't expect the above from every tax agent in the near future must have rocks in their head , "" NTAA said . In other words , ATO suspects that some tax agents might be complicit in tax avoidance . Clearly the Tax Office is digging deeper and seeking to make examples , but there is no question that this activity will in some way affect every business owner . To strengthen their efforts , the ATO recently issued an update on their small business benchmarks and published six new industry benchmarks for landscape construction services , motor vehicle retailers ( new and used ) , panel beating and smash repairers , lawn mowing and garden services , tattooing services and pharmacies . Over the next 12 months the ATO intends to publish benchmarks for a further 30 industries where there is a higher risk of ' cash economy activity ' . Record-keeping is the name of the game if you want to avoid the taxman's concerned gaze upon your business , so it is timely to remind business owners of the ATO's stance on it . Record keeping is a legal requirement . By law , businesses must keep records for five years after they are prepared , obtained or the transaction is complete , whichever occurs last . Your records must be in English and in a form that the ATO can access and understand to work out the amount of tax a taxpayer is liable to pay . Calculating your correct tax liability and keeping proper business records is becoming more onerous with the responsibility to do so being spurred on by the few who ca n't be bothered , have poor knowledge or who intentionally set out to deceive the ATO . If you 're unsure of your tax position or of sound record keeping procedures for your business , call OBT on 07 5462 2277 to discuss the gaps to get back on the front foot legally and fast . As the ATO uses valuable taxpayer revenues to fund their cash economy drive to make prosecutions , ask yourself if you 're in a safe position should your business or your tax agent be questioned . ATO has the manpower , the brain power and the might to doggedly pursue tax avoiders – could you last the distance should your business come under review ? About OBT"	0

167	These are grim economic times fellow TEDsters , grim economic times indeed . And so , I would like to cheer you up with one of the great , albeit largely unknown , commercial success stories of the past 20 years . Comparable , in its own very peculiar way , to the achievements of Microsoft or Google . And it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity . I refer to organized crime . Now organized crime has been around for a very long time , I hear you say . And these would be wise words , indeed . But in the last two decades it has experienced an unprecedented expansion . Now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP . I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy , or McMafia , for short . So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ? Well , of course , there is globalization , technology , communications , all that stuff , which we 'll talk about a little bit later . But first , I would like to take you back to this event . The collapse of communism . All across Eastern Europe , a most momentous episode in our post-war history . Now it 's time for full disclosure . This event meant a great deal to me personally . I had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe , like Solidarity in Poland , when I was in my teens . I then started writing about Eastern Europe , and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region . Which is what I was doing in 1989 . And so when 425 million people finally won the right to chose their own governments I was ecstatic . But I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall . It was n ' t long , for example , before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia . And amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in Eastern Europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there . Obviously there were characters like this . But there were also more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe . Like this character . Remember these guys ? They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling , every four years in the Olympics . And they were the great celebrities of communism . With a fabulous lifestyle to go with it . The used to get great apartments in the center of town . Casual sex on tap . And they could travel to the West very freely , which was a great luxury at the time . It may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe . Or as I like to call them , they are the midwives of capitalism . Here are some of those same wieghtlifters after their 1989 makeover . Now in Bulgaria , this photograph was taken in Bulgaria , when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe it was n ' t just communism , it was the state that collapsed as well . That means your police force was n ' t working . The court system was n ' t functioning properly . So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ? Well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies . We prefer to know them as the mafia . And in Bulgaria , the mafia was soon joined with 14 thousand people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991 . Now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14 thousand men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks , and killing people . But that 's what happened all over Eastern Europe . Now , when I was working in the 1990s I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia . And I could n ' t help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates . And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise . And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen , by talking to victims , by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services . But above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves . And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start . Why ? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing . But also , as they say in the retail trade , it 's location location location . And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world . Heroin , cocaine , women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals . And where were they heading ? The European Union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization . Transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history . Eventually comprising some 500 million people . And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes , sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers . Now , organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business . It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia . It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans . And then , of course , it has zones of consumption , like the European Union , Japan and of course , the United States . The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world . And they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed . Take Mexico for example . Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade . But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ? Since 1998 , five million people have died there . It 's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers . But it 's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War . And why is it ? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region . In the year 2000 , 80 percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo . Now coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone , in almost every laptop and games console . The Cogolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons . And the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets . And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime . Now , let me show you some of my friends in action , caught conveniently on film by the Italian police and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes . Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap . The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world . So if you can smuggle them into the E. U. there are very handsome profits to be made . And I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups . This boat is worth one million Euros when it 's new . And it 's the fastest thing on European waters . From 1994 , for seven years , 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic , from Montenegro to Italy , every single night . And as a consequence of this trade Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue . And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals . Now Italian police , when this trade started , had just two boats which could go at the same speed . And this is very important , because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas . Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution . And if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys . So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys . And the answer is six vessels . And remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night . So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ? Well , this is where we come to globalization because that was not just the deregulation of global trade . It was the liberalization of international financial markets . And boy did that make it easy for the money launderers . The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre . In the 1990s we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business . And there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering . And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked . But at the heart of this , is the offshore banking network . Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade . And if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them . On a positive note , we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities . And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation , regulation , effective regulation , I say , let 's take a look at Bernie Madoff , who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail . Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars . That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels , and the major Russian crime syndicates . But he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street . And no regulator picked up on it . So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall street , or in the city of London , fleecing ordinary folk , and money laundering ? Well I can tell you , it 's quite a few of them . Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now . And that is narcotics . Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning . This one , however , is in central British Columbia where I photographed it . It 's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B. C. which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade . Now I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera , of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B. C. Bud , as it 's called , in part because it 's marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in California . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now even by the police's asmission this makes not a dent in the profits , really , of the major exporters . Since the beginning of globalization the global narcotics market has expanded enormously . There has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces . This , however , may all be about to change . Because something very strange is going on . The United Nations recognized earlier this , it was last month actually , that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs . Interestingly , the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs . Now that is a game changer . Because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world . When that happens it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West . The drugs policy which we 've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion . Now , the recession . Well , organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession . Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world . And it has no rules to its regulatory system . Except , of course , it has two business risks , arrest by law enforcement , which is , frankly , the least of their worries , and competition from other groups , i . e . a bullet in the back of the head . What they 've done is they 've shifted their operations . People do n't smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession . And so instead they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime . And its been terribly successful . I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle . Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle . I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal . We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo , together . Hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank . It 's really not that difficult . And it 's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it 's not so much the technology . The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering . Or to use the technical term for it , there 's one born every minute . You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest . And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this , of course , the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise sex and love . I expect some of you remember the I-Love-You virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came . I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out . Because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine . Now she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time , but love was not amongst them . ( Laughter ) And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin , and spared myself a very nasty infection . So , cybercrime , do watch out for it . One thing that we do know that the internet is doing is , the internet is assisting these guys . These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense . Now , Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection . But over the past year or so researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what 's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance . And they fear that the reason it 's developing a resistance is because Cambodians ca n ' t afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the Internet . And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient . Which is why things are , the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance . The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives . You do n't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime . They affect our bank accounts . They affect our communications , our pension funds . They even affect the food that we eat and our governments . This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York . There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century . This is a mighty industry and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes . It is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously . It 's been a privilege talking to you . Thank you very much . ( Applause ) </content	0
1002	"New figures from the International Air Travel Association ( IATA ) reveal that international passenger numbers are on the rise . International air passenger traffic in the first four months of 2005 was 8.7 per cent higher than the same period in 2004 . Year-on-year figures for April showed a 7.5 per cent increase . There was also a 4.7 per cent year-on-year increase in Cargo traffic during the first four months of the year . However , capacity expansion lagged behind passenger traffic in all regions , averaging 73.6 per cent during the first quarter of this year . IATA director general Giovanni Bisignani warned that despite rising passenger numbers , soaring fuel costs were hitting airlines hard , predicting an industry loss of $ 5 . 5 billion ( ? 3 . 02 billion ) this year . "" However you look at it , 2005 is shaping up to be another difficult year for the airlines , "" he said . "" Fundamental and large-scale change is absolutely critical . "" The IATA is expected to press for further deregulation at its annual meeting in Tokyo next week , criticising governments and airports . Mr Bisignani told a press conference today : "" Airlines moved fast after September 11 , re-engineering , restructuring ... But governments have not played a role . """	8

These consultations involved a review of the work of the relevant Standing Committees of Experts , as recorded in their reports contained in annex IV , with a focus on the actions recommended by the Committees . E. Decisions and recommendations At its fifth plenary meeting , on 13 September 2000 , the Meeting considered matters arising from and in the context of reports to be submitted under Article 7 , including consideration of an amendment to the reporting format . The amendment to the format was adopted and is contained in annex III to this report . In addition , the Meeting reviewed the technical ways and means of circulating reports as adopted at the First Meeting , without making any changes to these , with the exception of encouraging States Parties to submit reports electronically and , when submitting an annual update , to highlight changes in relation to earlier reports . Further to the recommendations made by the Standing Committee of Experts on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , the Meeting recognized the continuing importance of the intersessional work programme and , at its fifth plenary meeting , on 13 September 2000 , agreed that the second intersessional work programme would be adjusted according to the President = s paper , which is contained in annex II . Further consultations identified the following States Parties as the Committee Co-Chairs and Rapporteurs until the end of the Third Meeting of the States Parties : - Mine Clearance and Related Technologies : Netherlands and Peru ( Co-Chairs ) ; Germany and Yemen ( Rapporteurs ) ; - Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness : Japan and Nicaragua ( Co-Chairs ) ; Canada and Honduras ( Rapporteurs ) ; - Stockpile Destruction : Malaysia and Slovakia ( Co-Chairs ) ; Australia and Croatia ( Rapporteurs ) ; - General Status and Operation of the Convention : Belgium and Zimbabwe ( Co-Chairs ) ; Norway and Thailand ( Rapporteurs ) . States Parties recognized that the work of the Standing Committees would require a high degree of coordination between the Co-Chairs to ensure that their work would facilitate the successful implementation of the Convention . In this context the States Parties established a Coordinating Committee of Co-Chairs , which will meet on an ad hoc basis under the chairmanship of the current President of the Meeting of the States Parties . This Committee will serve to coordinate matters relating to and flowing from the work of the Standing Committees with the work of the Meetings of the States Parties . As appropriate , the Committee can call upon any relevant party to assist in its work , including past Presidents , past Co-Chairs , and representatives of other States Parties and organizations . The Meeting also noted the work undertaken by interested States Parties to establish a sponsorship programme to ensure more widespread representation at meetings of the Convention . States Parties endorsed , and expressed satisfaction with , the work of the Standing Committees of Experts , warmly welcoming the reports of the Standing Committees of Experts , as contained in annex IV . The Meeting was in general agreement with the recommendations made by the Standing Committees of Experts and urged States Parties and all other relevant parties , where appropriate , to act with urgency on these recommendations . At its eighth plenary meeting , on 15 September 2000 , the Meeting agreed that the Third Meeting of the States Parties would be held on 18 to 21 September 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua . At the same plenary , the Meeting adopted the Declaration of the Second Meeting of the States Parties , which is contained in Part II of this report . In addition , the Meeting warmly welcomed the President = s Action Programme , contained in annex V , as a practical means of facilitating implementation of the Convention in accordance with the recommendations made by the Standing Committees of Experts . Documentation A list of documents of the Second Meeting is contained in annex I to this report . Adoption of the Final Report and conclusion of the Second Meeting At its eighth and final plenary meeting , on 15 September 2000 , the Meeting adopted its draft Final Report , contained in document APLC / MSP . 2 / 2000 / L. 8 . We , the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction , along with other States , international organizations and institutions and non-governmental organizations , are gathered in Geneva , Switzerland to reaffirm our unwavering commitment both to the total eradication of anti-personnel mines and to addressing the insidious and inhumane effects of these weapons . We celebrate the ongoing growth in support for the Convention and our satisfaction with the general status and operation of it : over 100 States have formally accepted the obligations of the Convention ; over 20 States Parties have completed destruction of stockpiled anti-personnel mines and a further 23 States Parties are in the process of destroying stockpiles ; the new international norm established by the Convention is taking hold as demonstrated by the behaviour of many States not parties to the Convention ; and approximately US $ 250 million has been allocated by donors over the past year to address the global landmine problem . We recognize that much work remains . However , we are pleased that our efforts are making a difference : considerable areas of mined land have been cleared over the past year ; casualty rates have been reduced in several of the world = s most mine-affected States ; and more and better efforts are being undertaken to assist landmine victims . While we celebrate the success of the Convention , we remain deeply concerned that anti-personnel mines continue to kill , maim and threaten the lives of countless innocent people each day ; that the terror of mines prevents individuals from reclaiming their lives ; and that the lasting impact of these weapons denies communities the opportunity to rebuild long after conflicts have ended . We deplore the continued use of anti-personnel mines . Such acts are contrary to the aims of the Convention and exacerbate the humanitarian problems already caused by the use of these weapons . We call upon all those who continue to use anti-personnel mines , as well as those who develop , produce , otherwise acquire , stockpile , retain and transfer these weapons , to cease now and to join us in the task of eradicating these weapons . We implore those States that have declared their commitment to the object and purpose of the Convention and that continue to use anti-personnel mines to recognize that this is a clear violation of their solemn commitment . We call upon all States concerned to respect their commitments . We celebrate this Second Meeting of the States Parties . But we recognize that achieving the promise of this unique and important humanitarian instrument rests in continuing to be tireless in our efforts to end the use of anti-personnel mines , to eradicate stockpiles , to cease development , production and transfers of these weapons , to clear mined areas in order to free land from its deadly bondage , to assist victims to reclaim their lives and to prevent new victims . We also recognize that these are common tasks for humanity and therefore call upon all governments and people everywhere to join us in this effort . We call upon those in a position to do so to provide technical and financial assistance to meet the enormous challenges of mine action , and , whenever relevant , to integrate these efforts into development planning and programming . We call upon those States that have not formally accepted the obligations of the Convention to ratify or accede to it promptly . We call upon all States that are in the process of formally accepting the obligations of the Convention to apply provisionally the terms of the Convention . And we call upon one another as States Parties to effectively implement the Convention and to comply fully with its provisions . We reiterate that , as a community dedicated to seeing an end to the use of anti-personnel mines , our assistance and cooperation will flow primarily to those who have foresworn the use of these weapons forever through adherence to and implementation of the Convention . While we realize that our task is huge , we warmly welcome the substantial progress that has been made during the intersessional work programme and the accomplishments of this programme = s Standing Committees of Experts . We recall that the intersessional work programme was established at the First Meeting of the States Parties to focus and advance the international community = s mine action efforts and to measure progress made in achieving its objectives . We express our satisfaction that the intersessional work programme has lived up to this promise , has assisted in developing a global picture of priorities consistent with the obligations and time-frames contained within the Convention , and has been undertaken in a manner consistent with the Convention = s tradition of inclusivity , partnership , dialogue , openness and practical cooperation . We acknowledge that the progress made during the intersessional work programme was significantly enhanced by the substantive participation of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and other relevant non-governmental organizations , and by regional and international organizations , including the International Committee of the Red Cross . We express our gratitude to these organizations for their important contributions and we thank the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining for its support of the first intersessional work programme and its commitment to continuing to support future intersessional work . Building upon the accomplishments of the intersessional work programme , including increased participation in the work of the Convention by mine-affected States , we call upon all interested parties to continue to participate in the work of the Standing Committees between now and the next Meeting of the States Parties , which will take place on 18 to 21 September 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua . In reflecting upon our progress and accomplishments , and in considering the work that lies ahead , we reconfirm our conviction to make anti-personnel mines objects of the past , our obligation to assist those who have fallen victim to this terror , and our shared responsibility to the memories of those whose lives have been lost as a result of the use of these weapons , including those killed as a result of their dedication to helping others by clearing mined areas or providing humanitarian assistance .

In terms of this decision , informal open-ended Standing Committees of Experts ( SCEs ) were established to focus on the following themes : - Mine clearance ; - Victim assistance , socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness ; - Stockpile destruction ; - Technologies for mine action ; - General status and operation of the Convention . It was further decided that the SCEs could meet on , at least , an annual basis . The SCEs = work programmes for 1999 and 2000 were organized in five periods of meetings in September and December 1999 , January , March and May 2000 . This work programme , together with the annual Meeting of the States Parties , meant that six periods of meetings were held to promote and facilitate the implementation of mine action in the context of the obligations of the Convention . Although the work programme of the SCEs succeeded in facilitating and supporting the effective functioning of the Convention , the extensive work programme , to a certain degree , constrained participation in , and the efficient organization of , the work of the SCEs . At the 10-11 January 2000 meeting of the SCE on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , the experience with the first meetings of the SCEs was discussed . The need for streamlining the work of the SCEs was identified as well as the importance of broadening the participation in the work of the Committees . At this meeting , it was recommended that the Co-Chairs of this SCE carry out consultations with the objective of formulating concrete suggestions on how the intersessional work programme could be adjusted . In this regard and in addition to various consultations , an informal open-ended consultation session was held at the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining ( GICHD ) in Geneva on 10 April 2000 , to which States Parties , other States , the International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) and the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) were invited . As a result of these consultations , the Co-Chairs of the SCE understood that there was a strong consensus in favour of streamlining the post-Second Meeting of the States Parties ( SMSP ) intersessional work programme . To this end , a series of recommendations were drafted and accepted at the 29-30 May 2000 meeting of the SCE . These recommendations are as follows : Duration of meetings As opposed to the current six periods of meetings , totalling six weeks in duration , it was recommended that only three periods of meetings be held annually , including the Meeting of the States Parties . That is , each SCE shall meet twice between Meetings of the States Parties , once during an initial week-long session of meetings in November or December 2000 and once during a week-long session of meetings in May 2001 . Number of SCEs In the interest of promoting efficiency , directly related themes should be merged into one SCE . It was , therefore , recommended that the SCEs for mine clearance and technologies for mine action be combined into one SCE . Therefore , there would be four SCEs as follows : - Mine clearance and related technologies ( meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) ; - Victim assistance , socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness ( meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) ; - Stockpile destruction ( meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) ; - General status and operation of the Convention ( meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) . Language of proceedings To further enhance active participation in the work of the SCEs , it was recommended that those States in a position to do so consider making voluntary contributions to have additional languages made available for the intersessional meetings . Dates of meetings It was recommended that the first of the two week-long sessions of meetings take place 4-8 December 2000 . It was further recommended that the second of the two week-long sessions of meetings take place 7-11 May 2001 . For example : Role of Co-Chairs It was recommended that Co-Chairs seek , as appropriate , the ongoing support and advice of past Co-Chairs . Name Change It was recommended that what has been to date known as Standing Committees of Experts now be referred to as Standing Committees . Co-Chairs and Rapporteurs As a result of consultations , it was recommended that the following States Parties serve as Co-Chairs and Rapporteurs between the SMSP and the end of the Third Meeting of the States Parties : PRESIDENT = S PAPER ON AMENDING THE Background At the January meeting of the Standing Committee of Experts on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , the Article 7 reporting process was discussed . While lessons were learned about difficulties encountered by States Parties in implementing this provision of the Convention , it was the sense of the Co-Chairs that there was general satisfaction with the reporting format accepted at the First Meeting of the States Parties in Maputo . As well , ideas were put forward with respect to possibilities for States Parties to update reports via the Internet . The United Nations should be recognized for the work it has undertaken to develop these ideas . However , concerns were expressed that several States Parties have not submitted reports on time and that of those that have , few have done so electronically . Therefore , it was the sense of the Co-Chairs that while working toward more efficient Internet-based reporting would be a worthwhile medium-term goal , current efforts with respect to Article 7 reporting should focus on increasing the rate of compliance and ensuring that States in a position to do so submit reports electronically . In addition , as part of the work programme of the Standing Committee of Experts on Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness , the Victim Assistance Reporting Network Group ( VARNG ) developed a draft reporting form and recommended its acceptance at the 29-31 March 2000 meeting of the SCE on Victim Assistance . The recommendation was not accepted , as States Parties expressed concerns , which included concern that the process may duplicate existing reporting efforts , Areporting fatigue @ , the fact that victim assistance is just one of several Article 6 obligations for which reporting is not an obligation for States Parties , and the difficulties that would be faced by mine-affected States in responding to the proposed form . The Co-Chairs of the SCE on the General Status and Operation of the Convention recognized the important role that the SCE on Victim Assistance played in highlighting the need for instruments to indicate the extent to which States Ain a position to do so @ have met their obligations under Article 6 of the Convention , particularly the obligation to Aprovide assistance for the care and rehabilitation , and social and economic reintegration , of mine victims @ . As a possible means of meeting the need highlighted by the SCE on Victim Assistance in a manner that is sensitive to the concerns expressed by States Parties at the March meeting of that Standing Committee , the Co-Chairs of the SCE on the General Status and Operation of the Convention proposed amending the Article 7 reporting format to include an additional form for voluntary reporting on these matters . The proposal put forward by the Co-Chairs was designed to provide an opportunity for States Parties to submit voluntary reports on matters considered important in complying with obligations under Article 6 , paragraph 3 . However , this proposal was also designed to provide States Parties with maximum flexibility in making voluntary reports and to capture , at the discretion of each individual State Party , additional matters pertaining to the implementation of the Convention not covered by formal Article 7 reporting requirements . At the 29-30 May 2000 meeting of the SCE on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , this proposal , in the form of the following recommendations , was accepted : - In order to provide States Parties with the opportunity to report voluntarily on matters pertaining to compliance and implementation not covered by the formal reporting requirements contained in Article 7 , it was recommended that the Article 7 reporting format be amended to include an additional form . ( See attached AForm J : Other relevant matters @ . - It was further recommended that States Parties consider using this form to report on activities undertaken with respect to Article 6 , in particular to report on assistance provided for the care and rehabilitation , and social and economic reintegration , of mine victims . Form J : Other relevant matters Remark : States Parties may use this form to report voluntarily on other relevant matters , including matters pertaining to compliance and implementation not covered by the formal reporting requirements contained in Article 7 . States Parties are encouraged to use this form to report on activities undertaken with respect to Article 6 , and in particular to report on assistance provided for the care and rehabilitation , and social and economic reintegration , of mine victims . State [ Party ] : _______________________________ reporting for time period from _______to________ [ Narrative / reference to other reports ] Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Mine Clearance to the Second Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention Introduction The Standing Committee of Experts ( SCE ) on Mine Clearance , established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of the States Parties ( FMSP ) , met in Geneva from 13-15 September 1999 and from 27-29 March 2000 . At the FMSP , it was agreed in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its annex IV that Mozambique and the United Kingdom would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE , with the Netherlands and Peru serving as Co-Rapporteurs . Representatives of 69 States , 8 United Nations bodies , the European Commission , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , the International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) and of numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in either or both of the two meetings . The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining ( GICHD ) . Matters reviewed by the SCE The SCE considered progress in reviewing and revising international standards for humanitarian mine clearance . The importance of involving all stakeholders and the need for the effective dissemination and implementation of the standards were discussed . The SCE also considered the conditions necessary for establishing a conducive operating environment for mine clearance , and the desirability of agreeing to guidelines for this . The SCE received progress reports on the Study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action , which is being undertaken by the GICHD on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , on the Level 1 Survey activities of the Survey Action Center ( SAC ) , and on the impact of mine clearance on peacebuilding and reconstruction . The SCE explored how better planning and the setting of priorities could be assisted by the availability of better quality information , both written portfolios of potential mine action projects and electronic information available on web sites . The United Nations Mine Action Service ( UNMAS ) database , Mine Action Investments , was presented . Ways of improving coordination among stakeholders were examined . Options for improving internal coordination within mine-affected countries were discussed , and ways of better disseminating information internationally were proposed . Recognizing the importance in most cases of developing a sustainable national capacity and the valuable role that the national military could play in certain circumstances , the SCE considered issues related to the use of the military and the improvement of training for enhanced management within national mine action centres . Actions taken or in process on the development of specific tools and instruments in order to assist the implementation of the Convention With the active endorsement of the SCE , and on behalf of UNMAS , the GICHD is revising international standards for mine clearance , which will be known as the International Standards for Humanitarian Mine Action and contain a glossary of terms and terminology . It was noted that members of the ICBL are reviewing and expanding existing guidelines and principles for good practice in mine clearance . In response to a matter proposed by the first meeting of the SCE , Canada completed the task of developing the UNMAS database , Mine Action Investments , in such a way that donors are able to communicate information on their funding and policies underlying the provision of support for mine action . The database is functioning , though further data would be welcomed . The SCE commended the Portfolio of Mine Action Projects issued by UNMAS and the Compendium Document produced by Handicap International ( HI ) / Mine Advisory Group ( MAG ) / Norwegian People's Aid ( NPA ) as useful foundations for identifying worthwhile mine clearance projects to support . UNMAS reported on the Information Management System for Mine Action ( IMSMA ) , a planning tool for action in mine-affected countries which received widespread interest and support within the SCE . With the encouragement of the SCE , the United Nations has developed guidelines for the use of local militaries in United Nations-supported mine action programmes . The SCE noted the ICBL web site ( www . icbl . org ) and the suggestion that all stakeholders consider contributing to it , including through participation in AE-groups @ . The SCE noted that Landmine Monitor would issue its second report in time for the Second Meeting of the States Parties ( SMSP ) , and that further funding had been requested to complete the report . The SCE commended the GICHD for providing a web site for information related to the work of the SCEs , undertook to provide relevant information and urged all stakeholders to visit and use the SCE portion of the GICHD site . Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention Based upon a statement made by Canada with respect to the compatibility between international standards for mine clearance and obligations under Article 5 of the Convention , the SCE agreed that Convention obligations and international mine clearance standards are not incompatible . With the active encouragement of the SCE , the GICHD is undertaking on behalf of UNDP a Study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action . The Survey Action Center has embarked on a programme of Level 1 Survey work in seven countries and has plans for undertaking more . At the suggestion of the SCE , the United Nations agreed to consider making fuller use of the Steering Committee on Mine Action . The SCE called for improved availability of news about mine action , in addition to Landmines magazine and the UNMAS web site . The second Landmine Monitor report would be available for the SMSP and consideration would be given to making available documentation from stakeholders ( e . g . national plans and donor criteria ) on web sites . With the active encouragement of the SCE and at the request of UNDP , Cranfield Mine Action is developing , with the support of the United Kingdom , curricula and training materials to improve the skills of mine action managers , and the first course for senior managers is being held from July-September 2000 . The SCE noted that subsequent courses would be run at the regional or national level , and would require donor support to assist participation . The SCE commended Nicaragua = s initiative in compiling information about national ( internal ) coordination mechanisms and related best practice , encouraged the continuation of this initiative and suggested that all stakeholders actively consider contributing to it . UNMAS was asked to consider the possibility of more closely involving donors in the annual International Meeting of Mine Action Program Directors and Advisers . Recommendations made by the SCE The SCE recommended that all stakeholders contribute to the UNMAS / GICHD process of revising international standards for mine action and encouraged broad participation of mine-affected countries . It was further recommended that UNMAS formally advise countries , through their missions in New York , of the opportunity to comment , with a view to UNMAS submitting these revised standards to the United Nations General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session . In addition , it was recommended that national authorities of mine-affected countries , donors and mine action agencies ensure that the new standards are applied . The SCE recommended that consideration be given to the effective dissemination of revised international standards for mine action ( including the translation of the standards ) and to the Mine Action Support Group ( MASG ) playing an active role in disseminating these standards along with other good practice guidelines , like the Bad Honnef Guidelines . The SCE recommended continued discussions by the Committee on the process of reviewing and revising international standards for mine action , including the implications of applying the standards to the requirements of emergency demining . The SCE recommended that the GICHD , when preparing guidelines for establishing a conducive operating environment for mine clearance , take into account comments and views made by Committee participants , including by the ICBL Mine Action Working Group . In commending the relevance of the Bad Honnef Guidelines , the SCE recommended that HI , MAG and NPA review and expand existing guidance and principles for good practice in humanitarian mine action . The SCE recommended that the UNDP / GICHD present preliminary findings of its Study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action to the SMSP and that linkages be further explored between the framework for monitoring and evaluating mine action , as outlined by the International Development Research Centre ( IDRC ) , and the UNDP / GICHD study . In endorsing the work of the Survey Action Center in its continuing programme of Level 1 Surveys , the SCE recommended that UNMAS / SAC disseminate survey findings and underlined the need for funding to enable additional surveys to take place . The SCE recommended that donors indicate clearly their criteria and requirements for funding in order to help governments and mine action organizations seeking funding to provide proposals which are better tailored to meet donors = funding criteria . The SCE recommended that UNMAS and HI / MAG / NPA consult when updating their respective project portfolios in order to make any appropriate linkages and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort ; that each should identify points of contact ; and that other NGOs should consider contributing to these documents . Recognizing that the UNMAS database Mine Action Investments will be effective only if accurate and substantially complete , the SCE recommended that donors contribute full information and provide regular updates . In addition , the SCE recommended that mine-affected countries check the database and notify UNMAS of any inconsistencies or gaps and that UNMAS consider the possibility of including information on private sector resources in the database . The SCE recommended that UNMAS explore linking relevant countries = and organizations = web sites and , if possible , consider incorporating information about mine affected States = national demining programmes . In addition , it was recommended that mine-affected countries provide texts for inclusion in the United Nations database or details of relevant web sites for linkage to the UNMAS web site . The SCE recommended that UNMAS make more use of the Inter-Agency Steering Committee on Mine Action ( which consists of the relevant United Nations organizations involved in mine action , the ICRC and the ICBL ) and noted the suggestion that the Steering Committee consider possible participation by regional agencies . The SCE recommended that the OAS and Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) share regional experiences in mine action with a view to enhancing coordination and mutual understanding . The SCE recommended that UNMAS identify further ways of disseminating news on mine action , in addition to the regular publication of the Landmines magazine and regular updates of its web site . The SCE recommended further consideration of the prospects for compiling guidelines based on lessons learned in emergency mine action in the event of natural disasters . In addition , the SCE recommended that UNMAS , in the event of a crisis or emergency mine action response , provide to interested parties regular updates on the affected countries = mine situation . The SCE recommended that the IDRC consider extending to other countries the Internet database which has been created for Mozambique . In the light of its discussion on UNMAS guidelines on the use of the military in mine action , the SCE recommended ( a ) that the United Nations Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action review the way these guidelines are applied on a case-by-case basis ; ( b ) that States Parties and donors consider the possibility of training military trainers of mine-affected countries ; and ( c ) that non-United Nations mine action stakeholders apply the United Nations guidelines in all circumstances where the use of the military is an option . The SCE recommended that donors and implementing agencies consider a multidisciplinary approach to mine action including , where appropriate , other mine action elements in addition to mine clearance , such as victim assistance and mine awareness education . The SCE recommended that the phasing out of direct assistance to national capacities should begin at the appropriate time so as to reduce reliance on foreign assistance ( e . g . the use of expatriate technical assistants ) when adequate local capacities have been developed . The SCE recommended that all relevant actors retain a flexible approach in following mine action guidelines and Committee recommendations .

Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness ( SCE-VA ) to the Second Meeting of the States Parties Introduction The Standing Committee of Experts on Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness ( SCE-VA ) , established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of the States Parties ( FMSP ) , met in Geneva from 15-17 September 1999 and from 29-31 March 2000 . At the First Meeting of States Parties , it was agreed in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its annex IV that Mexico and Switzerland would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE-VA , with Japan and Nicaragua serving as Co-Rapporteurs . Representatives of 43 States Parties , 9 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention , 9 other States , UNMAS , UNDP , the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs ( UNDDA ) , the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research ( UNIDIR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , OAS , ICRC , ICBL , GICHD and of numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in the SCE-VA meetings . The meetings of the SCE-VA received administrative support from the GICHD . The final report of the second meeting of the SCE-VA containing background information , views , opinions , analysis and recommendations can be found at www . gichd . ch. Its reading is highly recommended . Matters reviewed by the SCE-VA At the first SCE-VA meeting , six ANetwork Groups @ were established to facilitate work in the following thematic areas : collection and dissemination of guidelines ; information and data collection ; victim assistance reporting ; mine / unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) awareness ; portfolio of victim assistance programmes ; and donor coordination . The deliberations and outcomes of the Network Groups were discussed at the second meeting of the SCE-VA . Based on a spirit of partnership , shared commitment , and responsibility between civil society and governments , the SCE-VA discussed a comprehensive and integrated approach to victim assistance . The SCE-VA discussed a definition of Alandmine victim @ which includes directly affected individuals , their families , and mine-affected communities . In addition , the SCE-VA discussed Avictim assistance @ as multi-faceted , and requiring a broad range of activities including prevention , emergency medical care , physical and psychological rehabilitation and socio-economic integration . Also considered was victim assistance being defined as an integrated part of assistance to all victims of violence and trauma and persons with disabilities . The SCE-VA discussed , with a view to guaranteeing a long-term sustainable solution , victim assistance being integrated in a broader context of post-conflict reconstruction and development strategies , without losing sight of the directly affected individuals , families and communities which are specifically targeted by the Convention . In particular , the SCE-VA considered the need to have victim assistance integrated into public health , community development , conflict and violence prevention . In addition , the SCE-VA considered the need to include measures relevant to meeting the needs of victims in the principles of humanitarian and development cooperation . During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , Nicaragua and Mexico agreed to facilitate the Network Group on the Collection and Dissemination of Guidelines . The main objective of the Network Group was to try to make existing victim assistance guidelines , including guidelines on socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness , available to all relevant actors . To achieve this objective , the Network Group : called upon all interested actors to contribute in the collection of existing guidelines ; collected all existing victim assistance guidelines received ; discussed how to disseminate the received existing guidelines ; and discussed the need to disseminate a list with the collected guidelines and relevant information to interested parties . During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , Switzerland agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Information and Data Collection . The Network Group discussed a more systematic and reliable data collection and dissemination . Efforts were focused on base line data and quantifying the impact on public health and reintegration systems , on human and socio-economic development and on the daily life of people and communities . The Network Group emphasized that acquiring victim data should not be an objective in itself but integrated into broader efforts to prevent injuries , assist victims and facilitate better allocation of resources . The Network Group raised issues like national ownership , capacity-building , institutional development and adapting methodologies to reality in the mine-affected countries . The Network Group discussed providing mine-affected countries with methodological support rather than solutions , data collection being handled sensitively , and taking into consideration the impact of data collection on victims . During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , the ICBL and Handicap International agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Victim Assistance Reporting , the purpose of which was to propose a voluntary reporting mechanism . The Network Group raised the issue that , while there is no explicit requirement in the Convention for countries to report on contributions to victim assistance and mine awareness , the Convention requires , in Article 6 , paragraph 3 : AEach State Party in a position to do so shall provide assistance for the care and the rehabilitation , and social and economic reintegration , of mine victims and for mine awareness programmes . @ During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , the ICBL and ICRC agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Mine / UXO Awareness . The Network Group confirmed that appropriate mine / UXO awareness can save lives , that problems faced differ in each situation , but some common elements can be found . During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , the ICBL Working Group on Victim Assistance agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Portfolio of Victim Assistance Programs . The Network Group noted that mention of victim assistance in the Convention has led to a global upsurge of interest in these programmes and that to date there is no global compilation of information on programming . During the first meeting of the SCE-VA , Sweden agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Donor Coordination . The Network Group covered numerous issues of importance ( e . g . recognizing that different States have different needs and understanding the need for both a comprehensive development approach to victim assistance and remembering that victims should not have to wait until macro-level problems are solved before they begin to enjoy a better quality of life ) and identified several ideas for further consideration . Actions taken or in process on the development of specific tools and instruments in order to assist the implementation of the Convention The SCE-VA identified that a strategic , comprehensive and integrated approach to victim assistance is needed and made specific progress in the following areas : ( a ) towards efficient and effective means to monitor Article 6 obligations ; ( b ) in the development , refinement and implementation of various programming and coordination tools ; ( c ) in promoting an information exchange and discussion of various tools for data collection and mine awareness ; ( d ) in promoting various sets of victim assistance and mine awareness guidelines ; and ( e ) in better understanding matters pertaining to victim assistance data collection . The SCE-VA developed a Portfolio of Victim Assistance Programs , the purposes of which are : to raise awareness among governments , donors , and programme implementers on the range of activities that constitute victim assistance ; to promote transparency among all actors in victim assistance ; to highlight needs which have not been addressed because of lack of resources ; and to facilitate contact and information-sharing among actors in victim assistance . Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention Based upon the work of the Network Group on Victim Assistance Reporting , the SCE-VA recognized the importance of reporting by all States Parties on support provided for victim assistance and agreed to continue work on effective and efficient means through which States Parties could report on this matter . Recommendations made by the SCE-VA It was recommended that governments establish a mechanism or designate a focal point through which information on victim assistance guidelines could be channelled to appropriate actors in the field and to those elaborating victim assistance , socio-economic reintegration , mine awareness policies or programmes . It was recommended that governments , international and regional organizations , and NGOs interested or involved in victim assistance , socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness , take into account existing guidelines when developing victims assistance programmes and promote a common culture , based on the partnership of governments , international organizations and civil society , about their usefulness in the formulation of said programmes . It was further recommended that ways and means should be found to translate these guidelines into the languages of mine-affected countries . It was recommended that WHO give due attention to enhancing and assessing the quality and performance of surveillance systems for victim assistance in affected countries . It was recommended that governments , international organizations and NGOs share their information at country level with the local bodies ( e . g . inter-sectoral committees , mine action centres , health authorities ) and make the information public . Governments of affected countries should be encouraged to establish victim assistance web sites . It was recommended that new incidents be covered by an adapted health information system producing simple and rapid information as well as by the Information Management System for Mine Action ( IMSMA ) and that further development of the IMSMA incident module be considered . It was recommended that the WHO integrated surveillance system on victim and trauma be further developed and implemented in a gender-disaggregated form . It was recommended that a platform / clearinghouse for exchange , dissemination and information be established in order to promote transparency , in particular through : the collection and dissemination of standards , methodologies and questionnaires ; the establishment of national platforms and linking them to the international level ; the exchange of research ; and linking existing information about victims . It was further recommended that the GICHD assume this task and develop a test module accessible on its web site . In addition , it was recommended that WHO explore the possibility of engagement in this area . It was recommended that the testing of various tools for victim assistance and mine awareness data collection be promoted . It was recommended that all interested parties continue to work towards efficient and effective means to monitor the implementation of Article 6 , paragraph 3 of the Convention , taking into account the significant work of the Victim Assistance Reporting Network Group . It was recommended that funding be timely , particularly with regards to displaced and returning populations , responsive , appropriate to specific country needs and circumstances , flexible , allowing for the changing reality at the field level , as well as geographically appropriate and coordinated at the donor level . It was recommended that the UNICEF International Guidelines for Mine Awareness be taken into consideration at the outset of programming . It was further recommended that stakeholders should define , together with the mine action coordination body in the mine-affected country , the national standards and methodology for mine action . It was recommended that guidelines be developed for monitoring and evaluating mine / UXO awareness programming and training programmes for mine awareness . It was further recommended that mine / UXO awareness training be integrated into national mine action frameworks . It was recommended that UNICEF continue to provide an open and transparent process ensuring wide participation among mine / UXO awareness actors . It was recommended that UNMAS ensure the integration of the various mine action guidelines into the framework for the development of international standards for mine action . It was recommended that mine / UXO awareness coordination occur whenever possible under a government umbrella , on various levels , including between : ( a ) different implementing agencies involved in mine / UXO awareness programming ; ( b ) the wider mine action community including victim assistance organizations ; and ( c ) the Anon mine action @ humanitarian and development sector , which can bring alternative solutions to mine problems encountered by the communities . It was recommended that mine awareness programmes be implemented in partnership with national mine awareness institutions and actors at the community , regional and national level , from programme identification and assessment , to implementation , monitoring and evaluation . It was further recommended that UNMAS be encouraged to develop a mine / UXO awareness function within the IMSMA to ensure the development of an integrated effective mine action plan and that mine / UXO awareness programming be responsive to both emergency and long-term needs . It was recommended that for the successful implementation of mine action programming , donors / NGOs and all relevant stakeholders ensure that monitoring and evaluation are integral and meaningful parts of all programming . It was recommended that key stakeholders ensure that agencies undertaking mine / UXO awareness activities have a knowledge of and commitment to the existing UNICEF International Guidelines and have ideally a proven capacity and track record of successful programming . It was further recommended that existing mine / UXO awareness agencies should ensure that key documentation is widely available and accessible as learning tools for other agencies . It was recommended that government officials involved in victim assistance receive a copy of the Portfolio as a tool to facilitate contact with other victim assistance actors . It was recommended that States Parties provide resources for the creation and maintenance of a national coordination body , under whose aegis would fall the development of a national Portfolio of Victim Programs . It was recommended that interested parties continue to work together to develop suggestions and recommendations on methods pertaining to more effective donor coordination and long-term resource mobilization with the aim of effectively meeting the immediate and ongoing needs of victims . The focus of this process should be to identify gaps and available resources . It was recommended that , in its future work , the SCE-VA pay due attention to the issues of : ( a ) coordination , with a focus on the clear and precise rationalization of the roles of the major actors in victim assistance ; ( b ) identifying gaps in terms of financial , technical and other resources needed for victim assistance ; and ( c ) measuring progress towards implementation of the Convention , particularly with a focus on examining victim assistance reporting mechanisms . It was recommended that the future work of the SCE-VA should be divided into two types of activities : ( a ) operationalization of work already begun ( e . g . following through on the most salient recommendations of the Network Groups ; setting precise goals ; and collecting and disseminating documents from the SCE-VA ) ; and ( b ) analysis of new themes ( e . g . creating an inventory of existing policies , studies , surveys and lessons learned ; considering links between victim assistance and mine awareness and long-term strategies for sustainable development ; and increasing the participation in mine-affected countries of civil society and , particularly , associations of mine victims and / or persons with disabilities ) . Reference to supporting documents As a result of the work of the SCE-VA = s Network Groups , six papers were produced containing the views of these groups and the proposals put forward by them to the SCE-VA = s March 2000 meeting .

Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Stockpile Destruction to the Second Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention Introduction The Standing Committee of Experts ( SCE ) on Stockpile Destruction , established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of the States Parties ( FMSP ) , met in Geneva from 9-10 December 1999 and from 22-23 May 2000 . At the FMSP , it was agreed , in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its annex IV , that Hungary and Mali would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE , with Malaysia and Slovakia serving as Co-Rapporteurs . Representatives of 47 States , United Nations bodies , the ICRC , ICBL and numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in either or both of the two meetings . The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the GICHD . Matters reviewed by the SCE The SCE solicited the views of delegations with respect to the following thematic areas : stockpile destruction as an integral part of mine action ; allocation of resources - technologies and constraints ; case studies ; stockpile destruction as preventive mine action ; cooperative structures for stockpile destruction ; and the way ahead . The SCE noted its appreciation of the work of the following moderators : Ret. Gen. Gordon M. Reay , Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade , Canada ; Patrick Blagden , GICHD ; Col. Paul Power , Australian Defense Forces ; Steve Goose , Human Rights Watch ; and Adrian Wilkinson , Mine Action Consultant , UNDP . The SCE considered a number of practical issues with a view to highlighting the importance of the core objective of the SCE , namely to facilitate a swift and dramatic reduction in the number of stockpiled anti-personnel mines globally , including the following : ensuring political priority for stockpile destruction ; obligations and rights of countries under Article 4 of the Convention ; merits and constraints of various methods and technologies for destruction as experienced by individual countries ; the role of the military and private sector in stockpile destruction ; logistical , technical and financial considerations ; possible alternatives to the current methods of stockpile destruction ; planning and implementation of the process leading up to the actual destruction of stockpiles ; financial and technical assistanceBbilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to stockpile destruction ; compilation of a database of industrial / research capacities and capabilities ; possible mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating Article 7 reports ; assessing overall progress with regard to stockpile destruction ; progress report on global stockpiles and their destruction ; flow of information on available technologies , costs and environmental impact ; modalities of transfer and storage of foreign stockpiles ; avoiding competition among the various branches and actors of mine action ; engaging the media and the public at large in the process of stockpile destruction ; need for accounting and certification procedures ; compilation of databases on donors , recipients , needs , methods , options , companies , experts ; and possible mechanisms for engaging non-States parties in reducing their stockpiles . It was expected that discussion on all the above matters would continue in the intersessional work programme . As a result of the SCE = s deliberations , it was accepted that stockpile destruction is an integral part , in effect the Afifth pillar @ , of mine action and that , accordingly , compliance with Article 4 obligations should receive high political priority . It was also stressed , however , that this does not suggest unwarranted competition among the different branches of mine action . At the FMSP , participants emphasized the need for the rapid universalization of , adherence to and compliance with the Convention and , in parallel , the importance of prompt and strict compliance with the obligations as stipulated in Article 4 . Accordingly , States were urged to comply with their reporting obligations under Article 7 as a way to facilitate future cooperation between prospective donor States and those requesting assistance in carrying out this important task . In the course of its intersessional work , the Committee sought ways to ensure that the capabilities and capacities of prospective donor States become fully compatible with the needs of States requesting assistance . In addition , the SCE reviewed a wide range of technical options for stockpile destruction , which were introduced in the course of the sessions for consideration . Actions taken or in process on the development of specific tools and instruments in order to assist the implementation of the Convention A web site related to stockpile destruction is expected to be introduced by UNMAS and Canada by September 2000 and States were encouraged to contribute to this effort . Proposed UNDP guidelines on stockpile destruction will be made available on the web as well . A list of companies , experts and technologies related to stockpile destruction is also expected to be introduced in the near future . A cumulative list of companies , experts and technologies could provide a necessary link between the Adonor @ and Arecipient @ countries when designing future cooperative structures . Regarding monitoring and verification requirements , a number of presentations have already been prepared , which serve as good examples . It was acknowledged that case study presentations are a useful tool for maintaining political enthusiasm and that a standardized format for the case study presentations could be identified vis-à-vis the ones that have been presented up to date . The submission of ( annual ) national progress reports on stockpile destruction was not a matter of consensus at this point of time . It was observed that there are a number of relevant questions not included in the Article 7 reporting format ; therefore , a proposal for a separate questionnaire on stockpile destruction was entertained . The important role the ICBL Landmine Monitor plays in reporting on the global stockpile destruction process and contributing to greater transparency on this issue was highly appreciated . Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention The need for additional resources to be secured for stockpile destruction projects was stressed . To this end , the sessions considered various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches as possible components for establishing cooperative structures for stockpile destruction projects . The initiative launched by Canada and Ukraine was cited in this regard as a useful example for bilateral cooperation , while the establishment of a Partnership for Peace ( PfP ) Trust Fund for stockpile destruction within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council ( NATO / EAPC ) was singled out as a promising multilateral / regional project with a view to facilitating broad compliance with Article 4 obligations . More than a dozen countries provided insights into their experience with stockpile destruction and representatives offered their respective views with regard to the merits and constraints of various methods of destruction as experienced by individual countries . Financial , technical , social and environmental considerations were also discussed at length , and emphasis was placed on the need for careful planning and implementation of the process leading up to the actual destruction of stockpiles . The importance of engaging the media and the public at large in the process of stockpile destruction was also highlighted by various delegations . The SCE compared the converging or diverging approaches taken by the military and civil sectors in the actions needed for eliminating stockpiled anti-personnel mines . In most cases , it was argued , stockpile destruction in military facilities leads to a substantial reduction of incurred expenses and entails the more efficient utilization of already existing resources . Transparency in this process is also of critical importance , a fact about which the armed forces should be educated . An important role should be assigned to players outside the military to ensure maximum transparency in the process of stockpile destruction ( governmental agencies , mass media , diplomatic corps , etc. ) . The possible roles of UNMAS and UNDP in stockpile destruction projects were also discussed . With its 137 regional centres worldwide , UNDP could facilitate various bilateral or multilateral arrangements with a view to promoting information exchange and technical / financial cooperation in this field . Although the United Nations agencies are traditionally involved in humanitarian demining activities , the possibility of expanding their activities to facilitate stockpile destruction should not be excluded . The possible modalities of such United Nations involvement , e . g . transparency and lessons learned and shared , and financial assistance , were also discussed . Retention of stockpiled anti-personnel mines for training and development purposes under Article 3 was also discussed at length , although the Co-Chairs made the determination that the issue should be referred to the SCE on the General Status and Operation of the Convention for further deliberation . Generally , it was agreed that examination of all options and factors should lead to the destruction of global stocks in the fastest , most cost-effective way and with the least harmful effects to the environment . It was also emphasized that the possibility of adverse environmental impacts brought about by the destruction process should not be used as an excuse for inaction in meeting Article 4 obligations . The Committee agreed that , at the SMSP , the urgency and importance of stockpile destruction should be affirmed . Recommendations made by the SCE It was recommended that those countries that have completed the destruction of their stockpiles should make their expertise available to those in need , because in many instances countries lack the technical experience , industrial capacities or know-how to carry out obligations stipulated in Article 4 of the Convention . It was recommended that States be encouraged to contribute to the questionnaire presented by Canada in support of the development of an UNMAS web site on stockpile destruction . With regard to a complementary database to the Article 7 reports , it was recommended that the SCE Co-Chairs , in cooperation with interested parties , work to develop a questionnaire that would help collect information on needs and assistance offers expressed by non-States Parties . It was recommended that the SCE Co-Chairs develop specific language on recommendations concerning bilateral and multilateral / regional cooperative structures for stockpile destruction . It was recommended that an examination of all options and factors should lead to the destruction of global stocks in the fastest , most cost-effective way and with the least harmful effects to the environment . Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Technologies for Mine Action to the Second Meeting of the States Parties Introduction The Standing Committee of Experts on Technologies for Mine Action ( SCETMA ) , established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the First Meeting of the States Parties ( FMSP ) , which was held from 3-7 May 1999 in Maputo , Mozambique , met in Geneva on 13-14 December 1999 and on 24-25 May 2000 . In accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP , it was agreed that Cambodia and France would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE , with Germany and Yemen serving as Co-Rapporteurs . Representatives of 34 States that have ratified the Convention , 7 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention , 9 other States , the ICRC , the ICBL and 8 regional and international organizations , including the United Nations , and numerous other relevant organizations , including national mine action centres , universities , research centres and companies , were registered as participants in the SCE meetings . The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the GICHD . Matters reviewed by the SCE The SCETMA benefited from a pragmatic and clear mandate as well as a lively and dedicated participation by experts whose diversity and complementarity found full expression in the course of the debates . The SCETMA had been mandated to conduct a comparative survey of the needs of the end-users and of the technologies available to them or in development . The Committee fulfilled its mandate by taking into account the constraints which stand in the way of providing end-users with appropriate technologies , as well as the new standards required by the technological progress of mine action . This framework provided ample opportunity to field practitioners , programme managers , specialists from academia and research establishments as well as military and industrial decision-makers , to interact and to exchange information . This provided a better understanding of the adequacy of technologies currently or soon to be available for mine action , of the new international standards that ought to be implemented , and of the most promising progress in technology research . The Committee = s work was enhanced by useful contributions by individuals responsible for mine action field work , including individuals from Mine Action Centres ( e . g . C-MAC ( Cambodia ) , CROMAC , IND-Mozambique , NCHD-Chad , Monitoring , Evaluation and Training Agency ( META ) and MAP-Afghanistan , CND-Nicaragua ) , international organizations ( e . g . UNMAS and UNDP ) and non-governmental organizations ( e . g . ICBL , Handicap International , Mines Advisory Group , Norwegian People's Aid ) and GICHD . The military establishments of donor countries and affected States also participated . The scientific sector ( e . g . RMA-Belgium , ERA-United Kingdom , JRC-European Commission ) and the industrial sector ( e . g . Mechem-South Africa ) provided an overview of the ways used to attempt to adapt existing technologies . End-users and the research and development actors , academics ( e . g . University of Western Australia , Cranfield University , James Madison University , the European Commission Joint Research Centre ( JRC )) discussed their own efforts at rationalizing mine action in the face of the diversity of hurdles it has to overcome . Actions taken or in process on the development of specific tools and instruments in order to assist the implementation of the Convention The SCETMA confirmed that taken separately neither manual demining , nor mine detecting dogs , nor mechanical equipment , holds the key to the landmine problem . The key lies in the so called Atool box @ approach , wherein these techniques and technologies are complementary , and need to be used in different combinations after a careful review of the conditions and environment of each minefield or mine action programme . The SCETMA emphasized different elements of the tool box used by different mine action centres , from Cambodia to Afghanistan , Mozambique , Chad , Nicaragua or Croatia . The diverse elements presented reflect varying sets of constraints , ranging from human , geographical and climatic conditions , to financial , organizational or political limitations . Mine action centres are well placed to give proper consideration , for instance , to the variety of mines in place in the same area , or to the demands made on the mobility and modularity of teams and equipment , in consideration of different conditions in the field , from waterlogged to arid soils , from sandy to rocky terrains , etc. The SCETMA noted that while the tool box approach is widely accepted , there is room for a variety of opinions on other aspects of mine action in the field . With respect to mine detection dogs ( MDD ) for example , the experience of deminers in Afghanistan shows that MDDs are fast and effective , provided they are assigned appropriate tasks in area reduction or clearance in low-density mined areas . However , deminers in Kosovo pointed out that it is indispensable to adopt an accredition procedure in order to guarantee , before and during clearance operations , the quality of dogs supplied . The University of Western Australia suggested Adouble blind tests @ for dogs and supervisors . Universal interest in the MDD tool , and lingering doubts on its proper use , have led UNMAS and the GICHD to launch no less than eight studies to cover every aspect of the MDD technique in the course of the next few years . The SCETMA noted different , but not irreconcilable , approaches to the use of mechanical equipment . Suppliers of heavy equipment stressed its effectiveness if assigned appropriate tasks , from road clearance to vegetation-cutting and other preparations of the field . Practitioners in the field underlined the need for multi-purpose platforms and increased sustainability of the equipment purchased or leased , and for improved procedures for testing in the field . All were in agreement on the necessity to integrate the selection of appropriate mechanical equipment in the early stages of planning for demining . The SCETMA exposed concern at the multiplication of databases and information technologies available , and the need to promote compatibility and interconnectednesss . Field workers insisted on the need to preserve an end-user friendly approach . Progress made by the GICHD Information Management System for Mine Action ( IMSMA ) was applauded - a system which between the two meetings of the SCETMA was developed and tested in a growing list of mine-affected countries . The SCETMA acknowledged the importance of the current exhaustive review of United Nations norms and standards . End-users will systematically be associated with this process . The new United Nations standards will also be compatible with those of the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) . However , concern was raised regarding the need to identify who will assume the responsibility for implementing these standards and verifying their correct implementation . The SCETMA noted that stakeholders in mine action now realize that the time-lines of scientific innovation and progress and those of demining requirements are not necessarily the same . It was undersand that States most active in research and development of new demining technologies do so primarily for military reasons , with less attention to the particular needs of humanitarian demining . This bias , however , was not universal : international ( International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA )) , regional ( European Commission-JRC ) , and national institutions do have specific programmes or projects aimed at humanitarian demining . All stakeholders agreed to stress the importance of a cooperative approach among researchers , developers and deminers . Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention To faciliate the implementation of the Convention , the SCETMA concluded that there is an overall need to nurture a dual approach in the field of mine action technology , namely : the development of simple , end-user friendly technologies based on improving existing material , as being essential to ease the burden of deminers and to speed up ongoing programmes ; and the search for high-tech innovations , as being critical to save lives , time and money in the longer term . Recommendations made by the SCE With the view that cooperation between mine action stakeholders must be strengthened in several ways and at several levels , the SCETMA recommended : The exchange of relevant information between end-users , in particular between mine action centres ; The systematic field testing of new technologies in order ( a ) to provide researchers with a better appreciation of the improvements needed and a better access to data acquired by deminers and ( b ) to increase deminers' awareness and acceptance of new technologies ; The facilitation of the transfer of equipment through the adoption and implementation of Ademining friendly regulations @ ; The development of integrated databases such as IMSMA and fostering of the compatibility and interconnection of existing databases ; Facilitating access to national resources in terms of conventional and digitalized maps , surveys and other relevant documentation concerning mined areas , subject to national regulations and considerations of national security ; The development of software , using information available in databases , with a view to assist those responsible for mine action in their choice of adapted technologies ; Setting up of a network of probing facilities and international testing centres ; Defining common standards for field testing ; and Defining mechanisms and procedures to allocate new technologies to mine action teams ( e . g . with respect to its discussion on UNMAS policy on the use of militaries in mine action , the SCETMA recommended ( a ) that the United Nations Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action review the way these guidelines are applied on a case-by-case basis , ( b ) that States Parties and donors consider the possibility of training military trainers of mine-affected countries , and ( c ) that non-United Nations mine action stakeholders be urged to apply United Nations guidelines in all circumstances where the use of the military is an option ) . Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on the General Status and Operation of the Convention to the Second Meeting of the States Parties Introduction The Standing Committee of Experts ( SCE ) on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the First Meeting of the States Parties ( FMSP ) , held from 3-7 May 1999 in Maputo , Mozambique , met in Geneva at the International Conference Centre on 10-11 January 2000 , and at the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining ( GICHD ) on 29-30 May 2000 . In accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and the report = s annex IV , it was agreed that Canada and South Africa would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE , with Belgium and Zimbabwe serving as Co-Rapporteurs . Representatives of 43 States that have ratified the Convention , 9 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention , 10 other States , the ICRC , ICBL , 7 regional and international organizations , including the United Nations , and 13 non-governmental organizations were registered as participants in the meetings . The Meeting received administrative support from the GICHD . Matters reviewed by the SCE The Committee discussed the need to continue efforts in support of the universalization of the Convention and noted the continued growth in the number of States that have formally accepted the obligations of the Convention . The ongoing work of a number of States to encourage universalization was noted , as were the efforts of various international organizations , the ICBL and the ICRC . The Committee discussed progress made in implementation of and compliance with Article 7 of the Convention . While the rate of compliance with the Convention = s transparency provisions , contained in Article 7 , is not dramatically different relative to other Conventions , concern was raised that several States have not yet provided required reports . The importance of timely , consistent and detailed reporting was highlighted and recommendations were made with respect to the reporting process . The Committee discussed measures taken to implement Article 9 of the Convention , particularly the need to promote greater understanding of the different approaches taken with respect to national implementation measures . In addition , the Committee heard concerns about only a limited number of States Parties having established legislation as part of the Aappropriate legal , administrative and other measures , including the imposition of penal sanctions @ , as required in terms of Article 9 of the Convention . The Committee discussed matters pertaining to Article 2 , particularly matters related to anti-handling devices and the sensitivity of anti-vehicle mines = fusing devices . Ideas , like examining these issues through informal expert work and working towards the agreement by States Parties on an understanding on the matter were put forward . There was no agreement on proceeding with either idea at this time , although an ICRC initiative to discuss these matters was welcomed . Several States Parties affirmed their view ( a ) that mines equipped with anti-handling devices that activate when no attempt has been made to tamper with or otherwise intentionally disturb these mines are in fact anti-personnel mines as defined by the Convention and ( b ) that fusing mechanisms that cause anti-vehicle mines to function as anti-personnel mines are also anti-personnel mines as defined by the Convention . The Committee received the views of the ICBL with respect to States Parties working towards a common understanding of which acts are and are not permitted under paragraph ( c ) of Article 1 of the Convention . In particular the ICBL called for a common interpretation of the term Aassist @ , especially relating to the use of anti-personnel mines by non-States Parties in joint operations with States Parties and the stockpiling and transit of foreign-owned anti-personnel mines . The Committee highlighted the need for greater understanding of matters pertaining to anti-personnel mines retained for training and development under Article 3 of the Convention . To this end , the Committee received numerous reports from States Parties clarifying the reasons why mines are retained , how mines have been used to date and how they will be used in a manner consistent with Article 3 in the future . The Committee heard the view that mines retained under Article 3 should be kept to a minimum . The Committee received the views of the ICBL with respect to States Parties meeting their obligations under Article 6 of the Convention and , in particular , reviewed the need to provide support for victim assistance programmes . The Committee also reviewed the development and implementation of the UNMAS database of donor activity , Mine Action Investments . The Committee discussed the relationship between United Nations standards for mine clearance and Article 5 of the Convention , concluding that there is no contradiction between the two . The Committee discussed the need to examine matters pertaining to the operationalization of Article 8 in order that all structures and methodologies are in place for smooth execution whenever needed . To this end , the Committee agreed to an ongoing action to further discuss these matters . The Committee evaluated the first intersessional work programme and highlighted the need to make improvements , principally to streamline the process and address participation issues . To this end , the Committee made numerous recommendations . The Committee discussed a number of matters pertaining to preparations for the SMSP and recommended a draft agenda , a draft programme of work , draft amendments to the FMSP rules of procedure , and draft provisional cost estimates . The Committee also made a number of administrative decisions , including agreeing to the venue for the Meeting and to a plan for documentation . Tools and instruments developed or being developed to assist in the implementation of the Convention With respect to Article 7 , the Committee received an overview of the UNDDA Internet database of reports submitted under the Article . While ideas to enhance the reporting process were heard , like moving to direct Internet-based reporting , the Committee recognized that immediate efforts with respect to Article 7 reporting should be focused on encouraging a higher rate of compliance and taking small measures to facilitate the process . These small measures include States Parties , when possible , submitting reports electronically and , when submitting an annual update , to highlight the changes in relation to earlier reports . Also with respect to Article 7 , States Parties were invited to work with the ICBL on developing a reporting guide as a means of increasing the quantity and quality of the Article 7 reports . The ICBL was invited to make a progress report to the next meeting of the SCE . With respect to Article 6 , the Committee welcomed the UNMAS database Mine Action Investments , developed with the assistance of Canada , as a practical means for donors to share information on their activities for the purpose of enhanced coordination and greater transparency . Donors were encouraged to enter data into the database before the SMSP in order to increase the usefulness of this tool and to allow for more substantial analysis of donor activity . Monitoring participation in the database was considered a useful ongoing task for the Committee . With respect to Article 9 , States Parties were invited to work with the ICBL and other interested parties on developing a sample package of existing implementation legislation to assist other States Parties in establishing legislation . A progress report should be made on this issue at the next SCE . Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention With respect to Article 5 , based upon a statement made by Canada with respect to the compatibility between international standards for mine clearance and Convention obligations under Article 5 , the SCE agreed that Convention obligations and international mine clearance standards are not incompatible . With respect to Article 7 , the Co-Chairs of the Committee agreed to continue to coordinate joint actions to encourage compliance with Article 7 . With respect to Article 2 , the Committee welcomed as a useful step forward the offer of the ICRC to host technical discussions on how to minimize the risk of detonation of anti-handling devices through accidental or inadvertent contact and on sensitive fusing mechanisms for anti-vehicle mines . The ICRC indicated that these discussions may be held in early 2001 and encouraged States Parties to prepare technical studies on these issues for discussion at that time . Details on the proposed seminar will be provided at the next meeting of the Committee . With respect to Article 8 , based upon a paper developed by Canada and discussed at the Committee = s second meeting , the Committee agreed that expert work should proceed in the lead-up to the first post-SMSP meeting of the Committee on elaborating upon Astandards of evidence @ which may be used as a basis for initiating a ARequest for Clarification @ , the maintenance of a list of experts , fact-finding missions and financial issues . Recommendations made by the SCE With respect to the post-SMSP intersessional work programme , the Committee made the following recommendations for consideration by States Parties at the SMSP : ( a ) Duration of Meetings : It was recommended that only three periods of meetings be held annually , including the Meeting of States Parties . That is , each SCE shall meet twice between Meetings of States Parties , once during an initial week-long session of meetings in November or December 2000 and once during a week-long session of meetings in May 2001 . ( b ) Number of Committees : In the interest of efficiency , it was recommended that directly related themes be merged into one SCE , particularly that the Committees for Mine Clearance and Technologies for Mine Action be combined into one Committee without excluding discussions on technology , when necessary , on the part of the Committees on Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness , and on Stockpile Destruction . Thus there would be four Committees as follows : Mine Clearance and Related Technologies ( meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness ( meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) Stockpile Destruction ( meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) General Status and Operation of the Convention ( meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings ) . Example : ( c ) Language of Proceedings : To further enhance active participation in the work of the Committees , it was recommended that States in a position to do so consider making voluntary contributions to have additional languages made available for the intersessional meetings . ( d ) Date of Meetings : It was recommended that the first of the two week-long sessions of meetings take place in November / December 2000 . It is further recommended that the second of the two week-long sessions of meetings take place in May 2001 . ( e ) Supporting Participation : It was recommended that consideration be given to developing a mechanism to provide for assistance to support participation in meetings of the Convention . ( f ) Role of Co-Chairs : It was recommended that Committee Co-Chairs may , as appropriate , seek ongoing support and advice of past Co-Chairs . ( g ) Name Change : It was recommended that the Standing Committees of Experts ( SCEs ) be referred to as Standing Committees ( SCs ) . ( h ) Post-SMSP Rapporteurs : It was recommended that the following States be nominated to serve as Committee Rapporteurs following the SMSP : Mine Clearance and Related Technologies : Germany and Yemen Victim Assistance , Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness : Canada and another State to be determined Stockpile Destruction : Australia and Croatia General Status and Operation of the Convention : Norway and Thailand With respect to the Article 7 reporting process , the Committee made the following recommendations for consideration by States Parties at the SMSP : ( a ) In order to provide States Parties with the opportunity to report voluntarily on matters pertaining to compliance and implementation not covered by the formal reporting requirements contained in Article 7 , it was recommended that States Parties amend the Article 7 reporting format to include an additional form : AForm J : Other relevant matters @ . ( b ) It was further recommended that States Parties consider using this form to report on activities undertaken with respect to Article 6 , in particular to report on assistance provided for the care and rehabilitation , and social and economic reintegration , of mine victims .

PRESIDENT = S ACTION PROGRAMME Background At the First Meeting of the States Parties , the intersessional programme was established to focus and advance the international community = s mine action efforts and to measure progress made in achieving our objectives . This programme , which involved the work of five Standing Committees of Experts ( SCEs ) , was designed to serve as a practical means to assist in the implementation of the Convention . The President = s Action Programme has been developed to help in this process of implementation by identifying practical steps that can be taken in accordance with the recommendations of the SCEs . It provides a summary of concrete initiatives and activities that flow from the work of the SCEs as well as other specific initiatives that have been announced since the conclusion of the work of the SCEs or during the Second Meeting of the States Parties ( SMSP ) itself . In doing so , it is a mechanism that both builds upon past work and is forward looking in ensuring that the aims of the SCEs are realized . In addition , to assist in the coordination of our collective efforts , the President = s Action Programme includes a rolling calendar of future mine action activities that are consistent with this objective . In developing their work plans for the 2000-2001 Standing Committees , Co-Chairs of the various Standing Committees are encouraged to facilitate the implementation of relevant portions of the President = s Action Programme . In addition , States Parties and other parties are urged to consider participating in the implementation of the actions listed in this document and implementing , where relevant , other recommendations contained in the reports of the Standing Committees of Experts . ( See annex IV . Mine clearance and related technologies Revising technical standards for mine action : The SCE recommended that all mine action partners be encouraged to contribute to the process of revising international standards for mine action being undertaken by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining ( GICHD ) on behalf of the United Nations Mine Action Service ( UNMAS ) , and that work should be undertaken to support their effective dissemination and implementation . UNMAS , in conjunction with the GICHD , will soon make a final draft of the standards available on its web site and advise interested parties of the site details and request comment . Revising guidelines for mine action : The relevance of mine action guidelines and principles for good practice was recognized by the SCE . To follow-up on this recommendation , preliminary work undertaken by Handicap International ( HI ) , the Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) , Norwegian Peoples Aid ( NPA ) and the Bad Honnef group will be further revised and disseminated by the ICBL Mine Action Working Group ( MAWG ) . Developing indigenous capacities for mine action : The critical importance of developing indigenous mine action capacities and reinforcing national leadership was highlighted by the SCE . In support of this objective , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) is providing assistance to 15 mine-affected countries . This assistance includes the establishment of mine action centres and the provision of training and resource mobilization . In addition , UNDP is currently conducting a management training course for senior mine action officials , and further courses are planned . Furthermore , numerous non-governmental organizations are also developing mine action capacities in mine-affected countries . Enhancing transparency in mine action funding : It was recognized by the SCE that the UNMAS database of donor activity , Mine Action Investments , will be effective only if the data is substantially complete and if progress is made towards the database becoming the definitive source for donor activity . UNMAS is continuing to work to encourage donors to enter both data on donor activity and information on donors = policies regarding the provision of mine action funding . Improving the operating environment for mine clearance : It was recommended by the SCE that action be taken to establish best practices with respect to ensuring a conducive operating environment for mine clearance . To this end the ICBL Mine Action Working Group will prepare recommendations which will be brought to the Standing Committee on Mine Clearance . Supporting socio-economic analysis in planning and evaluating mine action : It was recommended by the SCE that the findings of studies on socio-economic impacts and mine action undertaken by the GICHD on behalf of UNDP be widely disseminated . In addition , it was recognized that mine clearance should be integrated , where relevant , into the larger context of reconstruction , development and peace-building . To follow-up on this recommendation , UNDP will widely disseminate their study and produce a socio-economic handbook for mine action managers . Training and workshops may also be conducted in mine-affected countries . In addition , the Survey Working Group , the International Peace Research Institute , Oslo ( PRIO ) and the NPA will make available the standards and protocols that they have developed as well as independent studies that will help to establish socio-economic indicators . Improving the exchange of mine action information : A number of recommendations were made by the SCE with respect to further disseminating information on mine action and enhancing mine action information tools . To this end , UNMAS is working to link its web-based project portfolio with non-governmental organizations = portfolios and is considering adding to its web-site country data-input opportunities and more links to mine-affected sites and mine action centres . ( See : http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/mine/. ) UNMAS is also undertaking a number of other steps ( e . g . , working with the Spokesman = s Office , contributing content to other mine action information sources , etc. ) within the United Nations system to improve upon the dissemination of information . In addition , the ICBL MAWG will update the NGO portfolios and make them available on the Internet . Reciprocal links will be developed amongst numerous relevant organizations . Improving the quality of mine action information from the field : The SCE endorsed the work of the Survey Action Centre ( SAC ) and recommended that survey findings be disseminated and that further surveys take place . To this end , surveys are being undertaken or planned for Cambodia , Chad , Lebanon , Mozambique and Thailand . Improving the testing and evaluation of demining equipment : The SCE recommended that measures be taken to enhance the testing and evaluation of mine clearance equipment , with a focus on technologies that are affordable , accessible and appropriate . An International Test and Evaluation Program ( ITEP ) for humanitarian demining equipment , processes and methods has been established through a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 17 July 2000 between the European Commission , Canada , the United States , Belgium , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands and Sweden . The ITEP mandate is to develop methods for test and evaluation and to use these methods to evaluate demining equipment before it is deployed to the field . Victim assistance , socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness Disseminating information on victim assistance programmes : A number of actions were proposed by the SCE with respect to the development and distribution of a portfolio of victim assistance programmes in order to highlight the range of victim assistance activities , promote transparency in programming and highlight current gaps in our efforts . The ICBL Working Group on Victim Assistance ( WGVA ) , as the facilitator of the Portfolio Network Group of the Standing Committee of Experts on Victim Assistance , produced the Portfolio of Victims Assistance Programs , which was distributed at the SMSP . The WGVA will make the Portfolio more broadly available via the Internet and other distribution methods and will update it annually if it is deemed to be a useful tool . Enhancing transparency in victim assistance programming : The SCE recommended that further work be undertaken to enhance transparency surrounding the implementation of , and compliance with , Article 6.3 of the Convention regarding the provision of assistance to landmine victims . Consequently , ICBL WGVA will continue its work to provide States Parties with guidance on how to effectively report on implementation of Article 6.3 of the Convention , including providing suggestions on how to use AForm J @ in the amended Article 7 reporting format . Disseminating victim assistance information through national focal points : The SCE recommended that governments establish a focal point on victim assistance from which information such as the global portfolio , guidelines and methodologies could be channelled to relevant actors . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the United Nations Children = s Fund ( UNICEF ) together with the ICBL will approach all relevant States by December 2000 to designate these focal points . Coordinating donor activity : The SCE recommended that interested parties further develop more effective methods of donor coordination , at both the country and global levels . Sweden will work with interested parties to facilitate the establishment of mechanisms , which would interact directly with relevant victim assistance coordinating bodies in mine-affected countries . ( Note : Mozambique , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan and others have already established coordinating mechanisms . Disseminating and encouraging implementation of all victim assistance guidelines : Relevant parties were encouraged by the SCE to take into account existing victim assistance guidelines when developing and evaluating victim assistance programmes . To this end , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , WHO , UNICEF , ICBL and UNMAS have distributed the major guidelines on victim assistance to mine action centres , demining institutes , governments and numerous other relevant organizations . These organizations will ensure additional distribution of guidelines as required . In addition , the GICHD will contribute to the collection and dissemination of guidelines through its web site and documentation centre . Disseminating and implementing mine awareness guidelines : Relevant parties were encouraged by the SCE to ensure that the UNICEF Guidelines for Mine Awareness are widely disseminated as a learning tool for programming agencies and integrated into programme development . UNICEF will continue its active dissemination of the Mine Awareness Guidelines . In addition , on 12 September 2000 , UNICEF launched its initiative aimed at training programme managers and mine awareness community facilitators . Improving victim assistance data and information management : The SCE recommended that enhancements be made to the Information Management System for Mine Action ( IMSMA ) to take into consideration data related to mine awareness and mine incidents . To this end , UNMAS and the GICHD are further developing and refining relevant IMSMA modules . In addition , the SCE recommended that WHO further develop its integrated surveillance system on victims and trauma in a gender-disaggregated form . WHO will follow-up on this recommendation . Improving victim assistance information and data collection : A number of actions were proposed by the SCE with respect to obtaining more reliable victim assistance data and more effectively disseminating these data . In addition , Landmine Survivors Network will , with support from UNMAS , expand the Rehab Service Database . Stockpile destruction Providing assistance for stockpile destruction : It was recommended by the SCE that those parties that have completed the destruction of their stockpiles make their expertise available to those in need . To this end , Switzerland will establish a training programme for stockpile destruction management . Furthermore , to assist in fulfilling this objective in the Americas , Argentina and Canada , in cooperation with the Organization of American States ( OAS ) and the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs ( UNDDA ) , will host a seminar in Buenos Aires on 6-7 November 2000 . Improving the exchange of information on stockpile destruction : It was agreed within the SCE that efforts should be made to collect and exchange more information on the stockpile destruction needs of States Parties and other States , and the assistance available to meet these needs . Accordingly , Canada is assisting UNMAS in developing a web site to facilitate information exchanges on experiences and best practices in stockpile destruction and to enable States that may need technical assistance to make their needs known . In addition , UNDP has compiled a number of case studies on stockpile destruction which it will disseminate . Destroying mines in an efficient and environmentally sound manner : Discussions were held within the SCE on ways and means to ensure that global stocks are destroyed in the fastest , most cost-effective way and with the least harmful effects to the environment . To facilitate exchanges of technical information on these issues , Hungary and Canada will host a seminar in early 2001 on the unique challenges associated with the destruction of PFM mines , which , if not handled properly , can corrode and cause significant damage to individuals and the environment . General status and operation of the Convention Universalizing the Convention : The importance of continuing efforts leading to the universalization of the Convention was highlighted by the SCE . Several States Parties , including Argentina , Australia , Belgium , Canada , Hungary , the Netherlands , Norway , South Africa , Switzerland and the United Kingdom , along with the ICRC and ICBL , have agreed to continue activities of an informal and open-ended Universalization Contact Group to facilitate coordinated action with a view to encouraging additional ratifications and accessions to the Convention . In addition , France and Canada , in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , are organizing a conference on the universalization and implementation of the Convention in Africa , to be hosted by Mali in Bamako on 15-16 February 2001 . Encouraging compliance with Article 7 : The SCE recommended that joint efforts be undertaken to encourage compliance with Article 7 of the Convention . To this end , Belgium has agreed to continue to coordinate these efforts with the participation of all interested parties . In addition , Belgium will work with interested States , the ICBL and UNDDA to develop a guide to completing Article 7 reports . Continuing dialogue on Article 2 : The SCE welcomed the offer by the ICRC to host discussions to examine the technical characteristics of existing stocks of anti-vehicle mines , as well as those that may be acquired in the future , to ensure that they are designed to minimize the risk to civilians . The ICRC has confirmed that it will host discussions on these matters in March or April 2001 and will provide further details on the structure of and preparations for the meeting in time for the December 2000 Standing Committee meetings . Operationalizing Article 8 : The SCE agreed that expert work should proceed on matters pertaining to operationalization of Article 8 . To this end , Canada will host a workshop in Ottawa in November 2000 to prepare detailed recommendations in time for possible review in December 2000 by the Standing Committee on the Status and Operation of the Convention . Clarifying matters pertaining to mines retained under Article 3 : The SCE highlighted the need for greater understanding of matters pertaining to anti-personnel mines retained for training and development under Article 3 of the Convention and received numerous clarifications from States Parties on this matter . To further clarify reasons why mines are retained and used in a manner consistent with Article 3 , the Co-Chairs of the Standing Committee on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , Belgium and Zimbabwe , will continue a dialogue on this topic during future meetings of the Standing Committee . Promoting the establishment of national implementing legislation : The SCE invited States Parties to work with interested organizations to develop a sample package of existing implementation legislation to assist other States Parties in establishing legislation . In response to this suggestion , the ICRC will work with the ICBL , the Co-Chairs of the Standing Committee on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , Belgium and Zimbabwe , and other interested parties on developing and disseminating such a package of legislation . Preparing for meetings of the States Parties : The SCE undertook to prepare for the Second Meeting of the States Parties . To build upon this practice , the Co-Chairs of the Standing Committee on the General Status and Operation of the Convention , Belgium and Zimbabwe , will ensure that work proceeds in preparation for the Third Meeting of the States Parties . As part of this work , the Co-Chairs will review the rules of procedure in consultation with the Coordinating Committee . September 16 : Handicap International Landmines Day .

177	"Good afternoon . There 's a medical revolution happening all around us , and it 's one that 's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions , including cancer . And the revolution is called angiogenesis , and it 's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels . So why should we care about blood vessels ? Well , the human body is literally packed with them , 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult . End to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice . The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries . We 've got 19 billion of them in our bodies . And these are the vessels of life , and , as I 'll show you , they can also be the vessels of death . Now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in . For example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood . In the lung , they line air sacs for gas exchange . In muscle , they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation . And in nerves , they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive . And we get most of these blood vessels when we 're actually still in the womb . And what that means is that , as adults , blood vessels do n't normally grow , except in a few special circumstances . In women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus . During pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby . And after injury , blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound . And this is actually what it looks like . Hundreds of blood vessels all growing to the center of the wound . So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time . And it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances , stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis , such that , when we need a brief burst of blood vessels , the body can do this by releasing stimulators , proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout . And when those excess vessels are no longer needed , the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis . Now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline , and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels . For example , after an injury . And a body can do that too , but only to that normal level , that set point . But what we now know is , for a number of diseases , there are defects in the system , where the body ca n ' t prune back extra blood vessels or ca n ' t grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time . And in these situations , angiogenesis is out of balance . And when angiogenesis is out of balance , a myriad of diseases result . For example , insufficient angiogenesis , not enough blood vessels , leads to wounds that do n't heal , heart attacks , legs without circulation , death from stroke , nerve damage . And on the other end , excessive angiogenesis , too many blood vessels , drives disease . And we see this in cancer , blindness , arthritis , obesity , Alzheimer's disease . In total , there are more than 70 major diseases , affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator . And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis . Now I 'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer , every type of cancer . So here we go . This is a tumor , dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain . And under the microscope , you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels , capillaries that are feeding cancer cells , bringing oxygen and nutrients . But cancers do n't start out like this . And , in fact , cancers do n't start out with a blood supply . They start out as small , microscopic nests of cells That can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size . That 's the tip of a ballpoint pen . Then they ca n ' t get any larger because they do n't have a blood supply , so they do n't have enough oxygen or nutrients . And in fact , we 're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body . Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts . About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers . And virtually 100 percent of us , by the time we reach our 70s , will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid . Yet , without a blood supply , most of these cancers will never become dangerous . Dr. Judah Folkman , who was my mentor , and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field , once called this "" cancer without disease . "" So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis , when it 's working properly , prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers . And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer . In fact , if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells , tumors simply ca n ' t grow up . But once angiogenesis occurs , cancers can grow exponentially . And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly . Cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors , natural fertilizer , that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer . And once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues . And the same vessels that are feeding tumors , allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases . And , unfortunately , this late stage of cancer is the one at which it 's most likely to be diagnosed , when angiogenesis is already turned on , and cancer cells are growing like wild . So , if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one , then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply . We call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it 's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers . And we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body . They 're abnormal ; they 're very poorly constructed ; and , because of that , they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them . In effect , when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a glioma , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved . Here 's a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin , which is FDA approved . And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment . Well , I 've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy . So , a few years ago , I asked myself , "" Can we take this one step further , and treat other cancers , even in other species ? "" So here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo who had a very agressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder . It invaded into his lungs . His veterinarian only gave him three months to live . So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an antiangiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor . And within a few weeks of treatment , we were able to slow down that cancer's growth such that we were ultimately able to extend milo's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted , all with a very good quality of life . And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs . We have about a 60 percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized . So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples . This is 20 year old dolphin living in Florida , and she had these lesions in her mouth that , over the course of three years , developed into invasive squamous cell cancers . So we created an antiangiogenic paste . We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week . And over the course of seven months , the cancers completely disappeared , and the biopsies came back as normal . Here 's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named Guiness . It 's a very , very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma . It had already spread to his lymph nodes , so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail , so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside . And over the course of six months , he experienced a complete remission . And here he is six years later , Guiness , with his very happy owner . ( Applause ) Now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers . And , in fact , the first pioneering treatments , for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available . There 's 12 different drugs , 11 different cancer types , but the real question is : How well do these work in practice ? So here 's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer . And the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available . But starting in 2004 , when antiangiogenic therapies first became available , well you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer , multiple myeloma , colorectal cancer , and gastrointestinal stromal tumors . That 's impressive . But for other tumors and cancer types , the improvements have only been modest . So I started asking myself , "" Why have n ' t we been able to do better ? "" And the answer , to me , is obvious ; we 're treating cancer too late in the game , when it 's already established , and , oftentimes , it 's already spread or metastasized . And as a doctor , I know that , once a disease progresses to an advanced stage , achieving a cure can be difficult , if not impossible . So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking : Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis , beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous ? This could help healthy people as well as people who 've already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back . So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer , I went back to look at cancer's causes . And what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers . Now , the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet , what what to strip out , take away . But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : What could we be adding to our diet that 's naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ? In other words , can we eat to starve cancer ? Well , the answer 's yes . And I 'm going to show you how . And our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we 've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis . So here 's a test system we developed . At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a star burst fashion . And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating . So let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes . The active ingredient's resveratrol . It 's also found in red wine . This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent . Here 's what happens when we add an extract from strawberries . It potently inhibits angiogenesis . And extract from soy beans . And here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we 're interested in studying . And for each food type , we believe there is different potencies within different strains and varietals . And we want to measure this because , well , while you 're eating a strawberry or drinking tea , why not select the one that 's most potent for preventing cancer . So here are four different teas that we 've tested . They 're all common ones , Chinese jasmine , Japanese sencha , Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared . And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent . But what 's very cool is when we actually combined the two less potent teas together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone . This means there 's food synergy . Here 's some more data from our testing . Now , in the lab , we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar . And using this system , we can test the potency of cancer drugs . So the shorter the bar , less angiogenesis , that 's good . And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people . Statins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others , they inhibit angiogenesis too . And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs . You can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they 're more potent than the actual drugs . Soy , parsley , garlic , grapes , berries , I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients . So imagine if we could create the world's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic cancer-preventative properties . And that 's what we 're doing right now . Now , I 've shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ? Well , the best example I know is a study of 79,000 men , followed over 20 years , in which it was found that men whom consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer . Now , we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene , and lycopene is antiangiogenic . But what 's even more interesting from this study is that those men who did develop prostate cancer , those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer . So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer . And we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream . Now , obviously , what I 've shared with you has some far-ranging implications even beyond cancer research . Because if we 're right , it could impact on consumer education , food services , public health and even the insurance industry . And , in fact , some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines . Check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota . And for many people around the world , dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments , but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local , sustainable , antiangiogenic crops . Now , finally , I 've talked to you about food , and I 've talked to you about cancer , so there 's just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that 's obesity . Because it turns out that adipose tissue , fat , is highly angiogenesis dependent . And , like a tumor , fat grows when blood vessels grow . So the question is : Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply ? So the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop , until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball . And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse . If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight . Stop the treatment , gains the weight back . Restart the treatment , loses the weight again . Stop the treatment , it gains the weight back . And , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis . So this approach that we 're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity . The really , truly interesting thing about this is that we ca n ' t take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be . In other words , we ca n ' t create supermodel mice . ( Laughter ) And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points . Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that , "" Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen , and thinking what no one has thought . "" I hope I 've convinced you that , for diseases like cancer , obesity and other conditions , that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator , angiogenesis . And that 's what I think the world needs now . Thank you . ( Applause ) June Cohen : So these drugs are n ' t exactly -- they 're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now . For anyone out here who has cancer , what would you recommend ? Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ? William Li : So there are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved . And if you 're a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one , you should ask about them . And there are many clinical trials . The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there 's about 100 more drugs in that pipeline . So consider the approved ones , look for clinical trials , but then between what the doctor can do for you , we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves . And this is one of the themes that I 'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors ca n ' t do for us , which is to use knowledge and take action . And if mother nature has given us some clues , we think that there might be a new future in the value of how we eat . And what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day . JC : Right . And along those lines , for people who might have risk factors for cancer , would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ? WL : Well , you know , there 's an abundant epidemiological evidence . And I think in the information age , it does n ' t take long to go to a credible source like Pubmed , the National Library of Medicine , to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications . And that 's certainly something that anybody can look into . JC : Okay . Well , thank you so much . ( Applause ) </content"	3

PART VI ENFORCEMENT NOTICES-LISTED BUILDINGS Listed buildings Listed building enforcement notices 77 . ( 1 ) Where it appears to the Department that any works have been or are being executed to a listed building and are such as to involve a contravention of Article 44 ( 1 ) or ( 5 ) , then , subject to paragraph ( 3 ) , the Department may , if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the effect of the works on the character of the building as one of special architectural or historic interest , issue a notice ( a ) . specifying the alleged contravention ; and ( b ) . requiring such steps as may be specified in the notice to be taken within such period as may be so specified i . for restoring the building to its former state ; or ii . where the Department considers that such restoration would not be reasonably practicable , or would be undesirable , for executing such further works specified in the notice as it considers necessary to alleviate the effect of the works which were carried out without listed building consent ; or iii . for bringing the building to the state in which it would have been if the terms and conditions of any listed building consent which has been granted for the works had been compiled with . ( 2 ) A notice under this Article is referred to in this Order as a "" listed building enforcement notice "" .

( 1 ) A person having an estate in the building to which a listed building enforcement notice relates or a person to whom paragraph ( 2 ) applies may , at any time before the date specified in the notice as the date on which it is to take effect , appeal to the planning appeals commission against the notice on any of the following grounds ( a ) that the matters alleged to constitute a contravention of Article 44 do not involve such a contravention ; ( b ) that the contravention of that Article alleged in the notice has not taken place ; ( c ) that the contravention of that Article alleged in the notice occurred before 9th December 1978 ; ( d ) that works to the building were urgently necessary in the interests of safety or health or for the preservation of the building , that it was not practicable to secure safety or health or , as the case may be , the preservation of the building by works of repair or works for affording temporary support or shelter , and that the works carried out were limited to the minimum measures immediately necessary ; ( e ) that listed building consent ought to be granted for the works , or that any relevant condition of such consent which has been granted ought to be discharged or different conditions substituted ; ( f ) that copies of the notice were not served as required by Article 68 ( 5 ) as applied by Article 77 ( 6 ) ; ( g ) that the period specified in the notice as the period within which any step required thereby is to be taken falls short of what should reasonably be allowed ; ( h ) except in relation to such a requirement as is mentioned in Article 77 ( 1 ) ( b ) ( ii ) or ( iii ) , the requirements of the notice exceed what is necessary for restoring the building to its condition before the works were carried out ; ( i ) that the steps required by the notice for the purpose of restoring the character of the building to its former state would not serve that purpose ; ( j ) that steps required to be taken by virtue of Article 77 ( 1 ) ( b ) ( ii ) exceed what is necessary to alleviate the effect of the works executed to the building ; ( k ) that steps required to be taken by virtue of Article 77 ( a ) ( b ) ( iii ) exceed what is necessary to bring the building to the state in which it would have been if the terms and conditions of the listed building consent had been complied with . ( 2 ) This paragraph applies to a person who on the date on which the listed building enforcement notice is issued occupies the building to which it relates by virtue of a licence in writing ; and continues to occupy the building as aforesaid when the appeal is brought . ( 3 ) Paragraphs ( 4 ) to ( 8 ) of Article 69 to 70 shall , with any necessary modifications , apply to an appeal under this Article against a listed building enforcement notice as they apply to an appeal under Article 69 against an enforcement notice . ( 4 ) On the determination of an appeal under this Article , the planning appeals commission may ( a ) grant listed building consent for the works to which the listed building enforcement notice relates or for part only of those works ; ( b ) discharge any condition or limitation subject to which listed building consent was granted and substitute any other condition , whether more or less onerous . ( 5 ) Any listed building consent granted by the planning appeals commission under paragraph ( 4 ) shall , subject to paragraph ( 6 ) , have the like effect as a listed building consent granted under Part V. ( 6 ) The decision of the commission in relation to the grant of listed building consent under paragraph ( 4 ) shall be final .

Effect of listed building consent on listed buildings enforcement notice . 79 . ( 1 ) If , after the issue of a listed building enforcement notice , consent is granted under Article 44 ( 3 ) for the retention of any work to which the listed building enforcement notice relates , the listed building enforcement notice shall cease to have effect in so far as it requires steps to be taken which would involve the works not being retained in accordance with the consent . ( 2 ) If the consent is granted so as to permit the retention of works without complying with some condition subject to which a previous listed building consent was granted , the listed building enforcement notice shall cease to have effect in so far as it requires steps to be taken for complying with that condition . ( 3 ) The preceding provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to the liability of any person for an offence n respect of a failure to comply with the listed building enforcement notice before the relevant provisions of that notice ceased to have effect . Urgent works to preserve building 80 . ( 1 ) Where it appears to the Department that works are urgently necessary for the preservation of ( a ) . a listed building , or ( b ) . a building in respect of which a direction has been given by the Department that this Article shall apply , the Department may , subject to the following provisions of this Article , execute the works , which may consist of or include works for affording temporary support or shelter for the building . ( 2 ) The ground on which the Department may give a direction that this Article shall apply to a building is that the building is in a conservation area and it appears to the Department that its preservation is important for maintaining the character or appearance of the conservation area . ( 3 ) If the building is occupied works may be carried out only to those parts which are not in use . ( 4 ) The owner of the building shall be given not less than seven days' notice in writing of the intention to carry out the works and the notice shall describe the works proposed to be carried out .

1215	"EU puts UK-Nissan deal under scrutiny The European Commission says it is in contact with UK authorities after Japan's Nissan said it had been given "" support and assurances "" over Brexit . Nissan's commitment to its Sunderland car plant , the UK's biggest , had been in doubt following the EU referendum . But after government pledges , Nissan is to build two key models in the UK . "" We have seen the press reports regarding Nissan and as a result the Commission ... is in contact with the UK authorities , "" a spokesman said . UK Business Secretary Greg Clark has said Nissan was told that the government would seek tariff-free access to EU markets for the car industry . However , the agreement has raised fears that the government might have breached EU rules preventing unfair state aid to companies . The Commission spokesman said : "" The UK authorities have not notified any support to Nissan for assessment under our state aid rules and we 've therefore not taken any formal view of this matter . "" Depending on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU , Britain may well no longer be bound by EU state aid rules following Brexit . But as long as it remains a member , the UK would not be able to favour particular companies . Mr Clark has insisted that that there was "" no cheque book "" involved in the assurances given to Nissan ."	8
14	"The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50 CAMBRIDGE – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis – those 13 days in October 1962 that were probably the closest the world has come to a major nuclear war . President John F. Kennedy had publicly warned the Soviet Union [ 178 ] not to introduce offensive missiles into Cuba . But Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to cross Kennedy's red line surreptitiously and confront the Americans with a fait accompli . When an American surveillance plane discovered the missiles , the crisis erupted . Some of Kennedy's advisers urged an air strike and invasion to destroy the missiles . Kennedy mobilized troops , but also bought time by [ 179 ] announcing a naval blockade of Cuba . The crisis subsided when Soviet ships carrying additional missiles turned back , and Khrushchev agreed to remove the existing missiles from the island . As then US Secretary of State Dean Rusk put it : "" We were eyeball to eyeball , and I think the other fellow just blinked . "" At first glance , this was a rational and predictable outcome . The United States had a 17-to-1 advantage in nuclear weaponry . The Soviets were simply outgunned . And yet the US did not preemptively attack Soviet missile sites , which were relatively vulnerable , because the risk that even one or two of the Soviet missiles would be fired at an American city was enough to deter a first strike . In addition , both Kennedy and Khrushchev feared that rational strategies and careful calculation might spin out of control . Khrushchev offered a vivid metaphor in one of his letters to Kennedy : [ 180 ] "" We and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war . "" In 1987 , I was part of a group of scholars that met at Harvard University with Kennedy's surviving advisers to study the crisis . Robert McNamara , Kennedy's secretary of defense , said he became more cautious as the crisis unfolded . At the time , he thought that the probability of nuclear war resulting from the crisis might have been one in 50 ( though he rated the risk much higher after he learned in the 1990's that the Soviets had already delivered nuclear weapons to Cuba ) . Douglas Dillon , Kennedy's treasury secretary , said he thought that the risk of nuclear war had been about zero . He did not see how the situation could possibly have escalated to nuclear war , and thus had been willing to push the Soviets harder and to take more risks than McNamara was . General Maxwell Taylor , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , also believed that the risk of nuclear war was low , and he complained that the US let the Soviet Union off too easily . He felt that the Americans should have removed the Castro regime . But the risks of losing control of the situation weighed heavily on Kennedy , too , which is why he took a more prudent position than some of his advisers would have liked . The moral of the story is that a little nuclear deterrence goes a long way . Nonetheless , there are still ambiguities about the missile crisis that make it difficult to attribute the outcome entirely to the nuclear component . The public consensus was that the US won . But how much the US won , and why it won , is hard to determine . There are at least two possible explanations of the outcome , in addition to Soviet acquiescence to America's superior nuclear firepower . One focuses on the importance of the two superpowers' relative stakes in the crisis : the US not only had a greater stake in neighboring Cuba than the Soviets did , but could also bring conventional forces to bear . The naval blockade and the possibility of a US invasion strengthened the credibility of American deterrence , placing the psychological burden on the Soviets . The other explanation questions the very premise that the Cuban missile crisis was an outright US victory . The Americans had three options : a "" shoot-out "" ( bomb the missile sites ) ; a "" squeeze out "" ( blockade Cuba to convince the Soviets to withdraw the missiles ) ; and a "" buyout "" ( give the Soviets something they want ) . For a long time , the participants said little about the buyout aspects of the solution . But subsequent evidence suggests that a quiet US promise to remove its obsolete missiles from Turkey and Italy was probably more important than was thought at the time ( the US also gave a public assurance that it would not invade Cuba ) . We can conclude that nuclear deterrence mattered in the crisis , and that the nuclear dimension certainly figured in Kennedy's thinking . But it was not the ratio of nuclear weapons that mattered so much as the fear that even a few nuclear weapons would wreak intolerable devastation . How real were these risks ? On October 27 , 1962 , just after Soviet forces in Cuba shot down a US surveillance plane ( killing the pilot ) , a similar plane taking routine air samples near Alaska inadvertently violated Soviet air space in Siberia . Fortunately , it was not shot down . But , even more serious , unbeknownst to the Americans , Soviet forces in Cuba had been instructed to repel a US invasion , and had been authorized to use their tactical nuclear weapons to do so . It is hard to imagine that such a nuclear attack would have remained merely tactical . Kenneth Waltz , an American scholar , recently published an article entitled [ 181 ] "" Why Iran Should Get the Bomb . "" In a rational , predictable world , such an outcome might produce stability . In the real world , the Cuban missile crisis suggests that it might not . As McNamara put it , "" We lucked out . """	0

737	Residential Care for Children What is it ? Children's homes are there to ensure that the needs of children are met when they can not live with their own family . When children and young people come to live in a children's home they will have a care plan . Their care plan says why a child is living in a home , what is supposed to happen while they are living there and what is supposed to happen at the end of their stay . Most children will go home , but a few go to live with other families and a few go to live in other homes . It is very important that children and young people stay in touch with their family and friends . It is only when they might be hurt , or a court order says that contact is not allowed , that some children will not be able to have visits from their family or go to visit them . Why do children go into residential homes ? The reasons can be very varied . These include : their parents are unwell they have problems with their family and need to spend some time away from home , eg : behaviour problems or educational difficulties they may have a disability and need a break from living with their families they are in the care of local authority subject on a court order or an interim care order Generally , when children and young people need to live away from their families , they will stay with foster carers . It is only when foster care is either not possible or not desirable , or not what the young person would choose , that residential care is decided upon . In all cases , we make sure that all the alternatives are fully considered before recommending residential care . What provision is there for older children ? Older children who are not planning to return home , are given help to prepare them for living on their own - this is called aftercare .	0
1107	"William Howard Taft ( September 15 , 1857 – March 8 , 1930 ) was an American politician who served as the 27th President of the United States ( 1909 – 1913 ) and as the 10th Chief Justice of the United States ( 1921 – 1930 ) , the only person to have held both offices . Taft was elected president in 1908 , the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate . In 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft Chief Justice , a position in which he served until a month before his death . With Roosevelt's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 , and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November . In the White House , he focused on the Far East more than European affairs , and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments . Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs , then a major source of governmental income , but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests . His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party , with which Taft often sympathized , and the progressive wing , toward which Roosevelt moved more and more . Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men . Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912 . Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates , and Roosevelt bolted the party . The split left Taft with little chance of re-election , and in Wilson's victory won only Utah and Vermont . After leaving office , Taft returned to Yale as a professor , continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace . In 1921 , President Harding appointed Taft chief justice , an office he had long sought . Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues , but under him , there were advances in individual rights . In poor health , he resigned in February 1930 . After his death the next month , he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery , the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there . Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents . William Taft was not seen as brilliant as a child , but was a hard worker ; the demanding parents pushed their five boys [ a ] toward success , tolerating nothing less . He attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati . At Yale College , which he entered in 1874 , the heavyset , jovial Taft was popular . One classmate described him succeeding through hard work rather than being the smartest , with sterling integrity . [ 3 ] In 1878 , Taft graduated , second in his class out of 121 . [ 4 ] He attended Cincinnati Law School , [ 5 ] and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1880 . While in law school , he worked on The Cincinnati Commercial newspaper , [ 4 ] edited by Murat Halstead . Taft was assigned to cover the local courts , and also spent time reading law in his father's office ; both activities gave him practical knowledge of the law that was taught in no class . Shortly before graduating from law school , Taft went to the state capital of Columbus to take the bar examination and easily passed . [ 6 ] After admission to the Ohio bar , Taft devoted himself to his job at the Commercial full-time . Halstead was willing to take him on permanently at an increase in salary if he would give up the law , but Taft declined . In October 1880 , Taft was appointed assistant prosecutor for Hamilton County ( where Cincinnati is located ) , and took office the following January . Taft served for a year as assistant prosecutor , trying his share of routine cases . [ 7 ] He resigned in January 1882 after President Chester A. Arthur appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue for Ohio's First District , an area centered on Cincinnati . [ 8 ] Taft refused to dismiss competent employees who were politically out of favor , and resigned effective in March 1883 , writing to Arthur that he wished to begin private practice in Cincinnati . [ 9 ] In 1884 , Taft campaigned for the Republican candidate for president , Maine Senator James G. Blaine , who lost to New York Governor Grover Cleveland . [ 10 ] In 1887 , Taft , then aged 29 , was appointed to a vacancy on the Superior Court of Cincinnati by Governor Joseph B. Foraker . The appointment was good for just over a year , after which he would have to face the voters , and in April 1888 , he sought election for the first of three times in his lifetime , the other two being for the presidency . He was elected to a full five-year term . Some two dozen of Taft's opinions as a state judge survive , the most significant being Moores & Co. v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1 [ b ] ( 1889 ) if only because it was used against him when he ran for president in 1908 . The case involved bricklayers who refused to work for any firm that dealt with a company called Parker Brothers , with which they were in dispute . Taft ruled that the union's action amounted to a secondary boycott , which was illegal . [ 11 ] It is not clear when Taft met Helen Herron ( often called Nellie ) , but it was no later than 1880 , when she mentioned in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him . By 1884 , they were meeting regularly , and in 1885 , after an initial rejection , she agreed to marry him . The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19 , 1886 . William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage . Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had , and she could be very frank with her criticisms . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The couple had three children , of which the eldest , Robert , became a U.S. senator . [ 1 ] There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889 , and Governor Foraker suggested President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it . Taft was 32 and his professional goal was always a seat on the high court . He actively sought the appointment , writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case , while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it . Instead , in 1890 , Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States . When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890 , the office had been vacant two months , with the work piling up . He worked to eliminate the backlog , while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge . [ 14 ] New York Senator William M. Evarts , a former Secretary of State , had been a classmate of Alphonso Taft at Yale . [ c ] Evarts called to see his friend's son as soon as Taft took office , and William and Nellie Taft were launched into Washington society . Nellie Taft was ambitious for herself and her husband , and was annoyed when the people he socialized with most were mainly Supreme Court justices , rather than the arbiters of Washington society such as Theodore Roosevelt , John Hay , Henry Cabot Lodge and their wives . [ 15 ] Although Taft was successful as Solicitor General , winning 15 of the 18 cases he argued before the Supreme Court , [ 1 ] he was glad when in March 1891 , Congress created a new judgeship for each of the United States Courts of Appeal and Harrison appointed him to the Sixth Circuit , based in Cincinnati . In March 1892 , Taft resigned as Solicitor General to resume his judicial career . [ 16 ] Taft's federal judgeship was a lifetime appointment , and one from which promotion to the Supreme Court might come . Taft's older half-brother Charles , successful in business , supplemented Taft's government salary , allowing William and Nellie Taft and their family to live in comfort . Taft's duties involved hearing trials in the circuit , which included Ohio , Michigan , Kentucky , and Tennessee , and participating with Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan , the circuit justice , and judges of the Sixth Circuit in hearing appeals . Taft spent eight years of his life , from 1892 to 1900 , in personal and professional contentment . [ 17 ] According to historian Louis L. Gould , "" while Taft shared the fears about social unrest that dominated the middle classes during the 1890s , he was not as conservative as his critics believed . He supported the right of labor to organize and strike , and he ruled against employers in several negligence cases . "" [ 1 ] Among these was Voight v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway Co. [ d ] Taft's decision for a worker injured in a railway accident violated the contemporary doctrine of liberty of contract , and he was reversed by the Supreme Court . [ e ] On the other hand , Taft's opinion in United States v. Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. [ f ] was upheld unanimously by the high court . [ g ] Taft's opinion , in which he held that a pipe manufacturers' association had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act , [ 18 ] was described by Henry Pringle , his biographer , as having "" definitely and specifically revived "" that legislation . [ 19 ] In 1896 , Taft became dean and Professor of Property at his alma mater , the Cincinnati Law School , a post that required him to prepare and give two hour-long lectures each week . [ 20 ] He was devoted to his law school , and was deeply committed to legal education , introducing the case system to the curriculum . [ 21 ] As a federal judge , Taft could not involve himself with politics , but followed it closely , remaining a Republican supporter . He watched with some disbelief as the campaign of Ohio Governor William McKinley developed in 1894 and 1895 , writing "" I can not find anybody in Washington who wants him "" . [ 21 ] By March 1896 , Taft realized that McKinley would likely be nominated , and was lukewarm in his support . He landed solidly in McKinley's camp after former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan in July stampeded the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech . Bryan , both in that address and in his campaign , strongly advocated free silver , a policy that Taft saw as economic radicalism . Taft feared that people would hoard gold in anticipation of a Bryan victory , but he could do nothing but worry . McKinley was elected ; when a place on the Supreme Court opened in 1898 , the only one under McKinley , the president named Joseph McKenna . [ 22 ] In January 1900 , Taft was called to Washington to meet with McKinley . Taft hoped a Supreme Court appointment was in the works , but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on the commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines . The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench ; the president assured him that if he fulfilled this task , McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court . Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission , with responsibility for success or failure ; McKinley agreed , and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900 . [ 23 ] Many Filipinos had responded to the American takeover with a fierce resistance , seeking independence for the islands , but U.S. forces , led by military governor General Arthur MacArthur , Jr. [ h ] had the upper hand by 1900 . MacArthur felt the commission was a nuisance , and their mission a quixotic attempt to impose self-government on a people unready for it . The general was forced to co-operate with Taft , as McKinley had given the commission control over the islands' military budget . [ 24 ] The commission took executive power in the Philippines on September 1 , 1900 ; on July 4 , 1901 , Taft became civilian governor . MacArthur , until then the military governor , was relieved by General Adna Chaffee , who was designated only as commander of American forces . [ 25 ] Taft sought to make the Filipinos partners in a venture that would lead to their self-government ; he saw independence as something far off . Many Americans in the Philippines viewed the locals as racial inferiors , but Taft wrote soon before his arrival , "" we propose to banish this idea from their minds "" . [ 26 ] Taft did not impose segregation at official events , and treated the Filipinos as social equals . [ 27 ] Nellie Taft recalled that "" neither politics nor race should influence our hospitality in any way "" . [ 28 ] McKinley was assassinated in September 1901 , and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt . Taft and Roosevelt had first become friends around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt a member of the Civil Service Commission . Taft had , after McKinley's election , urged the appointment of Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy , and watched as Roosevelt became a war hero , Governor of New York , and Vice President of the United States . They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recuperate after two operations caused by an infection . [ 29 ] There , Taft testified before the Senate Committee on the Philippines . Taft wanted to have Filipino farmers to have a stake in the new government through land ownership , but much of the arable land was held by Catholic religious orders , priests who were mostly Spanish , and were often resented by the Filipinos . Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to negotiate with Pope Leo XIII , to purchase the lands and to arrange the withdrawal of the Spanish priests , with Americans replacing them and training locals as clergy . Taft did not succeed in resolving these issues on his visit to Rome , but an agreement on both points was made in 1903 . [ 30 ] In late 1902 , Taft had heard from Roosevelt that a seat on the Supreme Court would soon fall vacant on the resignation of Justice George Shiras , and Roosevelt desired that Taft fill it . Although this was Taft's professional goal , he refused as he felt his work as governor was not yet done . [ 31 ] One reason for Roosevelt's action was his desire to neutralize a potential rival for the presidency : Taft's success in the Philippines had not gone unnoticed in the American press . [ 32 ] The following year , Roosevelt asked Taft to become Secretary of War . As the War Department was responsible for the Philippines , Taft would remain responsible for the islands , and Root was willing to postpone his departure until 1904 , allowing Taft time to wrap up his work in Manila . After consulting with his family , Taft agreed , and sailed for the United States in December 1903 . [ 33 ] Roosevelt introduces Taft as his crown prince : Puck magazine cover , 1906 . When Taft took office as Secretary of War in January 1904 , he was not called upon to spend much time administering the army , which the president was content to do himself – Roosevelt wanted him as a troubleshooter in difficult situations , as a legal adviser , and to be able to give campaign speeches as he sought election in his own right . Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses , and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election , "" I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office . It is awful to be afraid of one's shadow . "" [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Between 1905 and 1907 , Taft came to terms with the likelihood he would be the next Republican nominee for president , though he did not plan to actively campaign for it . When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905 , Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it , a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906 . [ 36 ] Edith Roosevelt , the First Lady , disliked the growing closeness between the two men , feeling they were too much alike , and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him . [ 37 ] Alternatively , Taft wanted to be chief justice , and kept a close eye on the health of the aging incumbent , Melville Fuller , who turned 75 in 1908 . Taft believed Fuller likely to live many years . Roosevelt had indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat , but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate . In any event , Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency . [ i ] [ 38 ] Through the 1903 Panamanian Revolution and the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty , the United States had secured rights to build a canal in the Isthmus of Panama . Legislation authorizing construction did not specify which government department would be responsible , and Roosevelt designated the Department of War . Taft journeyed to Panama in 1904 , viewing the canal site and meeting with Panamanian officials . The Isthmian Canal Commission had trouble keeping a chief engineer , and when in February 1907 John D. Stevens submitted his resignation , Taft recommended an army engineer , George W. Goethals . Under Goethals , the project moved ahead smoothly . [ 39 ] Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba , but as freedom for Cuba had been a major purpose of the war , it was not annexed by the U.S. , but was , after a period of occupation , given independence in 1902 . Election fraud and corruption followed , as did factional conflict . In September 1906 , President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention . Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force , and on September 29 , 1906 , under the terms of the Cuban – American Treaty of Relations of 1903 , declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba , a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon . In his time in Cuba , Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability , not occupation . [ 40 ] Taft remained involved in Philippine affairs . During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904 , he urged that Philippine agricultural products be admitted to the U.S. without duty . This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt , who remonstrated with his Secretary of War . Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position , and threatened to resign ; [ 41 ] Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter . [ 42 ] Taft returned to the islands in 1905 , leading a delegation of congressmen , and again in 1907 , to open the first Philippine Assembly . [ 43 ] On both of his Philippine trips as Secretary of War , Taft went to Japan , and met with officials there . [ 44 ] The meeting in July 1905 came a month before the conference which would end the Russo-Japanese War with the Treaty of Portsmouth . Taft met with Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Tarō . After that meeting , the two signed a memorandum , with Japan indicating it had no desire to invade the Philippines , and the U.S. that it did not object to Japanese control of Korea . [ 45 ] There were U.S. concerns about the number of Japanese laborers coming to the West Coast , and during Taft's second visit , in September 1907 , Tadasu Hayashi , the foreign minister , informally agreed to issue fewer passports to them . [ 46 ] Roosevelt had served almost three and a half years of McKinley's term . On the night of his own election in 1904 , Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908 , a pledge he quickly regretted . But he felt bound by his word . Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor , although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run . [ 47 ] Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent . [ 47 ] On pain of loss of their jobs , political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent . [ 48 ] One of a series of candid photographs known as the Evolution of a Smile , taken just after a formal portrait session , as Taft learns by telephone from Roosevelt of his nomination for president . A number of Republican politicians , such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou tested the waters for a run , but chose to stay out . New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran , but when he made a major policy speech , Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against corporate corruption . The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages . [ 49 ] Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term . [ 50 ] Assistant Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock resigned from his office in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort . [ 51 ] In April , Taft made a speaking tour , traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out another contested election . At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June , there was no serious opposition to him , and he gained a first-ballot victory . Yet , Taft did not have things his own way : he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver , but instead the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York , a conservative . Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote his full-time to the campaign . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Taft's opponent in the general election was Bryan , the Democratic nominee for the third time in four presidential elections . As many of Roosevelt's reforms stemmed from proposals by Bryan , the Democrat argued that he was the heir to Roosevelt's mantle and that Taft was not . Corporate contributions to federal political campaigns had been outlawed by the 1907 Tillman Act , and Bryan proposed that contributions by officers and directors of corporations be similarly banned , or at least disclosed when made . Taft was only willing to see the contributions disclosed after the election , and tried to ensure that officers and directors of corporations litigating with the government were not among his contributors . [ 54 ] 1908 Taft / Sherman poster Taft began the campaign on the wrong foot , fueling the arguments of those who said he was not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech , saying that he needed "" the President's judgment and criticism "" . [ 55 ] He for the most part supported Roosevelt's policies . The candidate argued that labor had a right to organize , but not to boycott . Moneyed interests , that is , capital , must also obey the law . Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government , but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector , with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission , subject to judicial review . Taft attributed blame for the recent recession , the Panic of 1907 , to stock speculation and other abuses , and felt some reform of the currency ( the U.S. was on the gold standard ) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times . Specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act . The constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax , thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down . Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial ; Taft proposed to continue his policies , but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation . [ 56 ] Taft upset some progressives by choosing Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) , placing him in charge of the presidential campaign . Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business . [ 57 ] Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs , Virginia , where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy . After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball , Roosevelt warned him against candid shots . [ 58 ] Electoral vote by state , 1908 . States won by Taft are in red . Roosevelt , frustrated by his own relative inaction , showered Taft with advice , fearing that the electorate would not appreciate Taft's qualities , and that Bryan would win . Roosevelt's supporters spread rumors that the president was in effect running Taft's campaign . This annoyed Nellie Taft , who never trusted the Roosevelts . [ 59 ] Nevertheless , Roosevelt supported the Republican nominee with such enthusiasm that humorists suggested "" TAFT "" stood for "" Take advice from Theodore "" . [ 60 ] Bryan urged a system of bank guarantees , so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed , but Taft opposed this , offering a postal savings system instead . [ 54 ] The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September , Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views . Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter , and Nation left indignant , to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance . Taft , at Roosevelt's advice , ignored the issue . [ 61 ] In the end , Taft won by a comfortable margin . Taft defeated Bryan by 321 electoral votes to 162 ; however , he garnered just 51.6 percent of the popular vote . [ 62 ] Nellie Taft said regarding the campaign , "" There was nothing to criticize , except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played . "" [ 63 ] Longtime White House usher Ike Hoover recalled that Taft came often to see Roosevelt during the campaign , but seldom between the election and Inauguration Day , March 4 , 1909 . [ 64 ] William Howard Taft was sworn in as president on March 4 , 1909 . Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice , Taft was inaugurated within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol as is customary . The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been "" one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor "" and to have had a part "" in the reforms he has initiated . I should be untrue to myself , to my promises , and to the declarations of the party platform on which I was elected if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration "" . [ 65 ] He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting , ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy . He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 Dingley Tariff , for antitrust reform , and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government . [ 66 ] Roosevelt left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over and , to keep out of Taft's way , arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa . [ 67 ] Taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that Roosevelt had , choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had . [ 70 ] His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion for the rule of law . [ 71 ] Taft made it a priority to restructure the State Department , noting , "" it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900 . "" [ 72 ] The Department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions , including desks for the Far East , Latin America and Western Europe . [ 73 ] The department's first in-service training program was established , and appointees spent a month in Washington before going to their posts . [ 74 ] Taft and Secretary of State Knox had a strong relationship , and the president listened to his counsel on matters foreign and domestic . According to Coletta , however , Knox was not a good diplomat , and had poor relations with the Senate , press , and many foreign leaders , especially those from Latin America . [ 75 ] There was broad agreement between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals . The U.S. would not interfere in European affairs . The U.S. would use force if necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas . The defense of the Panama Canal , which was under construction throughout Taft's term ( it opened in 1914 ) , guided U.S. policy in the Caribbean and in Central America . Previous administration had tried to defend American business interests overseas , but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to promote trade . Such ties , Taft hoped , would promote world peace . [ 75 ] Taft promoted arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France , but the Senate was not willing to yield to arbitrators its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties . [ 76 ] At the time of Taft's presidency , protectionism through the use of tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party . [ 77 ] The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition . The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act , and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions . Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15 , 1909 to deal with the tariff question . [ 78 ] Sereno E. Payne , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , had held hearings in late 1908 , and sponsored the resulting draft legislation . On balance , the bill reduced tariffs slightly , but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich , attached many amendments raising rates . This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette , who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform . Taft refused , angering them . [ 79 ] Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty , and according to Anderson , showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and really cared about . [ 80 ] When opponents sought to modify the tariff bill to allow for an income tax , Taft opposed it on the ground that the Supreme Court would likely strike it down as unconstitutional , as it had before . Instead , they proposed a constitutional amendment , which passed both houses in early July , was sent to the states , and by 1913 was ratified as the Sixteenth Amendment . In the conference committee , Taft won some victories , such as limiting the tax on lumber . The conference report passed both houses , and Taft signed it on August 6 , 1909 . The Payne-Aldrich tariff was immediately controversial . According to Coletta , "" Taft had lost the initiative , and the wounds inflicted in the acrid tariff debate never healed "" . [ 81 ] Newton McConnell cartoon showing Canadian suspicions that Taft and others were only interested in Canada when prosperous . In Taft's annual message sent to Congress in December 1910 , he urged a free trade accord for Canada . Britain at that time still handled Canada's foreign relations , and Taft found the British and Canadian governments willing . Many in Canada opposed an accord , fearing the U.S. would dump it when convenient as it had the 1854 Elgin-Marcy Treaty in 1866 , and American farm and fisheries interests were also opposed . After January 1911 talks with Canadian officials , Taft had the agreement , which was not a treaty , introduced into Congress and it passed in late July . The Canadian Parliament , led by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier , had deadlocked over the issue . Canadians turned Laurier out of office in the September 1911 election . No cross-border agreement was concluded , and the debate deepened divisions in the Republican Party . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Taft and Porfirio Díaz , Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , 1909 Taft and his Secretary of State , Philander Knox , instituted a policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America , believing U.S. investment would benefit all involved , while keeping European influence away from areas subject to the Monroe Doctrine . Although exports rose sharply during Taft's administration , the policy was unpopular among Latin American states that did not wish to become financial protectorates of the United States , as well as in the U.S. Senate , many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad . [ 84 ] No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's statesmanship and commitment to peace more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution . [ 85 ] When Taft entered office , Mexico was increasingly restless under the grip of longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz and many Mexicans backed his opponent , Francisco Madero . [ 86 ] There were a number of incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons ; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the army to the border areas for maneuvers . Taft told his military aide , Archibald Butt , that "" I am going to sit on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off "" . [ 87 ] He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico . [ 88 ] The day of the summit , Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only a few feet of the two presidents . [ 88 ] Before the election in Mexico , Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero , whose supporters took up arms resulting in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years . In the U.S. ' s Arizona Territory , two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured , some as a result of gunfire across the border . Taft would not be goaded into fighting and so instructed the territorial governor . [ 85 ] Nicaragua's president , José Santos Zelaya , wanted to revoke commercial concessions granted to American companies , [ j ] and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada . [ 89 ] Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers , and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route fall into the hands of Europeans . Zelaya's elected successor , José Madriz , could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered , and in August 1910 , the Estrada forces took Managua , the capital . The U.S. had Nicaragua accept a loan , and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues . The country remained unstable , and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912 , Taft sent troops ; though most were soon withdrawn , some remained as late as 1933 . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Treaties among Panama , Colombia , and the United States to resolve disputes arising from the Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame-duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909 , and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama . Colombia , however , declined to ratify the treaties , and after the 1912 elections , Knox offered $ 10 million to the Colombians ( later raised to $ 25 million ) . The Colombians felt the amount inadequate , and requested arbitration ; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration . [ 92 ] Due to his years in the Philippines , Taft was keenly interested as president in Far Eastern affairs . [ 93 ] Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant , but because of the potential for trade and investment , Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service . Knox did not agree , and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground . Taft replaced Roosevelt's minister there , William W. Rockhill , as uninterested in the China trade , with William J. Calhoun , whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions . Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy , and there were often conflicts . [ 94 ] Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria . [ 95 ] In 1898 , an American company had gained a concession for a railroad between Hankow and Szechuan , but the Chinese revoked the agreement in 1904 after the company ( which was indemnified for the revocation ) breached the agreement by selling a majority stake outside the United States . The Chinese imperial government got the money for the indemnity from the British Hong Kong government , on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line , and in 1909 , a British-led consortium began negotiations . [ 96 ] This came to Knox's attention in May of that year , and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate . Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent , Zaifeng , Prince Chun , and was successful in gaining U.S. participation , though agreements were not signed until May 1911 . [ 97 ] However , the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces . Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders , and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911 . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] After the revolution broke out , the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of what became the Republic of China , overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty , Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government , although American public opinion was in favor of it . The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic , but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers . Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established , but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through . [ 100 ] Taft continued the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt . A revised treaty of friendship and navigation entered into by the U.S. and Japan in 1911 granted broad reciprocal rights to Japanese in America and Americans in Japan , but were premised on the continuation of the Gentlemen's Agreement . There was objection on the West Coast when the treaty was submitted to the Senate , but Taft informed politicians that there was no change in immigration policy . [ 101 ] Taft was opposed to the traditional practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts , preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who , as Taft put it , would recognize an American when they saw one . High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France , Henry White , whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe . White 's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics . Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London , Whitelaw Reid , but Reid , owner of the New-York Tribune , had backed Taft during the campaign , and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports . Reid remained in place until his 1912 death . [ 102 ] Taft was a supporter of settling international disputes by arbitration , and he negotiated treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated . These were signed in August 1911 . Neither Taft nor Knox ( a former senator ) consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process . By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat . He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October , but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept , killing the agreements . [ 103 ] Although no general arbitration treaty was entered into , Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means , often involving arbitration . These included a settlement of the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick , a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan , and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland . The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940 . [ 104 ] Taft continued and expanded Roosevelt's efforts to break up business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act , bringing 70 cases in four years ( Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years ) . Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company , initiated under Roosevelt , were decided in favor of the government by the Supreme Court in 1911 . [ 105 ] In June 1911 , the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel ( U.S. Steel ) . That company had been expanded under Roosevelt , who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal , Iron , and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907 , a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings . Taft , as Secretary of War , had praised the acquisitions . [ 106 ] Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company , but it was in fact a bargain . For Roosevelt , questioning the matter went to his personal honesty . [ 107 ] In October 1911 , Taft's Justice Department brought suit against U.S. Steel , demanding that over a hundred of its subsidiaries be granted corporate independence , and naming as defendants many prominent business executives and financiers . The pleadings in the case had not been reviewed by Taft , and alleged that Roosevelt "" had fostered monopoly , and had been duped by clever industrialists "" . [ 106 ] Roosevelt was offended by the references to him and his administration in the pleadings , and felt that Taft could not evade command responsibility by saying he did not know of them . [ 108 ] Taft sent a special message to Congress on the need for a revamped antitrust statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911 , but it took no action . Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company , the large manufacturer of farm equipment , in early 1912 . As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester , but had taken no action ( a decision Taft had supported ) , the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination . Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly ; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years , and until he was under challenge , to reverse a decision he had supported . [ 109 ] Roosevelt was an ardent conservationist , assisted in this by like-minded appointees , including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield [ k ] and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot . Taft agreed with the need for conservation , but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order . He did not retain Garfield , an Ohioan , as secretary , choosing instead a westerner , former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger . Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement , believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield , and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies . [ 110 ] Roosevelt had withdrawn much land from the public domain , including some in Alaska thought rich in coal . In 1902 , Clarence Cunningham , an Idaho entrepreneur , had found coal deposits in Alaska , and made mining claims , and the government investigated their legality . This dragged on for the remainder of the Roosevelt administration , including during the year ( 1907 – 1908 ) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office . [ 111 ] A special agent for the Land Office , Louis Glavis , investigated the Cunningham claims , and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them , Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot . [ 112 ] In September 1909 , Glavis made his allegations public in a magazine article , disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service . This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for . [ 113 ] On September 13 , 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service , relying on a report from Attorney General George W. Wickersham dated two days previously . [ 114 ] Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal , which Taft tried to avoid , fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt ( still overseas ) . Taft asked Elihu Root ( by then a senator ) to look into the matter , and Root urged the firing of Pinchot . [ 113 ] Taft had ordered government officials not to comment on the fracas . [ 115 ] In January 1910 , Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service , Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands . According to Pringle , this "" was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office "" . [ 116 ] Pinchot was dismissed , much to his delight , and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt . [ 117 ] A congressional investigation followed , which cleared Ballinger by majority vote , but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney , Louis D. Brandeis , proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated , which Taft belatedly admitted . The Ballinger-Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda . [ 118 ] Taft announced in his inaugural address that he would not appoint African Americans to federal jobs , such as postmaster , where this would cause racial friction . This differed from Roosevelt , who would not remove or replace black officeholders with whom local whites would not deal . Termed Taft's "" Southern Policy "" , this stance effectively invited white protests against black appointees . Taft followed through , removing most black office holders in the South , and made few appointments from that race in the North . [ 119 ] At the time Taft was inaugurated , the way forward for African Americans was debated by their leaders . Booker T. Washington felt that most blacks should be trained for industrial work , with only a few seeking higher education ; W.E.B. DuBois took a more militant stand for equality . Taft tended towards Washington's approach . According to Coletta , Taft let the African-American "" be ' kept in his place ' ... He thus failed to see or follow the humanitarian mission historically associated with the Republican party , with the result that Negroes both North and South began to drift toward the Democratic party . "" [ 120 ] A supporter of free immigration , Taft vetoed a bill passed by Congress and supported by labor unions that would have restricted unskilled laborers by imposing a literacy test . [ 121 ] Taft made six appointments to the Supreme Court , the most of any president except George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt . [ 122 ] The death of Justice Rufus Peckham in October 1909 gave Taft his first opportunity . He chose an old friend and colleague from the Sixth Circuit , Horace H. Lurton of Georgia ; he had in vain urged Theodore Roosevelt to appoint Lurton to the high court . Attorney General Wickersham objected that Lurton , a former Confederate soldier and a Democrat , was aged 65 . Taft named Lurton anyway on December 13 , 1909 , and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote a week later . Lurton is still the oldest man to be made an associate justice . [ l ] Lurie suggested that Taft , already beset by the tariff and conservation controversies , desired to perform an official act which gave him pleasure , especially since he thought Lurton deserved it . [ 123 ] Justice David Josiah Brewer ' s death on March 28 , 1910 gave Taft a second opportunity to fill a seat on the high court ; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term , Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat . The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes , but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4 , 1910 . Taft took five months to replace Fuller , and when he did , it was with Justice Edward Douglass White , who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice . [ m ] According to Lurie , Taft , who still had hopes of being chief justice , may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he ( White ) than a younger one ( Hughes ) , who might outlive him , as indeed Hughes did . To fill White's seat as associate justice , Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming , a federal appeals judge . By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910 , he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody ' s retirement because of illness ; he named a Louisiana Democrat , Joseph R. Lamar , whom he had met while playing golf , and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge . [ 124 ] With the death of Justice Harlan in October 1911 , Taft got to fill a sixth seat on the Supreme Court . After Secretary Knox declined appointment , Taft named Chancellor of New Jersey Mahlon Pitney , the last person appointed to the Supreme Court who did not attend law school . [ 125 ] Pitney had a stronger anti-labor record than Taft's other appointments , and was the only one to meet opposition , winning confirmation by a Senate vote of 50 – 26 . [ 126 ] Taft appointed 13 judges to the federal courts of appeal and 38 to the United States district courts . Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts , including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals . [ 127 ] The Commerce Court , created in 1910 , stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission . There was considerable opposition to its establishment , which only grew when one of its judges , Robert W. Archbald , was in 1912 impeached for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January . Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court , but the respite was short-lived as Wilson signed similar legislation in October 1913 . [ 128 ] 1909 Puck magazine cover : Roosevelt departs , entrusting his policies to Taft During Roosevelt's fifteen months beyond the Atlantic , from March 1909 to June 1910 , neither man wrote much to the other . Taft biographer Lurie suggested that each expected the other to make the first move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing . Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return , Taft invited him to stay at the White House . The former president declined , and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance . Nevertheless , he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912 , and did not speak of himself as a candidate . [ 129 ] Taft and Roosevelt met twice in 1910 ; the meetings , though outwardly cordial , did not display their former closeness . [ 130 ] Roosevelt gave a series of speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910 . Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York , [ n ] he accused the federal courts of undermining democracy , and called for them to be deprived of the power to rule legislation unconstitutional . This attack horrified Taft , who privately agreed that Lochner had been wrongly decided . Roosevelt called for "" elimination of corporate expenditures for political purposes , physical valuation of railroad properties , regulation of industrial combinations , establishment of an export tariff commission , a graduated income tax "" as well as "" workmen's compensation laws , state and national legislation to regulate the [ labor ] of women and children , and complete publicity of campaign expenditure "" . [ 131 ] According to John Murphy in his journal article on the breach between the two presidents , "" As Roosevelt began to move to the left , Taft veered to the right . "" [ 131 ] During the 1910 midterm election campaign , Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics , while Taft with donations and influence tried to secure the election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio , former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding . The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate . In New Jersey , Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor , and Harding lost his race in Ohio . [ 130 ] After the election , Roosevelt continued to promote progressive ideals , a New Nationalism , much to Taft's dismay . Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration , arguing that its guiding principles were not that of the party of Lincoln , but those of the Gilded Age . [ 132 ] The feud continued on and off through 1911 , a year in which there were few elections of significance . Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican , and was backed by a convention of progressives . Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911 , writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms . [ 133 ] Roosevelt was receiving many letters from supporters urging him to run , and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf . Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House , he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition . [ 134 ] In February , Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him . Taft felt that if he lost in November , it would be a repudiation of the party , but if he lost renomination , it would be a rejection of himself . [ 135 ] He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt , who helped make him president , but having become president , he was determined to be president , and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term . [ 136 ] As Roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism , Taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re-nomination , as he was convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government . [ 137 ] One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt , one of the last links between the previous and present presidents , as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt . Ambivalent between his loyalties , Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912 . He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking , a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered . [ 138 ] Taft and Roosevelt – political enemies in 1912 Roosevelt dominated the primaries , winning 278 of the 362 delegates to the Republican National Convention in Chicago decided in that manner . Taft had control of the party machinery , and it came as no surprise that he gained the bulk of the delegates decided at district or state conventions . [ 139 ] Taft did not have a majority , but was likely to have one once southern delegations committed to him . Roosevelt challenged the election of these delegates , but the RNC overruled most objections . Roosevelt's sole remaining chance was with a friendly convention chairman , who might make rulings on the seating of delegates that favored his side . Taft followed custom and remained in Washington , but Roosevelt went to Chicago to run his campaign [ 140 ] and told his supporters in a speech , "" we stand at Armageddon , and we battle for the Lord "" . [ 141 ] Taft had won over Root , who agreed to run for temporary chairman of the convention , and the delegates elected Root over Roosevelt's candidate . [ 141 ] The Roosevelt forces moved to substitute the delegates they supported for the ones they argued should not be seated . Root made a crucial ruling , that although the contested delegates could not vote on their own seating , they could vote on the other contested delegates , a ruling that assured Taft's nomination , as the motion offered by the Roosevelt forces failed , 567 – 507 . [ 142 ] As it became clear Roosevelt would bolt the party if not nominated , some Republicans sought a compromise candidate to avert the electoral disaster to come ; they were unsuccessful . [ 143 ] Taft's name was placed in nomination by Warren Harding , whose attempts to praise Taft and unify the party were met with angry interruptions from progressives . [ 144 ] Taft was nominated on the first ballot , though most Roosevelt delegates refused to vote . [ 142 ] Campaign advertisement arguing Taft should be allowed a second term Alleging Taft had stolen the nomination , Roosevelt and his followers formed the Progressive Party . [ o ] [ 145 ] Taft knew he would almost certainly be defeated , but concluded that through Roosevelt's loss at Chicago the party had been preserved as "" the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions . "" [ 146 ] He made his doomed run to preserve the Republican Party . [ 147 ] Governor Woodrow Wilson was the Democratic nominee . Seeing Roosevelt as the greater electoral threat , Wilson spent little time attacking Taft , arguing that Roosevelt had been lukewarm in opposing the trusts during his presidency , and that Wilson was the true reformer . [ 148 ] Opposing Roosevelt , Taft contrasted what he called his "" progressive conservatism "" with Roosevelt's Progressive democracy , which to Taft represented "" the establishment of a benevolent despotism . "" http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/06/the-transformation-of-american-democracy-teddy-roosevelt-the-1912-election-and-the-progressive-party Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking re-election did not campaign , Taft spoke publicly only once , making his nomination acceptance speech on August 1 . He had difficulty in financing the campaign , as many industrialists had concluded he could not win , and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt . The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight , but had no illusions he would win his race . [ 149 ] He had hoped to send his cabinet officers out on the campaign trail , but found them reluctant to go . Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him . [ 150 ] Electoral vote by state , 1912 . States won by Taft are in red . Vice President Sherman had been renominated at Chicago ; seriously ill during the campaign , he died six days before the election , [ p ] and was replaced on the ticket by the president of Columbia University , Nicholas Murray Butler . But few electors chose Taft and Butler , who won only Utah and Vermont , for a total of eight electoral votes . [ q ] Roosevelt won 88 , and Wilson 435 . Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined . Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote , but finished with just under 3.5 million , over 600,000 less than the former president . [ 151 ] Taft was not on the ballot in California , due to the actions of local Progressives , nor in South Dakota . [ 152 ] With no pension or other compensation to expect from the government after leaving the White House , Taft contemplated a return to the practice of law , from which he had long been absent . Given that Taft had appointed many federal judges , including a majority of the Supreme Court , this would raise questions of conflict of interest at every federal court appearance and he was saved from this by an offer for him to become Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School . He accepted , and after a month's vacation in Georgia , arrived in New Haven on April 1 , 1913 to a rapturous reception . As it was too late in the semester for him to give an academic course , he instead prepared eight lectures on "" Questions of Modern Government "" , which he delivered in May . [ 153 ] He earned money with paid speeches and with articles for magazines , and would end his eight years out of office having increased his savings . [ 154 ] While at Yale , he wrote the treatise , Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers ( 1916 ) . [ 155 ] Taft had been made president of the Lincoln Memorial Commission while still in office ; when Democrats proposed removing him for one of their party , he quipped that unlike losing the presidency , such a removal would hurt . The architect , Henry Bacon , wanted to use Colorado-Yule marble , while southern Democrats urged using Georgia marble . Taft lobbied for the western stone , and the matter was submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts , which supported Taft and Bacon . The project went forward ; Taft would dedicate the Lincoln Memorial as chief justice in 1922 . [ 156 ] In 1913 , Taft was elected to a one-year term as president of the American Bar Association ( ABA ) , a trade group of lawyers . He removed opponents , such as Louis Brandeis and University of Pennsylvania Law School dean William Draper Lewis ( a supporter of the Progressive Party ) from committees . [ 157 ] Taft maintained a cordial relationship with Wilson . The former president privately criticized his successor on a number of issues , but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy . Taft was appalled when , after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916 , Wilson nominated Brandeis , whom the former president had never forgiven for his role in the Ballinger-Pinchot affair . When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis , Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents , stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court . Nevertheless , the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis . [ 158 ] Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered ; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency , at a funeral at Yale . They spoke only for a moment , politely but formally . [ 159 ] As president of the League to Enforce Peace , Taft hoped to prevent war through an international association of nations . With World War I raging in Europe , Taft sent Wilson a note of support for his foreign policy in 1915 . [ 160 ] President Wilson accepted Taft's invitation to address the league , and spoke in May 1916 of a postwar international organization that could prevent a repetition . [ 161 ] Taft supported the effort to get Justice Hughes to resign from the bench and accept the Republican presidential nomination . Once this was done , Hughes tried to get Roosevelt and Taft to reconcile , as a united effort was needed to defeat Wilson . This occurred on October 3 in New York , but Roosevelt allowed only a handshake , and no words were exchanged . This was one of many difficulties for the Republicans in the campaign , and Wilson narrowly won re-election . [ 162 ] When Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917 , Taft was an enthusiastic supporter . Taft was chairman of the American Red Cross ' executive committee , occupying much of the former president's time . [ 163 ] He took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the National War Labor Board , tasked with assuring industrial peace . [ 164 ] In February 1918 , the new RNC chairman , Will H. Hays , approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt . In May , Taft was in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel , and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there , walked in on them . The two men embraced to the applause of the room , but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919 . [ 165 ] Taft later wrote , "" Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me , I would have mourned the fact all my life . I loved him always and cherish his memory . "" [ 166 ] When Wilson proposed establishment of a League of Nations , with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles , Taft expressed public support . He was out of step with his party , whose senators were not inclined to confirm the treaty . Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides , destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration , and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party . The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact . [ 167 ] During the 1920 election campaign , Taft supported the Republican ticket , Harding ( by then a senator ) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge ; they were elected . [ 168 ] Taft was among those asked to come to the president-elect's home in Marion , Ohio to advise him on appointments , and the two men conferred there on December 24 , 1920 . By Taft's later account , after some conversation , Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court , for if Taft would , Harding would put him there . Taft had a condition for Harding : that having been president , and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis , he could only accept the chief justiceship . Harding made no response , and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House . In January 1921 , Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him , if given the chance . [ 169 ] White by then was in failing health , but made no move to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4 , 1921 . [ 170 ] Taft called on the chief justice on March 26 , and found White ill , but still carrying on his work and not talking of retiring . [ 171 ] White did not retire , dying in office on May 19 , 1921 . Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat , and waited and worried if he would be White's successor . Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick , Harding made no quick announcement . [ 172 ] Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes , especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle . [ 173 ] It later emerged that Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland a seat on the Supreme Court , and was waiting in the expectation that another place would become vacant . [ r ] [ 174 ] Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring . Taft felt , when he learned of this plan , that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well , and that once confirmed by the Senate , the memory of Day would grow dim . After Harding rejected Day's plan , Attorney General Harry Daugherty , who supported Taft's candidacy , urged him to fill the vacancy , and he named Taft on June 30 , 1921 . [ 172 ] The Senate confirmed Taft the same day , 61 – 4 , without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session . Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat . [ s ] [ 175 ] When he was sworn in on July 11 , he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice . [ 1 ] The Supreme Court , under Taft , posted a conservative record in Commerce Clause jurisprudence . This had the practical effect of making it difficult for the federal government to regulate industry , and the Taft Court also scuttled many state laws . The few liberals on the court – Brandeis , Holmes , and ( from 1925 ) Harlan Fiske Stone – sometimes protested , believing orderly progress essential , but often joined in the majority opinion . [ 176 ] The White Court had , in 1918 , struck down an attempt by Congress to regulate child labor in Hammer v. Dagenhart . [ t ] [ 177 ] Congress thereafter attempted to end child labor by imposing a tax on certain corporations making use of it . That law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1922 in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. , with Taft writing the court's opinion for an 8 – 1 majority . [ u ] He held that the tax was not intended to raise revenue , but rather was an attempt to regulate matters reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment , [ 178 ] and that allowing such taxation would eliminate the power of the states . [ 1 ] One case in which Taft and his court upheld federal regulation was Stafford v. Wallace . Taft ruled for a 7 – 1 majority [ v ] that the processing of animals in stockyards was so closely tied to interstate commerce as to bring it within the ambit of Congress's power to regulate . [ 179 ] A case in which the Taft Court struck down regulation that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital . [ w ] Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia . A 5 – 3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down . Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment , guaranteeing women the vote , meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions ; Taft , in dissent , deemed this unrealistic . [ 180 ] Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents , and because it was one of the few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government . [ 181 ] Taft in 1922 ruled for a unanimous court in Balzac v. Porto Rico . [ x ] One of the Insular Cases , Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a jury trial , a Sixth Amendment protection under the constitution . Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood , only such constitutional protections as Congress decreed would apply to its residents . [ 182 ] The U.S. Supreme Court in 1925 . Taft is seated in the bottom row , middle . In 1926 , Taft wrote for a 6 – 3 majority in Myers v. United States [ y ] that Congress could not require the president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee . Taft noted that there is no restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution . Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster , [ 183 ] Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act , for violation of which his presidential predecessor , Andrew Johnson , had been impeached , though acquitted by the Senate . [ 184 ] Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion . [ 185 ] The following year , the court decided McGrain v. Daugherty . [ z ] A congressional committee investigating possible complicity of former Attorney General Daugherty in the Teapot Dome scandal subpoenaed records from his brother , Mally , who refused to provide them , alleging Congress had no power to obtain documents from him . Van Devanter ruled for a unanimous court against him , finding that Congress had the authority to conduct investigations as an auxiliary to its legislative function . [ 186 ] In 1925 , the Taft Court laid the groundwork for the incorporation of many of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment . In Gitlow v. New York , [ aa ] the court by a 6 – 2 vote with Taft in the majority , upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government ; his defense was freedom of speech . Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion , and both majority and minority ( Holmes , joined by Brandeis ) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states . [ 187 ] Pierce v. Society of Sisters [ ab ] was a 1925 decision by the Taft Court striking down an Oregon law banning private schools . In a decision written by Justice James C. McReynolds , a unanimous court held that Oregon could regulate private schools , but could not eliminate them . The outcome supported the right of parents to control the education of their children , but also , since the lead plaintiff ( the society ) ran Catholic schools , struck a blow for religious freedom . [ 187 ] United States v. Lanza [ ac ] was one of a series of cases involving Prohibition . Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law , and was first convicted in Washington state court , then prosecuted in federal district court . He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment . Taft , for a unanimous court , allowed the second prosecution , holding that the state and federal governments were dual sovereigns , each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question . [ 188 ] Taft exercised the power of his position to influence the decisions of his colleagues , urging unanimity and discouraging dissents . Alpheus Mason , in his article on Chief Justice Taft for the American Bar Association Journal , contrasted Taft's expansive view of the role of the chief justice with the narrow view of presidential power he took while in that office . [ 189 ] Taft saw nothing wrong with making his views on possible appointments to the court known to the White House , and was annoyed to be criticized in the press . He was initially a firm supporter of President Coolidge after Harding's death in 1923 , but became disillusioned with Coolidge's appointments to office and to the bench ; he had similar misgivings about Coolidge's successor , Herbert Hoover . [ 190 ] Taft advised the Republican presidents in office while he was chief justice to avoid "" offside "" appointments like Brandeis and Holmes . [ 176 ] Nevertheless , by 1923 , Taft was writing of his liking for Brandeis , whom he deemed a hard worker , and Holmes walked to work with him until age and infirmity required an automobile . [ 191 ] Believing that the chief justice should be responsible for the federal courts , Taft felt that he should have an administrative staff to assist him , and the chief justice should be empowered to temporarily reassign judges . [ 192 ] He also believed the federal courts had been ill-run . Many of the lower courts had lengthy backlogs , as did the Supreme Court . [ 193 ] Immediately on taking office , Taft made it a priority to confer with Attorney General Daugherty as to new legislation , [ 194 ] and made his case before congressional hearings , in legal periodicals and in speeches across the country . [ 195 ] When Congress convened in December 1921 , a bill was introduced for 24 new judges , to empower the chief justice to move judges temporarily to eliminate the delays , and to have him chair a body consisting of the senior appellate judge of each circuit . Congress objected to some aspects , requiring Taft to get the agreement of the senior judge of each involved circuit before assigning a judge , but it in September 1922 passed the bill , and the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges held its first meeting that December . [ 196 ] The Supreme Court's docket was congested , swelled by war litigation and laws that allowed a party defeated in the circuit court of appeals to have the case decided by the Supreme Court if a constitutional question was involved . Taft believed an appeal should be usually be settled by the circuit court , with only cases of major import decided by the justices . He and other Supreme Court members proposed legislation to make most of the court's docket discretionary , with a case getting full consideration by the justices only if they granted a writ of certiorari . To Taft's frustration , Congress took three years to consider the matter . Taft and other members of the court lobbied for the bill in Congress , and the Judges' Bill became law in February 1925 . By late the following year , Taft was able to show that the backlog was shrinking . [ 197 ] When Taft became chief justice , the court did not have its own building and met in the Capitol . Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded , but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building . In 1925 , Taft began a fight to get the court a building , and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land , on the south side of the Capitol . Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building , and was hired by the government as architect . Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building , but it did not do so until 1935 , after Taft's death . [ 198 ] Taft is remembered as the heaviest president ; he was 5 feet 11 inches ( 1 . 80 m ) tall and his weight peaked at 335 – 340 pounds ( 152 – 154 kg ) toward the end of his presidency , [ 199 ] though this later decreased , and he weighed by 1929 just 244 pounds ( 111 kg ) . By the time Taft became chief justice , his health was starting to decline , and he carefully planned a fitness regimen , walking 3 miles ( 4 . 8 km ) from his home to the Capitol each day . When he walked after work as well , he would usually go by way of Connecticut Avenue ; the crossing over Rock Creek he would often take was after his death named the Taft Bridge . [ 200 ] At Hoover's inauguration on March 4 , 1929 , Taft recited part of the oath incorrectly , later writing , "" my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain "" , misquoting again in that letter , differently . [ 201 ] His health gradually declined over the near-decade of his chief justiceship , and he wrote in 1929 , "" I am older and slower and less acute and more confused . However , as long as things continue as they are , and I am able to answer to my place , I must stay on the court in order to prevent the Bolsheviki from getting control "" . [ 202 ] Taft insisted on going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles , who died on December 31 , 1929 ; the strain did not improve his own health . When the court reconvened on January 6 , 1930 , Taft had not returned to Washington , and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but had been unable to complete because of his illness . Taft went to Asheville , North Carolina for a rest , but by the end of January , he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations . [ 203 ] Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice ; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice . [ ad ] [ 204 ] Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3 , Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices . He died at his home in Washington on March 8 , 1930 . [ 203 ] Lurie argued that Taft did not receive the public credit for his policies that he should have . Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt ( although the lawsuits received much publicity ) . Taft , more quietly than his predecessor , filed many more cases than did Roosevelt , and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such a thing as a "" good "" trust . This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency ; according to Lurie , Taft "" was boring – honest , likable , but boring "" . [ 207 ] Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being "" one of the most interesting , intellectual , and versatile presidents ... a chief justice of the United States , a wrestler at Yale , a reformer , a peace activist , and a baseball fan ... today , Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub , "" a story that is not true . [ 147 ] Mason called Taft's years in the White House "" undistinguished "" . [ 192 ] Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress , but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill . [ 208 ] Anderson noted that Taft's prepresidential federal service was entirely in appointed posts , and that he had never run for an important executive or legislative position , which would have allowed him to develop the skills to manipulate public opinion , "" the presidency is no place for on-the-job training "" . [ 155 ] According to Coletta , "" in troubled times in which the people demanded progressive change , he saw the existing order as good . "" [ 209 ] Inevitably linked with Roosevelt , Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider , who chose him to be president , and who took it away . [ 210 ] Yet , a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete : as Coletta put it , "" Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him ? "" [ 211 ] Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not , Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation . Taft was generally slow to act , and when he did , his actions often generated enemies , as in the Ballinger-Pinchot affair . Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers ; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters , and , with no comment from the White House , hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent . [ 212 ] And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan - like figure , with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good . Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography ( which placed this view in enduring form ) was published after both men had left the presidency ( in 1913 ) , was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party , and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor . While Roosevelt was biased , [ 213 ] he was not alone : every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him . [ 214 ] Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency . [ 213 ] Four-cent stamp issued for Taft ( 1930 ) Taft was convinced he would be vindicated by history . After he left office , he was estimated to be about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness , and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict . Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company , with James Madison , John Quincy Adams and McKinley . [ 215 ] Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft , and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker . [ 216 ] According to Gould , "" the clichés about Taft's weight , his maladroitness in the White House , and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth , but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene , a man of consummate ambition , and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party . "" [ 217 ] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice "" an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics , played out over years , the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history "" . [ 173 ] Taft has been rated among the greatest of the chief justices ; [ 218 ] later Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted that this was "" not so much on the basis of his opinions , perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history "" . [ 219 ] A successor as chief justice , Earl Warren , concurred : "" In Taft's case , the symbol , the tag , the label usually attached to him is ' conservative . ' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics , but its use is too often confused with ' reactionary . ' "" [ 166 ] Most commentators agree that as chief justice , Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court , urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities . [ 166 ] [ 177 ] [ 220 ] Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court . [ 177 ] According to Anderson , Taft as chief justice "" was as aggressive in the pursuit of his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential "" . [ 221 ] The house in Cincinnati where Taft was born and lived as a boy is now the William Howard Taft National Historic Site . [ 222 ] Taft's son Robert was a significant political figure , becoming Senate Majority Leader and three times a major contender for the Republican nomination for president . A conservative , each time he was defeated by a candidate backed by the more liberal Eastern Establishment wing of the party . [ ae ] [ 223 ] Lurie concluded his account of William Taft's career , While the fabled cherry trees in Washington represent a suitable monument for Nellie Taft , there is no memorial to her husband , except perhaps the magnificent home for his Court – one for which he eagerly planned . But he died even before ground was broken for the structure . As he reacted to his overwhelming defeat for reelection in 1912 , Taft had written that "" I must wait for years if I would be vindicated by the people ... I am content to wait . "" Perhaps he has waited long enough . [ 224 ] ^ There were two sons from Alphonso's first marriage and three , including William , by the second . ^ Alphonso Taft died in 1891 in California , retired because of illness contracted during his diplomatic postings . See Pringle vol 1 , p. 119 . ^ Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway Co. v. Voight , 176 U.S. 498 ( 1900 ) . Only Justice Harlan dissented from the opinion for the Court written by Justice George Shiras . See Lurie , pp. 33 – 34 . ^ His son , Douglas MacArthur , would also become a general and famously fight in the Philippines . ^ Fuller's longevity was a source of frustration and some humor in the Roosevelt White House . Secretary Root originated a running joke that Fuller would be found alive and clinging to his seat on the Day of Judgment , and would then have to be shot . See Anderson 2000 , p. 328 . ^ In one of which Secretary Knox was said to be a major stockholder . See Coletta 1973 , p. 188 . ^ Hughes was 67 when he began his second period on the court , as chief justice succeeding Taft . ^ The "" Bull Moose Party "" , named by Roosevelt's comment he felt as strong as a young bull moose ^ Sherman was the last American vice president to die in office . ^ Taft's eight electoral votes set a record for futility by a Republican candidate matched by Alf Landon in 1936 . ^ Sutherland was appointed to the high court in 1922 . ^ 259 U.S. 20 ( 1922 ) .

1224	"Southern claims 96 % of conductors ' signed up ' for new role Southern wants drivers , rather than conductors , to operate carriage doors at certain times Nearly all conductors have signed up for a controversial new on-board supervisor role on Southern trains from January , the rail company has said . The conductors had until last Friday to respond to Southern's deadline , and 215 - 96 % of those required - have done so . The change to the role has caused a bitter dispute with the unions and has led to a series of walkouts . Mick Cash , RMT general secretary , said nothing had changed , members remained "" rock solid "" and the "" fight goes on "" . The latest 48-hour strike ended at midnight on Saturday and further stoppages are planned . Angie Doll , Southern's passenger services director , said : "" We 've now got over 200 conductors signed up ... disproving the union's claims that support is rock solid . "" RMT general secretary Mick cash responded : "" Nothing has changed in terms of the core issues at the heart of this dispute . It 's about basic rail safety and access to transport services for all members of our community . "" That ground has not shifted an inch thanks to the sheer pig-headed attitude of Southern Rail and their government pay masters . "" Our members remain rock solid ... and will not be bribed , bullied or beaten . That fight goes on . "" ' Spiteful act ' The new on-board supervisor roles will focus on "" customer service "" and move the operation of closing doors to the driver . A further 222 people will remain in their existing roles as conductors on certain services , Southern said . It is also planning to recruit a further 100 on-board supervisors to work across Southern and Gatwick Express services . Southern said the union leadership had "" stooped to a new low "" by calling a strike over Christmas , calling it a "" selfish , shameful and spiteful act "" . GTR , Southern's parent company , said its offer to the RMT to settle the dispute had now been formally withdrawn . Meanwhile , Aslef , the UK's biggest rail union , has suspended a strike ballot among its Southern members , because of "" technical difficulties "" . The RMT union is also balloting its driver members for strikes , with voting closing on 18 November ."	8
919	"Three Boys ; or the Chiefs of the Clan Mackhai George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Contents | Chapter I. The Mackhai of Dun Roe . "" Look here , Scoodrach , if you call me she again , I 'll kick you ! "" "" I didna ca ' you she . I only said if she 'd come ten the hoose aifter she had the parritch -- "" "" Well , what did I say ? "" "" Say ? Why , she got in a passion . "" Whop ! Flop ! The sound of a back-handed slap in the chest , followed by a kick , both delivered by Kenneth Mackhai , the recipient being a red-headed , freckled-faced lad of seventeen , who retaliated by making a sharp snatch at the kicking foot , which he caught and held one half moment . The result was startling . Kenneth Mackhai , the sun-browned , well-knit , handsome son of "" the Chief , "" came down in a sitting position on the stones , and screwed up his face with pain . "" Scood , you beggar ! "" he roared ; "" I 'll serve you out for -- "" "" Ken , are you coming to breakfast ? "" cried a loud , severe voice from fifty yards away . "" Coming , father ! "" shouted the lad , leaping up , giving himself a shake to rearrange his dark green kilt , and holding up his fist threateningly at the bare-legged , grinning lad before him . "" Just you wait till after breakfast , Master Scood , and I 'll make you squint . "" The lad ran up the steep slope to the garden surrounding the ancient castle of Dunroe , which had been built as a stronghold somewhere about the fourteenth century , and still stood solid on its rocky foundation ; a square , keep-like edifice , with a round tower at each corner , mouldering , with portions of the battlements broken away , but a fine monument still of the way in which builders worked in the olden time . The portion Kenneth Mackhai approached had for inhabitants only the jackdaws , which encumbered the broken stairs by the loopholes with their nests ; but , after passing beneath a gloomy archway and crossing the open interior , he left the old keep by another archway , to enter the precincts of the modern castle of Dunroe , a commodious building , erected after the style of the old , and possessing the advantages of a roof and floors , with large windows looking across the dazzling sea . Kenneth entered a handsome dining-room , where the breakfast was spread , and where his father , The Mackhai , a tall , handsome man of fifty , was pacing angrily up and down . "" Sorry I kept you , father . Scood said there was a seal on the lower rocks , and -- "" "" The scoundrel ! How dare he ? "" muttered The Mackhai . "" To take such a mean advantage of his position . I will not suffer it . I 'll -- "" "" I 'm very sorry , father ! "" faltered Kenneth , crossing slowly toward his frowning elder . "" I did not mean to -- "" "" Eh ! what , Ken , my boy ? "" cried The Mackhai , with his countenance changing . "" I 've only just come in . Sit down , my lad . You must be half-starved , eh ? "" "" I thought you were cross with me , sir . "" "" Cross ? Angry ? Not a bit . Why ? "" "" You said -- "" "" Tchah ! nonsense ! Thinking aloud . What did you say ? -- a seal ? "" "" Yes , father . Scood said there was one , but it had gone . "" "" Then you did n't shoot it ? Well , I 'm not sorry . They 're getting scarce now , and I like to see the old things about the old place . Hah ! "" he continued , after a pause that had been well employed by both at the amply-supplied , handsomely-furnished table ; "" and I like the old porridge for breakfast . Give me some of that salmon , Ken. No ; I 'll have a kipper . "" "" More coffee , please , father , "" said Ken , with his mouth full . "" Have a scone , father ? They 're prime . "" "" Gently with the butter , my boy . There is such a thing as bile . "" "" Is there , father ? "" said Kenneth , who was spreading the rich yellow churning a full quarter of an inch thick . "" Is there , sir ! Yes , there is . As I know to my cost . Ah ! "" he added , with a sigh , and his face wrinkled and made him look ten years older ; "" but there was a time when I did not know the meaning of the word ! "" "" Oh , I say , father , "" cried Kenneth merrily , "" do n't ! You 're always pretending to be old , and yet you can walk me down stalking , and Long Shon says you can make him sore-footed any day . "" "" Nonsense ! nonsense ! "" said The Mackhai , smiling . "" Oh , but you can , father ! "" said Kenneth , with his mouth full . "" And see how you ran with that salmon yesterday , all among the stones . "" "" Ah , yes ! I manage to hold my own ; but I hope you 'll husband your strength better than I did , my boy , "" said The Mackhai , with a sigh . "" I only hope I shall grow into such a fine man ! "" cried Kenneth , with his face lighting up , as he gazed proudly at his father . "" Why , Donald says -- "" "" Tut , tut , tut ! Silence , you miserable young flatterer ! Do you want to make your father conceited ? There , that will do . "" "" Coming fishing to-day , father ? "" There was no answer . The Mackhai had taken up a letter brought in that morning by one of the gillies , and was frowning over it as he re-read its contents , and then sat thoughtfully gazing out of the window across the glittering sea , at the blue mountains in the distance , tapping the table with his fingers the while . "" Wonder what 's the matter ! "" thought Kenneth . "" Some one wants some money , I suppose . "" The boy's face puckered up a little as he ceased eating , and watched his father's face , the furrows in the boy's brow giving him a wonderful likeness to the keen-eyed , high-browed representative of a fine old Scottish clan . "" Wish I had plenty of money , "" thought Kenneth ; and he sighed as he saw his father's face darken . Not that there was the faintest sign of poverty around , for the room was tastily furnished in good old style ; the carpet was thick , a silver coffee-pot glistened upon the table , and around the walls were goodly paintings of ancestral Mackhais , from the bare-armed , scale-armoured chief who fought the Macdougals of Lome , down to Ronald Mackhai , who represented Ross-shire when King William sat upon the throne . "" I ca n't help myself , "" muttered The Mackhai at last . "" Here , Ken , what were you going to do to-day ? "" "" I was going up the river after a salmon . "" "" Not to-day , my boy . Here , I 've news for you . Mr. Blande , my London solicitor , writes me word that his son is coming down--a boy about your age . "" "" Son--coming down ? Did you invite him , father ? "" "" Eh ? No : never mind that , "" said The Mackhai hastily . "" Coming down to stay with us a bit . Regular London boy . Not in very good health . You must be civil to him , Ken , and show him about a bit . "" "" Yes , father , "" said Kenneth , who felt from his father's manner that the coming guest was not welcome . "" He is coming by Glasgow , and then by the Grenadier . His father thinks the sea will do him good . Go and meet him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Tell them to get a room ready for him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Be as civil to him as you can , and--Pah ! "" That ejaculation , pah ! came like an angry outburst , as The Mackhai gave the table a sharp blow , and rose and strode out of the room . Kenneth sat watching the door for a few moments . "" Father's savage because he 's coming , "" said Kenneth , whose eyes then fell upon a glass dish of marmalade , and , cutting a goodly slice of bread , he spread it with the yellow butter , and then spooned out a portion of the amber-hued preserve . "" Bother the chap ! we do n't want him here . "" Pe-au , pe-au , came a wailing whistle through the open window . "" Ah , I hear you , old whaupie , but I can do it better than that , "" said Kenneth to himself , as he repeated the whistle , in perfect imitation of the curlews which abounded near . The whistle was answered , and , with a good-tempered smile on his face , Kenneth rose from the table , after cutting another slice of bread , and laying it upon that in his plate , so as to form a sticky sandwich . "" Scood ! "" he cried from the window , and barelegged Scoodrach , who was seated upon a rock right below , with the waves splashing his feet , looked up and showed his white teeth . "" Catch ! "" "" All right . "" Down went the bread and marmalade , which the lad caught in his blue worsted bonnet , and was about to replace the same upon his curly red head , but the glutinous marmalade came off on one finger . This sticky finger he sucked as he stared at the bread , and , evidently coming to the conclusion that preserve and pomade were not synonymous terms , he began rapidly to put the sweet sandwich somewhere else . "" I wish you had kept it in your bonnet , Scood . "" The boy looked up and laughed , his mouth busy the while . "" Father saw sax saumon in the black pool , "" he cried eagerly . "" Then they 'll have to stop , "" said Kenneth gloomily . "" Eh ? "" "" There 's a chap coming down from London . "" "" To fesh ? "" "" Suppose so . We 've got to go and meet him . "" "" With ta pony ? "" "" No , the boat ; coming by the Grenadier . "" "" Ou ay . "" "" It 's a great bother , Scood . "" "" But it 's a verra fine mornin ' for a sail , "" said the boy , looking up and munching away . "" But I did n't want to sail ; I wanted to fish . "" "" The fush can wait , tat she can . "" "" Oh , you ! "" shouted Kenneth . "" Wish I had something to throw at you . "" "" If she did , I 'd throw it back , "" said Scoodrach , grinning . "" I should like to catch you at it . There , go and get the boat . "" "" Plenty of time . "" "" Never mind that ; let 's be off and have a good sail first , as we have to go . "" "" Will she--will you tak ' the gun ? "" "" Of course I shall . Take the lines too , Scood ; we may get a mackerel . "" The lad opened his large mouth , tucked in the last piece of marmalade , and then leaped off the stone on to the rock . "" Scood ! "" The boy stroked down his grey kilt , and looked up . "" Put on your shoes and stockings . "" "" What for ? "" "" Because I tell you . Because there 's company coming . Be off ! "" "" She 's got a big hole in her stocking , and ta shoe hurts her heel . "" "" Be off and put them on , "" roared Kenneth from the window . "" I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . "" Scood nodded , and began to climb rapidly over the buttress of rock which ran down into the sea , the height to which the tide rose being marked by an encrustation of myriads of acorn barnacles , among which every now and then a limpet stood out like a boss , while below , in the clear water , a thick growth of weed turned the rock to a golden brown , and changed the tint of the transparent water . | Next chapter | | Contents | Created from a nineteenth or early twentieth century text by Athelstane E-Texts"	6

29	"Ezra 1 Cyrus Helps the Exiles to Return 1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah , the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing : 2 "" This is what Cyrus king of Persia says : "" ' The LORD , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah . 3 Anyone of his people among you – may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD , the God of Israel , the God who is in Jerusalem . 4 And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem . ' "" 5 Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests and Levites – everyone whose heart God had moved – prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem . 6 All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with valuable gifts , in addition to all the freewill offerings . 7 Moreover , King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD , which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god .

1292	"Back in 1992 the Boeing scientists Tom Caudell and David Mizell coined the phrase Augmented Reality to describe how aircraft assemblers in Seattle were given head-mounted displays that showed them photographic images of their work enriched with layers of technical information . Now Inge de Waard , e-learning coordinator and researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp , Belgium , reported to the ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN conference in December on how her team trialled Augmented Reality in tropical medicine . De Waard , a pioneer of e-learning projects in South Asia , Africa and Latin America , forecasts that "" AR will reach us , and change all of us , within five years "" . The Antwerp e-learning team started a pilot AR project early in 2010 , looking for a tool that would help learners to visualise complex information , often difficult to explain in words or simple pictures . "" We wanted to be able to visualise the progression of certain tropical diseases , and give extra information on each crucial point in the progression , "" Ms de Waard explains . "" We knew we would not immediately be able to achieve what we had in mind , but we could start projects to get there . "" The team has been pilot testing two AR techniques , a simple one based on Hoppala and Layar and a more complicated one using a combination of Google SketchUp , the AR plugin from ARmedia and the ARToolKit . One of the first results is a guide to the city and university campus at Antwerp : If the user directs the camera of a mobile device at a building of the Institute of Tropical Medicine , he can add an extra layer of information , such as the details of the staff members who work in the particular building or a historic archive photograph of the building . The display shows both the real object and the virtual content . "" Technically speaking , this is a very straight forward AR application . You use ready-made software ( Hoppala and Layar ) , a php script language and a mysql data server to add the relevant content to specific geo-locations , "" Inge de Waard says . Their more advanced application involves creating 3D imaging and layering of content . They have tested small 3D objects using the AR plug-in from ARmedia , cinema4D and the ARToolKit and their first results will be shown at ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN 2010 . The complete medical application may be ready for use against tropical diseases by September 2011 . A potential future application could help to improve epidemiological research . "" A researcher out in the field , studying a parasite that might be transmitting a tropical disease , can be equipped with a mobile device that will deliver augmented content on the different stages of the parasite . We can enhance a map of the up-to-date geographical distribution of the parasite with information on local weather conditions , altitude , presence of nearby streams or any other factors that might influence the spread of the disease . With this contextualised content a researcher will be able to project the progression of an epidemic more accurately and respond to it much more quickly . "" "" The benefit of AR is that the student or researcher now has access to content that is really relevant , it will be contextualised and linked to that specific location . "" Integrating a global positioning system with mobile telephone technology and augmented reality has been revolutionary . With GPS , image recognition and an accelerometer , AR can pinpoint where a mobile camera is focused and then overlay relevant information at appropriate points on the screen . "" Dissecting "" Body Parts – Virtual Medical Procedures In The Field Inge de Waard expects AR to be used by doctors in remote areas of the world , allowing them to use the 3D anatomical models that enable surgeons to study body parts from all angles on a screen before conducting a medical procedure . The new mobile AR technology will allow them to use anatomical simulations previously restricted to clinics and operating theatres . "" Let's say we have a patient with Buruli ulcer . On our mobile device , we will not only see the real ulcer as it is ; the added virtual content will take us on a simulation , deeper into the ulcer layer by layer , allowing a successful surgical excision to be planned "" . Additionally , the learner can move on to the advanced stage of the ulcer and see how it will develop if not treated , or how extensive skin grafting should be performed . "" These applications will deepen our understanding of medical conditions and diagnosis . It will give the learner a holistic medical understanding as well as details on anatomical and scientific coherences . "" Huge Potential – Not only for Education A big challenge for AR in tropical medicine has been the poor connectivity and infrastructure of many tropical regions . But the team in Antwerp hopes to bring new technology to low resources regions with easy-to-use AR smartphone applications like Layar , Wikitude or Hoppala . All in all , Inge de Waard is convinced that AR has a huge potential – not only for education . "" It is one thing to see pictures or a 3D animation on the screen . But being able to put our hand inside the virtual image , and move it around any way you want , will increase our knowledge of the real world . At OEB 2010 , Inge de Waard will present Augmented Learning ? Taking the First Steps for Education as part of the session Xtreme Learning which will take place on Thursday , December 2 , from 14 : 30 – 16 : 00 .

1519	"Tips Today is National Boss's Day ; a secular holiday celebrated around the world on Oct. 16 each year . It reportedly began in 1958 when a woman named Patricia Bays Haroski registered the holiday with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because she wanted to designate a day for employees to show appreciation for their managers . Haroski chose Oct. 16 because it was her father's birthday , and she working for him at the time as a secretary for the State Farm Insurance Company in Illinois . In 1962 , four years after registering the holiday , the Illinois Governor officially proclaimed the day , which is now observed in the U.S. and countries such as Canada , Australia and India . Millions of appreciative workers will take full advantage of the day ; thanking their boss ' for their support , encouragement and guidance throughout the year . Others , however , have little to celebrate today . These are typically employees who have terrible relationships with their managers . If you fall into that second group of workers , National Boss's Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on your employee-employer relationship , and think about ways to improve it . "" It 's very important to have a strong , or otherwise healthy relationship with your boss for a variety of reasons , "" says Teri Hockett , chief executive of What 's For Work ? , a career site for women . "" First , your boss has a tremendous amount of influence over workplace stress , whether real or perceived . They can make the workplace exciting and something to look forward to each day , or a place that you dread visiting . In short , your health is at stake , "" she says . "" Second , they typically hold the key to your advancement within the company , or sometimes outside as well . Without a good relationship , they may not speak highly of you or consider nominating you to other positions , departments or companies , regardless of your performance . And third , having a good relationship with your boss just makes sense . Work consumes most of your time usually , and having good relationships will make things more enjoyable and lead to opportunities . "" Joyce Maroney , senior director of customer experience and services marketing for Kronos , a Mass. - based workforce management software and services company , says the boss-employee relationship is much like others we need to manage in our lives . "" We get out of them what we put into them – as long as both parties are committed to the relationship , "" she says . "" If both parties are n't clear in communicating their expectations and giving feedback when expectations are n't met , little issues can snowball to the point the relationship is no longer viable . "" Maroney says a recent Kronos survey revealed that 69 % of employees believe their managers set a good example in the way they behave and 92 % of those employees also believe their managers adhere to those values on a regular basis . "" But setting a good example for behavior does n't always translate into a strong relationship . Employees might not get the direct and constructive performance feedback they need to elevate their career – or the boss is n't all that invested so he or she does n't push the team to consistently achieve and grow . "" Sandy Mazur , a division president at Spherion , a recruiting and staffing firm , agrees . "" In order to grow , learn and advance in their careers , employees need to be on the same page with their supervisors about their goals , objectives and career path , "" she says . "" And employees should start this dialogue so that they can open the lines of communication with their supervisor and engage them in this process . "" According to a recent Spherion "" Emerging Workforce "" study , most workers rate their relationship with their supervisor as good , great or excellent ( 84 % ) . "" However , for the small amount of people that rate their relationship as weak , it could be related to trust . Strong relationships are based on trust from both parties , and it takes an open line of communication from both the employee and the supervisor to make that happen . "" Other reasons some employees have such weak relationships with their boss ? Andy Teach , a corporate veteran and author of From Graduation to Corporation , says sometimes it 's simply due to the "" very nature of the boss-employee dynamic . "" "" If an employee has someone over them who is constantly telling them what to do and in many instances , how to do it , this can easily cause friction and resentment , "" he says . "" An employee is always being held accountable by their supervisor and this just adds stress to the employee 's already stressful work day . In addition , there are many employees who are jealous of their boss and perhaps feel that they , not the boss , should be the one in charge . Again , this causes resentment toward the one person at work who has the most control over your career . "" But Teach says it 's absolutely imperative to have a great work relationship with your boss "" because they control your destiny . "" "" You do n't have to love your boss but you need to be able to work well with them . One of the main reasons employees leave their job is because of their boss . A troubled relationship with your boss can negatively affect your morale , your productivity , your happiness , and of course , your career . A positive relationship can improve your morale , productivity and happiness which could lead to more career success in the form of promotions , raises and higher self-esteem . "" Maroney says a "" strong relationship "" may mean different things to different people , but what she has seen again and again is that "" it 's important to manage your relationship with your boss if you expect to prosper in a job . "" Here 's how to strengthen your relationship with your boss : Put yourself in your boss's shoes . Figure out the challenges your boss will encounter that day and be prepared to offer solutions , Mazur suggests . "" Anticipate the questions that your supervisor may ask about your work or a project and have thoughtful answers or next steps for them to take . Thinking ahead can really show that you 're an invaluable team member . "" Teach says it 's easy to be resentful of your boss , especially if they treat you a certain way , "" but they have a job to do , just like you , "" he explains . "" There 's a lot about their job that you do n't know about or see , so do n't assume that they 're out to get you , "" he adds . "" Sometimes they act a certain way for a reason – perhaps their boss is putting a lot of pressure on them – so try to be understanding . "" Show value . "" They hired you for a reason , so make sure that you 're adding value to the organization and / or position , "" Hockett says . "" Bosses want employees not only to agree with them , but also be willing to speak up about the realities and challenges in the business that need to be addressed . Be the person that speaks with facts , confidence and reasonable suggestions that produce results . This builds your boss's confidence in you . "" How did you choose your profession ? Did you pick a job that you thought would be easy ? Or lucrative ? Or glamorous ? Or , did you pursue a career related to your interests and hobbies ? Chances are , you did n't base your decision on the latter – but you probably should have . Why ? Hobbies are the things you choose to do ; activities that you 're probably good at and enjoy doing , and these personal expressions "" will give us unedited clues as to our real desires and interests , "" says Joyce K. Reynolds , an expert business coach . She says looking for career clues in one's choice of hobbies , interests and vocational activities will provide the most fruitful direction for highly successful career choices . "" In fact , the earlier we are able to observe our personal tastes as they show up in hobbies and outside activities , the more powerful a lead these things will provide in steering us to meaningful professional and career choices . "" Career coach Phyllis Mufson agrees . "" A hobby you really enjoy can be an important part of choosing a career because your hobby is a window into what you love and value and do most naturally , which are all important components of a career where you 'll flourish . "" While there can be tremendous joy in earning income from doing something that you might happily do for free , there are also practical benefits . "" It can be easier to segue into a hobby-related career since you may already have many of the skills , experiences and personal connections needed for success , "" says Nancy Collamer , a career coach at MyLifestyleCareer.com . But you need to spend time seriously evaluating whether turning your hobby into your work is a good idea , she adds . "" Sometimes it 's best to leave the two as separate and distinct parts of your life . "" Here are a few ways to monetize a hobby : Teach others to do what you love . Teach piano lessons , offer cooking classes , or teach another language , if those are your passions . You can do this by teaching through a college or continuing education program , by creating your own classes , or by creating your own webinars or tele-seminar series online , Collamer says . Sell / import / invent / craft a product or accessory for enthusiasts in your hobby . For example , if you are a wine enthusiast , you might import hand-blown wine glasses from a different country , or invent a unique wine refrigeration device , or develop a line of fun wine-themed T-shirts . "" Hobbyists tend to be very enthusiastic , passionate and willing to spend money on items related to their hobby , "" Collamer says . "" Just think of what baseball enthusiasts are willing to pay for World Series tickets . "" Teach the business of the hobby . "" I actually talk about this in my book ( Second-Act Careers : 50 + Ways to Profit From Your Passions During Semi-Retirement ) , using an example of a man who used to work for Microsoft in marketing , but his hobby was magic , and now he teaches marketing to magicians , "" Collamer says . So let 's say your background is in publishing , but you love cooking , you could specialize in teaching people in the food industry how to get their cookbooks published . "" I have another example in my book of a woman who teaches people how to make a living importing goods from Ecuador , for people who love to travel and / or shop . "" Speak or write about your hobby . Hobby related how-to topics , historical perspectives , and compelling stories , are all of interest to enthusiasts , Collamer says . And you could get paid to do it . Create a tour or performance series around what you love . "" The other day I met a woman who bills herself as a ' Founding Fathers Fanatic ' and she performs at schools , in character , to teach students about the Founding Fathers , "" Collamer says . "" Another example of this is Tony Mula , who turned his love of pizza and Brooklyn into the highly successful ' A Slice of Brooklyn ' pizza tours , "" she adds . "" I also know of a bike enthusiast who runs bike tours in California . "" Appraise , repair or fix items related to what you love . Most hobbies have "" stuff "" connected to them , and sometimes , that stuff needs to be fixed by a skilled and knowledgeable person . "" You could fix computers , appraise collectibles , repair bicycles , source missing parts for highly unusual items , and so on , "" Collamer says . "" The next time you find yourself confused as to how to generate income from your hobbies , search out the most successful entrepreneurs in your area of interest and study their business models and revenue streams , "" Collamer suggests . "" Ask yourself : Is their income coming from consulting services , videos , accessories , events , classes or product sales ? What is their mix of products and services ? What is their pricing strategy ? "" In doing this , you 'll discover proven models for monetizing your hobbies , as well as helpful information about how to price your own services and products . Mufson , who has interests outside of career coaching , says she managed to turn a hobby into a lucrative part-time gig . "" I personally turned my hobby of creating gemstone jewelry into a side-line business , "" she explains . "" Jewelry making is an expensive hobby and early on I decided to make it pay for itself . Since then I have developed two online stores and a relationship with a jewelry gallery that sells most of my work . "" Not everyone is going to wind up a star by following a well-loved hobby into a professional setting , Reynolds says . "" We ca n't all be Olympic skaters , NBA top scorers or real estate moguls . However , it can be taken as a promise that , if we follow the lines and design of our natural interests and loves , we will give ourselves the very best chance to grow into the most successful human beings we can be . It will also ensure that we have more days we love because we 're doing the things that most interest us , nourish us , and give us expression , "" she concludes . There are a few problems with the Tourism Authority of Thailand 4-page brochure mainly that they neglected to also publish this document in the Thai language since most of the offenses listed are committed by Thais and not by foreigners . The problem with the Tourism Authority of Thailand brochure for Chinese and Western tourists is that it has errors , assumes Thailand is Singapore , and only expects tourists to obey the rules – not local Thais . Right off the bat , the Tourism Authority of Thailand pamphlet tells us that smoking is allowed in all of Thailand's International Airports . The International Airports in Thailand have designated smoking areas – outside . At Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok , one has to cross the street and go to a designated area or face a 2,000 baht fine . I guess the Tourism Authority of Thailand is trying to help the cigarette-butt police increase their daily take . What the Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention is that if you get into a confrontation with a Thai , he will most likely get 10 of his buddies to come and beat the shit out of you . Failing that , he will pull a gun and shoot you . Tourism Authority of Thailand Counterfeits The Tourism Authority of Thailand also does n't tell you that you can buy your pornographic materials right out in the open on Sukhumvit Road . Dildos , XXX videos , and fake / real Viagra are readily available . All sorts of copyright material are also available . Tourism Authority of Thailand Loud Yes , Thais are soft-spoken except when they are drunk . They can also be quite noisy if handed a microphone especially when butchering karaoke songs . Tourism Authority of Thailand Proper Attire The Tourism Authority of Thailand also fails to point out , like Tom at Isaan-Live has done numerous times , that the biggest violators are Thai women . Tourism Authority of Thailand Spitting Yes , it is disgusting . For some reason the Tourism Authority of Thailand thinks this is Singapore where people get caned for spitting . But , no this is Thailand where at times it seems like the national pastime is spitting – and no one gets caned . Tourism Authority of Thailand Driving Safety I saved the best for last . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention that Thais are some of the worst drivers in the world , traffic laws are not followed , and the Thai Police selectively enforce laws . But , maybe since Chiang Mai targets foreign drivers these silly rules should be followed by tourists – after all – they are not followed by most Thais . Let 's take a look at them one by one : Drive safely in Thailand and strictly follow all traffic regulations . Yes , do n't do like Thai drivers and disobey every driving rule there is . Thailand adopts left-hand drive system . Always keep to the left lane when driving in Thailand . Actually , it should be that slower moving traffic stick to the left lane and only pass on the right . The Tourism Authority of Thailand does n't tell you that you can drive like a Thai and cross double yellow lines , pass on a hill , and drive at any speed you want . Always beware of bicycles and motorbikes as there are many on the roads . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to warn foreigners that Thais like to drive their motorcycles on the wrong side of the road and also like to drive on the sidewalks / footpaths . To prevent accidents , do not stop your car abruptly in the middle of a road for any reason . Unless you are Thai – then it is OK . If you are Thai , you can also stop in front of 7-11 or an ATM machine and block one lane of traffic as long as you put on one turn signal indicator . Please study the directions before each journey to make sure you know your way . And , do n't use any guidebooks from the Tourism Authority of Thailand unless you plan on getting lost . Always stop at zebra crossings to allow all pedestrians to cross the road first . The Tourism Authority of Thailand should warn people that zebra crossings / pedestrian crossing sare simply lines painted on the road that are ignored by all Thai drivers . If you stop for pedestrians in the crossing , be prepared to be rammed from the back . The rest of the list from the Tourism Authority of Thailand only pertain to those that bring vehicles into Thailand from foreign countries so it is of no value at all for Chinese / Western tourists and will most likely just confuse people . This just goes to show that the Tourism Authority of Thailand is clueless when it comes to foreign tourists and needs to focus some of its energy on cleaning up Thailand or tourists will stop visiting . One of the most important hiring criteria for many companies is the ability to work as a team player – yet , so many of us have colleagues who do n't play well with others . "" If you have one bad apple in the bunch , it can really hurt the morale and enthusiasm of an entire department , "" says Andy Teach , author of From Graduation to Corporation , and host of the YouTube channel FromGradToCorp . "" A department , or company , that works well together , has the most success together . When you enjoy working with your colleagues and look forward to interacting with them , everyone benefits . "" Working with other team members whom you have a great work relationship with can actually make work fun , he says . "" Morale is high , which leads to better productivity , which leads to better results . "" Skip Weisman , a leadership and workplace communication expert , agrees . "" A high-morale work environment will always produce more than a low-morale work environment . "" When people care about the people they work with , things get done faster , he says . "" People will go the extra mile ; they will take ownership of a job , a decision or problem and work through it without feeling like they have to go up the chain to get things done . "" Another benefit of colleagues working well together : Information flows more freely , says David Parnell , a legal consultant , communication coach and author . "" In addition , the group 's well being and success become more of a priority ; patience , generosity and a gravitation toward interaction grows ; and good moods and dynamic information beget better moods and even more dynamic information , "" he says . "" All of this conspires to create a more balanced , functional , aggressive and successful company . "" So , what happens when colleagues do n't work well together ? Parnell says time and cognitive bandwidth is wasted "" exercising restraint , measuring words and otherwise forcing hands to play nicely in the sandbox . "" The outcome is shoddy workmanship , pushed or missed deadlines and severe lacerations to the company culture or your group's sub-culture . Deborah Shane , a career author , writer , speaker and professional branding and social media marketing strategist , adds that a bad workplace relationship creates negative energy , which can affect everyone on the team , as well as customers or clients . It can also cause employee turnover , which "" interrupts building and creating a strong , unified team . "" Finally , she says , "" conflict fosters cliques and factions within a team that always works against it . "" Make teamwork a priority by making it part of the performance management system . This begins with performance expectations when someone joins the organization , Weisman says . "" I was speaking with a prospective client last summer who was complaining about this very thing – that their people were not working well together – so I asked her , ' Well , do you assess their contribution to teamwork as part of your annual performance review process ? ' She looked at me like a deer in headlights and responded as if it was a master stroke of genius . "" If you do n't measure it and give people the expectation at the very beginning of their role with the organization , it will not be seen as priority . Pinpoint the issue . "" Explore your feelings and behavior toward your colleagues , "" says Parnell . "" Social and professional relationships are inextricably symbiotic and interactive , and much of the communication that occurs is both subconscious and reactive . "" If your colleagues seem to be difficult , they may actually be reacting to the signals you are giving off – whether consciously or unconsciously . While this might be a bitter pill to swallow , you may be the very root of the problem and the first step toward recovery is discovering this . Think you deserve a bigger paycheck ? Want to ask for a raise but not sure you 'll get one ? Plenty of employees are finding themselves in this predicament , because many recession-wary companies that stopped handing out raises during the economic downturn are still hesitant to open their wallets today . But career experts say that despite all the penny-pinching , a salary hike is n't necessarily out of the question – so you might as well ask . "" Clearly most companies today are not looking for opportunities to hand out money , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" During the boom era of the late '90s when talent was scarce and retention was top of mind , nearly the opposite was true . While the corporate landscape is different now , you should n't sit idly and feel dissatisfied in silence . If you have supportive evidence your salary is at sub-market levels , you should speak up . "" She says it is possible to get a raise , even in an environment where money is n't exactly falling from trees . "" Your organization has invested time and money in you . Savvy bosses understand that unhappy and underpaid employees are under-performing employees , which helps no one . It 's a drain on their time to have to re-hire and train a replacement that fits the corporate culture . So if you have a legitimate request , you do have a certain amount of leverage . "" Connie Thanasoulis-Cerrachio , a career expert and co-founder of SixFigureStart , a career coaching firm , agrees . "" I think it 's always a good idea to ask for a raise , even when employers are not handing them out , "" she says . "" But only when that discussion is tied to performance . "" Employees should keep careful records of how their actions helped the bottom line of their company , or helped other team members improve the bottom line of the company , she suggests . "" No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the great things you did all year , "" she adds , so keep track and share them with your manager at the appropriate time . Asking for a pay raise is a delicate conversation and something you should not do without careful planning , says Dr. Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career . "" Being prepared can help you overcome your hesitation . "" Aside from keeping track of your accomplishments and contributions , you can plan by thinking about things like timing . "" This is key , "" Brooks says . "" If others are being laid off , or there has been a cutback in revenues to the organization , that is generally not the time to ask for a raise . Wait for things to settle , then assess the situation . Perhaps you are now doing the work of two former workers , or you have brought in more revenue than in previous years . Wait until you can approach from a positive rather than negative stance . "" Know your value . Do the proper research to figure out what you 're worth , even if it means going on interviews or using resources like Getraised.com , Payscale.com , or Glassdoor.com , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . If you find out you 're underpaid , you can use that to negotiate an increase . "" Look at salary surveys , cost-of-living comparisons , and rates of compensation within your organization , if possible , "" Brooks says . "" If you are aware that colleagues are earning more than you , tread carefully . You do n't want to put others in a negative light or violate a corporate written or unwritten rule about knowing what others earn . Simply present what the field generally pays , and why you believe your performance is at the top of your field . "" Know the number . Once you do the research , figure out what you think is a fair amount of money to ask for , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . "" Have that number in your head when you ask for a raise . "" Schedule a meeting . Find a time that works best for you and your boss , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . Taylor adds , "" Give your boss a head 's up that you want to chat about your career growth so that you both have ample time . "" Practice salary negotiations . This can be a difficult or awkward conversation . Practice with a friend who can be a tough negotiator , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . We all have our moments of "" multitask overload "" – especially managers . But working with a perpetually disorganized boss can be exasperating and even detrimental to your workplace productivity . "" You may feel like you 're spinning your wheels , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" There can be many false starts if your boss has n't thought through a project or the resources required for it ; if he has n't set priorities well ; or if he ca n't get back to you because everything appears to be in disarray . And if you follow orders based on a disorganized initiative , a chaotic domino effect can occur within your department . "" This work style can negatively affect your sense of accomplishment and performance , she adds . "" And it can bring down an entire team . "" Sara Sutton Fell , CEO and founder of FlexJobs , agrees . "" It can be extremely frustrating to deal with a disorganized boss , because their disorganization often trickles ( or even pours ) down on you . It can hurt team morale , and it reflects poorly on everyone . "" When the boss is disorganized , it can lead to partial project requests , misinformation , missed or wrong deadlines and "" general messiness , "" she says . "" All of those can cause balls to be dropped , and then ensuing stress and rush to pick them back up again . "" Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career , says the word "" disorganized "" can mean several things . "" It could be a failure to see the big picture and approach issues strategically ; difficulty remembering important deadlines , meetings , projects , etc. ; or failure to set goals and prioritize what is important for the office . "" Productivity coach Casey Moore concurs . She says in the workplace , "" disorganization "" takes many forms . One , she says , is what she calls "" the searcher . "" "" This supervisor ca n't find the objects or information she needs when she needs them . She frequently wastes time looking for keys , emails , digital files , etc. – and she wastes money replacing lost items and wastes energy ( and more time ) re-creating documents or other work products . She usually has a cluttered desk and email inbox , "" explains Moore , the author of Stop Organizing , Start Producing . "" You and your colleagues will likely be dragged into time-consuming searches or scrambles to re-do or replace what is n't found . You may have to exercise caution about what you give your supervisor because it may be lost and / or forgotten . "" "" The improviser "" is another type of disorganized boss . This supervisor does n't plan ahead . He may be adept at reacting and improvising on the spot , but eventually you realizes he 's covering his tracks , not blazing a trail , Moore says . "" He requires his team to reinvent the wheel over and over because there 's no time to fine-tune processes when you 're always behind the curve . "" If this is your boss , you and your colleagues likely perform too many fire drills : rushing to meet deadlines , struggling to fix easily-preventable mistakes , and missing out on opportunities that require a modicum of foresight . Moore says the third type of disorganized supervisor is "" the constrictor . "" This boss does n't delegate , she says . "" Her reasons vary from altruist ( ' protecting ' her team ) to arrogant ( only she can do it ' right ' ) ; from fearful ( of letting go ) to flummoxed ( unable to identify exactly how others could help ) . The result , however , is always the same : a bottleneck that slows everyone . "" This type of boss's subordinates probably feel frustrated by her unresponsiveness , the lack of challenging goals and the subtle implication that she does n't think you they handle the work , Moore adds . Do you have a coworker who thinks he knows everything ? He believes he 's the go-to person ; the one with the special connections and authority . He acts as though he 's been everywhere and has experienced everything . If there 's a problem , he has the solution ; if there 's a question , he has the answer . He is n't open to new ideas or collaborating – and he has strong opinions , which he delivers in an obnoxious manner . Chances are , you 've never , ever heard him utter the words "" I do n't know . "" "" They tend to monopolize conversations , dismiss input from others and make decisions without first considering all the facts , "" she says . "" A ' my way or the highway ' attitude often leads to unhappy coworkers , disgruntled clients , and an unhappy work environment . "" Andrew G. Rosen , founder and editor of career advice blog Jobacle.com , says it can be extremely difficult to work with a know-it-all because "" they are generally poor listeners , often thinking about what they are going to say next rather than hear what you are saying . Their mindset makes it hard to get through to them that their idea or solution might not be the best one . They have often already formed an opinion and will not be swayed . "" Michael Kerr , an international business speaker , president of Humor at Work , and author of The Humor Advantage : Why Some Businesses are Laughing all the Way to the Bank ( Dec. 2013 ) , agrees . "" Know-it-alls can be extremely frustrating to work with for a number of reasons , "" he says . "" One , they tend to speak more than they listen , so people can be left with the feeling that their opinions or ideas have n't been given a proper hearing . They can often be close-minded as well – which means they can become a severe impediment to the creative process by blocking any idea other than their own . They simply know an idea either will or wo n't work . Some know-it-alls can come across as opinionated , aggressive , brusque and even loud – all traits that wo n't win over a lot of people at the office – and in fact can be easily construed as bullying behavior . "" Here are eight tips for dealing with a know-it-all coworker : 1 . Be empathetic . This coworker may irritate you – but remember that his or her know-it-all attitude is probably stemming from a confidence issue or some deeper personal issue , Rosen says . "" Rather than get angry , allow yourself to be empathetic . "" 2 . Pick your battles . "" Dealing with a know-it-all can be exhausting and there are times when your best response is to ignore their ' helpful ' hints as much as possible , "" Collamer says . "" Deflect their comments with a simple , ' Thanks for that suggestion ' instead of engaging them in an ongoing conversation . "" 3 . Lead by example . "" A boss or manager , especially , needs to model the behavior that in many circumstances it 's not only okay to not know everything , it 's encouraged , "" Kerr says . "" Saying ' I do n't know , but let 's find some answers or get some great ideas ' demonstrates that you are flexible and open to other opinions . Saying ' I do n't know , ' can also build trust by demonstrating openness , vulnerability and honesty . "" 4 . Be armed with your own facts . If you are delivering a presentation , selling an idea or heading into a meeting , be confident in your own facts , Kerr says . "" Double check your sources and verify the facts . The more armed you are with knowledge , the less chance the know-it-all has to interject or one up you . "" When in meetings , stick to an agenda ( passed around ahead of time ) that provides a set amount of time for each person to speak , Collamer adds . "" Come prepared with facts and statistics in writing , so in the event ' Mr. Know-it-all ' does n't let you get a word in edgewise , you have something in writing to share with the team . The better prepared you are , the less room there will be for the know-it-all to commandeer the discussion . "" "" Although it 's highly tempting to use sarcasm with a know-it-all , this will undoubtedly backfire . Instead , take a deep breath , smile and do your best Johnny Carson impersonation , ' I did not know that . That is weird , wild stuff . ' Laugh it off by reminding yourself that often their behavior is harmless and they do n't really mean anything by it . A friendly , ' Okay , I want you on my Trivial Pursuit team ' can disarm a potentially tense situation . "" 6 . Ask probing questions . Be respectful , but ask detailed question to peel back the layers of a know-it-all's stance , Kerr suggests . "" Ask why they believe something to be true or where they found their sources , "" he says . "" Asking pointed questions on specific details can teach a know-it-all over time that they need to have their facts in order before speaking out . "" 7 . Take the person aside and offer constructive feedback on their behavior . "" Recognize that it 's possible that Ms. Know-it-all may be clueless about the impact of her behavior on others , "" Collamer says . "" If you suspect that 's the case , consider gently pointing this out during a private discussion away from the office . "" Kerr adds : "" Although this can be tricky , if you do it in a respectful way it can help . Keep in mind that many know-it-alls may be highly insecure , so stroke their ego , flatter them on their range of knowledge , but caution them as to how their communication style may be coming across to other people . "" Remind them how important it is for less confident people than themselves to be able to speak up . 8 . Avoid involving your boss unless the know-it-all is truly threatening your success . "" If that becomes necessary , maintain a positive tone and instead of complaining about the person , focus on what you 're willing to do to make sure the work is done well , "" says Isa Adney , author of How to Get a Job Without a Resume and the blog firstjoboutofcollege.com . Collamer agrees . "" If the situation really becomes unbearable , talk it over with your boss and let him or her know how the know-it-all's behavior is impacting the team and work environment . "" Any new entrepreneur can become quickly overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved in running a business . A business owner has to be concerned about record-keeping requirements for tax purposes , client contact notes , marketing schedules , and billing , while still trying to meet the day-to-day needs of running a business . Try to be as paper-free as possible . This saves money and storage costs , and does n't tie you down to a desk . One advantage of being new is that you can start from the beginning with everything . It is difficult to try to get organized once your business is established . Take some time to consider some online options that will cut down on paperwork and get your office on track right from the very start . Here are five tips that can help : Dropbox : This free online service lets you bring your photos , documents , and videos anywhere and share them easily . Just start an account to install the Dropbox application on your computer . Then you simply create and share folders to exchange information with other people . Also use Dropbox to store your own files so they are available wherever you go . Join . me : Join . me offers free screen sharing and online meetings . Share your computer screen to go over any documents when you have telephone appointments with clients . Money Issues : Being in business requires you to become a good money manager . You must keep your financial commitments and be tenacious about accounts receivable . Whenever possible , have clients pay for as much work upfront as possible . If any amount is due , use scheduling reminders to send a reminder invoice . As your business grows , you might begin using QuickBooks or PayPal to help in collecting and sending money . Authorize . Net is another online payment solution , where clients receive a link via email and access the site to pay by credit or debit card . Tax Issues : Depending on your business you could be responsible for federal and state income tax , social security payments , sales tax , and other tax responsibilities . Consult a local accountant , tax advisor , tax authority , or Small Business Administration office to find out what taxes you are responsible for as a small business owner . A Little Now Saves A Lot Later It 's never too early for high school students to start checking out colleges on their list of potential schools . A campus tour is not only a great way for students to find places they love , but also to cross off those on their list that may not be the right fit . A college may look great in a brochure or say all the right things on its website , but the true test of fit often comes from a personal visit . Of course , several things can make or break a college tour . For example , students who visit during the summer or over breaks may not have the same experience as those who attend information sessions and tours during the fall or spring semesters . To ensure students have a successful college tour , I suggest the following tips . 1 . Explore Online Before students head to any campus , it 's a good idea to do a little reconnaissance . Students should check the college's website to verify the school offers the degree programs they may be interested in , as well as study abroad or research opportunities ( if desired ) . Students may want to browse the student activities page and see what clubs , organizations and groups may be present on campus , as well . It 's not a bad idea to check if any events ( sporting , concert , etc. ) will be held during the tour date , as there could be issues with parking or areas of the campus that are inaccessible at that time . Students should definitely familiarize themselves with the admissions and financial aid pages , too . After carefully reviewing the college's website , students should write down any questions they might have and bring these with them during the tour . 2 . Make Appointments Although some schools may have informal , walk-in tours available , most of the larger schools will require an appointment for students to participate in an admissions session and / or campus tour . This means students will need to go online or call weeks ( or even months ) in advance to secure their spot . Depending on the time of year , some schools may even limit the number of high school underclassmen allowed , saving those precious spaces for graduating seniors who will be attending next fall . Seniors should not only participate in an admissions session and tour , but also consider scheduling an interview with an admissions counselor , and possibly meeting with the department chairs or professors within their chosen degree field . Juniors , who tour during the spring or summer before senior year , should also consider going through the interview process . 3 . Roam Freely Campus tours are a great way to get a feel for a school , but students should remember that tours are geared to show them the best the college has to offer . To see what a college may be like on an average day , students should opt to roam on their own for a few hours before or after their tour . It 's a good idea for them to have a meal at the cafeteria ( they 'll be eating there quite a lot , if accepted ) , sit in on a class ( big and small ) , or chat up some students that are hanging out on campus . If possible , students should also spend some time exploring the surrounding community , or consider participating in an overnight stay , to see if it the college is a good match . It 's helpful if students bring along a campus scorecard to keep track of things they like ( or dislike ) during their tours , as campuses can start to blend together after a few visits . Students should pay attention to various things , such as dorm room sizes and options , typical class size , how many students stay after their first year and how many graduate on time , as well as other things that may play a role in their decision to apply . Once students have narrowed their lists , sent in their college applications , and received their acceptance letters , a second trip may be needed to help them make a final decision . A picture may speak a thousand words , but a campus visit is the best way for students to see themselves in that picture ."	7

186	"Held at the Palais des Nations , Geneva , on Wednesday , 2 September 2009 , at 10.10 a . m . President : Mr. Christian STROHAL ( Austria ) The PRESIDENT : I declare open the 1157th plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament . It is a particular honour and pleasure for me to be able to welcome the Federal Minister for European and International Affairs of the Republic of Austria , Mr. Michael Spindelegger , to this Conference . Mr. Spindelegger has had a long career , in spite of his young age , in the Austrian Parliament and the European Parliament . He has been the Second President of the Austrian Parliament and the foreign policy spokesperson of the People's Party , and became a minister last year . We are delighted that he has made it to Geneva , where he has arrived at a busy time when we are preparing not only for the closure of this year's session of the Conference on Disarmament but also for the General Assembly of the United Nations , as well as for the relevant activities of the Security Council , on which Austria will be represented next year as a non-permanent member . I now give the floor to the minister . Mr. SPINDELEGGER ( Austria ) : Mr. President , Thank you for this opportunity to address the Conference on Disarmament today . Austria has assumed the presidency of the Conference at an important point in time . This year the Conference finally adopted a programme of work after more than a decade of stalemate . This is a positive , long overdue development . So I do not need to speak about deadlocks or the missed opportunities of the past . Let me focus on recent positive developments in arms control and disarmament and their implications for our future . The year 2009 has seen one paramount development : the goal of nuclear disarmament and the eventual total elimination of nuclear weapons has been put back on the global agenda . I welcome the five-point plan for disarmament proposed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr. Ban Ki-moon , which I had the opportunity to discuss with him a few days ago in Austria . I also welcome the recent positive statements that have been made by United States President Obama in Prague and Cairo and by Russian President Medvedev . And only a few weeks ago , Chinese Foreign Minister Yang underlined China's goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world here in this very room . Austria promoted the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons throughout the cold war , when only a few countries possessed nuclear capabilities . Since proliferation has introduced new threats from States and non-State actors , striving for this goal is now all the more necessary . Our vision is now shared by the most important nuclear powers . But how far has this vision been translated into concrete action ? We can identify two developments . First , direct bilateral negotiations : we see a renewed readiness to engage in bilateral negotiations . The commitment by President Obama and President Medvedev to negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty by the end of this year is a good example . Second , the global atmosphere in multilateral arms control negotiations has changed : preparations for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) show a markedly better atmosphere . Initiatives by States and civil society all around the world , such as the Security Council summit on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament due to be held on 24 September , ensure global ownership and demonstrate a new readiness to engage in dialogue . But let me be clear : positive declarations , a good atmosphere and universal interest also need real implementation and compliance . The NPT can only fulfil its promise of peace if all States adhere to their obligations . Similarly the programme of work of the Conference on Disarmament needs to be implemented if it is to become a real achievement . This brings me to my next point - our expectations for the future . First let me start with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , a treaty which originated in this chamber . The deplorable nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in May has made clear that the entry into force of the CTBT is overdue . As Co-Chair , together with Costa Rica , Austria has been deeply involved in efforts to secure this goal over the past two years . Let me thus use this opportunity to appeal once again to those States that have not yet done so to accede to the CTBT as soon as possible . I am encouraged by the recent commitment of President Obama to pursue ratification by the United States , and also by China's comments in this regard . Let me appeal to all States to show their support for the treaty at the Article XIV conference in New York later this month , and to all delegation 's present to help ensure that their country participates . Second , Austria believes that a comprehensive fissile material cut-off treaty ( FMCT ) - a treaty that still has to emerge from this chamber - would significantly contribute to nuclear disarmament . Reliable techniques for monitoring and verification have been developed over the past years . The potential positive impact of such a treaty has been confirmed many times . The IAEA is ready to make an important contribution . It now requires the political will of Governments and the efforts of skilled negotiators to make it a reality . It is my sincere hope that the new spirit in the Conference on Disarmament will soon enable it to proceed with actual work and start negotiations on an FMCT . Finally , when we talk about expectations for the upcoming year , we must mention the NPT Review Conference , which will take place next May in New York . The Preparatory Committee has shown a willingness to achieve a meaningful outcome this time . Today , we see a broad understanding that the dangers of nuclear technology need to be contained in a manner that creates trust and confidence among all States . The Review Conference will demonstrate whether we are capable of transforming this positive atmosphere into real progress . Austria will present and support initiatives aimed at making substantial progress in nuclear disarmament , non-proliferation and a global system to effectively control the nuclear fuel cycle . This should help to avoid tensions such as the ones we are currently witnessing in regard to the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran . Austria attaches great importance to arms control also in the area of conventional weapons such as landmines , cluster munitions and small arms and light weapons . Let me make three brief comments in this respect . First , with regard to landmines : Austria's objective for the Second Review Conference of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention , to be held later this year in Cartagena , Columbia , is to work for a strong Cartagena action plan , which will serve as a clear guide to States and bring us closer to a world free of mines . One priority for us is to improve assistance to landmine survivors . In this respect Austria has sponsored - together with Norway and civil society partners - a project to examine the global impact of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and what remains to be done to improve the situation of survivors . The report will be presented here today right after this meeting . Let me just use this opportunity to encourage all States that have not yet done so to accede to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention . It is time for the international community not only to review its stance on nuclear weapons but also to finally eradicate this terrible weapon . Second , with regard to cluster munitions : I encourage States to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions . So far 17 States have ratified it . It is our strong hope that the Convention will receive the necessary 30 ratifications to enter into force before the end of this year . To support this , Austria has engaged in a worldwide campaign and will support a conference on cluster munitions in Indonesia in November . Third , with regard to small arms and light weapons : these are a major security threat in parts of the world . Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan once called them the "" real weapons of mass destruction "" . Every year , hundreds of thousands of people are killed by them . The United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects is a significant step forward . Austria supports its implementation on the ground , especially in Africa . To stop the illicit arms trade , Austria supports the conclusion of a legally-binding international arms trade treaty . As a producing and exporting country of small arms , Austria feels a special responsibility to engage in this process and will also host the concluding conference of the global joint project of the European Union and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in February 2010 . We hope that the conference in Vienna will provide positive momentum and enable the conclusion of a treaty in the near future . One thing is clear : there is no lack of work in the field of arms control and disarmament today and the international community is responding positively . In order to succeed , I count not only on the new flexibility of the nuclear-weapon States and the constructive contributions of all the other States , but also on the commitment and expertise of civil society . Throughout the years , non-governmental organizations and private citizens have remained important motors of the disarmament and arms control process . Austria has always underlined that disarmament and arms control must be an open , participatory process if it is to succeed . Protecting the world from the harm caused by weapons is a global project and needs active support from all of us . In this respect , I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the Conference for his tireless efforts , and this year's other presidencies - Viet Nam , Zimbabwe , Algeria , Argentina and Australia - for their excellent cooperation in the Conference on Disarmament . I wish the Conference the necessary energy for a good conclusion to this year's session and an early and effective resumption next year . The PRESIDENT : I thank the minister for his statement . Before adjourning this plenary meeting , let me just make two brief announcements . The first is , as mentioned , at 11 a . m . in this chamber , the minister will launch the report "" Voices from the Ground "" , a report in which victims of landmines and explosive remnants of war will speak out on victim assistance . The next plenary meeting of the Conference will be held tomorrow at 11 a . m . in this chamber . At that time , the Chairman-Designate of the First Committee of the General Assembly , Ambassador José Luis Cancela of Uruguay , will deliver a statement . This plenary meeting is adjourned . The meeting rose at 10.25 a . m . ( Mr. Spindelegger , ( Austria ) ( Mr. Spindelegger , ( Austria )"	1

I would be grateful if you could have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development under agenda item 1 . ( Signed ) Wang Yingfan Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Annex to the letter dated 27 January 2002 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General China's position paper : No accreditation of the International Campaign for Tibet to the World Summit on Sustainable Development The World Summit on Sustainable Development is an international conference of crucial importance in the field of sustainable development . The Chinese Government attaches great importance to the Summit and has always been actively engaged in the preparatory process for the Summit . The Chinese Government appreciates the active role of non-governmental organizations in the field of sustainable development and welcomes their participation in and contributions to the Summit . However , the International Campaign for Tibet , as listed in the Secretary-General's note on accreditation of non-governmental organizations and other major groups to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ( E / CN . 17 / 2002 / PC . 2 / 16 ) , is an organization whose primary objective is to split Tibet from China . All its main activities have been conducted with a view to achieving this primary objective . Referring to decision 2001 / PC / 3 , adopted at the organizational session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development , China firmly opposes granting accreditation to the International Campaign for Tibet to take part in the World Summit on Sustainable Development and its preparatory process . This is a matter of principle to the Chinese Government . Tibet is an inalienable part of China . This is an indisputable fact recognized by all countries in the world . However , the International Campaign for Tibet denies the fact and treats Tibet as an independent State and openly advocates that Tibet is now under "" Chinese invasion "" , "" Chinese occupation "" and even "" Chinese colonial rule "" . Maintaining sovereign territorial integrity is one of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations . It is very clear that the objective and splittist activities of the International Campaign for Tibet constitute not only an infringement upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China but also a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations . The International Campaign for Tibet is closely associated with the so-called "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" has for a long time devoted itself to splitting Tibet from China and it has never been recognized by any country . Ever since its establishment , the International Campaign for Tibet has been identifying itself with the position and views of the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The main purpose of its activities is to spread and implement policies and schemes formulated by the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The special relationship of the International Campaign for Tibet with the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" clearly demonstrates its objective of splitting Tibet from China . China is a united multiethnic State . Equality and unity have always been the fundamental principles adopted by the Chinese Government for harmonizing relations among all Chinese ethnic groups . During the second half of the twentieth century , universally acknowledged achievements have been made in political , economic , social and cultural aspects in regions where there are large populations of ethnic minorities , including in Tibet . Out of its objective of splitting Tibet from China , the International Campaign for Tibet has been misleading the international community with all kinds of tricks . The International Campaign for Tibet turns a blind eye to all the achievements made by the Chinese Government . It has organized a series of activities against China and slandered Chinese ethnic policies using distortions and fabrications . It has also tried every means to create obstacles to hinder the economic and social development of Tibet . Moreover , although China has been giving strong and firm support to the international counter-terrorism campaign after the terrorist attacks of 11 September , the International Campaign for Tibet still wantonly makes the accusation that "" China today has established state terrorism "" . This clearly demonstrates its anti-China character . For the above-mentioned reasons , the International Campaign for Tibet should not be allowed to participate , in whatever name and under whatever pretext , in any United Nations activities . Accreditation of such an organization to the World Summit on Sustainable Development will undermine the cooperative atmosphere , normal proceedings and the ultimate success of the Summit . The Chinese Government urges the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development to reject the application of the International Campaign for Tibet for accreditation and calls for the understanding and support of all delegations in this regard ."	0

11	"François Hollande's Wrong Idea of France LONDON – France's new president , François Hollande , has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May . Unfortunately , his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France's apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite's approach to the "" construction of Europe . "" Since winning the presidency , Hollande has won a parliamentary majority and pushed Germany toward accepting joint liability for eurozone countries' debts . But forebodings of crisis have become widespread in French business and economic circles . But the real danger – which even Hollande's sternest critics may be underestimating – is not so much his individual policy failings ( serious though they may be ) as his approach to the twin challenges posed by France's economic imbalances and the eurozone crisis . On each front separately , he might manage to muddle through ; together , they look likely to cement France's loss of competitiveness . Declining competitiveness is best captured in a single indicator : unit labor costs , which measure the average cost of labor per unit of output . In a monetary union , discrepancies in wage growth relative to productivity gains – that is , unit labor costs – will result in a chronic accumulation of trade surpluses or deficits . Since the euro's introduction , unit labor costs have risen dramatically faster in France than they have in Germany . According to Eurostat data published in April 2011 , the hourly labor cost in France was € 34 . 2 , compared to € 30 . 1 in Germany – and nearly 20 % higher than the eurozone average of € 27 . 6 . France's current-account deficit has risen to more than 2 % of GDP , even as its economic growth has ground to a halt . The high cost of employing workers in France is due not so much to wages and benefits as it is to payroll taxes levied on employers . The entire French political class has long delighted in taxing labor to finance the country's generous welfare provisions , thus avoiding excessively high taxation of individuals' income and consumption – though that is about to come to an end as Hollande intends to slap a 75 % tax on incomes above € 1 million . This is a version of the fallacy that taxing companies ( "" capital "" ) spares ordinary people ( "" workers "" ) . Of course , such taxes on firms are always passed on to households – usually through straightforward price hikes , and , in France , also through unemployment . High tax rates on labor – together with rigid regulation of hiring and firing – make employers extremely reluctant to recruit workers . As a result , France has had chronic long-term unemployment – forecast to reach 10.5 % by 2013 – for many years . Hollande's predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , tried to address this problem . He exempted voluntary overtime pay from employment tax and shifted some of the burden of labor taxation onto consumption ( via a hike in VAT ) . But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms . The repeal of the tax break on overtime reflects another economic fallacy to which French Socialist politicians are deeply attached : the "" lump of labor "" notion that underlay the most disastrous of their economic policies – the 35-hour workweek , introduced in 2000 . The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant , and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment . Such measures , designed to create jobs by freeing up work hours , are futile at best , and are often detrimental . French Socialists should recall their school physics lesson about communicating vessels : when a homogeneous liquid is poured into a set of connected containers , it settles at the same level in all of them , regardless of their shape and volume . Generating more "" liquid "" ( jobs ) requires not discouraging the entrepreneurs on whose activities sustainable job creation ultimately depends . The effect of fiscal and regulatory pressure on employment is to encourage French firms to invest and hire outside France . Hollande's apologists praise his gradualist and consensual approach to addressing the economy's structural distortions . They argue that his penchant for setting up consultative commissions is the best way to forge the consensus required for structural reform , whereas Sarkozy's combative style was counterproductive . Even banishing skepticism and assuming that Hollande could over time persuade his supporters to embrace competitiveness-boosting policies , the eurozone crisis is denying France the time that such gradualism requires . A simple , effective way to buy time would be to abandon the euro and restore competitiveness through a devalued national currency . But this expedient is incompatible with mainstream French politicians' devotion to the "" European project , "" which amounts to a projection of French soft power ; indeed , building Europe lies at the heart of the French establishment's version of what Charles de Gaulle used to call "" a certain idea of France . "" For mainstream French politicians , renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative : an all-out push for full European political union . This would reestablish monetary sovereignty and create a normal central bank ( like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England ) at the European level . But it would also mean abandoning France's republic in favor of a federal European government – anathema to that "" certain idea of France . "" The combination of gradualism ( on the most generous interpretation ) in domestic economic reform and the paralyzing effect of the eurozone crisis will lead to a massive shock . Remaining in a currency union with the much more competitive German economy will require wrenching and rapid reforms , for which Hollande's tepid approach will fail to prepare the complacent French . The result will be even more support than was seen in last April's presidential election for extremist political parties that reject both Europe and competitive market capitalism ."	0

This is preserved intact . His mother , Mary Arden , was one of the daughters of Robert Arden , a yeoman farmer of Wilmcote : his father , John Shakespeare , was a glover and wool dealer of good standing who held the office of Bailiff of the Borough in 1568 . From the age of seven to about 14 , he attended Stratford Grammar School receiving an excellent well rounded education . At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway , who was seven years his senior and three months pregnant . She was of ' yeoman ' stock - her family owned a farm one mile west of Stratford in Shottery . He endured her until he could stand it no longer and fled to London to become an actor . He then became actor-manager and part-owner in the Blackfriars and afterwards the Globe Theatres . He was a first-rate actor , but it is as a writer of plays that he has achieved lasting world-wide fame . His plays are thought to be the finest ever written in any language . His 37 plays vary in type ; historical romances , light , fantastic comedies , some are tragedies , all including the comical and the farcical . He was a shrewd business man , amassing quite a fortune in his time . He returned to Stratford for his latter years where he died at the age of 52 and now lies at rest in his special grave at Holy Trinity Church .

1450	Orpheus Gustave Moreau drew much attention when he painted Orpheus in 1865 . The intriguing composition regards the famous Greek legend of Orpheus , a poet and musician so talented that he was believed to be able to charm beasts into submission . Moreau , known for his wild imagination , created a unique ending to the myth , and depicted it on canvas . The story goes that when Orpheus charmed the maenads , ( seductive female followers of the god of wine ) , and then refused their advances , they tore him apart and threw his head and lyre into a nearby stream . While most artists chose to paint the horrific events of the raging women murdering Orpheus , Gustave Moreau opted to depict his personal idea of what happened after the tragic slaying . He includes a young girl dressed in delicate oriental garments who , after having salvaged Orpheuss decapitated head and lyre from the stream , lovingly stares at it with a sad facial expression that could signify regret or pity . The similarity of the two faces not only captivates viewers with its eeriness , but it also has them questioning the artists intention . This likeness may be symbolic in nature , but Moreau offers no explanation and leaves its interpretation to the onlookers imagination . The paintings sombre background is meticulously detailed , and harmonizes with the mystical mood of the painting . The composition is diagonally in sync ; the musicians at the top left of the canvas are balanced by the two turtles at the bottom right . Analysis With respect to Gustave Moreaus style , the Musee dOrsays website states : In Orpheus , we sense the emergence of a semi-fantastic world with disturbing atmospheres , impregnated with ambiguous charms . The golden chiaroscuro , complex composition and sensual yet mystic mood that characterised Moreau's mature style about 1870 are already in place here . For all these reasons , Moreau counts as a decisive figure in the Symbolist movement . Musee dOrsay	4
1397	FARMINGTON , Conn. – The number of smartphone shipments to rise from 700 million in 2012 to 1.37 billion by the end of 2017 . Apple's iOS and Google's Android will continue to dominate the market with a combined market share of 81.7 % of smartphone shipments in 2017 , up from 78 % in 2012 . Unlike OS market share , handset vendor market share will be volatile during the forecast period . Smartphone vendors can be removed from the top share positions in less than a year ( for example , HTC and RIM in 2011 ) , because the market evolves extremely fast and competition is fierce . Operators should resist the temptation to develop their own smartphone platform . A bad track record in software and content distribution and a lack of hardware design and capabilities are major pitfalls for any operator-controlled smartphone platform . Executives seeking detailed market research on global smartphone markets and spectrum valuation will benefit from the two reports previewed below . Retaining established smartphone users is as important as capturing new ones . 75 % of worldwide smartphone shipments will correspond to handset upgrades in 2017 ( see Figure 1 ) . This will create a significant strategy shift for stakeholders . Operators will have to increase the value of smartphone contracts by offering early handset upgrades and larger data allowances to retain customers , and handset vendors will have to develop stronger app and content ecosystems ( as Apple has done ) in order to increase loyalty . The addressable market represented by multi-device ecosystems is still relatively small , but will grow significantly in the next 5 years . Operators should embrace those ecosystems in the following ways : 1 ) Offer multi-device data plans so that consumers can add mobile connectivity to their personal ' device pool ' ; 2 ) Adopt and promote inter-device connectivity technologies specific to each ecosystem in mobile broadband routers and IPTV set-top boxes ; and 3 ) Open access to content distribution channels dedicated to each multi - device ecosystem and facilitate the transfer of content between the devices . When mobile network operators roll out a new network , they typically start with an evenly spaced layer of coverage sites . As more customers join the network , the traffic that the network needs to carry increases depending on the location of users , so that individual sites may become more overloaded than others . When this happens , operators ' split ' the busy site by building a new capacity site near it that can absorb the excess traffic . Like the population of a country , mobile traffic is distributed unevenly between rural and urban areas . Because of the uneven distribution of traffic , the prices operators are likely to pay for each additional capacity band is likely to decrease . This is because the number of sites on which an operator can usefully employ additional capacity bands reduces with each additional capacity band . In order to remedy this , the operator can either split the forty sites , or could acquire additional capacity in new higher frequency bands in order to add capacity to established sites . According to the report , operators derive commercial and strategic value from holding additional spectrum .	0
1449	"Sometimes it 's easy to overlook that your distribution center is called upon to operate as a two-way street : Product heads out in one direction , but it also can shift into reverse and come back to you . One of the biggest problems with this boomerang effect is the time it takes for distribution centers to figure out what to do with returned goods . After all , the primary goal is to get goods out of the door . Hence , reverse logistics . As fast as you can ship out a product , it can be headed right back to you . The better prepared you are to handle such situations , the more smoothly your distribution center will function . The fact that many businesses are willing to pay someone else to take care of this tells you it 's a valuable service . And if someone 's willing to pay an outsider to come in and do it , why not do it yourself and save the money ? Time is the single greatest enemy to handling reverse logistics . Processes grind to a halt and distribution center employees are forced to research and make decisions for each item or product that comes back in your door . There 's a two-step solution for this : Identify the categories / reasons for return , and There are seven core reasons for returns : manufacturing problem service problem recalls end-of-life obsolete end-of-use problem under warranty Once you 've determined the core cause for return , it 's easier to drop it into one of six "" asset recovery disposition "" buckets : restock to resell refurbish destroy repackage to resell sell to secondary market , and return to manufacturer . Once your distribution center has developed working criteria for each disposition , it 's much easier for any staffer to handle returns . You 'll save time , decrease frustration , and get returned goods on the way to where they 're supposed to be . One Response to "" 7 ways inventory comes back to bite you "" Because it 's cheaper , and doing it yourself DOES N'T save money . Like everyone else , we have been feeling the crunch of the economy , and we were surprised to find out that using a third party logistics company saves dollars and increases reliability . The truth is that if your companies specialty is n't warehousing and transportation , it is cheaper to allow someone handle it that specializes in that field . They do it more efficiently and reliably . The bottom line is that if a company has years of experience handling this task for many different types of companies , they bring a lot more experience and lessons learned to the table . We have started using a company called Ceva Logistics , that has literally saved our company and our jobs . And there are several other companies that perform similar duties ."	2

1474	at health Pet owners who are health conscious may be wondering if a cat health remedy is necessary for their pet . In this article , you will learn why a daily remedy is important for good health and what to look for in a quality supplement . Prevention becomes even more important when you realize how the quality of our food , water and environment have changed over the past fifty years . For instance , the environment is more polluted than at any other time in history . Food is less nutrient-rich because it is grown in over-farmed , mineral deficient soil . It is also sprayed with pesticides . Water is treated by the city water treatment plant and is full of chemicals . These toxins adversely affect humans and they have the same effect on our beloved pets who did nothing to contribute to the mess that we are in . So let 's talk about what to look for in a good supplement because there are many on the market and some are better than others . The formulation that I recommend has antioxidants and uses herbs that cats would normally chew on in the wild if allowed freedom to roam . These herbs include Mistletoe , Echinacea , Astralagus , Milk Thistle and of course , Cat's Claw . Together , this formulation can increase lung and heart health , build immunity , provide much-need nutrients and even fight cancer and other immune-suppressing disorders . If you choose to give your pet a daily cat health remedy , you might as well give your pet the best . In addition to giving your pet a supplement , other important ways of promoting cat health are to get a tap filter to remove all those chemicals from city water and feed your pet healthy food . Make sure to read the ingredients label to ensure that it 's not the equivalent of junk food as some commercial brands are . Watch out for dyes , chemicals and cheap grains and fillers .	7
1527	Freshness How recently an egg was laid has a bearing on its freshness but is only one of many factors . The temperature and humidity level at which the egg is held play their parts as well . These variables are so important that an egg one week old , held under ideal conditions , can be fresher than an egg left at room temperature for one day . The ideal conditions for egg storage are temperatures between 35 and 40oF ( 2o to 4oC ) and a relative humidity of 70 to 80 % . Proper handling means promptly gathering and washing the eggs within a few hours after they 've been laid . Most commercially produced eggs reach supermarkets within a few days of leaving the laying house . If you and your market handle eggs properly , they 'll still be fresh when they reach the table . It 's a misconception that you can judge freshness by placing an egg in salt water . A carefully controlled brine test is sometimes used to judge shell thickness of eggs for hatching purposes but the test has no application to freshness of table eggs . How important is freshness ? As an egg ages , the white becomes thinner , the yolk becomes flatter and the yolk membrane becomes weaker . These changes do n't have any great effect on the nutritional quality of the egg or its functional cooking properties in recipes . Appearance may be affected though . When poached or fried , the fresher the egg , the more it will hold its shape rather than spread out in the pan . However , if you hard-boil eggs that are at least a week old , you 'll find them easier to peel than fresher eggs . The stronger the yolk membrane , the less likely the yolk will break inadvertently .	7
1313	Patience is n't so much something believers receive as it is an attribute that they develop over time and through experience . Think of patience as a muscle that you have to use in order to see it build . To that end , believers should recognize difficulty as an opportunity to flex their patience . The human instinct is to cry out to God in bewilderment when tribulation comes knocking . We blame . We resist . We complain . Humanly speaking , praising the Lord for tribulation is unnatural . However , doing so begins to make sense to believers when they cling to God's promise that good comes from hardship . Accepting hardship as a means of growth is a radical concept in this world . Even more extreme is the believer who praises the Lord for the storm . But God's followers have cause to rejoice . Tribulation increases our patience so that we can stand firm on His promises and await His good timing .	0

"" The Saw - Horse would probably have paid no attention to this , but just then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground , where it lay upon its back , frantically waving its four legs in the air . Tip ran up to it . "" You 're a nice sort of a horse , I must say ! "" he exclaimed . "" Why did n't you stop when I yelled ' whoa ? ' "" "" Does ' whoa ' mean to stop ? "" asked the Saw-Horse , in a surprised voice , as it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy . "" Of course it does , "" answered Tip . "" And a hole in the ground means to stop , also , does n't it ? "" continued the horse . "" To be sure ; unless you step over it , "" said Tip . "" What a strange place this is , "" the creature exclaimed , as if amazed . "" What am I doing here , anyway ? "" 52 Full page line-art drawing . "" DO KEEP THOSE LEGS STILL . "" 53 "" Why , I 've brought you to life , "" answered the boy "" but it wo n't hurt you any , if you mind me and do as I tell you . "" "" Then I will do as you tell me , "" replied the Saw-Horse , humbly . "" But what happened to me , a moment ago ? I do n't seem to be just right , someway . "" "" You 're upside down , "" explained Tip . "" But just keep those legs still a minute and I 'll set you right side up again . "" "" How many sides have I ? "" asked the creature , wonderingly . "" Several , "" said Tip , briefly . "" But do keep those legs still . "" The Saw-Horse now became quiet , and held its legs rigid ; so that Tip , after several efforts , was able to roll him over and set him upright . "" Ah , I seem all right now , "" said the queer animal , with a sigh . "" One of your ears is broken , "" Tip announced , after a careful examination . "" I 'll have to make a new one . "" Then he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to regain his feet , and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright Tip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horse's head . 54 "" Now , "" said he , addressing his steed , "" pay attention to what I 'm going to tell you . ' Whoa ! ' means to stop ; ' Get-Up ! ' means to walk forward ; ' Trot ! ' means to go as fast as you can . Understand ? "" "" I believe I do , "" returned the horse . "" Very good . We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City , to see His Majesty , the Scarecrow ; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back , so he wo n't wear out his joints . "" "" I do n't mind , "" said the Saw-Horse . "" Anything that suits you suits me . "" Then Tip assisted Jack to get upon the horse . "" Hold on tight , "" he cautioned , "" or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin head . "" "" That would be horrible ! "" said Jack , with a shudder . "" What shall I hold on to ? "" "" Why , hold on to his ears , "" replied Tip , after a moment's hesitation . "" Do n't do that ! "" remonstrated the Saw-Horse ; "" for then I ca n't hear . "" That seemed reasonable , so Tip tried to think of something else . "" I 'll fix it ! "" said he , at length . He went into the wood and cut a short length of limb from a young , stout tree . One end of this he sharpened to a point , and then he dug a hole in the back of 55 Full page line-art drawing . "" DOES IT HURT ? "" ASKED THE BOY 56 the Saw-Horse , just behind its head . Next he brought a piece of rock from the road and hammered the post firmly into the animal's back . "" Stop ! Stop ! "" shouted the horse ; "" you 're jarring me terribly . "" "" Does it hurt ? "" asked the boy . "" Not exactly hurt , "" answered the animal ; "" but it makes me quite nervous to be jarred . "" "" Well , it 's all over now "" said Tip , encouragingly . "" Now , Jack , be sure to hold fast to this post and then you ca n't fall off and get smashed . "" So Jack held on tight , and Tip said to the horse : "" Get up .

489	On Radio 4 's Today programme on 10 April , the Church of England Education Officer Canon John Hall argued - inaccurately - that campaigners against faith schools are proposing a ' French model ' , and made flawed claims about the church's contribution to the development of education . There are , of course , legitimate arguments to be made on both sides of the faith schools debate , but the BHA calls on Canon John Hall to stop muddying the water with false claims . ' The nation's children deserve a higher standard of debate on the expansion of faith schools . ' said Hanne Stinson , BHA executive director , ' Their future depends on it . ' The French secularist model Canon John Hall , on the Today programme , said : ' The sort of knee-jerk reaction answer to ' how do you educate for life in a diverse multi-cultural society ? ' by some people is that you leave faith outside the door , that you teach about religion but you certainly do n't teach religion . Now frankly , that 's the sort of French secularist model . ' The Canon is entirely incorrect in his assessment of the French system , and his criticism of humanist ( and also religious ) campaigners' approach to issues of religion and schools is similarly flawed . It is wrong to label as supporters of a French-type system those who call for inclusive community schools that accommodate those of all beliefs instead of religiously segregated schools . The French ignore religion ; faith schools evangelise about it . The middle road is objective , fair and balanced teaching about religions and non-religious beliefs that does not set out to persuade but to educate . This is what the BHA has long advocated and set as policy . This approach also has the support of many religious people - the Christian think tank Ekklesia , for example , has criticised John Hall's comments ( click here ) History of church schools Canon John Hall said : ' Of course , the churches founded the educational system - and 4700 schools are Church of England , another two and a half thousand are Catholic - so 7000 - there they are - and they 've been there since well before the state started doing anything . ' Clearly the only sensible approach to take to the debate over faith schools and academies today is to look at current circumstances . Because the Church of England in particular , however , has made great play of the longstanding involvement of the church in education as a defence of its continued involvement , we feel that the glowing narrative of church school history must be challenged . Most of today's church schools as institutions and the great majority as buildings were in fact created with public money . Since 1944 the church has contributed nothing to either running or building costs of voluntary-controlled schools and nothing to running costs and now only ( at most ) 10 % to building costs of voluntary-aided schools - but nothing , under recent government policies , to the current programme of rebuilding of secondary schools . The church in fact is the recipient of huge state aid , as are and will be the other religious groups as they gain their own faith schools . The church actually opposed state involvement in schools throughout the 19th century until it was finally forced to compromise in 1870 . When in 1798 Joseph Lancaster opened the first monitorial school in Southwark it aroused antagonism from the Church of England for its offering of non-sectarian education . In 1808 Bishops in the House of Lords opposed a Bill proposing a measure of free education . Small Government grants were introduced in the 1830s but when in 1839 the government proposed that the grants be conditional on inspection of schools and proposed also the formation of a non-sectarian State normal school for training of teachers , it was strongly opposed by the Church of England . The Church also defended its right to impose Anglican education on all by opposing bitterly the minimal conscience clause suggested by the government and sought by non-conformists , The introduction of a system of publicly funded education in 1870 was bitterly contested by the churches , who secured an interval to create new schools before the local school boards were allowed to start their own . In 1876 Joseph Chamberlain said that the Church party were trying everywhere ' to stunt the programme of the board school system , to prevent the erection of new schools and the provision of sufficient accommodation , to prevent the reduction of the cost of education [ ie school fees ] to the parents and to prevent the expenditure necessary to secure the efficiency of the schools ' . A notably sympathetic history , Church and State in English Education by Marjorie Cruickshank , states that ' Attempts to secure State intervention were baulked for many years by religious antagonisms . ' Brian Gates , in Faith Schools - Consensus or Conflict ? , says , ' Arguably , it was the tussling between [ the Anglican National Society and the non-conformist British and Foreign Schools Society ] that delayed the introduction of a fully comprehensive school system funded by public taxation . ' So the Churches have nothing to be proud of in their pre-1870 record . Rather , they held back education in England and Wales so that our position was notably worse than that of most of Europe and way behind that in Scotland , largely because of the religious beggar-my-neighbour opposition to any state intervention in schools .

You can read it and about it here and about the BHA's views on the Government's Education and Inspections Bill here We welcome the current renewed interest in faith schools , stimulated by the threats posed by the Government's Education Bill , and by the concerns of teachers , expressed through their unions , in the current conference season .	0

In the early days of Christianity boxes were placed in Churches for charities and opened on Christmas day . The contents were then distributed to the needy by the priests the following day . Also heads of houses gave gifts to those who worked for them on the day after Christmas . So yesterday , we gave to those we love , today , Boxing day ... we give to , and pray for those who are in need .	0

1358	"TV Licensing : A Picture Paints A Thousand Words Jimmy Savile committed vile sexual abuse of children when he was on the payroll and property of the BBC . That much is completely beyond dispute . BBC employees , who knew all about Savile's crimes , turned a blind eye as he molested some of Britain's most vulnerable children in his BBC Television Centre dressing room . Today the BBC's Director General , George Entwistle , who described Savile as a "" skillful and successful sexual predator "" , admitted that the Corporation was currently investigating up to 10 serious allegations involving past and present employees over the "" Savile period "" . A subsequent BBC statement clarified that the Corporation was "" aware of nine allegations of sexual harassment , assault or inappropriate conduct regarding current staff or contributors "" .

1157	"Drug abuse has always been a very delicate question as it always it deals with the health , well-being and even lives of human beings belonging to any country . The position of the United States of America towards drugs has always been very clear and distinctively negative . Throughout the history of the country there were numerous cases against drug dealers , buyers and many more . These cases did always catch the attention of civil people who by showing interest in such cases revealed their worries about the future of their own children that one-day might face this problem , too . As time goes by it get even more clear that people need to feel protection from the side of law-enforcement establishments such as police . Drugs may destroy the life of a person , therefore while fighting with drug dealers and buyers cooperatives no other interest rather than removing this "" elements "" from the society should be taken into account . The case , which is known as "" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative "" did more than just catch the attention of people . Million of people followed the case from its very beginning and did have certain expectations concerning the outcome of the case . The specifics of the case made people have twofold points of view when analyzing the solution that was delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas concerning the case . Nevertheless , to understand the solution it is necessary to examine the case deeper and only then decide whether the Court's decision is really twofold , ambiguous or completely justified . 2 . Main points of the case . Summarizing the main point in the opinion of the case it is necessary to start from its very beginning . The case was argued on the 28th of March 2001 and the decision was delivered on the 14th of May 2001 . It was argued intensively and both of the sides were acted rather confident . The Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative with Jeffrey Jones as a head started its life according to California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996 and was started to follow medical purposes of distributing marijuana to people that in accordance with their state of health qualify for it as a treatment . This organization spent two years distributing marijuana to "" qualified patients "" until the year of 1998 , when it was sued by USA . The main point of the argument was that USA's government charge of Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative breach of the Controlled Substances Act's and mainly its "" embargo "" for distributing , manufacturing , and possessing of the substance , as far as marijuana is listed in the Controlled Substances Act . The activity of the Cooperative continued in spite of the District's Court decision and its activity was very intense . The key issue presented by the Cooperative was its medical necessity defense , other words they stated that all the marijuana that was distributed by means of their organization was only distributed according to the medical necessity of this substance by qualified patients . As it has been already mentioned the District Court made an injunction concerning the activity of the organization and the following consideration of the case lead to the Court of Appeal . According to the Court of Appeal all the "" medically necessary distributions were to be permitted "" . So the reason the United Stated of America charged the organization is for the violation of the policy concerning the distribution and manufacturing of the substance . On the other side the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative cited the medical necessity defense which was approved the Court of Appeal and lately made the District Court change its injunction concerning the activity of the cooperative . 2a . The main argument of USA suing the Cooperative . The United States of America on its side presented a tremendously weighty argument that deals with the law of the country in the first place . The mentioned above Controlled Substances Act is a certain prohibition concerning narcotics , which has been made by experts and considered to be a law . Ordinarily , there is no exception from the law that already exists ; it is similar to the situation when the fact of not knowing a certain law does not release from the responsibility for its violation . The argument of the case was related to the possibility to make an exception concerning the Controlled Substances Act prohibitions . Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative implied that marijuana is medically necessary for a definite group of people and the USA's government considered this to be a violation the Controlled Substances Act . The "" degree "" of marijuana's necessity in medical purposes was point that caused the majority of the questions throughout the case . The Court was supposed to "" solve the problem "" and announce its verdict . 3 . The Court's decision . "" The statute reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception ; medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana , "" – these words of Justice Clarence Thomas clearly reveal the decision of the Court . The "" degree "" of medical necessity of marijuana was decided not to be enough to make an exception in the Controlled Substances Act and therefore sell it to people , who may medically require it . Manufacturing of marijuana as a fact in the activity of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Cooperative and therefore its possibility to distribute marijuana to the citizens of the country was concluded to be weightier than marijuana's medical treatment characteristics . Therefore the Court confirmed USA's position of the impossibility to make violate the prohibitions of the Controlled Substances Act . The opinion of the Court basically reflected the next – no distribution should be justified even by medical necessity and no defense should be given to such distributors . The possibility to make an exception was reviewed in four medical cases : "" The foregoing injunction does not apply to the distribution of cannabis by the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative and Jeffrey Jones to patient-members who ( 1 ) suffer from a serious medical condition , ( 2 ) will suffer imminent harm if the patient-member does not have access to cannabis , ( 3 ) need cannabis for the treatment of the patient-member's medical condition , or need cannabis to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition , and ( 4 ) have no reasonable legal alternative to cannabis for the effective treatment or alleviation of the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition because the patient-member has tried all other legal alternatives to cannabis and the alternatives have been ineffective in treating or alleviating the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition , or the alternatives result in side effects which the patient-member can not reasonably tolerate . "" This "" critical exception "" by itself caused a lot of arguments and undermined the steadfastness of the Controlled Substances Act . Nevertheless , the decision of the case remained unflinching and by this produced a lot of opposition . 4 . Various aspects of the case . The decision of the court is obviously twofold and makes every person think deeply before expression any kind of opinions . People who really do suffer from hard diseases and may require marijuana might experience certain difficulties and probable complications in their health state . Therefore hospitals , which previously primarily had to deal with people belonging to this group , find themselves in the situation of inability to help their patients . They need to find more high-priced medicaments for the patient's treatment , which may hit hard the budget of the hospital and of the patient . This definite case is very complicated due to its connection to the most valuable thing – the life and health of a human being . This ambiguous case may require new statutes or constitutional amendments , due to the statutory ambiguity according to the opinion of some people . Nevertheless , this ambiguity is rather questionable and the Controlled Substances Act points it rather clearly . It seems that it is better to find a medical substitute of marijuana , which is easier to do nowadays when medicine keeps providing new innovative medicaments , than it was for instance , 30 years ago . And maybe this is one of the primary reasons the Controlled Substance Act becomes so restrictive . It is obvious that it was designed in order to protect the health of the citizens of the country from drug-dependence and therefore any statement claiming that it will kill people has no base under itself . It was a case of health v. health , and the only difference was that the Controlled Substance Act protected million of potential dope fiends and the cooperative defended a certain group of people who may find an alternative medical treatment . So , the Court's decision remains the same : "" ... there is no medical necessity exception to the prohibitions at issue , even when the patient is "" seriously ill "" and lacks alternative avenues for relief "" . Conclusion . Is marijuana that advisable after all ? This was the main question that the Court answered by its decision . It is obvious that this case did touch certain moral issues , as the case was about the health of human beings . Analyzing the destructive influence of marijuana in general it is necessary to remember that marijuana does more harm than it does good . Therefore , would not it be the main question to stop the outcry against the policy . A narcotic will always remain a narcotic ; even the famous genius Sigmund Fried went through this trying to treat people . Why should we do it ? Let us put the health of the nation ahead of everything ."	0
653	"Imogen Heap is best known for her ethereal voice and the ability to mix electronica , rock and pop . Here , she speaks with Megan M. Retka about her record company woes and having her bed set on fire ... MR : You 've had quite a formal musical history . You were trained as a classical pianist ? IH : First things first , was the piano . We had a piano at my parent's house in Essex , and I think as a kid you 'd obviously want to make noise on something , and thing that would make the most noise in my house was the piano . So , I used to play the piano very badly from as soon as I could reach [ it ] , and I do n't remember going to my first lesson . As far as I know , I 've always played the piano . And obviously I did n't at some point because I was , like , a baby , but I 've always felt like I 've played it . I guess , as a kid , I would just hear sounds and try and imitate them , and gradually as I became conscious that I was actually playing a piano and I wanted to learn more , that 's when my parents tried to get me lessons . I wanted to get lessons even before my feet would reach the pedal , [ but ] I could n't have my first lesson until my foot would reach the pedal . Luckily , I got there quicker than most because I 'm quite tall . So , I learned classically . I did all my lessons and I did my grades on the piano , and I learned about theory as well . Then , as I became a bit older , maybe about eight , I started learning cello . Well , actually I started learning the violin , but I hated the violin . You have to spend hours and hours rehearsing to get even a decent sound out of the violin , but luckily with the cello , it looks great instantly . Yeah , it 's not quite [ such a ] jarring , screechy noise . By this point , I kind of decided I wanted to be a composer . I wanted to compose and conduct orchestras and play pianos for orchestras and write for film - things like that . That was my plan as a kid . And then I thought , well if I learn a string instrument and a percussive instrument , then I need to learn a woodwind , so then I learned the clarinet . I tried to go one stage further and learn the trumpet , but that was n't to be . I stopped at brass . I really enjoyed writing and composing for instruments and the orchestra , and as a kid that was about the only subject that I really , you know , spend time on the homework and actually get excited about a string quartet . I think the other reason is , maybe partly , is that when I was a kid , I realised that the more instruments I played , the more academic lessons I could get out of . So , that was quite cool . Later , when I was about twelve , I went to a boarding school . The music school there , was really really amazing . They had loads of pianos - they had 24 pianos . I guess they really thought that people in the school would want to play the piano if they 've got all those hours to wile away after lessons . Of course , I was in there every night playing the piano , and soon realised that Mr. Dodge , was his name , had a toy room where he had a computer - an old Mac Classic . You could write notes and things like that on this program he had called Notator . I kind of realised that quite early on and was like , "" Hmm . I really want to get into that . "" But he said , "" Well , you ca n't really use that until a bit later . "" So , when it came to doing GCSEs , I then learned about this computer . I was thirteen when I did my GSCEs , because I was always a year ahead . I start using this gear when I was about thirteen . I did n't get on with my music master at all . It was just me and him in GCSE class . Just me and him . In a quiet , eerie room , pencils scribbling - it 's all very eerie . So , I 'd get there and talk to him , and after about five seconds we 'd be at each other 's throats arguing with each other - I was a bit of a rebel - so he was like , "" Ok . I 've had about enough of you . Go into that room and make some music . "" So , I 'd basically have an hour , three times a week , to read this massive manual of this computer , to figure out how to use it . As soon as I realised that I could do this with this computer - create like a whole orchestra without having to actually have an orchestra - I was hooked . From the beginning . That 's when my love of programming started . Throughout the years I just got better and better at it .

1454	Military Provisioning Guardian 6 Recommendations . 1 : Increasing long-term federal investment in high-technology industries , particularly those involving advanced research and manufacturing capabilities . The distinguishing attribute of the U.S. defense industrial base is technological innovation . As foreign nations continue manufac ¬ turing an ever-larger share of America's defense supplies , the United States increases its risk of diminishing its capacity to design and commercialize emerging defense technologies . To help ensure that our armed forces dominate the future battlefield , Congress should provide funding for American manufacturers to develop and implement advanced process technologies . 2 : Properly applying and enforcing existing laws and regulations to support the U.S. defense industrial base . Domestic source preferences already enacted into law , such as those that apply to the steel and titanium industries under the Specialty Metals Clause , must be retained to ensure that important defense capabilities remain secure and available for the U.S. armed forces . 3 : Developing domestic sources of key natural resources required by our armed forces . Right now the United States relies far too heavily on foreign nations for certain key metals and other raw materials needed to manufacture weapons systems and other military supplies . For example , most rare earth elements , which are essential components of many modern military technologies , currently must be purchased from China . The U.S. government and industry must stockpile these vital raw materials , strengthen efforts to resume mining and transformation of the materials in the United States , improve recycling to make more efficient use of current supplies , and identify alternate materials . 4 : Developing plans to strengthen our defense industrial base in the U.S. National Military Strategy , National Security Strategy , and the Quadrennial Defense Review process . This would make creating and sustaining a healthier defense industrial base a higher national priority , with a focus on increasing support for the most important and vulnerable industrial sectors . 8 : Crafting legislation to support a broadly representative defense industrial base strategy . Congress and the Administration must collaborate on economic and fiscal policies that budget for enduring national security capabilities and sustain the industrial base necessary to support them . 9 : Modernizing and securing defense supply chains through networked operations . These operations should be built on the excellent work that the DOD and industry are already doing to map and secure defense supply chains . The operations would provide ongoing communications between prime contractors and the supply chains they depend on . Closer communications , patterned on the networked operations of U.S. military forces around the world , would help managers identify and solve recurring problems with military supplies . 10 : Identifying potential defense supply chain chokepoints and planning to prevent disruptions . This recommendation would require determining the scope of foreign control over critical military supply chains and finding ways of restoring U.S. control . Subscribe Now !	7
932	"Chapter indexed HTML of Villette , the novel by Charlotte Bronte ebooks of essential English literature free to read online sponsored external link to Lighting site II - Paulina Some days elapsed , and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in the house . She was not exactly naughty or wilful : she was far from disobedient ; but an object less conducive to comfort--to tranquillity even--than she presented , it was scarcely possible to have before one's eyes . She moped : no grown person could have performed that uncheering business better ; no furrowed face of adult exile , longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes , ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage . She seemed growing old and unearthly . I , Lucy Snowe , plead guiltless of that curse , an overheated and discursive imagination ; but whenever , opening a room-door , I found her seated in a corner alone , her head in her pigmy hand , that room seemed to me not inhabited , but haunted . And again , when of moonlight nights , on waking , I beheld her figure , white and conspicuous in its night-dress , kneeling upright in bed , and praying like some Catholic or Methodist enthusiast--some precocious fanatic or untimely saint--I scarcely know what thoughts I had ; but they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy than that child's mind must have been . I seldom caught a word of her prayers , for they were whispered low : sometimes , indeed , they were not whispered at all , but put up unuttered ; such rare sentences as reached my ear still bore the burden , "" Papa ; my dear papa ! "" This , I perceived , was a one-idea 'd nature ; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have ever thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed . What might have been the end of this fretting , had it continued unchecked , can only be conjectured : it received , however , a sudden turn . One afternoon , Mrs. Bretton , coaxing her from her usual station in a corner , had lifted her into the window-seat , and , by way of occupying her attention , told her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the street in a given time . She had sat listlessly , hardly looking , and not counting , when--my eye being fixed on hers--I witnessed in its iris and pupil a startling transfiguration . These sudden , dangerous natures--_sensitive_ as they are called--offer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler temperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries . The fixed and heavy gaze swum , trembled , then glittered in fire ; the small , overcast brow cleared ; the trivial and dejected features lit up ; the sad countenance vanished , and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness , an intense expectancy . "" It _is_ ! "" were her words . Like a bird or a shaft , or any other swift thing , she was gone from the room , How she got the house-door open I can not tell ; probably it might be ajar ; perhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest , which would be impetuous enough . I--watching calmly from the window -- saw her , in her black frock and tiny braided apron ( to pinafores she had an antipathy ) , dart half the length of the street ; and , as I was on the point of turning , and quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child was run out mad , and ought instantly to be pursued , I saw her caught up , and rapt at once from my cool observation , and from the wondering stare of the passengers . A gentleman had done this good turn , and now , covering her with his cloak , advanced to restore her to the house whence he had seen her issue . I concluded he would leave her in a servant's charge and withdraw ; but he entered : having tarried a little while below , he came up-stairs . His reception immediately explained that he was known to Mrs. Bretton . She recognised him ; she greeted him , and yet she was fluttered , surprised , taken unawares . Her look and manner were even expostulatory ; and in reply to these , rather than her words , he said , -- "" I could not help it , madam : I found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled . "" "" But you will unsettle her . "" "" I hope not . And how is papa's little Polly ? "" This question he addressed to Paulina , as he sat down and placed her gently on the ground before him . "" How is Polly's papa ? "" was the reply , as she leaned on his knee , and gazed up into his face . It was not a noisy , not a wordy scene : for that I was thankful ; but it was a scene of feeling too brimful , and which , because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow , only oppressed one the more . On all occasions of vehement , unrestrained expansion , a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary spectator's relief ; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will , a giant slave under the sway of good sense . Mr. Home was a stern-featured--perhaps I should rather say , a hard - featured man : his forehead was knotty , and his cheekbones were marked and prominent . The character of his face was quite Scotch ; but there was feeling in his eye , and emotion in his now agitated countenance . His northern accent in speaking harmonised with his physiognomy . He was at once proud-looking and homely-looking . He laid his hand on the child's uplifted head . She said -- "" Kiss Polly . "" He kissed her . I wished she would utter some hysterical cry , so that I might get relief and be at ease . She made wonderfully little noise : she seemed to have got what she wanted--_all_ she wanted , and to be in a trance of content . Neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire , and yet she was of his strain : her mind had been filled from his , as the cup from the flagon . Indisputably , Mr. Home owned manly self-control , however he might secretly feel on some matters . "" Polly , "" he said , looking down on his little girl , "" go into the hall ; you will see papa's great-coat lying on a chair ; put your hand into the pockets , you will find a pocket - handkerchief there ; bring it to me . "" She obeyed ; went and returned deftly and nimbly . He was talking to Mrs. Bretton when she came back , and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand . It was a picture , in its way , to see her , with her tiny stature , and trim , neat shape , standing at his knee . Seeing that he continued to talk , apparently unconscious of her return , she took his hand , opened the unresisting fingers , insinuated into them the handkerchief , and closed them upon it one by one . He still seemed not to see or to feel her ; but by-and-by , he lifted her to his knee ; she nestled against him , and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour following , I suppose both were satisfied . During tea , the minute thing's movements and behaviour gave , as usual , full occupation to the eye . First she directed Warren , as he placed the chairs . "" Put papa's chair here , and mine near it , between papa and Mrs. Bretton : _I_ must hand his tea . "" She took her own seat , and beckoned with her hand to her father . "" Be near me , as if we were at home , papa . "" And again , as she intercepted his cup in passing , and would stir the sugar , and put in the cream herself , "" I always did it for you at home ; papa : nobody could do it as well , not even your own self . "" Throughout the meal she continued her attentions : rather absurd they were . The sugar-tongs were too wide for one of her hands , and she had to use both in wielding them ; the weight of the silver cream-ewer , the bread-and-butter plates , the very cup and saucer , tasked her insufficient strength and dexterity ; but she would lift this , hand that , and luckily contrived through it all to break nothing . Candidly speaking , I thought her a little busy-body ; but her father , blind like other parents , seemed perfectly content to let her wait on him , and even wonderfully soothed by her offices . "" She is my comfort ! "" he could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton . That lady had her own "" comfort "" and nonpareil on a much larger scale , and , for the moment , absent ; so she sympathised with his foible . This second "" comfort "" came on the stage in the course of the evening . I knew this day had been fixed for his return , and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had been expecting him through all its hours . We were seated round the fire , after tea , when Graham joined our circle : I should rather say , broke it up--for , of course , his arrival made a bustle ; and then , as Mr. Graham was fasting , there was refreshment to be provided . He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance ; of the little girl he took no notice for a time . His meal over , and numerous questions from his mother answered , he turned from the table to the hearth . Opposite where he had placed himself was seated Mr. Home , and at his elbow , the child . When I say _child_ I use an inappropriate and undescriptive term--a term suggesting any picture rather than that of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette , that might just have fitted a good-sized doll--perched now on a high chair beside a stand , whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood , and holding in her hands a shred of a handkerchief , which she was professing to hem , and at which she bored perseveringly with a needle , that in her fingers seemed almost a skewer , pricking herself ever and anon , marking the cambric with a track of minute red dots ; occasionally starting when the perverse weapon--swerving from her control--inflicted a deeper stab than usual ; but still silent , diligent , absorbed , womanly . Graham was at that time a handsome , faithless-looking youth of sixteen . I say faithless-looking , not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition , but because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair , Celtic ( not Saxon ) character of his good looks ; his waved light auburn hair , his supple symmetry , his smile frequent , and destitute neither of fascination nor of subtlety ( in no bad sense ) . A spoiled , whimsical boy he was in those days . "" Mother , "" he said , after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for some time , and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room relieved him from the half-laughing bashfulness , which was all he knew of timidity --- "" Mother , I see a young lady in the present society to whom I have not been introduced . "" "" Mr. Home's little girl , I suppose you mean , "" said his mother . "" Indeed , ma ' am , "" replied her son , "" I consider your expression of the least ceremonious : Miss Home _I_ should certainly have said , in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude . "" "" Now , Graham , I will not have that child teased . Do n't flatter yourself that I shall suffer you to make her your butt . "" "" Miss Home , "" pursued Graham , undeterred by his mother's remonstrance , "" might I have the honour to introduce myself , since no one else seems willing to render you and me that service ? Your slave , John Graham Bretton . "" She looked at him ; he rose and bowed quite gravely . She deliberately put down thimble , scissors , work ; descended with precaution from her perch , and curtsying with unspeakable seriousness , said , "" How do you do ? "" "" I have the honour to be in fair health , only in some measure fatigued with a hurried journey . I hope , ma ' am , I see you well ? "" "" Tor-rer-ably well , "" was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now essayed to regain her former elevation , but finding this could not be done without some climbing and straining--a sacrifice of decorum not to be thought of--and being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young gentleman , she relinquished the high chair for a low stool : towards that low stool Graham drew in his chair . "" I hope , ma ' am , the present residence , my mother's house , appears to you a convenient place of abode ? "" "" Not par-tic-er-er-ly ; I want to go home . "" "" A natural and laudable desire , ma ' am ; but one which , notwithstanding , I shall do my best to oppose . I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that precious commodity called amusement , which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail to yield me . "" "" I shall have to go with papa soon : I shall not stay long at your mother's . "" "" Yes , yes ; you will stay with me , I am sure . I have a pony on which you shall ride , and no end of books with pictures to show you . "" "" Are _you_ going to live here now ? "" "" I am . Does that please you ? Do you like me ? "" "" No. "" "" Why ? "" "" I think you queer . "" "" My face , ma ' am ? "" "" Your face and all about you : You have long red hair . "" "" Auburn hair , if you please : mamma , calls it auburn , or golden , and so do all her friends . But even with my ' long red hair ' "" ( and he waved his mane with a sort of triumph--tawny he himself well knew that it was , and he was proud of the leonine hue ) , "" I can not possibly be queerer than is your ladyship . "" "" You call me queer ? "" "" Certainly . "" ( After a pause ) , "" I think I shall go to bed . "" "" A little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since ; but you probably sat up in the expectation of seeing me ? "" "" No , indeed . "" "" You certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society . You knew I was coming home , and would wait to have a look at me . "" "" I sat up for papa , and not for you . "" "" Very good , Miss Home . I am going to be a favourite : preferred before papa soon , I daresay . "" She wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night ; she seemed hesitating whether Graham's deserts entitled him to the same attention , when he caught her up with one hand , and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head . She saw herself thus lifted up on high , in the glass over the fireplace . The suddenness , the freedom , the disrespect of the action were too much . "" For shame , Mr. Graham ! "" was her indignant cry , "" put me down ! "" -- and when again on her feet , "" I wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in that way , lifting you with my hand "" ( raising that mighty member ) "" as Warren lifts the little cat . "" So saying , she departed ."	6
315	The 2006 Annual Exhibition took place on 11th November and proved to be another very successful event with a good turnout of members and guests . As this year has been an exceptional one for migrants it was not surprising that many exhibits displayed specimens of rare migrants , and several moth species new to Britain . As an experiment this year , and in response to requests made in the questionnaire circulated last year , Pemberley Books were invited to have a book stand at the exhibition , and it is hoped that this was a financial success for them . No doubt the BENHS Council will consider whether to repeat this venture in future years . In past years trading has been limited to the Society's own publications plus those of the London Natural History Society , and the Royal Entomological Society , with whom we have strong links . Around 40 people stayed to enjoy an excellent evening meal at Imperial College , a fitting end to a most enjoyable exhibition . The date of the 2007 exhibition will be posted to this site as soon as the booking has been made and confirmed . It is likely to be held on Saturday 10th November 2007 at Imperial College . Hope to see you there .	5
1448	Harvesting and Storing Herbs HARVESTING YOUR HERBS Harvesting herbs will promote new growth , so is to be encouraged . There are a few rules to ensure you get the best harvest possible : Always harvest from clean healthy plant material Flowering herbs are in their peak condition just before flowering so pick then , unless it 's the flowers you want Try and harvest herbs in the morning on a dry day and after the dew has done Annual herbs such as Coriander , Basil can usually be harvested two or three times in a season Perennial Herbs such as Rosemary , Sage after the first year can be harvested throughout the year Flowers for drying are usually picked in bud When harvesting roots it is not necessary to destroy the whole plant , just cut away what you need and replant the plant . PRESERVING YOUR HERBS There are several methods for preserving and storing Herbs that can easily be carried out at home , with little if any specialist equipment . Drying Herbs Herbs can be air dried , a technique used in many countries The ideal place is dry and well ventilated , free from dust and fumes An airing cupboard , an attic or under the eaves are all good places Do NOT dry herbs in the sun as this will evaporate all the precious volatile oils A constant temperature of 20o - 32o C is ideal Speed is of the essence NOTE : If the herbs turn black or go mouldy then throw them away as the drying process has failed and the herbs are not worth keeping Oven Drying Herbs Place clean and dry roots on a baking tray and dry at 50 o – 60o C for between 2-3 hours depending upon the amount and size of herbs you are drying Microwave Drying Care has to be taken when drying herbs in a microwave Generally it takes about 1-4 minutes to dry approximately 10 sprigs of herbs , depending upon the type of herb , small leaved herbs such as thyme take less time It is very easy to overcook herbs using this method NEVER dry Sage using this method as it ignites ! Storing Dried Herbs It is better to store dried herbs in a dark cupboard as light destroys the quality of the herb The shelf life of dried herbs is generally about 12 months , if they smell musty then throw them away NOTE : There are a number of purpose made Dehydrators that can be bought for drying all types of food . Herbs dry particularly well in these Freezing Herbs Freezing is an excellent method for storing herbs as it helps retain colour , flavour and nutritional content . There are two ways to freeze herbs : Place finely chopped herbs in an ice-cube tray and top up with water . Each ice cube hold about 1 tablespoon of herbs and a teaspoon of water NOTE : Individual herb flowers , such as borage , Lavender or leaves such as mint can all be frozen in individual cubes to add flavour and interest to summer drinks HERBAL OILS & VINEGARS Herbs have been preserved in oils and vinegars for centuries . Herb Oils and Vinegars can be used in salads , sauces , dressings and marinades . Herb Oils and Vinegars can be made with some basic equipment and can look attractive if you can find some old bottles to store the oils and vinegars . Herbal Oils Loosely fill a clean glass jar ( Kilner type is best ) with the herb of your choice and fill with good quality oil – olive or sunflower Strain the contents to remove the herbs and fill clean bottles , adding a sprig of the herb for identification , although it 's best to label and date as well A variety of herbs are suitable to make oils : Basil , Rosemary , Dill , Lemon Thyme , Fennel , Sage NOTE : Care must always be taken when making herbal oils as there is a risk of Botulism – a rare but serious form of food poisoning . If the herbs look mouldy in the oil , throw it away and start again . Herbal Vinegars Made in much the same way as the oils . It is best to first slightly crush the herbs before placing in the clean jar Never use a jar with a metal lid , as the vinegar will corrode the lid and this will taint the contents After two weeks , strain the herbs and place the vinegar in clean bottles , with a sprig of herb for identification	7
0	"BMW's and Chinese Justice * * * * * In most places , the name "" BMW "" implies luxury and exclusivity . But in China , the brand has unwittingly found itself enmeshed in tales that illustrate the powerlessness of ordinary Chinese against the powerful and corrupt . The first scandal occurred last year , after a tractor filled with green onions scraped the side of a BMW in Harbin . The drivers of both the tractor and the metallic-silver luxury car were 45-year-old women , but any similarity between them ended there : the former was a peasant , the latter the wife of a wealthy businessman . After a confrontation between the two , the wealthy wife drove her BMW into the growing crowd of spectators on the roadside , killing the peasant woman and injuring 12 others . The case went to the local court , where the judge ruled it an "" accidental traffic disturbance "" and gave the driver a two-year suspended sentence . The judge's ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her because her husband was related to senior provincial officials . It quickly became a story of "" rich versus poor , "" widely cited as an example of high-level corruption . Over the next few months , newspapers and television stations ran with the story as it snowballed into a national obsession . Alarmed by the public reaction , the Harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case was closed this March . The big BMW story of late 2003 resurfaced quietly , before being buried again forever . That same month , a lottery scandal threw the BMW brand into the limelight once again . Lottery officials in Shaanxi province rejected a winning ticket , calling it a fake and denying its bearer , a 17-year-old security guard named Liu Liang , the grand prize of a $ 58 , 000 BMW and 120,000 yuan ( $ 14 , 510 ) in cash . Liu became so angry about being accused of fraud and denied the car that he climbed atop a high advertising billboard and threatened to jump as a show of innocence . But the story did n't end when police officers managed to talk him down . News broadcasts covered his continued insistence that he did not forge his ticket , along with the lottery center's claims that their rejection of the ticket was legitimate . The police finally stepped in and , after a careful investigation , announced that they had found the true criminal : Yang Yongming , a private businessman whom the local lottery administration had contracted to organize ticket sales . Yang had conspired with the government officials directing the lottery , who were arrested for malfeasance , to fraudulently obtain the top prizes . In June Liu Liang finally got what he deserved - a BMW-325i sedan and a sincere apology from the lottery center . If the first scandal was a tragedy , the second was more like a farce . But both offer keys to understanding contemporary Chinese psychology . The outcry after the first BMW case was not really about the light sentence given to a rich woman , but about the lack of confidence ordinary people have in China's judicial system . In China , power , money , and connections trump the law . Even as they are becoming ever more litigious , many Chinese believe that they have no hope of securing justice against the powerful . The apathetic response of the dead peasant woman's husband to the $ 10 , 000 in compensation he received was telling . "" I do n't care about the verdict and whether it is justice or not , "" he said . The most harmful consequence is the public's loss of trust in the system . Social trust is not something you can buy with money . If an entire society believes that you can not depend on legal rights for protection - that one must instead rely on a web of relationships with those who have power and influence - questions about whether such a society is livable or desirable will remain . Similarly , in the second BMW case , people did n't blame a corrupt businessman ; they ascribed culpability to the lottery center , a government body . So instead of mistrusting one person , they grew suspicious of an institution - even of government itself . When a stubborn teenager went up against the mighty lottery authority with its army of auditors and inspectors and initial alibis , this individual , not the system , was the clear winner of the public's admiration . Liu Liang may have been just a working-class kid , but there was wisdom in his words that there is still a "" silent majority "" who can affect the workings of China's fragile society . He refused to settle privately , because he believed that if he let corrupt government officials off the hook , "" they 'll keep scamming the public . "" Thanks to his perseverance and the media's investigation , the fraud was laid bare . Power corrupts everywhere , but individuals in China such as Liu have come to form a countervailing force . Even so , such marginal forces do not yet constitute a system for redressing grievances . While pop music fans in China can listen to whatever they like , including Madonna singing "" I 'm gonna shake up the system , "" ordinary Chinese need courage to speak such messages aloud . As one saying goes , "" There is not want of conscience in Chinese , but there is want of courage . """	0

748	"What is the North East Local Biodiversity Partnership ? The North East Local Biodiversity Partnership was formed in 1996 from a wide range of statutory and voluntary agencies and individuals with a common interest in conserving biodiversity . The local authorities involved in the North East Local Biodiversity Action Partnership are Aberdeenshire Council , Aberdeen City Council and Moray Council . The government agencies , non-statutory and voluntary organisations that have an active role in the partnership are Scottish Natural Heritage , Forestry Commission , Scottish Landowners Federation , National Farmers Union of Scotland , Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , University of Aberdeen . There are also a number of individuals that contribute to the running of the North East Local Biodiversity Partnership . The aim of the partnership is to protect and enhance the local biodiversity of the area by developing and implementing the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) . A Local Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group was established to co-ordinate the production of a series of action plans for the North East of Scotland . These action plans identify a range of species , habitats and areas that are considered important locally and nationally and require action to ensure their protection . A number of these action plans can be found on this web site . The Local Biodiversity Action Plan is designed to fit into a national and international programme designed to enhance biodiversity globally . What is biodiversity ? Biodiversity , shorthand for biological diversity , can be defined as "" the variety of life , the great richness of living things in the natural world "" . Biodiversity conservation is about sustaining and using wisely the whole variety of life . The careful use of land and natural resources is one of the most important influences on the abundance and variety of animals and plants sharing our environment . What is an action plan ? An Action Plan is a working document that is used by local organisations and Local Biodiversity Action Plan Partners . Action plans layout the measures needed for the protection of habitat , species or areas in the North East area . A local action plan is designed to protect and enhance local and national priority species , habitats and areas . It is a detailed five year plan specifying the actions required to meet proposed objectives and targets . Action plans are accessible to a wide range of people , from those in lead organisations , such as Councils , to individuals with an interest in the environment . Action plans are written by volunteers with a particular research interest or knowledge of a particular species , habitat or area . Once a first draft of the action plan has been compiled a consultation process takes place by a working group of stakeholders in the plan . The plan is subsequently published , implemented and periodically reviewed . The current action plans for the North East can be found on this web site ( Click Here to View the Action Plans ) Why do we need to protect and enhance local and national priority habitat , species and areas ? We need to protect and enhance local and national priority species , habitats and areas of the North East in order to maintain the biodiversity of this area . Biodiversity is essential to our existence on this planet . Without the intricate network of biological systems , habitats and species the support systems that sustain human existence would cease to continue . It is important to realise that biodiversity is the dynamic interrelationship of living species and communities operating together to produce living habitats and ecosystems . The loss of one species can have serious knock on effects that are hard to predict . Individual losses of species or habitats are likely to precipitate further losses or at least a general decline in the biodiversity . We must conserve the variety and richness of life on earth for our own enjoyment and quality of life . We also have a moral obligation to pass on to the next generation an environment that is healthy and intact . Regrettably we have already lost many species from our countryside but we can not allow any more to reach the point of extinction . Biodiversity is the variety of life , the rich assembly of living things in the natural world . Biodiversity includes all living things and their environments , from the tiniest flying insect to the tallest tree , from open expanses of coastline to the smallest urban garden . Biodiversity is found everywhere . We are part if biodiversity and depend on it for our quality of life . Biodiversity involves everyone , it supports us , it is our vital for our survival ."	0
1220	"Smart motorways catch more than 1,000 speeding drivers a week More than 1,000 motorists a week are being caught speeding on the UK's smart motorways , police figures suggest . Last year , 52,516 fixed penalties were issued on 11 smart sections , including on stretches of the M1 , M25 and M6 . This compared to 2,023 on the same stretches in 2010-11 , before they were upgraded to smart motorways - which use the hard shoulder and variable speed limits to control traffic flow . The government says they are used to improve capacity , not generate revenue . Smart motorways are operated by Highways England , which uses overhead gantries - also containing speed cameras - to direct traffic into open lanes and change speed limits depending on the volume of traffic . There are more than 236 miles of smart motorways in England . A further 200 miles of smart motorways are currently either planned or under construction . Revenue increased The BBC's One Show asked 12 police forces in England that monitor major stretches of smart motorway , including parts of the M1 , M25 , M4 , M42 and M6 , for the total number of speeding tickets and fines collected . The majority of forces responded , with half supplying directly comparable data , showing that a total of 52,516 tickets had been issued on these stretches in 2014-15 , compared to 2,023 in 2010-11 . That meant the revenue going to central government every year increased to more than £ 1 . 1m , from £ 150 , 600 five years ago . There is just one stretch of smart motorway in Scotland - on the M9 - which saw the annual number of tickets issued increase from nine to 41 over the four years . Almost 250 people were caught speeding in the first three days after enforcement was introduced on the M4 , near Newport . The system had been introduced in 2011 but was inactive for five years . On one section of the M1 in Nottinghamshire , police issued 8,489 tickets , amounting to £ 425 , 000 of fines , in 2015 . Source : Relevant police forces Nottingham-based motoring lawyer Paul Wright said he had seen a "" deluge "" of cases along one stretch of the M1 . He told the BBC : "" A cynic might say that it 's another way of getting more and more money out of the motorist , over and above what we 're paying already . "" And it 's an easy way to extract fines from people , because once you 're clocked over the limit by the camera , it 's very difficult to fight against that . "" And the AA told The One Show "" questions need to be answered about the money being recouped "" . It has also raised safety concerns about drivers having to use emergency refuge areas when the hard shoulder is removed to operate as an extra lane . AA president Edmund King said more emergency refuges were needed and they should be twice as long , adding : "" Only a couple of weeks ago one of our members broke down on a smart motorway . There was a red ' X ' up but they still got hit from behind . "" Cut congestion With motorway traffic forecast to increase by up to 60 % from 2010 rates by 2040 , the government is pressing ahead with its £ 6bn investment in smart motorways . A spokesman for the Department for Transport said : "" Smart motorways smooth traffic flow and cut congestion for millions of motorists , with evidence from trials showing they are just as safe as regular motorways . "" Enforcement is a matter for the police and it is clear that speeding costs lives . However , we have been clear for a number of years that speed cameras should not be used to generate revenue . "" Shaun Pidcock , from Highways England - which has published advice for motorists on smart motorways - said they were "" the safest motorways on the network "" . "" We have 100 % CCTV coverage and we have people watching over them , making sure they 're safe , and we can get people in the traffic office to them far safer and quicker than we can do on normal motorways . "" For a full report , watch The One Show on BBC One , at 19 : 00 GMT on Monday 7 November ."	8

255	Thanks to Jamie Oliver our children will soon be getting more nutritious food at school , but it 's time we thought more about what we are feeding them at home and how . Author of parenting bible ' Yes , Please . Thanks ! ' Penny Palmano gives us the low down on family eating . Penny ( centre ) with children Francesca ( 16 ) , Katherine ( 19 ) and Sam ( 17 ) Not only are all our children going to end up obese with diabetes and heart problems but they will have all the social skills of a whelk unless we start to do something about it . And poor nutritional food does not only affect their health but their behaviour as well . We know most children eat far too many fast food products , pre-prepared meals , processed foods , fizzy drinks , snacks , sweets , biscuits , cakes , etc and almost all these products may contain some type of food colouring , preservative , hydrogenated fat , salt and sugar . The additives are a kind of ' food cosmetic make-over ' , disguising poor nutritional food with colour and artificial flavour to make it more attractive to children . But the increased consumption of these foods and the decline in the foods which are good for children , such as fresh vegetables , fruit , fish , meat and cheese , has sadly begun to take its toll . Hyperactivity , moodiness , obesity , long-term health problems and poor intellectual performance can all be connected to a poor diet . Sugar An excess of white sugar can change the normal biochemical ' pathways ' of both , resulting in moody , unmanageable and disruptive children who make everyone's life a misery including their own . Products made mainly from pure white flour will also convert into pure sugar in the body with the same effect . A can of a popular well-known fizzy drink contains both sugar and caffeine , combining two stimulants . If children drink a can at lunchtime the caffeine will still be in their system by the evening and we know what that means , T-R-O-U-B-L - E. These poor children will not be able to sit still at school or around the dinner table and will find it difficult to fall asleep . Help children to cut down their sugar intake by removing the sugar bowl off the table and administering it yourself ( less and less each time ) and replacing fizzy drinks with water or unsweetened fruit juice . Fats Much has been written about fats in the body . It is now widely recognised and accepted that the body does need fat and that there are good and bad fats . Good fats The brain is composed of 60 % fat and needs an abundance of fatty acids from our diet to function effectively . Essential fatty acids are the good fats . They are found in oily fish such as mackerel , tuna , herring , sardines and salmon and nuts , seeds and cold-pressed oils . These fatty acids are essential for the normal development of the brain , eyes and nervous system . Three very good reasons why parents should not put their children on low-fat or fat-free diets . New research from Oxford university has shown that many children suffering from dyslexia , dyspraxia and ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactive disorder ) which affect children's ability to listen , think , speak , sit still and write are suffering from a dietary deficiency of fatty acids . We all want what is best for our children so let 's avoid contributing to their future health problems , hyperactivity , moodiness , poor behaviour and under-performing brain by changing their poor diet . Bring back the family meal Processed ' fast ' foods are not only responsible for these problems . Because children eat them with their fingers they are partly responsible for the demise of the family meal around a table . Now the odd thing is that ever since evolution we have been educating ourselves away from eating with our fingers and grunting . But since the arrival of fast finger foods combined with TV , video , DVD , computer games , we seem to have come full circle and children are again eating with their fingers and grunting ! Funny old world . The break down of the family meal together around a table has sadly taken its toll in many ways . Firstly , children do not know how to hold conversations with adults , they are having no supervision on how to eat or behave correctly at the table , and finally , it is now reported that the absence of the family meal is causing depression and mental-health problems . All this because we eat pizza in front of the telly ??!! Sadly , the lack of family meals together has also been connected to rising crime , depression , stress and mental-health problems among adolescents . And I always thought it was the family meal that caused these problems , with the over-powering father , the stressed out mother and the arguing children . Well , it is up to you to create a happy and harmonious atmosphere at the table , so the children and yourselves will actually look forward to this time . With so many parents both working , time with their children has been greatly reduced . So the family meal is the perfect way of combining talking with them and continuing their social education and really bonding ' as a family ' . By enjoying regular family meals together and having the opportunity to talk , the family will become very close . How to achieve the modern day family meal Under no circumstances have the television on ! It is very unlikely that both parents will be around early enough during the week to eat with toddlers or young children as a family , so make the effort at the weekend . Children are far less likely to be fussy eaters if their parents are eating with them . Never let children eat on their own at a table , always sit and talk to them and encourage their table manners . Rather than saying , ' Do n't hold / talk / eat etc. . ' use the term ' Remember ' .. ' it 's far less reprimanding and much more cajoling . Table manners are just another learning curve . When it is possible , all eat together in the evenings and re-introduce Sunday lunch . Depending on your children's ages and homework load , it is very easy to remain at the table after supper and all play cards or a short board game , which keeps the family together and cuts down on TV and computer time . A double whammy ! Always get a child , whatever age , to help lay the table and , if you have more than one child , let them take it in turns . The meal Whoever is cooking should prepare something that does n ' t take a great deal of last minute attention , so that the majority of time is spent at the table rather than standing at the cooker . But if the thought of having to prepare a meal and cook it sends you rushing for the bottle , prepare something simple like a salad with a ready-roasted chicken and a baked potato . The last thing the family needs is a gin-sodden cook having a nervous breakdown or the children losing their entire set of milk teeth on the first mouthful . Stay calm , have fresh fruit for dessert , followed by cheese and biscuits . Offer children water or unsweetened fruit juice , as high-sugar fizzy drinks will make it harder for them to sit still . Relax The key to a happy time at the table , which is the most beneficial for the children , is for the parents to be relaxed , happy and getting along . So do n't bring up any issues that might spark an argument . If siblings are likely to squabble , do not let them sit next to each other . Tell your children amusing stories and encourage them to do the same . Laughter is great for bonding and relieving stress . Always listen and stay interested in your children's stories and opinions , after all it 's very demoralising for a child ( or adults ) while recounting a story , to watch their audience rapidly losing the will to live . But do n't worry , just because you have started to eat and talk together as a family does n ' t mean that you ca n ' t all enjoy a weekly take-away pizza with your feet up in front of the TV together .

Archives Username : Password : Did you know that if you were a registered user you could add this article to your clipped articles folder ? Editor Denise Tyler tries out the scientific new way to reduce tummy fat - by walking in a vacuum suit . Sounds weird ? It feels a bit weird too , but it does work ! Putting the suit on is harder work than the actual session as it is like a wet suit . You have to strip off and put a thin liner suit on first , then pull on the outer suit which has to fit snugly as the entire thing becomes a vacuum that you then walk on the treadmill in . Tubes are attached to the front of the suit that creat the vacuum and you do get the vague feeling that you now know how cows must feel when they get linked up to a milking machine ! The machine is programmed according to your weight and fitness levels and then you walk opn the treadmill to varying degrees of incline and speed . The idea is to get your heart rate up while the vacuum inside the suit pulls blood into areas it does n ' t usually get into , i . e . t he tumy and hip areas . Normally when you work out , blood gets diverted into your muscles and that 's why it can be difficult to shift stubborn fat on the stomach and hips . This method , strange though it may seem , actually encourages the blood into those areas , thereby using up the fat . And it does work . I 'm just three quarters of the way though my twelve sessions and I 've already lost just over 4cm off my waist and I feel trimmer . My jeans have gone down a belt hole - clear proof that it works ! You have to be prepared to stick with it as you will book up for twelve sessions , three a week of 40 minutes each . By the time you have changed and showered at the end , expect the whole process to take an hour each time .

If you are a fan of Yoga or are curious to know more about it but have n ' t the time to attend classes , the this DVD could well be enjoyable and a time saver . Fenella Lindsell and her husband , co-founders of The Art of Health and Yoga Centre South-West London , opened the centre to offer complementary health treatments and related classes to everyone . They had 3 children during the 7 years at the premises and as a result many of the classes and therapies offered were directed at babies , infants and small children . One of the most successful activities was YogaBugs . YogaBugs classes are targeted at children aged 2 1 ⁄ 2 to 7 years old . Fenella integrated postures into adventures and creative stories which children love . Since YogaBugs was created at The Art it has developed further to help children from all walks of life and is committed to the on going development of Yoga for Children . I tried the new DVD ( pictured ) with my 3 year old and although I had my doubts she would actually be interested or pay attention long enough , we did in fact manage to follow quite alot of the story telling and integrate some of the moves . The nice thing was , we missed bits because we were laughing so much . She has asked to do it again several times and I enjoy taking part with her . I can see that the benefits would increase with age as children learn to replicate the Yoga positions and understand the breathing techniques . I found it actually quite relaxing to simply spend time doing an activity in my own home with my daughter that did n't involve driving anywhere or needing special kit but that left her happy and me feeling like I had actually stretched out a bit . YogaBugs is now a trade marked company and has taught teachers ' nation-wide as well as Europe , America , Australia and Asia . Classes are also run as after school activities or integrated into the school day . To apply for a discounted copy of the YogaBugs DVD , see our	0
276	What is a relational database ? A relational database consists of two or more tables whose records are related to each other . The relationship is created by linking a field in one table with a field in another table . Both these fields must be exactly the same datatype . In one of the tables it must be a Primary Key . Key fields are the heart of relational database management . The value in a key field uniquely identifies a particular occurrence of a given record type . For example a customer record might have a key field called Account and a particular customer's Account field might have a value of 123 to distinguish it from others . Storing copies of the value 123 in order records generated by that customer lets us relate the customers and order records . Only one customer record can have an account number of 123 but many order records can have the value 123 , relating them to the same customer . This is called a one-to-many relationship . The golden rule of relational database design : Never store the same information twice unless there is a very good reason The advantage of a relational database is that there is no more duplication , other than the link fields . The following diagram illustrates this . The Primary Keys for each table are in blue . ( Only a few fields are shown . ) Looking at the customers table , if we want to know more about the rep for each customer , all the data is contained in the Sales Rep table . The sales rep for customer accounts 123 and 124 is AJ and this links to the Primary key AJ in the sales Rep table , so we see his name is Andy Jordan . If we want to know what orders Ronalds has placed , the details can be found in the orders table , linked via the Primary Key Accounts . Relationships in Access Let us see how Access displays relationships . Lets also use an application which you may have had experience of yourself - a library . Here are the relationships in a simple library system . How it works There are two basic tables in a library - the Books table contains all the details of the books in the library . If there a many copies of a book , then only way you can tell them apart is the Accession Number . This is the Primary Key for the table . The second table is the Members table . This contains all the details about the members . There may be two people with the same name etc. so a different membership number is assigned to each member . This is the Primary Key for this table . These two tables become linked , when you take out a book , by means of a third table - the Transaction table . This assigns a separate number to every transaction . This is the Primary Key for this table . When you go to a library all you do is give the librarian your library card ( which has a barcode number on it ) . The librarian scans the card and scans the barcode on the book you are taking out . The two numbers are being linked together in this transaction . The computer assigns the day's date and the number of the transaction . This completes a new record in the transaction table . If they need to find out your phone number , the link will take them to the Members table and your record . If they need to find out the title of the book you took out , the link will take them to the Books table and the record for that book . Imagine how long it would take if they had to write down your details and the book details ( or even just the name and the title of the book ) every time ! How to set up relationships Firstly , you must plan the tables very carefully . It is essential that each table contains a Primary Key The fields to be related are the same datatype and the same format Once you have created your tables you should set up the relationships before you enter any data . It can be done later , but there are often problems with data not matching etc. If the relationships are created first , the computer will not allow you to enter data that breaks the rules .	7
1149	"Single Parent Struggle For many years , children growing up in a single parent family have been viewed as different . Being raised by only one parent seems impossible to many yet over the decades it has become more prevalent . In today's society many children have grown up to become emotionally stable and successful whether they had one or two parents to show them the rocky path that life bestows upon all human beings . The problem lies in the difference of children raised by single parents versus children raised by both a mother and a father . Does a child need both parents ? Does a young boy need a father figure around ? Does the government provide help for single parents ? What role do step-parents and step-siblings play ? With much speculation , this topic has become a very intriguing argument . What people must understand is that properly raising a child does not rely on the structure of a family but should be more focused on the process or values that are taught to these children as they learn to mature . Children of single parents can be just as progressive with emotional , social and behavioral skills as those with two parents . People claim that the only way for children to gain full emotional and behavioral skills is to be raised by both a mother and a father . When a topic such as this one has a broad amount of variables it is impossible to simply link these problems to only having one parent . In the article , "" Single-parent families cause juvenile crime "" , author Robert L. Maginnis states , "" Children from single-parent families are more likely to have behavior problems because they tend to lack economic security and adequate time with parents "" . The simple statement that raw criminals are products of single-parent adolescence is absurd . What this writer must understand is that it can be extremely difficult for one parent to raise a child by themselves for many reasons . A single-parent must work full time to be able to afford to provide for themselves and their child . They must also be able to still have time to offer an exuberant amount of emotional time for the well being of their child . However , even though this may seem impossible , it can be done . As this subject continues to be looked down on people must realize that single parents are becoming more common in today's world . Since 1995 the American family structure for children ages fourteen to eighteen consists of forty-two percent living in a first marriage family with both parents , twenty-two percent living in a second marriage step-family , twenty-one percent living in a single parent , divorced or separated family , six percent living in a single parent never married family and three percent living in a single parent widowed family . This is an extremely scary statistic considering that fifty - eight percent of children in America are living in a single parent family . This is a chilling percentage because it shows how little faith is put into a relationship before actually deciding to have children . Unfortunately not all single-parents take the time to perform the vital tasks needed to raise their children . Parents who think they would never be able to provide emotional stability for their children by themselves should have taken the time to think this through before deciding to become parents . Accidents may happen once in awhile but in most cases adults know what is at stake when planning to have a child . Plain and simple , if you 're not ready , than do n't do it . If you do decide to have this child and you love this child , then you can be a good parent . There are many ways to enhance the well being of your child if you simply apply yourselves as parents . Magginnis later states that , "" Boys who do not have fathers as male role models suffer especially "" . While it is extremely important for a male child to have his father around , there are other ways of teaching a young boy the lessons he needs to become a man . I know from personal experience that what the author of this article is trying to convey is wrong . I never had my father around while growing up and I did in fact have many positive male role models . My Grandfather was always there to help guide me as I slowly blossomed into a young man . Anytime my mother had to work to support us , my grandparents , aunt 's , uncles and cousins would step up and provide the time and attention I needed . Therefore , I had the best support group I could have had as a young man . Being a child with a single mother had its benefits . Although I came to find how hard it really was for her to always meet the needs of her child , she did the best job that she possibly could and gave me the knowledge that I needed to become a successful man without the guidance of my father . I did however have the experience of dealing with a step-parent . Today , twenty - five percent of all American children will spend at least some time of their growing-up years in a stepfamily . This seems fine for single parents because they feel like they can start over in a new relationship and receive help from their spouse both emotionally and financially . A step-parent can cause confusion and emotional stress on the child since they have just had to adjust to only one parent and now have to adjust to a new parental figure stepping into the family role . Another factor of bringing a step-parent into a single family's life is new step-siblings to get along with . It might not be justified for a step - parent to punish their step-child like they would their own flesh and blood . As long as both parents have an understanding that their family comes first and that it is important to communicate between themselves and with the children , a step-family could survive . Children who are raised with both a mother and a father have more attention from both parents therefore they get the emotional time they need to progress in life . This could be true but not in all circumstances . It would not be beneficial at all to grow up in a two parent family who did nothing but argue and put each-other down . Naturally , a child who sees this from a very young age until they are ready to be out on their own would only follow in the footsteps of all that they have ever known . Children who are raised by one parent who devotes their time and emotion into their child would benefit much more than a child who has both parents showing them that fighting and arguing is acceptable . Not all families are lucky enough to have a healthy structure . It is important for society and government aids to notice these structural differences and take action . There should be government funded programs to help assist single-parent families with childcare and finances for parents who must work and still have time for their children . Whether it 's a mother and a father , a single mother , or a single father , children need guidance . They will only become a product of what they are taught from a young age and these children are deeply affected emotionally by the amount of love and compassion that is put into raising them . Whichever family structure is implied it must be one of respect and strong moral values that they can someday pass on to their family ."	0

Power of Department to execute street works 13 . -- ( 1 ) Subject to paragraph ( 2 ) , if a requirement under Article 11 is not complied with within the time specified in the notice containing that requirement , the Department may execute the street works indicated in the notice and , subject to the following provisions of this Part , may recover in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 from each responsible person in default such part of the expenses of the street works ( including a charge in respect of surveys , superintendence and notices [ ... ] F006 ) as may be apportioned to him in accordance with Article 14 .

( 2 ) For the purposes of paragraph ( 1 ) , the frontage for which a person is responsible is , subject to Article 24 ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , the frontage on the part of the street in respect of which he has , or is deemed under Article 24 ( 11 ) to have , paid or secured a sum under Article 24 ( 1 ) or given an undertaking under Article 24 ( 2 ) or in respect of which he has entered into an agreement under Article 32 , or , where no such prior provision for street works has been made , the frontage of the premises of which he is the owner .

( 5 ) The Department shall not be entitled to recover by virtue of paragraph ( 4 ) unless , at the time at which the reduction is made , it has served a notice on the responsible person indicating the circumstances in which such recovery may be made .

( 7 ) Any sum apportioned under paragraph ( 6 ) shall be recoverable in accordance with Article 15 from the person or persons who would be the responsible persons if the street works were in respect of the street on which those premises have a frontage .

1672	"In July 1957 British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan told fellow Conservatives at a rally in Bedford , England , that "" most of our people have never had it so good . "" The generation of novelists , playwrights , directors , and filmmakers who became known as the "" Angry Young Men "" could n't have disagreed more . From the mid-1950s to the early 1960s , they produced a body of arresting work that was grounded in the "" kitchen sink "" reality of working-class life , railed against the class-conscious British social order , and reflected the alienated , rebellious , and pessimistic mood of many in post-World War II Britain . Here are 10 of the most prominent figures in that cantankerous lot . Woodfall Film Productions Charles Lumley , the protagonist of John Wain ' s novel Hurry on Down ( 1953 ) , a recent university graduate with contempt for the conformity of his privileged class , and Jim Dixon , the antihero of Kingsley Amis ' s comic classic Lucky Jim ( 1954 ) , who has risen from a modest background to the relatively cushy post of university lecturer , are often cited as precursors , but the ur-Angry Young Man ( AYM ) was Jimmy Porter , the furious focus of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger ( 1956 ) . First played onstage by Kenneth Haigh and on film by Richard Burton , trumpet-playing Jimmy is a bilious but articulate working-class lad whose university degree has landed him a job as the proprietor of a sweet stand in a market . His rage against class-based oppression and pretension is most often sadistically directed at his wife ( whom he calls "" Lady Pusillanimous "" ) and her upper-middle-class family , whose mannered existence he repeatedly skewers with vengeful rapierlike wit . Critic Kenneth Tynan called Jimmy "" the completest young pup in our literature since Hamlet "" ; a Royal Court Theatre publicist coined the phrase "" angry young man "" to describe him . UPI / Bettmann Newsphotos There is plenty of playwright John Osborne in Jimmy . The son of an advertising copywriter father and an abusive barmaid mother , Osborne carried a lower-middle-class bitterness with him most of his life . Having left school at age 16 after hitting a teacher , Osborne worked as a trade industry journalist and then as an actor in provincial theater before the breakout success of the Royal Court Theatre production of Look Back in Anger in May 1956 made him a literary superstar at age 26 . By putting working-class life , characters , language , and frustrations onstage , Osborne revolutionized British theater , displacing the mannered gentility of playwrights such as Noël Coward and Terence Rattigan . Nearly as memorable as Look Back in Anger was The Entertainer ( play 1959 , film 1963 ) , in which Osborne created the bitter music-hall comedian Archie Rice for Laurence Olivier . In 1961 Osborne extended his condemnation of British society in a letter to the leftist Tribune in which he damned England , writing , "" You 're rotting now , and quite soon you 'll disappear . "" Ironically , although he was long characterized as a bomb-throwing leftist , by the end of his career Osborne had taken a political turn to the right and ended up the kind of country gentleman Jimmy so despised . Osborne's essential collaborator was Tony Richardson , founder of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court and the director of both the stage production and the 1959 film version of Look Back in Anger as well as the stage and film versions of The Entertainer . Together , Osborne and Richardson established Woodfall Film Productions , which released several landmark AYM films , including Saturday Night and Sunday Morning ( 1960 ) and two other crucial AYM films directed by Richardson , A Taste of Honey ( 1961 ) and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner ( 1962 ) . Richardson got his filmmaking start as part of the Free Cinema movement , joining Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz in making short socially conscious documentaries before they became the pillars of the British New Wave of fiction filmmaking . Having grown up in an apartment above the pharmacy owned by his father but with an aristocratic family on his mother's side , the Oxford - educated Richardson was familiar with both sides of the fence that separated privilege and privation in Britain . Woodfall Film Productions Alan Sillitoe ' s novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning ( 1958 ) focuses on Arthur Seaton ( played in the Reisz-directed film by Albert Finney ) , a boozy , hedonistic young factory worker in gritty industrial Nottingham who lives with his parents and has a passionless affair with a coworker's wife . Self-centered survival seems to be the best that Arthur can hope for in life . On the other hand , Colin Smith , the antihero of Sillitoe's long short story "" The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner , "" who is sent to a borstal ( reform school ) for petty thievery , has a choice : he can cooperate and win a cross-country race to bring glory to the borstal's governor or turn class warrior and rebel and keep his integrity . Sillitoe grew up in transient poverty in Nottingham , left school at 14 , and worked in a factory before becoming a writer . He was celebrated by the Soviet Union as a genuine revolutionary working-class voice , but when he spoke to the Congress of the Soviet Writers' Union in 1968 ( in the presence of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ) , Sillitoe denounced the totalitarian suppression of human rights he had observed in the U.S.S.R. Through knowing glances , loaded smirks , and trenchantly inflected dialogue , Tom Courtenay subtly conveys the intricacies of Sillitoe's first-person narrative in his masterful portrayal of Colin in the film version of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner . When Colin runs , he thinks – about his family , the events that have brought him to the borstal , and the ongoing battle waged between cunning "" out-laws "" and "" in-laws "" in Britain's class-ridden stacked-deck society . This was the breakout role for Courtenay as an actor , but he scored big again in the title role of another classic AYM film , the John Schlesinger - directed comedy Billy Liar ( 1963 ) . In it Courtenay again gives body to the interior life of the protagonist , this time reenacting the Walter Mitty - like fantasy life of an undertaker's clerk who aspires to becoming a writer and leaving his provincial home but , ultimately timid , instead revels in his imaginary heroic ventures in the make-believe land of Ambrosia . Before Courtenay brought the neurotic Billy Fisher to the screen , he was played by Albert Finney in the stage version of Billy Liar , written by Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse from Waterhouse's popular 1959 novel . Waterhouse grew up in Yorkshire , and his novel – like so many AYM standards – is suffused with the sensibility , manners , and material reality of Northern England , along with the diction and drabness of lower-middle - and working-class life . Billy is a born storyteller , and so was Waterhouse , who wrote plays , screenplays , television scripts , and some 60 books ( including 16 novels ) . Yet beyond Billy Liar , Waterhouse is best remembered in Britain for his long career as a journalist and newspaper columnist . Romulus Films Look Back in Anger hit the stage just a year before the publication of John Braine ' s AYM novel Room at the Top ( 1957 ) , but the film version of the latter beat that of the former onto British screens by several months in 1959 . Unlike most AYM protagonists , Braine's central character , Joe Lampton ( played by Laurence Harvey in the Jack Clayton-directed film ) , is unrelentingly ambitious . The setting is the fictitious Yorkshire town of Warnley ( modeled on Braine's hometown , Bradford ) , to which Joe has moved from smaller , drabber Dufton to take a low-level job with the city . Joe falls deeply in love with an unhappily married older woman ( played by Simone Signoret ) but brings about her suicide ( and the death of his integrity ) by abandoning her to orchestrate a social-climbing , loveless marriage to the daughter of a local Brahmin . Braine , who worked as a librarian for some 17 years , wrote most of Room at the Top while recovering in a sanatorium from tuberculosis contracted during his service in the navy during World War II . Julian Wintle / Leslie Parkyn Productions The polemicist of the British New Wave of the AYM school of filmmaking , Lindsay Anderson began his involvement with motion pictures as a critic , cofounding the influential film journal Sequence while he was a student at Oxford . By the late 1940s he was directing short socially and morally engaged Free Cinema documentaries . He and fellow directors such as Reisz and Richardson continued to embrace the gritty , no-frills naturalism of the Italian Neorealist movement as they turned their attention to making feature films . On-location shooting became a hallmark of the British New Wave , and Anderson set his first fiction film , This Sporting Life ( 1963 ) , an AYM classic based on a novel by David Storey , in Yorkshire , where he had already shot four documentaries . With his visceral tour de force performance as a miner turned star rugby player who mangles his relationship with an emotionally repressed widow , Richard Harris is reminiscent of Marlon Brando ' s brutish Stanley Kowalski . Woodfall Film Productions Shelagh Delaney was not a man , but she was plenty angry at repressive aspects of British society , and she was definitely young – just aged 18 – when she wrote her powerful AYM play A Taste of Honey ( 1958 ) . Delaney had begun to tackle the subject matter as a novel , but she switched formats to drama , partly in response to her disappointment at the treatment of homosexuality in Terence Rattigan ' s play Variations on a Theme . Richardson opened up Delaney's play when he translated it to film ( 1961 ) , working with cinematographer Walter Lassally to make the most of its location in the industrial Salford ( adjacent to Manchester ) , Delaney's home and that of her protagonist , 19-year-old Jo , who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a black sailor . Estranged from her mother , Jo is supported by a gay friend who offers to marry her to give the baby a father . Julie Christie made her dynamic film breakthrough in Billy Liar , and Rachel Roberts had the female lead in both This Sporting Life and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning , but it was the much less conventionally attractive Rita Tushingham who became the distaff face of the AYM movement with her soulful portrayal of Jo . Decades after the initial prominence of A Taste of Honey , Delaney's influence loomed large for singer-songwriter Morrissey , who borrowed her lines for song lyrics and put her image on the Smiths ' compilation album Louder than Bombs ( 1987 ) ."	4
860	"You are here : Home "" News "" Archive "" 2006 "" April "" Charity demands action on child ASBOs ( 12 April ) Charity demands action on child ASBOs ( 12 April ) Anti-social behaviour orders ' becoming entirely routine ' Anti-social behaviour orders -- ASBOs -- are ' catapulting children into custody ' , the charity Barnardo's has warned . When ASBOs were first introduced in 1998 they were intended for use with children only in ' exceptional circumstances ' , said Barnardo's chief executive Martin Narey . In the two years to the end of 2000 , there were only 61 child ASBOs . By contrast , in 2003 there were more than 500 in 2003 and more than 1,000 in 2004 . ' This is not exceptional use , ' Mr Narey said . ' In some areas the use of ASBOs on children is becoming entirely routine . ASBOs have their place but their overuse is unnecessarily catapulting children into a custodial system which has so many children in it that the chances of rehabilitation are extremely slim and the chances of deeper criminalisation very likely . ' Barnardo's is calling for changes to the law so that an assessment of needs and circumstances must be carried out before any child is given an ASBO . It is also demanding that ASBOs for children run for shorter periods . Currently , ASBOs have to run for a minimum of two years , which the charity says to a child will ' seem like infinity ' ."	0
718	The people of Northern Ireland , Britain as a whole , and of the rest of the world respect the freedom of the United States . We all deserve those rights and responsibilities . Our freedoms must be protected . Those who challenge and hate our civilisation must be hunted down and held to account for their crimes . The terrorist who hides behind the mask of oppression will be ousted , but how much greater is the crime of the terrorist who hides , skulks and abuses the freedoms they are afforded within the free world . AMERICA The American Connection Murder 9 / 11 The Land Of The Free ............................................. The question is often asked why do terrorists act as they do ? Why would someone fly a plane into a building killing hundreds of people but also ending their own lives ? The terrorist kills to impose their will on others . The fanatical belief that their way and the way of violence is paramount infests their minds . The terrorist can not understand freedom . They can not understand the complex web of life , they can not understand the diversity of nature and creation . They only understand their perception of the world and will kill to enforce it . Many also choose to die i.e. the act of suicide to impose their universal worldview . Bobby Sands and Mohamed Atta may never have known each other . They died for different ' causes ' but their act was the same . They ended their own lives , they worked to take the lives of others , because they hate freedom . The terrorist mind insists on their way and no other , and if they cant impose it by murder they will seek to do it by suicide . Freedom is a precious thing . Freedom is hard to get , and it is harder to keep . It is frequently abused , but also often enjoyed and stretched so far that freedom is afforded to those who wish to destroy it . Freedom is not indiscriminate . Freedom is for those who value it . When the perpetrator has more freedom than the victim , then freedom is threatened . There are those who use the freedoms our society afford they use them for their own ends far and beyond the spirit in which that freedom is bestowed . That is the inherent danger . We should enjoy our freedom , we should live to extend our freedom and seek to extend the spirit of freedom , but we must also protect our freedom against those who hate the free . Protect our liberty - end Noraid now !	0
258	The South Wales Caving Club Expedition to The Franche Comte ( The Jura and the Doubs ) 23rd July to 6th August 2005 Franche-Comté is the name given to the vast area of woodland which lies to the north of the French Alps in Eastern France , and stretches southward along the Swiss border for 250km , from Vosges to the Jura . The region is divided into four different départements , the Haute-Saône , Doubs , Jura and Territoire de Belfort , the first three of which all contain important cave systems . The Franche-Comte is brimming with sites of outstanding natural beauty , including Alpine meadows , lakes , cirques , waterfalls , thick forest and some of the most beautiful rivers in France . Glaciation , high rainfall and copious Spring snowmelt has encouraged plentiful erosion on the predominant Jurassic limestone landscape , resulting in a full range of karst features , including of course , several thousand cave systems . Where is it ? ... As you can probably appreciate from the map extract , the area is quite a large one . It nestles up against the Franco Swiss border immediately east of Dijon . We will be based roughly in the middle in a picturesque little town called Ornans which is located on the D67 about 20km south of Besancon . The area is probably best reached using the Dover - Calais or Folkstone - Calais crossings . A route is available which cuts south east around Reims and Dijon which negates the need to get tangled up with Paris . An alternative more elongated route swings up into Belgium and down across Luxembourg to drop back into France at Nancy . The auto routes are all free of toll on this route but it does take a little longer . A little about the local geology ..... The region can be divided into three major zones , the Mountains , the Plateau Ridges and the Lowlands . The mountains are located in the east and follow a NE-SW axis along the Swiss border . They are quite small mountains for the area , the highest peak being Cret de la Neige , at 1718m high . A few Alpine style shaft systems can be explored in this zone . Parallel with the mountains lies an extensive series of Plateau Ridges , which range in height from 900m to 400m , stepping down gradually from East to West . These gently undulating agricultural regions , are home to the majority of the caves ( including most of the major systems ) , particularly around the spectacular river gorges separating the ridges . The final region , the lowlands , occupies the north of the region , but includes only a few notable caves , formed in isolated ridges . The waters drain North-West from the eastern mountains to the Saone valley . To get there they have to cross the plateau ridges , for which there are only two possible options , via Cluses ( narrow gorges cutting through the ridges ) or via caves , which is why the majority of cave systems are found within the Plateau Ridges region . The whole region has been subject to quite severe folding and faulting , and this has had a powerful effect on cave development . Underground drainage is predominantly directed along the axis of the folds . Since the dip is generally shallow , underground streams can travel very large distances and the separation from sinks to resurgence can be considerable ( the longest positive trace is from Seignes de Passonfontaine to Source du Maine , a distance of 28km over a vertical range of nearly 500m ) . However , the narrow widths of the synclinal folds acts as a limit on overall catchment areas and consequently many major systems consist of single streamways , albeit of great length . The resurgences are often large and impressive , but almost invariably flooded for a considerable distance . The feeders to these Collecteurs are predominantly vertical , simple shaft systems , of not very great depth ( commonly between 100m and 300m ) . Most peter out in mud chokes and impenetrable cracks , but a few utilise tectonic fractures to connect directly into the Collecteurs . There are probably many more of these , hidden beneath a blanket of alluvium . A third type of cave passage is found in ancient , fossil remnants , located in the higher beds . Due to the relative youth of the Jurassic formation , these are quite scarce , but typically feature large , dry tunnels , often adorned with huge , muddy formations . So what are the caves like ? ....... The caves of the Franche-Comte are generally simple in plan , with a series of vertical Dales like pots feeding long , linear streamways . This is partly due to the geology and partly due to the relative youth of the Jurassic formations . The caves are commonly wet , muddy and well-decorated , often with large formations . Jurassic limestone can be thinly-bedded and brittle , so care should be taken when climbing or traversing . The weather is generally sunny , but punctuated by sudden and severe thunderstorms . This can create real problems , for the water tends to flash through the caves very quickly . Pitch heads should be rigged as far out of potential flood water as possible and long trips into streamways are best timed to avoid the late afternoons . The vast majority of caves in the Franche-Comte are prone to flooding of one degree or another , so it is best to take some food and survival kit on most trips . On the plus side , the water is likely to drop as fast as it rises , so a few hours wait will normally allow for a safe exit . Choice of personal kit can also be difficult . Many of the dry caves can be very warm , requiring only the lightest of clothing . On the other hand , the wet caves often require full wetsuits . Over 5000 caves have been mapped , the majority of which are horizontal systems . Approximately 100 caves exceed 1km , 50 exceed 2km , and no less than 15 exceed 5km in length . No very deep caves exist , but of the vertical systems , three exceed 300m in vertical range , and more than 50 exceed 100m . The region is equally famous for cave diving and includes some of the most extensive submerged networks in Europe . Here is a short list of the sort of thing available ..... Reseau de la Verneau Traverse ( Bief-Boussets to Baudin ) - 9km long , 345m deep . One of the classic French through trips . Big stream , very flood-prone . 12 hour + trip . 4th longest cave in France ( 30km ) . In same class as PSM , Dent de Crolles , Diau , Felix Trombe i . e about as good as it gets . Includes pitches up and down and a 5m free-diveable sump ( do n't worry , can be bypassed ) . Grotte de Chauveroche - 6 km to sump with lots of swimming ( 204 pools !!! ) . Then 6 km back out . Julian Walford , who found Claonaite and Pollballiny reckons it 's the best stream cave he 's ever done . A wet-suit trip . Another French classic . Hard . Gouffre de Pourpeville - 9 km long . Entrance pitches drop into big well-decorated galleries . La Borne Aux Cassots - 15 km horizontal cave with good formations . Combination lock . Part streamway , part big pretty stuff . Gouffre de Granges-Mathieu - 25m pitch to bizarre gate ( climb over ) then lots of pretty passage to fantastically decorated final chamber . Gouffre de la Baume St Anne - Basically a big 85m deep daylight shaft much like Alum Pot . Not much else ( much like Alum Pot ) . The Dutch think it 's fab . Gouffre de Montaigu - Deepest cave in area . Impressive pitches . Gouffre de Vauvougier - Sporting . Over 200 meters deep , its pits and meanders provide numerous surprises . No pretties or big passages though . 10 hr + hard trips . Baume de la Faviere - Basically Vertical to - 229 metres Caborne de Menouille - Through trip from Gouffre du Cernon possible - but very polluted . Vertical round trip possible from resurgence , including 60m shaft . Gouffre du Mont Ratey - Superb cave . Beautiful and deep but very flood prone . Grotte du Cul de Vau - 4 km long . Underground river . Lots of swimming .. which should be enough to keep everyone going for a while . Plus - Via Ferrata adjacent to Verneau resurgence . Camping ... The campsite is booked ! We have reserved 8 pitches in the area of the site that projects out to the west ( look for 14B on the map ) . Mr Clipstone kindly carried out a reconnaissance of the site and informs us that these are the best ones with a good deal of shade and nice flat pitches . The site itself had been recommended by several well respected cavers and to boot it turns out that the Wessex mega trip this year ( 50 plus attendees ) used the same site . The url for the site is http://www.lechanet.com / . It seems to be a very tidy site with loads of amenities including ' Le Snack Bar ' and of course La Piscine . Camping on the site gives you complimentary access to the Piscine Municipal which is a few hundred metres up the road . Money , Money Money ... Until we get a better idea of numbers we have only reserved 8 pitches . We are working on the basis that people may want to share pitches and hence reduce the cost . If you would like to reserve a complete pitch then would you be so good as to forward a cheque for £ 40.00 . If you would like to share a pitch would you please forward a cheque for £ 20.00 . Cheques should be made payable to ' Cantabria Expeditions' Pitches will obviously go on a first come first served basis . If numbers require further pitch reservations I will make these reservations as and when it becomes obvious that we need them . I 'm not guaranteeing that we will get more pitches but it sounds like the area where the Wessex camped ( northernmost triangle ) is pretty open plan and although quite steep and devoid of shade will probably accommodate last minute bookings . One or two of the families have booked the mobil home accommodation available on the site ( no prizes for guessing who ! ) . If you would like to reserve one of these do let me know or speak to the campsite direct .

1166	"Preventing violence against women "" During her lifetime one out of two women will be beaten by a man who loves her ! "" Leonore Loeb Adler Education has always played an integral part in the lives of every single child in the country and in the world . This is not surprising as it is education that gives children the knowledge to think , evaluate and be able to identify a problem and solve it . Social skills , critical thinking skills , problem solving skills , empathy training – all of these are obtained through the process of education and are an essential part of a becoming a multi-sided developed personality . One of the major characteristics of such a personality is the ability to solve all the conflicts without any aggression and especially without violence . The process of socialization of children through age appropriate K-12 in all the skills listed above put school-boys in the group that are less likely to be violent to women and minimize the values and beliefs that boys form according to their male entitlement . As children learn everything connected with aggression and violence and how to deal with it they become "" armed "" and do not get lost in situations that require active actions in order to recognize or respond to any type of violence against women be it a physical , verbal , sexual , or emotional type of abuse . Boys acquire the ability to react and recognize violence against women owing to the education and knowledge they get they and it is a strong presupposition to not being aggressive . Nevertheless school is just one of the factors influencing boys and the other one is family . If the family's interpersonal relations are characterized by high rate of violence , school non-violent education may fail to succeed . Violence definition and K-12 education If we take violence against women and children as the criterion to identify children from adverse families and as something school-education tries to reduce such behavior to its minimum , it is necessary to identify the term "" violence "" itself . The term "" violence "" is ordinarily used to define aggression and acts of abuse that eventually cause damage to private property , animals and even people . Violence is a manifestation of a behavior with a destructive orientation . Random domestic violence , the one that is very common nowadays causes a lot of troubles nowadays for too many people and especially women get serious , irretrievable injuries that changes do harm to their physical possibilities in everyday vital activities . Violence to women does truly damage the society's "" morality "" and is the example of a primitive gender based conflict based on the notion that women are men's "" private property "" . Violence against women is a synonymy of any act of discrimination and physical abuse aimed to hurt a girl or a woman . One of the most spread acts of violence against women is domestic violence , rape and others . As all the children , including boys , tend to copy the behavior of adults and their parent in the first place , they become very sensitive to violence in terms of copying it , too . Sometimes school-education becomes the only source of showing children the ways of recognizing the responding to violence and if the process of education is harmonious and professionally then it empowers all children and particularly boys to become active participants and not just observers of violence-prevention . The abbreviation K-12 is used for the designation for the primary and secondary education in North America . K-12 , or "" Kay through twelve "" is a shortening for "" kindergarten through twelfth grade "" education . This education implies working with children from five to 18 years old , and this is the whole period when the children learn all the values and believes that will define their future life . The K-12 education if conducted properly is an excellent precondition to educate boys not to be passive in the women-oriented violent acts but to have enough information in order to stop them . The age from 5 to 18 is an exceptional period for education , as it becomes a "" filter "" for violence in general and violence against women in particular . At the age of 18 young men start their proceeding life . They start looking for a couple and thinking about their future wives , so it is essential to make sure they do truly know how to control their anger and not let it transform into violent behavior against women . The K-12 education is based on the notion that every child is unique and needs a differentiated approach . Besides the fact that K-12 classroom instruction works to meet individual student's needs as the classrooms often include children with different level of abilities , it also provides skills that are designed to teach the student to be successful in his environment . As children spend most of their time in school it become the very place to motive them not to be aggressive and violent against girls and women . Teaching non-violent behavior The K-12 education in terms of preventing violence against women is very much needed by the society because the contemporary exposure of children to violence id immense and have never been as available as now . Television , video and computer games , films constantly give the weak child's mind new patterns of aggressiveness and violence . Sometimes children do experience violence themselves or grow up in the atmosphere of threat or in a neighborhood that constantly provides examples of inability to self-control and to stop the conflict peacefully . Children start taking all of these as a "" normal "" fact and see nothing bad in behaving in the same way for the only thing they do – is the simply copy what they see . The reason that the personality of the teachers nowadays is valued more than their knowledge in the course they teaching is because the values and behavior examples delivered to children in the sensitive period outweigh some gaps in the course . Good teachers protect children from violence and make sure their development is healthy and they learn what true beauty and virtue is . The basic reasons children in general and boys in particular can be so easily influenced by violent behavior is because such behavior as it has been mentioned before is actually learned . The brain starts making critical connections in the period of childhood but in reality these connections are not truly "" critical "" as they are taken a priori . At the beginning the child's mind is a "" Tabula Rasa "" , a clean board , on which teachers and family with their hand draw the picture of the child's future behavior and personality . So basically saying , the violent behavior against women performed by men is simply an imprint that a man got when he was a boy . While thinking only about the fact that exposure to violence causes boys to be violent in future , teachers and parent should not forget that love is the tool to teach the child to be understanding and patient , to be loving and non-aggressive . Mutual understanding makes the child learn constructive way of conflict solving and also learn how to control himself and not to express his anger in any destructive way . The education from Kindergarten through the twelfth grade that is based on acceptance , love and true devotion to children is a guarantee of preventing violent manifestations in the lives of these children . If children feel that they are needed and expected at school , if they feel safe expressing their thoughts and know that they are respected and never humiliated they will never humiliate anybody themselves and will have less problems dealing with a stress ( Mullender , 2004 ) . It is common knowledge that aggression is a protection and violence is a strong , fixed aggressive behavior ( Kimmel & Michael , 1989 ) . And there is no secret in the fact that the majority of teachers are women . If a boy learns to be aggressive from Kindergarten till his senior year in High School the probability that he will not be violent to women is very low . So here it is necessary to face two major facts : the two most important factors influencing the boy's violent orientation are school and family . The majority of teachers are women and the most important person for a child – mother , belong to the female gender , too . In case mother fails to teach her son solve the conflicts constructively and the teacher fails to develop his problem solving skills – aggression against women is very probable to occur . K-12 education with its ability to teach children to cope with negative feelings in non-destructive positive ways nowadays has turned to the key element in teaching non-violent behavior against women . This is true for very often parents are very busy working and have no time to open their child the door to the productive , non-aggressive life . Male violence against women Violence in its very essence is a manifestation of the destructive desire to control and have power over another human being . According to Bancroft there nine types of abusive men which can use different styles starting with a strictly verbal abuser and ending with a physical batterer ( Bancroft , 2003 ) . Male violence against women is a desire to feel complete control over a human being that for ages has been seen as a "" weak gender "" . Therefore violence becomes the way of proving that a man or a boy really belongs to a male gender and therefore women have to "" knuckle under "" him . In other words male violence against women is a characteristic of men , who were abused or neglected in their childhood ( Bancroft , 2003 ) . According to the information not known at wide public but collected by the Federal bureau of investigation – out of all the domestic violence acts – 95 percent are violent behavior manifestations against women . So this is all basically about the gender violence and primarily violence over women committed by men . The men who were abused in their childhood or were victims of family and school neglect most commonly commit violent criminal behavior . If a little boy is constantly exposed to his father beating his mother he is a potential abuser for every woman in his life ( Widom & Maxfield , 2001 ) . The situation becomes even worse if a little boy is abused himself , too . The main problem concerning children and boys that are being abused is that can not learn what is empathy for other people and for the pain they are experiencing . They treat other people the same as they were treated themselves . So , if a child that is abused or watches his family members or neighbors abuse their relatives get not proper attention at school the boy easily converts into a criminal and his life will be broken because of his broken child's heart . Violence against women – is not the fault of men but their misfortune . The true reason is that men used to be boys and these little boys did not have anybody to love and understand them neither at home nor at school . They did not have anybody to teach him or her how to control their anger , for anger is the major feeling such "" abusive "" children experience . They are angry with the people who are so indifferent to them and they become sure nobody is honestly able to understand them and become and violent ( Bancroft , 2003 ) . This issue is not even about women letting men abuse them and turning them to police and not about men believing that the punishment will not hard . This is about the possibility to prevent violence against women when men are little boys are seek for love just as any girl does ( Kimmel & Michael , 1989 ) . Male violence against women has different various forms : verbal violence , sexual assault , sexual harassment , battered women and others . All of these are result to the inability to build normal relationships . As it has been mentioned before school is the second most important element in bringing up successful and psychologically healthy men . The aim of K-12 education is to fill in the blanks of dysfunctional relationships within the family of the boy and especially in terms of relations with women . An attentive female teacher , showing respect and love for a little boy shows him that he is worth of love the way he is and does not have to use his male advantages such as strength to show his dominance over women . As the majority of men are heterosexuals , their female companions are the one that experience violence the most . Violence-prevention through education K-12 education can be rather effective in term of growing up non-violent males . Under the condition of an individual differentiated approach to the each boy the process education can guarantee several ways of preventing violence against women . This can happen through the establishment of positive interactions between the teachers and the male-student , learning how to build productive relationships , taking into account the person interest of the child . As the K-12 education implies a lot of sport activities , which take away the spare energy that a growing body has and can use in the direction of violent acts . The K-12 education provides the attention to a large variety of aspects concerning the child's life that could lead him to aggression and afterwards – violence . This is achieved through the development of different kind of skills such as physical , social , cognitive and emotional aspects . If a boy gets the required attention if not at home , but at least at school in terms of emotional attachment and psychical exercises he is not in the "" risk group "" for becoming violent towards women . Contemporary schools provide a counselor to every child and this person is responsible for observing the child behavior . In cases the behavior becomes not adaptive and abnormal the counselor may feel free to turn for a psychological assistance or speak with the child's parents . The professionalism of teachers should primary reveal the ability to teach the boy to regulate his emotional conditions . K-12 through teaches boys how to speak off their thoughts and emotional conditions . This completely coincides with one of the best steps in the prevention of violence against women . The K-12 education teaches makes boys learn that it is okay to be angry and that each person sometimes does feel angry but the biggest difference is how a person reveals his anger to others . A boy , being in class learns that there are inappropriate ways of showing his anger and the most productive way to do it is to tell what he is feeling and not physically hurt a human being . Such an approach implies that a boy will never hit a woman though originally women are believed to be weaker than men are . Boys learn violence by watching grown ups . Not depending on the fact whether the boy's family is or is not "" healthy "" in term of violence school takes the most part of the responsibility of teaching boys how to be not violent . The K-12 education can prevent boys and eventually men form being violent towards women by teaching them to solve their problems using word of respect and a wide range of non-violent actions . The female teachers become an essential part of K-12 stopping violence against woman . If a boy established relations that are full of mutual respect and emotional attachment with a female teacher he will learn how to control and monitor his "" negative "" feelings and therefore will take this pattern for the rest of his life !"	0
1555	"Throughout the life of the El Camino , ad images emphasized both its sporty profile and its pickup truck-style rear , which was perfect for hauling groceries , furniture , or the kid's bicycles . The powers-that-be at Chevrolet tweaked this "" all things to all men "" formula throughout the vehicle's production years . In 1968 , these efforts resulted in the introduction of an SS package . This was essentially a carbon copy of the Chevelle Super Sport's options , including Chevy's legendary Turbo Jet 396 cubic inch engine . With this V8 monster under its hood , the El Camino could wrap up the quarter-mile in 14 seconds – respectable for the time and not too bad by today's standards . There was one crucial difference between the Chevelle and El Camino SS packages , however . Try as they might , builders could not adapt the Chevelle's heavy-duty rear anti-sway suspension to the hybrid truck-sports car frame . This was due to the fact that the El Camino was originally designed to haul freight , not burn rubber . It points out the problems that inevitably arise when a company tries to please everyone . The El Camino SS came closer than any other attempt to bridge divide between rebellious youth and responsible adulthood , however . For that alone , it deserves its place in automotive history ."	4

1496	"Friday , 26 October 2012 "" first they came ... "" another extradition controversy The latest controversy revolving around extradition to the US comes hot on the heels of the resolution of another two . First came the extradition of Abu Hamza and four associates – the convicted terrorist's sermons inspired 9 / 11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui as well as would-be shoe-bomber Richard Reid . Lawyers defended the eight-year long process by saying it shows Britain's determination to be fair . While Abu Qatada was often free to roam and preach hate-sermons during his extradition process and Gary MacKinnon lived at home , Robinson is being held alongside Muslim prisoners . British Freedom leader Paul Weston was also detained , when he refused to leave the reception area of Wormwood Scrubs prison without news of Tommy's whereabouts and safety . ( Can anybody now doubt that habeas corpus no longer exists ? ) Tommy Robinson neither preaches hate sermons nor encourages others to be violent . He has never compromised another country's defence . So if you are reading this I hope you will find his arrest sinister and disturbing , regardless of your views on the English Defence League . At the very least follow his case and , if his extradition should be placed on the fast track , ask yourself how you 'll fare when it 's your turn to stand up against the British Establishment . 1 comment : Can we see some paper work of freezing of funds , denial of legal help , costs awarded to the Police ( 11th Sept ) . So far we just have Mr Robinson's word . All we get is tweets these days . Tweets are not effective for a proper debate or argument ."	0
917	"I have found that holy place of rest Still changeless .  – Mrs. Hemans – When Mr. Thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded by his baffled passion . He was as dizzy as if Margaret , instead of looking , and speaking , and moving like a tender graceful woman , had been a sturdy fish-wife , and given him a sound blow with her fists . He had positive bodily pain – a violent headache , and a throbbing intermittent pulse . He could not bear the noise , the garish light , the continued rumble and movement of the street . He called himself a fool for suffering so ; and yet he could not , at the moment , recollect the cause of his suffering , and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had produced . It would have been a relief to him , if he could have sat down and cried on a door-step by a little child , who was raging and storming , through his passionate tears , at some injury he had received . He said to himself , that he hated Margaret , but a wild , sharp sensation of love cleft his dull , thunderous feeling like lightning , even as he shaped the words expressive of hatred . His greatest comfort was in hugging his torment ; and in feeling , as he had indeed said to her , that though she might despise him , contemn him , treat him with her proud sovereign indifference , he did not change one whit . She could not make him change . He loved her , and would love her ; and defy her , and this miserable bodily pain . He stood still for a moment , to make this resolution firm and clear . There was an omnibus passing – going into the country ; the conductor thought he was wishing for a place , and stopped near the pavement . It was too much trouble to apologise and explain ; so he mounted upon it , and was borne away – past long rows of houses – then past detached villas with trim gardens , till they came to real country hedge-rows , and , by-and-by , to a small country town . Then every body got down ; and so did Mr. Thornton , and because they walked away he did so too . He went into the fields , walking briskly , because the sharp motion relieved his mind . He could remember all about it now ; the pitiful figure he must have cut ; the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in the world ; and had met with exactly the consequences which , in these wise moods , he had always fore-told were certain to follow , if he ever did make such a fool of himself . Was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes , that soft , half-open , sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder only yesterday ? He could not even shake off the recollection that she had been there ; that her arms had been round him , once – if never again . He only caught glimpses of her ; he did not understand her altogether . At one time she was so brave , and at another so timid ; now so tender , and then so haughty and regal-proud . And then he thought over every time he had ever seen her once again , by way of finally forgetting her . He saw her in every dress , in every mood , and did not know which became her best . Even this morning , how magnificent she had looked – her eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that , because she had shared his danger yesterday , she had cared for him the least ! If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning , as he assured himself at least twenty times he was , he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon . All that he gained in return for his sixpenny omnibus ride , was a more vivid conviction that there never was , never could be , any one like Margaret ; that she did not love him and never would ; but that she – no ! nor the whole world – should never hinder him from loving her . And so he returned to the little market-place , and remounted the omnibus to return to Milton . It was late in the afternoon when he was set down , near his warehouse . The accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of thought . He knew how much he had to do – more than his usual work , owing to the commotion of the day before . He had to see his brother magistrates ; he had to complete the arrangements , only half made in the morning , for the comfort and safety of his newly imported Irish hands ; he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the discontented work-people of Milton . Last of all , he had to go home and encounter his mother . Mrs. Thornton had sat in the dining-room all day , every moment expecting the news of her son's acceptance by Miss Hale . She had braced herself up many and many a time , at some sudden noise in the house ; had caught up the half-dropped work , and begun to ply her needle diligently , though through dimmed spectacles , and with an unsteady hand ! and many times had the door opened , and some indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand . Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray frost-bound expression , and the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency , so unusual to their sternness . She wrenched herself away from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought about to herself by her son's marriage ; she forced her thoughts into the accustomed household grooves . The newly-married couple-to-be would need fresh household stocks of linen ; and Mrs. Thornton had clothes-basket upon clothes-basket , full of table-cloths and napkins , brought in , and began to reckon up the store . There was some confusion between what was hers , and consequently marked G H T ( for George and Hannah Thornton ) , and what was her son's – bought with his money , marked with his initials . Some of those marked G H T were Dutch damask of the old kind , exquisitely fine ; none were like them now . Mrs. Thornton stood looking at them long – they had been her pride when she was first married . Then she knit her brows , and pinched and compressed her lips tight , and carefully unpicked the G H. She went so far as to search for the Turkey-red marking-thread to put in the new initials ; but it was all used – and she had no heart to send for any more just yet . So she looked fixedly at vacancy ; a series of visions passing before her , in all of which her son was the principal , the sole object – her son , her pride , her property . Still he did not come . Doubtless he was with Miss Hale . The new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his heart . A terrible pain – a pang of vain jealousy – shot through her : she hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental ; but it forced her to sit down . In a moment , she was up again as straight as ever – a grim smile upon her face for the first time that day , ready for the door opening , and the rejoicing triumphant one , who should never know the sore regret his mother felt at his marriage . In all this , there was little thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual . She was to be John's wife . To take Mrs. Thornton's place as mistress of the house , was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the supreme glory ; all household plenty and comfort , all purple and fine linen , honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , would all come as naturally as jewels on a king's robe , and be as little thought of for their separate value . To be chosen by John , would separate a kitchen-wench from the rest of the world . And Miss Hale was not so bad . If she had been a Milton lass , Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked her . She was pungent , and had taste , and spirit , and flavour in her . True , she was sadly prejudiced , and veryignorant ; but that was to be expected from her southern breeding . A strange sort of mortified comparison of Fanny with her , went on in Mrs. Thornton's mind ; and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter ; abused her roundly ; and then , as if by way of penance , she took up Henry's Commentaries , and tried to fix her attention on it , instead of pursuing the employment she took pride and pleasure in , and continuing her inspection of the table-linen . His step at last ! She heard him , even while she thought she was finishing a sentence ; while her eye did pass over it , and her memory could mechanically have repeated it word for word , she heard him come in at the hall-door . Her quickened sense could interpret every sound of motion : now he was at the hat-stand – now at the very room-door . Why did he pause ? Let her know the worst . Yet her head was down over the book ; she did not look up . He came close to the table , and stood still there , waiting till she should have finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her . By an effort she looked up . "" Well , John ? "" He knew what that little speech meant . But he had steeled himself . He longed to reply with a jest ; the bitterness of his heart could have uttered one , but his mother deserved better of him . He came round behind her , so that she could not see his looks , and , bending back her gray , stony face , he kissed it , murmuring : "" No one loves me – no one cares for me , but you , mother . "" He turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantel-piece , tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes . She stood up – she tottered . For the first time in her life , the strong woman tottered . She put her hands on his shoulders ; she was a tall woman . She looked into his face ; she made him look at her . "" Mother's love is given by God , John . It holds fast for ever and ever . A girl's love is like a puff of smoke – it changes with every wind . And she would not have you , my own lad , would not she ? "" She set her teeth ; she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth . He shook his head . "" I am not fit for her , mother ; I knew I was not . "" She ground out words between her closed teeth . He could not hear what she said ; but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curse – if not as coarsely worded , as fell in intent as ever was uttered . And yet her heart leapt up light , to know he was her own again . "" Mother ! "" said he , hurriedly , "" I can not hear a word against her . Spare me – spare me ! I am very weak in my sore heart ; – I love her yet ; I love her more than ever . "" "" And I hate her , "" said Mrs. Thornton , in a low fierce voice . "" I tried not to hate her , when she stood between you and me , because – I said to myself – she will make him happy ; and I would give my heart's blood to do that . But now , I hate her for your misery's sake . Yes , John , it 's no use hiding up your aching heart from me . I am the mother that bore you , and your sorrow is my agony ; and if you do n't hate her , I do . "" "" Then , mother , you make me love her more . She is unjustly treated by you , and I must make the balance even . But why do we talk of love or hatred ? She does not care for me , and that is enough – too much . Let us never name the subject again . It is the only thing you can do for me in the matter . Let us never name her . "" "" With all my heart . I only wish that she , and all belonging to her , were swept back to the place they came from . "" He stood still , gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer . Her dry dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him ; but she seemed just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke . "" Warrants are out against three men for conspiracy , mother . The riot yesterday helped to knock up the strike . "" And Margaret's name was no more mentioned between Mrs. Thornton and her son . They fell back into their usual mode of talk – about facts , not opinions , far less feelings . Their voices and tones were calm and cold a stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations ."	6
207	"Personnel matters Report by the Director-General Contents Developments on personnel-related matters The Organization continued to strengthen its field presence by increasing the number of Professional staff ( international and local ) in the field . As of 1 September 2008 there were 56 Professional staff in the field ( 39 international and 17 national ) , which constitutes a 43 per cent increase since the field mobility policy was launched in April 2006 . The modalities of implementation of the Young Professionals Programme ( YPP ) were finalized and a policy document was issued containing provisions for the recruitment and career management of those to be recruited under this programme . The programme aims at facilitating succession planning , knowledge retention and rejuvenating the workforce through the recruitment , on a competitive basis , of young talent into the Organization . The programme targets individuals under the age of 30 who will be recruited for a three-year fixed term appointment at the P-1 level . Once recruited they will follow a managed development programme , including the possibility of a field assignment . The YPP includes ten positions in the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation ( PTC ) and the Programme Coordination and Field Operations ( PCF ) Divisions . A revised learning policy has been presented for staff / management consultations to the Joint Advisory Committee ( JAC ) . The policy recognizes the fact that UNIDO's most important resource is its staff and the knowledge and technical expertise embodied in them . It takes into consideration the challenging and dynamic business environment , in which UNIDO is operating as well as the need for the Organization to be a learning organization . The policy also introduces some measures to encourage continuous flow of knowledge and ideas between the Organization and the external environment through partnerships and exchanges with educational and research institutions as well as other organizations . Following the success of the leadership development programme that was implemented in 2007 for managers , the Organization has introduced a management development programme for all Professional staff at the P-1 to P-4 levels as well as National Programme Officers . The programme is made up of three specific modules and seeks to enhance staff members' management skills and competencies in achieving results through working with other people and leading their subordinates . The programme will continue over two years . In addition to its regular training programmes , the Organization also introduced a number of training events to familiarize and update staff with its various administrative rules and processes . Programmes were run on the Financial Performance Control System ( FPCS ) and project management . A mandatory procurement training programme was introduced to ensure that staff members involved in procurement activities have sufficient knowledge of the related rules . Participants in the first phase of this programme do a self study of the Procurement Manual following which they undertake an intranet-based test . Upon successful completion of the test , they receive a certificate . Advanced training on procurement will also be provided covering issues such as preparing technical specifications and terms of reference , evaluating offers , procurement ethics and fiduciary oversight . Staff in duty stations away from Headquarters were also invited for a one week training programme organized in Vienna . The training included staff assigned to Investment and Technology Promotion Offices and other offices . The training focused on supporting staff in these offices to increase the offices' level of efficiency and effectiveness . Good employee relations remained a high priority for management and various actions were implemented to ensure staff engagement . The year was marked by an intensification of staff / management consultations , especially within the framework of the Joint Advisory Committee ( JAC ) . During the relevant period , meetings were held regularly ( at least once a month ) , during which staff and management representatives discussed various issues related to staff welfare , conditions of work , reviewed existing policies and consulted on new ones . The discussions included such subjects as the UNIDO Young Professionals Programme , the UNIDO policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits and investigations , the UNIDO policy on learning and performance appraisal . JAC discussions will also include the UNIDO Code of Conduct and the financial disclosure programme . The Director-General continued to meet directly with randomly selected staff members in the context of his initiative "" Dialogue with the Director-General "" . Two such meetings were held in 2008 and they continued to be a valuable forum for generating proposals , inputs and feedback on organizational issues . A similar initiative has been introduced by the Managing Director of the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation Division ( PTC ) . In addition to meeting with the Professional staff as part of the performance appraisal process , he also met with his General Service staff . The views generated from such meetings will serve as valuable inputs for management decision-making . Common system developments Salary scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories Schedule I to the staff regulations . The concept of the base / floor salary scale was introduced by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 44 / 198 , section I. H , of 21 December 1989 . The scale is set by reference to the salary scale of the comparator civil service ( the federal civil service of the United States of America ) in Washington , D. C. Periodic adjustments are made on the basis of a comparison of net base salaries of United Nations officials with the corresponding salaries of their counterparts in the United States federal civil service . By resolution 62 / 227 of 21 December 2007 , the General Assembly approved , with effect from 1 January 2008 , a revised base scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories . The scale reflects the consolidation , on a no loss / no gain basis , of 1.97 multiplier points of post adjustment into the base salary scale . The increase of the base / floor salary scale by 1.97 per cent does not affect the level of remuneration of staff , as the post adjustment portion has been reduced by the amount consolidated into the base salary . Upon implementation of the revised base salary scale , revised post adjustment indices and multipliers have been established by the International Civil Service Commission ( ICSC ) for all duty stations . Changes in post adjustment multipliers due after 1 January 2008 have been effected on the basis of the movement of the newly consolidated post adjustment indices . The revised base salary scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories , effective 1 January 2008 , is set out in annex I to this document . The financial implications of the consolidation of 1.97 per cent of post adjustment into base salaries on a no gain / no loss basis normally had an impact on two groups of staff entitlements , namely the hardship / mobility allowance and the repatriation grant . Following changes in the hardship and mobility scheme effective 1 January 2007 ( see below ) , this allowance is no longer linked to the salary scale and is no longer relevant in connection with the consolidation process . As for the repatriation grant , the consolidation resulted in a similar increase in the payments of this entitlement to eligible staff . The programme and budgets , 2008-2009 , as approved by Member States , contains provisions to absorb the related cost increases . Matters related to the staff rules Pensionable remuneration for staff in the Professional and higher categories Appendix C to the staff rules . In accordance with Article 54 ( b ) of the regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund , the scale of pensionable remuneration for the Professional and higher categories must be adjusted on the same date and by the same percentage as the net remuneration of United Nations officials serving in New York . In accordance with this provision , ICSC promulgated revised scales of pensionable remuneration effective 1 September 2007 and 1 August 2008 . These were promulgated in appendix C to the staff rules and are contained in annexes II and III to the present document . Salary scale for staff in the General Service category Appendix A to the staff rules . In accordance with the Flemming principle , General Service staff shall have pay and other conditions of employment that match the best on offer at the duty station . The principle was first stated in 1949 by a body of experts on pay established by the United Nations General Assembly . It is the cornerstone of the methodology followed by ICSC for the conduct of local salary surveys . Based upon the Flemming principle , staff regulation 6.5 ( a ) provides that "" The Director-General shall fix the salary scales for staff in the General Service and related categories , normally on the basis of the best prevailing conditions of employment in the locality , taking into account the recommendations of the International Civil Service Commission . "" According to the approved ICSC methodology , which takes account of changes in the consumer price and wages indices over a period of 12 months , and in consultation with the other Vienna-based organizations , the Director-General implemented effective 1 April 2007 an interim adjustment of the salary scales for General Service staff of 1.96 per cent . The revised scale is contained in annex IV to the present document . Assignment grant and mobility / hardship allowance Appendix N to the Staff Rules has been amended to reflect changes to the mobility and hardship scheme effective 1 January 2007 , as approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 61 / 239 of 22 December 2006 on the recommendation of the International Civil Service Commission . Following extensive consultations on the modalities of implementation of the revised scheme among the United Nations Common System Organizations , the scheme was implemented with appropriate transitional measures . The new Appendix N containing the revised conditions is shown in annex V to the present document with deletions shown in square brackets and amendments being underlined . Staff rule 103.12 on Appointment and Promotion Board Staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) has been amended to indicate that posts in the General Service category in field duty stations are exempt from submission to the General Service Selection Panel of the Appointment and Promotion Board . The revised staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) is contained in annex VI to the present document with amendments being underlined . The amendment was introduced in the interest of efficiency while the competitive process was maintained and is implemented locally . Financial implications The financial implications of the above changes have been anticipated in the programme and budgets for the biennium 2008-2009 . Social Security Agreement Negotiations between UNIDO and the Republic of Austria regarding a new social security agreement as a supplementary agreement to the Headquarters Agreement of 1995 ( decision GC . 6 / Dec. 21 refers ) have been concluded . The agreement will be presented to the Board at its thirty-sixth session for approval and may be provisionally applied pending its approval by the Industrial Development Board and the General Conference and its entry into force . Action required by the Board The Board may wish to consider the adoption of the following draft decision : "" The Industrial Development Board ; "" ( a ) Takes note of the information contained in document IDB . 35 / 13 ; "" ( b ) Notes the amendments made in pursuance to staff regulation 13.3 to schedule I of the staff regulations in order to bring them into conformity with the decision of the General Assembly set out in resolution 62 / 227 ; "" ( c ) Also notes the amendment to appendices A , C and N to the staff rules and to the staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) .

If the staff member did not remain for at least three years , recovery of a one-month lump sum shall be effected . If , however , the staff member's appointment or expected duration of assignment to the duty station is for two years or less , only one month's net base salary ( plus appropriate additional elements ) is payable ; the second month's net base salary ( plus appropriate additional elements ) is payable at the start of the third year at the duty station if the staff member's appointment or assignment is extended to a total period of three years or more .

Mobility / hardship allowance ( a ) Staff members in the Professional and higher categories , including project personnel and internationally recruited General Service staff members , who are appointed or assigned to a duty station for one year or more shall be eligible for the payment of a mobility / hardship allowance . The allowance shall be paid according to the staff member's entitlements with respect to the following components of the allowance : ( i ) The mobility element , as an incentive [ to staff of organizations participating in the United Nations common system to accept reassignments to different duty stations ] for the geographic mobility of staff ; ( ii ) The hardship element , [ as an incentive to staff to serve at field duty stations with varying degrees of hardship ] as compensation for the varying degrees of hardship at different duty stations ; ( iii ) The non removal element , as compensation for the non removal of personal effects and household goods . ( b ) [ The staff member's entitlement to the allowance are reckoned in terms of percentage points of a base salary rate , as defined in paragraph ( d ) below . With respect to each of the three elements , the percentage points may be accrued as follows : ] Lump sum payments of the mobility / hardship allowances are made in the form of flat amounts set by the International Civil Service Commission . The amount of the allowances payable to each eligible staff member may vary as follows : ( i ) Mobility [ element : ] allowance : At H duty stations , nil for the first three assignments . Mobility allowance is paid upon [ 4 percentage points for ] the fourth assignment ( provided that at least two of the previous assignments were at A-E [ field ] duty stations ) . [ and 6 percentage points for the fifth and subsequent assignments ; ] For payment purposes , the number of assignments are grouped as four to six assignments and seven or more assignments ; b . At [ all other ] A-E duty stations , nil for the first assignment [ ; ] . Mobility allowance is paid upon [ 10 percentage points for ] the second assignment . - [ and 2 additional percentage points for each subsequent assignment up to and including the fifth assignment ; ] For payment purposes , the number of assignments are grouped as two to three assignments , four to six assignments and seven or more assignments ; ( ii ) Hardship [ element ] allowance : nil for H and A duty stations .

[ ( c ) The matrix below shows the various combinations of percentage points that may be accrued cumulatively on account of the three elements of the allowance . Mobility / hardship allowance matrix a Plus 3 per cent if the staff member is not entitled to the removal of household goods . b Provided that the staff member has previously served on two or more assignments in A E duty stations , otherwise no entitlement is payable . c Minus 5 per cent if the staff member receives full household removal . ] [ ( d ) ] ( c ) [ The actual amount of the allowance is determined by applying the percentage points to a base salary rate , which is equivalent to the net base salary of staff at the mid point of the Professional salary scale , i . e . P 4 , step VI , at the dependency rate . This base salary rate is applicable to staff at levels P 4 and P 5 . It is increased by 13 per cent for staff at levels D1 and above and reduced by 13 per cent for staff at levels P 1 to P 3 and internationally recruited General Service staff . For staff who have no dependent spouse or child , the allowance is calculated at 75 per cent of the base salary rate appropriate to their grade . ] The mobility / hardship allowances are flat amounts . Payments are differentiated by the following grade groupings : P-1 to P-3 and internationally recruited General Service staff , P-4 and P-5 and D-1 and above . Single staff shall receive 75 per cent of the flat amount paid to staff with dependants of the corresponding grade range . [ ( e ) ] ( d ) The mobility / hardship allowance is payable to all eligible staff [ including those serving in their own country ] and is non pensionable . [ The allowance is normally paid in a lump sum at the beginning of each 12 month period that the staff member is expected to remain at the duty station or pro rata as appropriate . ] [ ( f ) ] ( e ) The allowance shall be payable at the dependency rate to a staff member with recognized dependants , irrespective of where the dependants actually reside . When both husband and wife are staff members entitled to the allowance , it shall be paid to each of them in an amount calculated on the basis of his or her own salary level . [ ( g ) ] ( f ) Staff members who are assigned to a particular duty station and are then placed in travel or mission status while in receipt of a daily subsistence allowance ( DSA ) shall be eligible for the mobility / hardship allowance in respect of the duty station to which they were originally assigned and not in respect of the duty station at which they are in travel or mission status . Mobility element [ ( h ) ] ( g ) Entitlement to the mobility element is subject to the requirement that the staff member concerned should have had five or more consecutive years of service in an organization participating in the United Nations common system . This requirement may be considered as met if the staff member has accumulated five years of service within a period of six consecutive years . Continuity of service is not considered as broken by periods of special leave without pay , but full months of any such period are not to be credited as service for the purpose of this allowance . [ ( i ) ] ( h ) In counting the number of assignments for the application of the mobility element , the following guidelines will be taken into account : ( A ) An assignment will not be counted as such unless it involves the installation of the staff member at the duty station ( i . e . payment by the Organization of travel expenses and the assignment grant ) except in the case of an initial appointment for one year or more where no travel expenses and assignment grant have been paid ; ( B ) Any period of service on travel or mission status while in receipt of DSA will not be counted as an assignment . However , if such status is extended beyond one year at the same duty station , that period will be so counted ; ( C ) If a staff member is posted to a duty station for an initial period of less than one year and the period is subsequently extended so that service at the duty station equals or exceeds one year , such service will be counted as an assignment ; ( D ) In the case of consecutive assignments of less than one year at different duty stations during which the staff member is paid post adjustment under staff rule 106.04 ( c ) ( i ) or 206.12 ( d ) , the combined periods of such assignments may be counted as one assignment ; ( E ) If a staff member is assigned to a duty station for a period of one year or more and the period is subsequently reduced on the initiative of the Organization to less than a year's duration , such service should normally be counted as an assignment . [ ( j ) ] ( i ) Transfers , secondments and loans to other organizations participating in the United Nations common system are treated in the same way as movement within the Organization for the purpose of the mobility element , i . e . in order to be counted as an assignment , such transfers , secondments and loans should be for a period of one year or more and involve a change of duty station . [ ( k ) ] ( j ) The mobility allowance is paid in monthly instalments . Payment ceases after [ After ] five years of service at the same duty station . [ , the mobility element is reduced by 10 percentage points on the matrix ; and if the duty station is one of the H duty stations , the mobility element will be reduced to nil . This limited period of five years may exceptionally be extended by the Organization up to one more year , if the staff member : ( a ) remains at the duty station on the initiative of the Organization ; or ( b ) is expected to be reassigned before the end of the sixth year . ] Hardship element [ ( l ) ] ( k ) The hardship element is payable from the initial appointment or the first assignment of a staff member to any of the duty stations classified in the B , C , D or E category , provided that the staff member meets the general conditions of eligibility for the allowance . Payments are made in monthly instalments . It remains applicable for the entire duration of the staff member's service at the duty station and for as long as that duty station remains classified in the category concerned . Upon a change in the classified category , an appropriate adjustment of [ the percentage points for ] the hardship element and the resulting amount of payment will be made . Non-removal element [ ( m ) ] ( l ) The element for non removal is applicable for a maximum period of five years at one duty station , provided the staff member is not entitled to a removal of household goods , irrespective of the length of his or her total consecutive service with an organization participating in the United Nations common system or at the duty station . Payments will be made in a lump-sum at the beginning of the assignment , up to a maximum of five years . [ This period may , exceptionally , be extended for up to two more years at the discretion of the Director-General . ] Annex VI Staff Rule 103.12 Appointment and Promotion Board ( a ) ( i ) An Appointment and Promotion Board shall be established by the Director-General to give advice on the appointment and promotion of staff in the Professional and General Service categories , and at the D-2 and D-1 levels , except for staff in the Office of the Director-General , heads of the Bureaux reporting to the Director-General , entry grades G-1 / G-2 in the General Service category and staff in the General Service category serving at field duty stations ; For reasons of economy , this document has been printed in a limited number .

1671	"World War I , also called First World War or Great War , an international conflict that in 1914 – 18 embroiled most of the nations of Europe along with Russia , the United States , the Middle East , and other regions . The war pitted the Central Powers – mainly Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey – against the Allies – mainly France , Great Britain , Russia , Italy , Japan , and , from 1917 , the United States . It ended with the defeat of the Central Powers . The war was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter , carnage , and destruction it caused . A British soldier inside a trench on the Western Front during World War I , 1914 – 18 . Hulton Archive / Getty Images World War I was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history . It led to the fall of four great imperial dynasties ( in Germany , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey ) , resulted in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia , and , in its destabilization of European society , laid the groundwork for World War II . A collection of significant facts about World War I. The outbreak of war With Serbia already much aggrandized by the two Balkan Wars ( 1912 – 13 , 1913 ) , Serbian nationalists turned their attention back to the idea of "" liberating "" the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary . Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević , head of Serbia's military intelligence , was also , under the alias "" Apis , "" head of the secret society Union or Death , pledged to the pursuit of this pan-Serbian ambition . Believing that the Serbs' cause would be served by the death of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand , heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph , and learning that the Archduke was about to visit Bosnia on a tour of military inspection , Apis plotted his assassination . Nikola Pašić , the Serbian prime minister and an enemy of Apis , heard of the plot and warned the Austrian government of it , but his message was too cautiously worded to be understood . Overview of the start of World War I , including details of the June 28 , 1914 , assassination of ... Europeans were fighting heavily on two fronts before the U.S. entered the war in 1917 . At 11 : 15 am on June 28 , 1914 , in the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife , Sophie , duchess of Hohenberg , were shot dead by a Bosnian Serb , Gavrilo Princip . The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff , Franz , Graf ( count ) Conrad von Hötzendorf , and the foreign minister , Leopold , Graf von Berchtold , saw the crime as the occasion for measures to humiliate Serbia and so to enhance Austria-Hungary's prestige in the Balkans . Conrad had already ( October 1913 ) been assured by William II of Germany ' s support if Austria-Hungary should start a preventive war against Serbia . This assurance was confirmed in the week following the assassination , before William , on July 6 , set off upon his annual cruise to the North Cape , off Norway . Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife , Sophie , riding in an open carriage at Sarajevo ... Henry Guttmann – Hulton Archive / Getty Images The Austrians decided to present an unacceptable ultimatum to Serbia and then to declare war , relying on Germany to deter Russia from intervention . Though the terms of the ultimatum were finally approved on July 19 , its delivery was postponed to the evening of July 23 , since by that time the French president , Raymond Poincaré , and his premier , René Viviani , who had set off on a state visit to Russia on July 15 , would be on their way home and therefore unable to concert an immediate reaction with their Russian allies . When the delivery was announced , on July 24 , Russia declared that Austria-Hungary must not be allowed to crush Serbia . Serbia replied to the ultimatum on July 25 , accepting most of its demands but protesting against two of them – namely , that Serbian officials ( unnamed ) should be dismissed at Austria-Hungary's behest and that Austro-Hungarian officials should take part , on Serbian soil , in proceedings against organizations hostile to Austria-Hungary . Though Serbia offered to submit the issue to international arbitration , Austria-Hungary promptly severed diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilization . Home from his cruise on July 27 , William learned on July 28 how Serbia had replied to the ultimatum . At once he instructed the German Foreign Office to tell Austria-Hungary that there was no longer any justification for war and that it should content itself with a temporary occupation of Belgrade . But , meanwhile , the German Foreign Office had been giving such encouragement to Berchtold that already on July 27 he had persuaded Franz Joseph to authorize war against Serbia . War was in fact declared on July 28 , and Austro-Hungarian artillery began to bombard Belgrade the next day . Russia then ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary , and on July 30 , when Austria-Hungary was riposting conventionally with an order of mobilization on its Russian frontier , Russia ordered general mobilization . Germany , which since July 28 had still been hoping , in disregard of earlier warning hints from Great Britain , that Austria-Hungary's war against Serbia could be "" localized "" to the Balkans , was now disillusioned insofar as eastern Europe was concerned . On July 31 Germany sent a 24-hour ultimatum requiring Russia to halt its mobilization and an 18-hour ultimatum requiring France to promise neutrality in the event of war between Russia and Germany . Both Russia and France predictably ignored these demands . On August 1 Germany ordered general mobilization and declared war against Russia , and France likewise ordered general mobilization . The next day Germany sent troops into Luxembourg and demanded from Belgium free passage for German troops across its neutral territory . On August 3 Germany declared war against France . In the night of August 3 – 4 German forces invaded Belgium . Thereupon , Great Britain , which had no concern with Serbia and no express obligation to fight either for Russia or for France but was expressly committed to defend Belgium , on August 4 declared war against Germany . Austria-Hungary declared war against Russia on August 5 ; Serbia against Germany on August 6 ; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7 and against Germany on August 12 ; France and Great Britain against Austria-Hungary on August 10 and on August 12 , respectively ; Japan against Germany on August 23 ; Austria-Hungary against Japan on August 25 and against Belgium on August 28 . Romania had renewed its secret anti-Russian alliance of 1883 with the Central Powers on February 26 , 1914 , but now chose to remain neutral . Italy had confirmed the Triple Alliance on December 7 , 1912 , but could now propound formal arguments for disregarding it : first , Italy was not obliged to support its allies in a war of aggression ; second , the original treaty of 1882 had stated expressly that the alliance was not against England . On September 5 , 1914 , Russia , France , and Great Britain concluded the Treaty of London , each promising not to make a separate peace with the Central Powers . Thenceforth , they could be called the Allied , or Entente , powers , or simply the Allies . The outbreak of war in August 1914 was generally greeted with confidence and jubilation by the peoples of Europe , among whom it inspired a wave of patriotic feeling and celebration . Few people imagined how long or how disastrous a war between the great nations of Europe could be , and most believed that their country's side would be victorious within a matter of months . The war was welcomed either patriotically , as a defensive one imposed by national necessity , or idealistically , as one for upholding right against might , the sanctity of treaties , and international morality . Britannica Web sites World War I lasted from 1914 to 1918 . It was known at first as the Great War and the War to End All Wars . It was the largest war that the world had seen up to that time . Most of the battles took place in Europe and the Middle East . More than 8 million soldiers and sailors died , and more than 20 million were injured . The war was so bad that many people thought no one would ever start another war . However , the results of World War I helped to cause World War II , which broke out in 1939 . A major international conflict fought from 1914 to 1918 , World War I was the most deadly and destructive war the world had ever seen to that time . More than 25 countries eventually participated , aligned with either the Allied or the Central powers . The Allies-who won the war-included primarily France , Great Britain , Russia , Italy , Japan , and , from 1917 , the United States . The Central Powers consisted mainly of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and the Ottoman Empire ( Turkey ) . World War I felled four great imperial dynasties , in Germany , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey . It led to revolution in Russia , destabilized Europe , and laid the foundations for World War II . ( For a chronology of events for World War I , see World War I Chronology . )"	4

"" "" Told me that you have a , a -- "" she began . "" -- Love , just hang on . "" Then Spike shot him a look as narrow-eyed and vicious as any in the Big Bad's pre-conscience arsenal . "" Giles . Go , and take Anya with you . "" Leaning on Anya's supporting arm , he got to his feet . Much as he enjoyed being this close to her , he was damn tired of the tottering-old-man moves . Also , his ribs stung , even though he knew Spike had tried not to break anything when saving his life . All in all , it was n't the post-crisis image he had hoped to project , which lent an edge to his voice : "" Keys then , mate . "" "" What ? "" "" Keys . I 'm not bloody walking . Give me the car keys . "" Spike jerked away from Buffy's pinioning arms , dug in his pocket , then hurled them hard , straight and over-arm . Should have guessed the little twerp was a fast bowler , Giles thought . Not being a fool , he did n't attempt a catch but let the keys fall in the dust behind him . "" I 'll get them for you , Rupert . "" Anya bent down , a pleasing angle , and retrieved them . "" Although I could always just have teleported -- "" "" No ! "" He had to take a breath , lower his voice . "" No , dear , I 'd prefer to drive . "" And he crooked his arm for her . "" Would you care to accompany me ? "" She looked at him for a second , then inclined her head and accepted his escort to the DeSoto . *** When he heard the car pull away , Spike turned away from Buffy . There lay the ruins of what once had been Sunnydale High , deceptively picturesque in the moonlight . They had had their first real confrontation in those halls . He could almost hear the echoes in the still night : "" As a personal favour from me to you , I promise I 'll make it quick . It wo n't hurt a bit . "" And her soft-voiced "" No , Spike . It 's gonna hurt a lot . "" He had had no idea how much , he thought . He really had n't . Then he was spun around hard , and Buffy grabbed the coat again . "" Is it true ? What Giles said ? You have a soul now . "" "" Yes , although I 'd prefer you not to call it -- "" She pushed him away with Slayer-strength , and he stumbled back several feet . "" What the bloody hell was that for ? "" "" For you being you , stupid idiot ! What did you do ? What were you thinking ? To go off ... to make me ... let me ... oh God , I ca n't breathe -- "" and she fell to her knees , sobbing . He cursed under his breath , then dropped down beside her . "" Oh , love . Please . Please do n't . "" She shook with the force of her tears , her body almost coming apart , and he could n't bear it . Tentatively he put his arms around her -- she at once tried to crawl into his lap , but he was n't situated quite right . The two of them struggled , almost toppling over , but he used his strength to balance and find a place for her . And then he rocked her , murmuring "" Darling , darling "" into her hair as she let out months of accumulated pain in almost animal wails . He wrapped his hands around hers and held on . *** Giles wrapped his hands tightly around the old steering wheel . Anya was sitting quietly in the passenger seat , looking out the cracks of the painted windshield , and he could n't stop turning his head to make sure she was still there , still next to him . "" Giles , why do you keep looking at me ? "" Well , it is Anya , he thought , he should expect the honest question .

The tearing sobs soon subsided into hiccuping breaths , and now she sat quietly , cradled in his lap , her small hands surrounded by his . But of course that would n't last either . He started counting in his head : one , two , three , four -- And she pushed up and off , one boot digging into his shin as she moved . She was such a wounded creature , he thought , so far from the happy girl he 'd first seen twirling , hands in the air , at the Bronze . But she was strong . And it was the strong Buffy who turned to face him now . She had dashed tears away , but the tracks were still visible in the moonlight . Her face was set , but not cold -- a gain , a definite gain , he thought . Then she said something he had n't anticipated : "" Who did you kill ? "" Fabulous . A trick question . "" What ? Pet , I did n't keep a list or anything . Well other than -- "" And for the first time in his long unlife he managed to bite back , literally , the completely stupid comment "" of Slayers "" which was coming next . He could taste the blood on his tongue . "" No. No , Spike . I mean , who did you kill so that you got cursed with a soul . "" Bloody buggering hell . Bloody bollocks of a bog-trotting son of a bitch , the Poof struck again . Fired by a blast of sudden crackling rage , Spike leapt to his feet and roared , "" No one ! Not in a long time , oh , DAMN it ! "" He stalked forward . "" See , this is why I did n't tell you . Besides that we got busy and I forgot . You had to bring him into it , did n't you ? ' S never about Spike , no , it 's all about HIM . "" He whirled , paced away from her so that he would n't unleash fist or fangs . He should have guessed , why had n't he guessed . She spun him around again , and he snarled . She did n't run . Got closer , hands on the duster , fingernails digging in . "" Then how the hell did you get a soul , if not cursed ? Wal-Mart ? Buy-and-sell-souls-dot-com ? ' Cause I 'm really eager to know . "" "" Oh are you ? Could n't tell from over here . Been back two sodding days , have n't heard much in the way of inquiry about where I 've been or what I 've been doing . Why the bloody hell would I bother to tell you anything ? "" "" I saved you this morning ! And I told you not to dust ! "" "" Yeah , ' cause you wanted to kill me yourself . God , Buffy . "" And the anger burned out as quickly as it had come . He put his hands over hers , holding her to him . This was going to be worse than the quest itself . "" Right then . After I hurt you so badly ... before , you know ... I realized I could n't stay the way I was . Torn up . So I heard about this spirit-caller half a world away , and I decided I 'd see what there was to see . Find out if there was something else I could do or be . "" Her eyes were locked on him . He could n't read them , though , and he swallowed hard . "" Managed to get to the shaman , and he sent me inside myself . I wo n't tell you what I saw or did , but end result , a conscience and no chip . "" He managed a short , pain-filled laugh . "" We 're not calling it a soul for the very reason you just demonstrated . I 'm not Peaches , nor was meant to be . "" She looked at him for a long moment . Her fingers intertwined with his , pressed briefly , then pulled away . "" Oh , Spike . You might not be Angel . But you keep changing on me . "" She brushed a butterfly kiss on his lips , then she walked away from him . He stood there in the moonlight . Yeah , he had had no idea how much it was going to hurt . *** "" Damn it , that hurt ! "" Giles snapped , briefly coming out of his fog of lust . Almost stretched out in the front seat of the DeSoto , lips and hands fully engaged on top of the sweet-smelling and quite delightfully aggressive ( if still unfortunately clothed ) Anya , was a location next door to paradise . If only he did n't keep hitting the steering column whenever he moved . "" What ? Wait . Wait . Giles , get off . "" And Anya pushed him back into the steering column , hitting right on the fresh bruise . Bloody buggery hell . Swallowing a more inventive stream of curses and firmly shoving Ripper ( now growling in frustration ) back into the mental box where he usually lived , Giles managed to scramble back to his side of the car . Breathe in and breathe out , old man . Think of tweed . Think of Travers . Anya took her own series of deep calming breaths , settling back into the passenger seat . The two sat there a moment , separate , staring into black glass . Then Giles managed , his voice almost normal , "" Anya ? You all right ? "" "" I think so . "" His hand went towards hers , but she moved a bit further away from him . "" Giles , would you say my name ? "" "" Darling Anya . "" Her brown eyes did n't waver from his . Oh , right . "" Anyanka . "" Those eyes filled with tears . "" You do n't want to be with Anyanka , do you ? Not really . "" Did he want to love a demon ? He 'd never imagined , even in his chaos-worshiping days , such a question posed to him . But he needed to answer it honestly . He took a moment to organize his thoughts , then claimed her hand . "" I want to be with you . The vengeance part deeply troubles me , I admit ; the idea of you hurting people throughout dimensions , well ... But strangely , er , I do n't actually mind the demon part . "" He risked a small grin . "" At least when you 're Anyanka , I 'm the younger man . "" "" Are you worried about age ? Because from what I can tell , you 're far more skilled than , say , Xander , which -- "" "" Darling , stop right there . Please , no comparisons . Ever . "" She squeezed his hand . "" But you 're better so far . "" He could n't repress a laugh , and she smiled at him . Then her expression shifted , back to that thinking-hard face he 'd seen a thousand times , over invoices or a question of demon history or that stock-market website she favoured , and his heart melted . Then she turned to him . "" I have to go right now . I have something to do . But I 'll be back soon . "" She released his hand , then disapparated . He stared at the empty space beside him . God , he needed a drink . Of his private stock . *** Spike's right hand reached for his glass , and he took a swallow of extremely good brandy . As golden as the lamplight in which he sat , it warmed him a bit . Then he bent to his task again , his left hand moving across the page of his notebook . The bell over the door rang , and he looked up to see Giles . "" What are you doing in the Magic Box , Spike ? And how did you get in ? "" "" Did n't want to go home . Came through the basement . "" He returned to his notebook . Giles walked over to the table and picked up the bottle of brandy . Spike did n't need to look up to know that Rupert's eyebrows were up around his ( receding ) hairline : poor Watcher had n't realized Spike had found the good stuff months ago . Then Giles fetched another glass , came back to the table , and sat . He poured his own , then took a sip . Spike finished the sentence he was writing , then drank again . Giles scrutinized him , but at least it was n't the Ripper stare he 'd used to terrorize Xander . He took another drink . Giles mirrored his action , then put his glass on the table . "" So what happened with you and Buffy after Anya and I left ? "" "" Bollocksed everything up . And you ? "" "" Almost got shagged . "" The two burst into shared laughter , which dwindled into chuckles , until the Magic Box was silent . Giles spoke again . "" What are you writing ? "" Spike pushed the notebook across the table . Giles adjusted his glasses and read through the page , then flipped back a page or two more . "" This is very good . Very clear , detailed . "" "" I started keeping records on her fights after you left . Well , as many as I knew about . Got the rest back at the crypt . "" "" The Watcher's Council would be interested in these . "" Spike snorted . Yeah , he was sure the Council of Wankers would just love a vampire's field reports . "" I appreciate the praise , Rupes . But I think they 'd prefer an actual Watcher's comments , yeah ? And now that you 're back -- "" "" Sunnydale 's not my home any more . "" The words fell into a hush . Spike thought Giles had rather surprised himself with them . "" I 'm still connected here , still tied . I wo n't cut myself off again , as I did this past year . But I do n't live here . "" "" Y ' know , I felt like that in London . "" Giles raised his eyebrows , and Spike shrugged . "" I love the old girl , I really do . Have a favourite spot , in fact : nighttime , obviously , on the terrace of Somerset House , overlooking the river . The weight of the stone behind me , the sound of traffic and water below , the lights on the South Bank opposite . Time passes sweetly there . "" He picked up his glass again , swirled the brandy around the bowl . Giles did the same , meditatively . "" But Sunnyhell is where my heart is . "" The bell of the door jangled again , and Buffy came in . Spike nodded across the table . "" As you see . "" Giles drained his glass , then stood . "" I 've still got the car , Spike . "" He walked to the door , then gave Buffy a hug . She clung to him for a moment , then they let each other go . He smiled down at her . "" Do n't let Spike bollocks it up again . And do n't you either , my dear . "" And he left them alone . Spike was thankful he did n't have to breathe , because he was n't sure he could . Buffy hesitated , her eyes on the floor , then she came to him . Not all the way , though ; she hovered just out of reach . "" You were n't at the crypt . "" "" No. "" "" I was afraid you were gone . "" "" Again , no . Just came back , did n't I. "" She nodded . And , with a sudden swirl of air , she sat on his lap . He crushed his lips to her hair -- God , he loved her hair -- and waited . She wound her fingers through his , and said with a rush , "" The thing I forgot tonight ? When you told me ? "" He tightened his grip . "" Change is n't always a bad thing . "" And her mouth was on his . *** Giles stood in the shadows of the alley besides the DeSoto , jingling his keys . Good to know that someone would be happy tonight , even if once again it would n't be Rupert Giles . He was bloody tired of being left out , but there it was . He wished it was n't . "" Rupert . "" He turned to see Anya standing in the moonlight , just outside the alley . She took one step toward him , then another . "" I had to see D ' Hoffryn . Because I 'm not sure I want to be human again , what with all the pain and confusion and the dying , but I know I want to be with you . So I had to check with D ' Hoffryn , to see if I could quit but not actually quit , if you see what I mean -- "" He did n't remember moving , but he was there and she was in his arms . He fisted one hand in her hair , thrust a knee between her thighs , kissed her as deeply as he had dreamed about in those long and lonely months . Then he swung her around , maneuvered her . And it was Ripper's voice that came out of his mouth : "" We 'll bloody talk about this later . "" "" Oh , Rupie , "" she moaned as he lowered her to the bonnet of the car . *** For the moment as giddy as the girl she had been when he first met her , Buffy swung Spike's hand . He closed the Magic Box door behind them , and she pulled him into the moonlight . "" I guess I have n't been the brightest star tonight in the now-safely-Toller-free sky , have I. "" "" You get no argument from me . "" She thwapped him on the shoulder , then snuggled close as they started to walk . "" I do have to check on Dawnie and Willow , but then -- "" she smiled at him -- "" let 's see if we can manage not to break any furniture . "" His lips trailed down her neck and further , then she pushed his head away and put a finger to his open mouth . "" Do you hear something ? "" From the alley opposite came the sound of a muffled thud , thud against metal , then mingled , synchronized gasps . "" No , I do n't hear a damned thing . Walk with me , love , walk with me . "" She rolled her eyes but followed as he pulled her more quickly down the street . He smiled at her , thinking , Tosser 's going to pay if he makes any dents ."	6
23	"The Making of China's Trade Deficit BEIJING – China registered a monthly trade deficit of $ 7 . 2 billion in March 2010 , its first since April 2004 . And yet , at around the same time , the United States Congress issued its loudest call ever to classify China as an exchange-rate manipulator , accusing Chinese leaders of maintaining the renminbi's peg to the dollar in order to guarantee a permanent bilateral trade surplus . China's March trade deficit indicates , first of all , that it is incorrect to claim that Chinese economic growth depends mainly on exports . Exports are an important part of the Chinese economy , and any global market fluctuation or external shock will certainly have an impact on overall growth . But , like any other large economy , China's economy is driven by domestic consumption and investment . Indeed , China's exports fell by 16 % year on year in 2009 , owing to the global financial crisis and recession . Nevertheless , annual GDP grew by 8.7 % , thanks to 16.9 % growth in consumption ( measured by gross sale of consumer goods ) and a 33.3 % surge in fixed-investment demand . Moreover , although China's "" trade dependency "" is now reckoned to be 70 % of GDP , that figure is greatly distorted by the fact that Chinese exports require massive imports of materials and parts . The net value added of total Chinese foreign trade accounts for only about 15 % of GDP . Thus , net exports contributed 10.8 % to China's overall GDP growth rate , or only about 1.1 percentage point of 9 % growth in 2008 . Compare that figure to Germany , where net exports accounted for 64 % of growth in 2008 . Similarly , the figure was 33 % in Japan , 28.6 % in Korea , and 20 % in the Philippines . Clearly , China is nothing special in this regard . To be sure , China's domestic consumption is not as high as it should be , standing at 49 % of GDP in 2008 , with household consumption accounting for only 35 % . Such figures have led many observers to believe that overall domestic demand must be low , leaving China dependent on external markets for growth . But domestic demand , which determines imports , consists not only of consumption , but also of fixed-asset investment . Indeed , rapid growth in investment may translate into high import growth and trade deficits . That is exactly what is happening in China now . Some people may argue that investment growth without consumption growth will result in overcapacity and eventually lead to recession . Perhaps . But we need to remind ourselves that housing investment accounts for about 30 % of China's total fixed investment , with much of the rest directed toward infrastructure – that is , long-term , durable public infrastructure investments – including subways , railways , highways , urban public facilities , and the national water system . Moreover , one can easily imagine that import demand would soar further if the US and the European Union lifted their bans on exports of high-tech products to China . In that case , the trade deficit recorded in March could be at least 40 % higher . The renminbi's exchange rate , then , is really a secondary factor in China's external account . Put another way , the global imbalance could be corrected more efficiently by addressing other , more fundamental factors . The fundamental factors underlying the US external imbalance are large fiscal deficits and low household savings , owing to excessive financial leverage . The fundamental factors on the Chinese side are high corporate and household savings , together with some distortion of resource / utility prices . Indeed , the current situation indicates that a significant adjustment in exchange rates may not be needed at all in order to redress global imbalances . If that is true , and China should n't worry about the renminbi's exchange rate , should it worry about its economy overheating ? After all , its previous trade deficits in the era of reform – such as in 1992-1996 and 2003-2004 – all occurred at times of overheating . But there are differences between now and those earlier periods . For example , when rapid investment growth in 2004 led to overheating , world markets were booming . At that time , both domestic investment and exports required immediate tightening . Today , by contrast , although domestic investment is growing very strongly , external demand has not recovered to its previous levels . The result is the March trade deficit , caused mainly by exceptionally high annual import growth ( 65 % ) coupled with relatively low export growth , which reached a nominally impressive 24 % only because of the sharp decline recorded in the base period . Such a single-factor situation is easier to deal with than the double-factor situation of 2004 , and because the high investment demand has been mainly stimulus-related this time , policymakers can handle it in a more timely fashion if they perceive a problem . That said , the ratio of capital formation does require careful monitoring . The last time China saw such high growth in domestic investment , the savings rate was not as high as it is now . The problem currently is that a trade deficit has emerged at a time when the national saving rate is as high as 51 % . That means that investment is extremely high – and that , despite the high share of infrastructure investment , there is an urgent need to manage the potential risks ."	0
311	Carlos Fallanty lost his wife at the time of the Violent Unknown Event . She was a voluble , untidy woman who made her own clothes and washed once a week in the water wrung out of the laundry . She was invaluable to her husband . She looked after his poultry , kept his accounts , and when roused , was as uxorious a wife as Carlos could wish to have . On the night of June 12th of the VUE , Carlos's wife suffered a stroke , and Carlos transferred his affection to a turkey . The VUE Directory records for Carlos a debilitating malfunction of the left ventricle , bone-marrow disease , and save for the VUE immortality clause , would have normally given him six months to live . Carlos had buried his wife in the floor of his greenhouse . The local authorities later had the body exhumed . Now Carlos lived in the greenhouse to keep his turkey company . A fowl-pest epidemic finally erased Carlos's other poultry , and two veterinary officials came to make sure he had burnt or buried all the corpses . Insisting that the one remaining bird should be destroyed as well , the vet promised to compensate Carlos with at least a set of photographs . These are the photographs taken as the vet stalked the bird with his camera , whilst the vet's assistant stalked the bird with a shotgun . Carlos was not happy with the photographs . He is now awaiting trial at Clichy for shooting the vet .	6
200	Report of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention Note by the secretariat * Contents Paragraphs Page Mandate The Conference of the Parties ( COP ) , at its fifth session , by its decision 8 / CP . 5 , decided to establish the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ( CGE ) , with the objective of improving the preparation of national communications from these Parties ( non-Annex I Parties ) . In order to fulfil this objective , the COP , in the annex to this decision , mandated the CGE to : Exchange experience and information on the preparation of national communications , including consideration of subregional experience , through meetings and workshops , on the basis of agendas prepared in consultation with the participants ; Consider , as appropriate , the needs for and availability of financial resources and technical support , and the identification of barriers to and gaps in this support ; Consider , as appropriate , information in national communications from non-Annex I Parties in accordance with the guidelines for the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties contained in the annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 ; Review existing activities and programmes to facilitate and support the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties with a view to identifying gaps and making recommendations to better coordinate these activities and programmes in order to enhance the preparation of national communications ; Identify the difficulties encountered by non-Annex I Parties in the use of the guidelines contained in the annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 and in the use of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) methodologies and other models , and make recommendations for improvement where appropriate ; Identify the analytical and methodological issues , including technical problems in the preparation and reporting of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) inventories , in particular with respect to the improvement of data collection , the development of local and regional emission factors and activity data , and the development of methodologies , where appropriate , with a view to enhancing the quality of future inventories ; Examine national communications , in particular greenhouse gas inventories , submitted by non-Annex I Parties , with a view to arriving at recommendations on ways of overcoming difficulties in the use of the IPCC methodologies and the UNFCCC guidelines relating to inventories contained in the annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 , and on possible innovations , and produce reports thereon ; Encourage interaction among experts from all Parties . The COP further , at it seventh session , in decision 31 / CP . 7 , decided that the CGE shall continue to have the objective of improving the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties . By the same decision , the COP also decided that in addition to its mandate contained in the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 , as outlined above , the CGE shall identify and assess technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them , and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies , and shall also provide input to the draft improved guidelines for the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties . The COP , pursuant to decision 31 / CP . 7 , mandated the CGE to conduct two workshops during 2002 , with the objective of sharing experiences to ensure adequate coverage of issues referred to in paragraph 2 above . Scope of the report This document contains a summary of the main issues , technical problems and constraints relating to the preparation of national communications and those that have particularly affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them ( section III ) , and the activities and programmes that facilitated and supported the preparation of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( section IV ) . Section V outlines the recommendations made by the CGE for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Possible actions by the subsidiary bodies The Subsidiary Body for Implementation ( SBI ) may wish to take note of the information presented in this document with a view to improving the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In particular , the SBI may wish to recommend to the COP , a draft decision on further guidance for the future work of the CGE in improving the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . In addition , the SBI may wish to consider the recommendations made by the CGE , contained in this report , and make these recommendations available , through the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice , to the IPCC , with a view to developing appropriate methods , tools and models for use in non-Annex I Parties . The SBI may also wish to consider the information contained in this document and make available recommendations , through the COP , to the bilateral and multilateral support programmes to provide additional financial resources and technical support for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Organization of work Pursuant to decisions 8 / CP . 5 and 31 / CP . 7 , the CGE held five meetings , each immediately prior to sessions of the subsidiary bodies , and six workshops , between May 2000 and August 2002 . The issues discussed at the meetings of the CGE included the consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the CGE workshops aimed at the improvement of the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties , development of work plans , examination of the information presented in national communications submitted by non-Annex I Parties , and preparation of the CGE reports for consideration by the subsidiary bodies . The reports of four meetings are contained in documents FCCC / SBI / 2000 / 16 , FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 2 , FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 3 , and FCCC / SBI / 2002 / 2 . The report of the fifth meeting was presented by the CGE Chair as an oral report to the subsidiary bodies at their sixteenth session , and is contained in the annex to this document . The six workshops were conducted by the CGE members with the support of the secretariat to facilitate the exchange of experiences between non-Annex I Parties , within and between each developing region , on the preparation of each of the elements of the national communication , so as to identify problems and constraints relating to analytical , technical and methodological issues , and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies to overcome these problems and constraints . A total of 105 experts nominated by 70 non-Annex I Parties , 9 experts from 8 Annex I Parties and 12 representatives from 4 bilateral and 8 multilateral agencies participated in the workshops . The elements of a national communication considered at the workshops were national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , research and systematic observation , GHG mitigation analysis , education , training and public awareness , information and networking , and financial and technical support . In view of the need to analyse information pertaining to each of the elements of a national communication , the CGE divided itself into six task groups to cover : national GHG inventory ; vulnerability and adaptation assessment and research and systematic observation ; GHG mitigation analysis ; education , training and public awareness ; information and networking ; and financial and technical support . The task groups , each facilitated by a coordinator , analysed information presented in 81 initial national communications , and in CGE meetings and workshops . The CGE members also made active use of the CGE listserv , developed and maintained by the secretariat , to exchange views on various issues pertaining to the discharge of its work . The work of the CGE was supported by the secretariat which provided administrative and technical support , and prepared its reports . The CGE , in fulfilling its mandate and terms of reference , contained in the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 , examined information contained in the first compilation and synthesis report ( FCCC / SBI / 1999 / 11 ) and in the 50 initial national communications which had been officially submitted to the secretariat between June 2000 and March 2001 . A report on this work was completed and submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) . In that report , conclusions and recommendations were made by the CGE relating to the improvement of the preparation of the various elements of the national communication , including the recommendations for the improvement of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties contained in the annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 ( UNFCCC guidelines ) . Since the completion of that report , the CGE was mandated by the COP ( decision 31 / CP . 7 ) to continue its work to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . To this end , it examined , together with the previous 50 initial national communications , an additional 31 communications submitted between April 2001 and June 2002 , in accordance with the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 . Additionally , the CGE identified technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them , in accordance with decision 31 / CP . 7 . Data and information The most common problem / constraint encountered by non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their national communications was related to the scarcity and quality of data ( for example , availability , accessibility and reliability ) in all the relevant areas of the national communications . This problem was exacerbated by lack of capacities and expertise to access , collect , analyse , manipulate and manage the data and databases necessary to conduct these studies and analyses . In almost all relevant categories of GHG sources and sinks ( energy , industrial processes , agriculture , land-use change and forestry , and waste ) most Parties found that there was lack of and / or deficiencies in the activity data . This is particularly true in the informal and household sectors of the economy , as well as on gases such as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFC ) , perfluorocarbons ( PFC ) and sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) . Some Parties found that the lack of disaggregation of data on fuel consumption in the industrial and transport sectors made it difficult to estimate emissions from these sectors ( e . g . in biomass and kerosene combustion ) , which caused delays in completing their national GHG inventories . In the assessment of vulnerability and adaptation , Parties noted a lack of the data required as input to impact models and assessments . Therefore , vulnerability and adaptation assessments were based on broad sensitivity studies and the use of expert judgement , although some experts indicated that this method was not generally the preferred option for conducting such assessments . Many Parties also indicated that the assessment of potential mitigation options was constrained by the lack of relevant data and information . Where data were available they were not relevant for sector - and country-specific mitigation analysis . IPCC methodologies and other models Parties generally reported that many of the methodological problems and constraints they encountered in using the IPCC methodologies and other models were due to the fact that many of the default methodologies from the IPCC did not take into account their specific national circumstances . Many Parties also reported that the use of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines ( IPCC Guidelines ) for estimating the GHG emissions in some sectors was inappropriate to their circumstances , particularly in the land-use change and forestry sector ( LUCF ) where forest classifications and the terms used in the LUCF section of the IPCC Guidelines were not consistent with the classifications and definitions used in non-Annex I Parties . For example , growth rates of biomass and / or emission rates used in the IPCC Guidelines for soil carbon , and estimation of fractions of biomass burnt on site , burnt off site or left to decay , were not appropriate for use in many non-Annex I Parties . Many Parties also had difficulties in matching the classification systems recommended by the IPCC Guidelines for animals and agricultural soils to their own circumstances . This created problems in the choice and use of default emission factors , thereby affecting the reliability of the results in the agriculture sector . Similar problems were experienced in calculating the emissions from waste disposal . Many difficulties were encountered in applying and using the IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation ( IPCC Technical Guidelines ) in completing vulnerability and adaptation assessments . These difficulties mainly stem from the unsuitability of existing methods and tools , lack of national capacity / expertise to develop and / or use socio-economic scenarios , and lack of financial resources for assessment work . The analytical methods provided by the IPCC Technical Guidelines and the internationally developed integrated assessment methods , and policy development and decision support tools were often found to be incompatible with local needs and capacities . Integrated assessments and other such sophisticated diagnostic assessments typically required levels of information and expertise that were not widely and readily available in many non-Annex I Parties . This led Parties to use qualitative studies , which were compatible with local capacities , but could be less credible . Many Parties found that difficulties in undertaking impact assessments were mainly due to unavailability of models and inability to apply them . For example , some countries had difficulties in selecting and testing a general circulation model that would adequately fit their own circumstances . The use of MAGICC / SCENGEN was generally reported as being unsatisfactory due to its inappropriate downscaling methods and output . Other Parties indicated that they did not have sufficient knowledge or expertise to use / apply impact models for vulnerability and adaptation assessment . Most of the Parties identified adaptation to climate change as a major issue and included a list of potential adaptation options in their national communications . However , many of these Parties did not evaluate , prioritize and cost these adaptation options . This could be attributed to the fact that the IPCC Technical Guidelines did not adequately address the identification and evaluation of specific adaptation strategies , and to the lack of national expertise to undertake cost-benefit analysis on adaptation options . In general , the identified GHG mitigation options were not assessed comprehensively , due to the lack of common analytical tools ( e . g . models ) and of specific studies , and expertise . Additionally , the lack of models / software for scenario construction , particularly in the agriculture and livestock sectors , presented a serious constraint in conducting mitigation assessments . For some Parties , the preparation of technical studies was constrained by the fact that many of the methodologies and other models , and their instructions and other related documentation , were available only in English , so it was difficult for some experts to use and apply these methods and models . Institutional arrangements , information and networking A major constraint for many Parties was the lack of appropriate institutional arrangements and of clarity over roles and responsibilities of experts and institutions in carrying out the technical studies relating to the preparation of the national communication , which affected data collection and information exchange and networking among countries , regions and project personnel . Some Parties reported that their activities were constrained by the lack of effective coordination among the different ministries involved , and limited awareness among policy makers . The national climate change committees charged with the preparation of national communications in many countries were neither active , nor operational , and many were not granted the necessary legal and institutional authority to effectively carry out their work ; they were therefore not sufficiently motivated to implement their tasks in a timely manner . They also lacked the necessary human capacity to ensure a minimum level of active participation in and monitoring of technical studies , review and endorsement of the project outputs and launching of concrete follow-up actions relating to the preparation of national communications . In some Parties , project implementation was delayed by high turnover of technical staff , political instability and / or a change in project leadership within the institutions responsible for the preparation of the national communication . Some Parties found that weak institutional arrangements and the lack of human resources and capacities for conducting systematic data collection , together with the absence of universities and / or research centres working on climate change issues , particularly in small and poor countries , made it difficult to implement the activities relating to the preparation of national communications . Many Parties recognized that the use of information systems forms an important part of GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment and mitigation analysis , and that networking helps to provide access to updated information and promote the exchange of experiences on these issues . However , many Parties found that such exchange of information and networking were generally weak due to limited human and financial resources , limited data and information , and underdeveloped systems for collecting , processing and maintaining data and information . The lack of hardware , software and expertise for establishing and maintaining networking facilities for the exchange of information ( computers , communication channels ) , presented major constraints in this regard . Many Parties stressed that the low priority granted to vulnerability and adaptation issues by policy makers at the highest levels of government has affected cooperation and coordination among stakeholders in conducting the vulnerability and adaptation assessments . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Almost all Parties highlighted their limited capacities to undertake research and systematic observation activities such as accessing , analysing and managing data relevant to climate change in the areas of impact assessment , detection and early warning of climate extreme events and climate prediction . These limitations were mainly due to lack of financial resources and of human capacities and capabilities , as well as to limited technical support . Many Parties indicated that the level of scientific research and scholarship in institutions which have been established to conduct research was low and / or deteriorating . Some Parties further noted that the problem of lack of research activities was further compounded by irregular observations , out-dated and / or deteriorating infrastructure / systems for data collection , and the inability to access , process and transfer observational data . Many Parties emphasized that the issue of climate change was new to them and so their effort in climate change education , training and public awareness was not commensurate with the importance they placed on this issue . Some Parties also indicated that unavailability of experts and limited financial resources caused difficulties in organizing training workshops for their technical teams , which contributed to the considerable delays in the preparation of different technical studies ( inventory , mitigation , vulnerability ) . The integration of climate change issues into educational curricula was recognized as crucial for the future , but many Parties did not have appropriate resources for such integration . There was also a lack of clear and targeted awareness and education programmes , and the training provided was limited in scope . Many Parties emphasized that awareness and education on climate change issues among the public at large and the policy makers was minimal , partly because of the limited coverage of climate change issues by local media , the lack of active participation on this issue by non-governmental organizations in that area , and limited technical advice and support material . In this context , several Parties mentioned the lack of sufficiently trained scientific and technical personnel , policy makers , and the institutions to carry out research and training on climate change issues . Resources : human , technical and financial Globally the resources dedicated to vulnerability and adaptation studies were not commensurate with the needs and the importance that Parties place on these issues . Limited financial resources , insufficient and inappropriate tools , limited sectoral coverage , insufficient capacity and expertise , lack of experience to coordinate , implement and participate in climate change activities efficiently at the national , subregional , regional and international levels , were all highlighted . Many Parties considered that the level of funding provided and the period allowed for the preparation of the initial national communication were not sufficient to enable them to provide adequate and reliable information in the initial national communication . Some Parties noted that their governments had limited resources to address climate change issues and pointed out that these limitations were not very well compensated by external support for climate change activities . They further indicated that this may be because some bilateral programmes focus on the countries that have a large GHG mitigation potential . Other Parties stressed that their low economic situation meant that climate change issues were given low priority . Insufficient funds for international consultants and for project team members presented many problems in the implementation of the activities relating to the preparation of the national communications . This was particularly true in engaging and involving experts in training , international meetings and workshops . Some Parties stressed that funding available to conduct impact and vulnerability analyses in many sectors that are of vital importance to the national economy was inadequate . Many Parties indicated that in order to address climate change issues in a multidisciplinary and an efficient way , they would require additional financial and technical resources to develop and train a critical mass of human resources . Specific technical problems and constraints that have affected non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications Many of the problems and constraints faced by those Parties who have not yet submitted their initial national communications were similar to those faced by non-Annex I Parties that had already completed their initial national communications . However , Parties that have yet to complete their initial national communications face other specific technical problems and constraints . Some Parties stressed that the implementation of the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications was often hampered by the lack of , or insufficient , level of coordination , especially among the technical experts responsible for such tasks , which often led to lengthy delays in starting and completing technical studies relevant for the preparation of national communications . Many Parties found that bureaucratic inertia / bottlenecks inherent within national institutions responsible for the preparation of national communication , and weak institutional linkages between the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) Country Offices and the national executing agencies , with resulting lack of clarity over their respective roles and responsibilities , often slowed progress in implementing the activities and tasks relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties also had difficulties in applying the UNDP modalities for the nationally executed programmes , which were not necessarily consistent with the enabling activities project management procedures . This also led to further delays in the implementation of the projects relating to the preparation of national communications . Some Parties specifically attributed the delays in the preparation of initial national communications to social disturbances and / or political problems and the resultant changes in the leadership of the projects . Such changes sometimes led to inactivity relating to the preparation of national communications , where either the expertise was not available or the institutional arrangements were not appropriate . Other Parties indicated that it was not always clear which agency would be responsible for preparing the initial national communication , thereby leading to lengthy delays . In its previous report to the subsidiary bodies ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) , the CGE noted that a number of multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes had provided human , technical and financial assistance to 137 of a total of 146 non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their initial national communications . The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) was the largest contributor ( US $ 79.6 million ) , through its climate change enabling activities programmes . This , however , represented only about seven per cent of the total funds ( US $ 1.052 billion ) allocated by the GEF to the climate change focal area for the period 1991 to July 2000 . The majority of non-Annex I Parties ( 124 ) had received support from the GEF climate change enabling activities programmes , and only three Parties that had submitted their initial national communication ( Israel , the Republic of Korea and Singapore ) did not receive any support from any of the support programmes . The GEF , in collaboration with the UNDP , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and the UNFCCC , established and funded the National Communications Support Programme , which provided human and technical support to 130 non-Annex I Parties , including countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States . Technical support and assistance provided was mainly in the form of thematic subregional exchange workshops , technical reviews , a help desk and networking . Funding for this support programme comprised US $ 2.1 million from the GEF and US $ 1.3 million through cofinancing from Denmark , the European Community , Finland and Norway . Support from the bilateral support programmes and Annex II Parties was provided through their respective programmes : the United States Country Studies Programme ( USCSP ) , the German Technical Cooperation Agency ( GTZ ) , the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme ( NCCSAP ) , the Finland Climate Change Assistance Programme , and the governments of New Zealand and Greece . Other Annex II Parties ( Australia , Denmark , Japan , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) had also provided financial resources and technical assistance to non-Annex I Parties through climate change training courses , workshops , studies and projects / programmes . Level of funding As of 30 June 2002 , the GEF has provided US $ 1.5 billion in grants for climate change projects since its establishment as a pilot programme in 1991 . About US $ 87.6 million , representing about six per cent of the total amount , was provided by the GEF to 133 non-Annex I Parties through its climate change enabling activities programmes for the preparation of initial national communications . The analysis of the support provided by multilateral and bilateral support programmes points to a growing need to increase capacity and enhance the work relating to the preparation of the national communications in the areas of national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis . In considering the availability of financial resources and technical support , the CGE found that many needs relating to financial and technical support still exist , and new needs have been identified by Parties . These needs will require additional financial and technical support to improve the preparation of national communications . Additional financial support would be needed for data collection , accessing , archiving , quality control , retrieval and management , as well as for capacity-building , and promotion of education , training and public awareness . The analysis of the distribution of financial resources , however , indicated that some countries had received three or four times more funding than had many other countries . The differing focus of the support activities and of the coverage across technical areas , countries and regions , as well as the lack of a reporting framework for the support programmes , particularly bilateral ones , made it difficult to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of these efforts to date . However , from the information presented above on the funding and activities of the support programmes , and information contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 on this issue , it appeared that the level of funding and the number and scope of activities were not commensurate with the needs of Parties identified in their initial national communications and the needs of those Parties that have yet to complete the preparation of their initial national communications . Coordination An analysis of the implementation of activities of the support programmes indicated that there was a need for better coordination and interaction between these programmes , in order to enhance the overall effectiveness of their use of limited resources and to ensure that smaller and poorer countries received adequate attention . This could be done through the establishment of an information sharing mechanism , developed and hosted by a relevant agency / institution , such as the UNFCCC secretariat , to provide information on assistance programmes that support the preparation of national communication or any of its elements . The CGE noted the important role of the National Communication Support Programme in assisting non-Annex I Parties during the preparation of their initial national communications . The CGE was of the view that the newly established National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP might be well placed to assist countries , particularly those that have recently started to prepare their initial national communications . Additionally , the CGE emphasized that there was a need to develop and strengthen interactions and links within and between countries and regions , through multi-country , regional and global projects , and through regional centres of excellence working on various climate change issues , where appropriate . Lessons learned The experiences gained and lessons learned by the multilateral and bilateral support programmes in providing human , financial and technical support for project implementation point to a number of areas where changes could improve the institutional arrangements necessary for the preparation of national communications : Greater involvement of and participation by key policy stakeholders from the beginning of the project cycle and / or at the project concept level and heightened country-driven discussions on the projects and acitvities ; Political support and buy-in to the project and the enhancement of appropriate institutional frameworks for the preparation of national communication ; Engagement of in-country personnel in project activities and promotion of country ownership of the project ; Provision of financial and technical support and integration of project activities and outputs with national policies and strategies ; Building and maintaining capacity of national and / or regional expertise to collect , process and analyse data for enhancing the preparation of national communications and planning for sustainable development ; Focusing studies undertaken in the context of the preparation of national communications , on national priorities . Future plans The multilateral and bilateral support programmes also indicated their plans to continue their activities and programmes to facilitate and support non-Annex I Parties in the implementation of the Convention , including the preparation of national communications . These programmes include the UNEP / IPCC project on the Assessment of Impacts of and Adaptation to Climate Change in multiple regions or sectors , and the World Bank project on Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in the Caribbean region . The UNDP's National Communication Support Unit will implement three regional pilot projects to build capacity in 34 countries on improving the quality of national GHG inventories through the use of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management and to prepare for stage II adaptation using the UNDP's Adaptation Policy Framework . Additionally , a global project on systematic observation is underway , in conjunction with the Global Climate Observing System secretariat . All these activities will feed into the national communication process . The bilateral programmes include phase II of the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme , support by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to the National Communications Support Unit of the UNDP , and the activities of the Danish Agency for Development Assistance . The United States Agency for International Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have plans to continue to provide human , technical and financial support to non-Annex I Parties for activities that underpin the preparation of national communications , including national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and mitigation analysis . To overcome some of the technical problems and constraints identified by non-Annex I Parties in their initial national communications , and by the CGE in fulfilling its mandate in pursuance of decisions 8 / CP . 5 and 31 / CP . 7 , several recommendations were made by the CGE to improve the process of the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Data and information Additional resources should be mobilized to develop and implement a sustainable data collection , compilation , archiving and updating management system for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis . Regional cooperation in activity data generation and management should be encouraged . Particular groups of nations and or regions should develop emission factors , particularly for key sources , to better reflect their national circumstances . Information relating to technical material , methods , tools and models for national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments and GHG mitigation analysis needs to be made available in all official languages of the United Nations at the earliest opportunity and in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of Parties . IPCC methodologies and other models Existing methodologies for GHG inventories should be improved and made clearer for use in non-Annex I Parties . In particular , more clarification is needed in the use of terms and the forest classification systems in the land-use change and forestry sector . The IPCC should be encouraged to develop methods , tools and other models for use in assessing impacts and adaptations in agriculture , water resources , coastal zones and human health at time scales that are relevant for policy-making processes in non-Annex I Parties . Methodologies and models for assessing mitigation options and analysing abatement potential should be made readily accessible to non-Annex I Parties . Studies to conduct detailed cost-benefit analysis should be encouraged in non-Annex I Parties . Institutional arrangements , information and networking Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged , with international support , to develop appropriate and sustainable institutional frameworks and arrangements to carry out activities relating to the preparation of national communications and the implementation of the Convention on a continuous basis . Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to streamline and mainstream activities relating to national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis in their recurrent programmes of work . The GEF and its implementing agencies should be encouraged to clarify roles and responsibilities in close consultation with the national executing agencies relating to the preparation of national communications . Information exchange and sharing of experiences on the preparation of the national communications should be encouraged within and between countries and regions . Regional research and educational centres should be strengthened and , where appropriate , established in various regions . Research and systematic observation , education , training and public awareness Non-Annex I Parties should be encouraged to undertake assessment of their capacity and needs for research and systematic observation and for climate change education , training and public awareness . Training of national experts on climate change issues such as national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , and GHG mitigation analysis should be carried out continuously . The scope of training on climate change issues should be widened , to include data and uncertainty analysis and vulnerability and adaptation assessments , at both basic and advanced levels . Resources : human , technical and financial Additional human , technical and financial resources should be provided to non-Annex I Parties for the improvement of the process of preparation of national communications . Additional financial resources should be made available to non-Annex I Parties to enhance national expertise to systematically collect , analyse and maintain appropriate data and databases for the preparation of national communications . Clear additional guidance should be given to the GEF to provide financial resources that are commensurate with the resource needs identified by non-Annex I Parties in their national communications . Existing methodologies and national capacities to undertake integrated assessment of climate change impacts in different sectors , such as water resources , agriculture and human health , coastal zones , human settlements and biodiversity , should be enhanced . Training on the use of software and technical guidelines should be provided to non-Annex I Parties so that the studies can be carried out locally . Financial and technical assistance should be provided for assessment of vulnerability and the economic and social costs of adaptation measures . UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications In fulfilling its mandate contained in decision 8 / CP . 5 , the CGE considered the information presented in the initial national communications in accordance with the UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ( annex to decision 10 / CP . 2 ) , with a view to improving them . The CGE report containing recommendations for improving the guidelines for reporting on national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessments , GHG mitigation analysis and education , training and public awareness in the national communication , was submitted to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth session , and is contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 . In pursuance of decision 31 / CP . 7 , the CGE also provided its input to the proposed improved UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention . The input of the CGE on the proposed improved guidelines is contained in document FCCC / SBI / 2002 / INF . 8 . Annex Report of the Chair of the Consultative Group of Experts A report on the work of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention ( CGE ) was presented to the sixteenth sessions of the subsidiary bodies by the Chair of that group , Ms. Isabelle Niang-Diop ( Senegal ) . In her report , the Chair of the CGE recalled that the CGE had presented its first report ( FCCC / SBI / 2001 / 15 ) , covering the period 2000-2001 , to the subsidiary bodies at their fifteenth sessions in October 2001 in Marrakesh , Morocco . In addition to the mandate contained in the annex to decision 8 / CP . 5 , the Chair of the CGE reminded delegates of the mandate given by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh session ( decision 31 / CP . 7 ) , requesting the CGE : ( i ) to identify and assess technical problems and constraints that have affected the preparation of initial national communications by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to complete them and make recommendations for consideration by the subsidiary bodies ; ( ii ) to provide input to the draft improved guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties ; ( iii ) to conduct two workshops with the objective of sharing experiences ; and ( iv ) to organize , to the extent possible , a meeting back-to-back with a meeting of the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The Chair subsequently gave an overview of the activities undertaken by the CGE since its last report . This included a summary of the workshop held in April 2002 on the identification and assessment of technical problems and constraints faced by non-Annex I Parties that have yet to submit their initial national communications , as well as the outcomes of the fifth CGE meeting which addressed the issue of coordination of activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , the work plan to fulfil its current mandate , the relationship between the CGE and the LEG and the exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications . The Chair noted that the CGE , in implementing the mandate contained in decision 31 / CP . 7 , had held its first workshop from 10 to 12 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The workshop had facilitated the exchange of experiences with non-Annex I Parties on different issues related to the preparation of national communications . It had also provided the initial input by the CGE into the draft improved guidelines which was presented to the intersessional workshop on the revision of the guidelines for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties , held from 15 to 17 April 2002 in Bonn , Germany . The CGE had analysed views provided by some non-Annex I Parties ( not including least developed countries ) that had received funds more than three years ago for the preparation of their initial national communications and had not submitted them . Views on the technical problems and constraints Parties are facing had been provided by means of a questionnaire and presentations at the workshop . The CGE noted that those Parties faced methodological and analytical problems similar to those of Parties that had submitted their initial national communications . However , the presentations in the workshops had revealed additional institutional , management and resource constraints , as reported in document FCCC / SBI / 2002 / INF . 3 . According to the Chair , the CGE recognized the difficulties with the coordination of existing activities and programmes that facilitate and support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties . The CGE had thus recommended that exchange of information on existing activities and programmes be improved , for example by establishing a publicly accessible database on past and ongoing activities and programmes relating to the preparation of national communications . The CGE had also recognized with concern that important programmes that supported the preparation of national communications were no longer in place , without any consideration for their replacement . The Chair indicated that the CGE had stressed that there was a need for continuing the financial and technical assistance for the 62 non-Annex I Parties that were still in the process of preparing their initial national communications . Regarding the CGE work plan for the period between June and October 2002 , the Chair stated that the CGE had held discussions on its report to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies and on a tentative programme for its second workshop . From these discussions , the CGE had agreed on the following : The report of the CGE to the seventeenth session of the subsidiary bodies would consist of a synthesis of the work accomplished by the CGE from its establishment at COP 5 up to COP 8 in October 2002 . It would also present the results of exchange of views on potential activities for future improvement of the preparation of national communications ; The CGE had decided to hold its second workshop from 7 to 9 August , possibly in Nassau , Bahamas , with the aim of completing its work on problems and constraints of non-Annex I Parties that had yet to submit their initial national communications , and on support programmes and activities . Countries that had not yet presented information on the technical problems and constraints that they were facing in the preparation of their initial national communications would be invited to do so at this workshop . Representatives of multilateral agencies that support the preparation of national communications would be invited to make presentations on their programmes in accordance with a framework that should be provided by the CGE . Presentations would also be made by experts on how to overcome some of the constraints that had been identified already . The Chair reported that the CGE had also discussed its relationship with the least developed countries expert group ( LEG ) . The group had noted that a back-to-back meeting would unfortunately not be feasible for 2002 as originally decided at COP 7 ( decision 31 / CP . 7 , paragraph 5 ) . The CGE , however , had stressed the importance of exchanging views between the two groups through the two common members , the consideration of each group's reports and the participation of experts from the LEG at the CGE workshops . The CGE had also discussed the provision of financial resources for the preparation of the second national communications . In the light of the gaps and constraints identified in the preparation of the initial national communications , the CGE recognized that it might be necessary to increase the financial resources to improve the process of the preparation of national communications . The CGE recommended that the distribution by the GEF of financial resources among Parties for the preparation of national communications should be based on transparent criteria , considering the specific needs of each Party . Furthermore , the CGE had exchanged views on possible future activities to improve the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties and in this regard had identified as potential areas : a technical assessment of national communications on a voluntary basis ; organization of workshops on specific topics ; monitoring of capacity-building programmes and strengthening of coordination between the national communication processes ; and reporting activities under other environmental agreements . In line with this , it would be necessary to identify the appropriate institutional arrangements to support these activities . The Chair of the CGE stated that it was her belief that many of the technical issues , problems and constraints identified in the preparation of initial national communications , and recommendations made by the CGE , would form the basis upon which financial and technical support would be made available for the preparation of subsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties . Therefore , the subsidiary bodies might wish to invite the financial mechanism and bilateral organizations to provide financial and technical resources to those non-Annex I Parties that were ready to start the preparation of their second national communications . In concluding , the Chair acknowledged the dedication and commitment provided by the CGE experts , and their respective governments and organizations who had supported their participation in the CGE . She also extended this acknowledgement to the other experts ( 101 participants representing 68 Parties ) that had participated in the CGE workshops . It was to these that the Chair , on behalf of the CGE , expressed her gratitude and thanks . The Chair also thanked the Governments of Australia , Finland , Germany ( through the Bonn Fund ) , Switzerland , the Netherlands and the United States of America for funding the CGE workshops and the UNFCCC secretariat for the excellent support it had provided to the CGE in the organization of its work and the production of its reports . * This document is submitted after the due date because all the necessary information was not available on time . Three regional workshops , one each for the regions of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean , were held in 2000 ; one interregional workshop was held in 2001 ; and two interregional workshops were held in 2002 . Support programmes are those activities , projects and programmes which supported the preparation of initial national communications , and the preparation of various elements of the national communication ( e . g . national GHG inventories , vulnerability and adaptation assessment , mitigation assessment ) . The climate change enabling activities programmes include activities that are funded through expedited procedures , full projects that use standard procedures of funding , and projects covering limited components of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties .

223	"Twelfth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Introduction The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1417 ( 2002 ) of 14 June 2002 , by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) until 30 June 2003 and to review progress every four months on the basis of reports of the Secretary-General . It describes developments until 11 October 2002 , since my report of 5 June ( S / 2002 / 621 ) and the special report ( S / 2002 / 1005 ) which I submitted to the Council on 10 September 2002 , following the agreements concluded recently in Pretoria and Luanda between the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda , respectively . Political developments The period under review witnessed a number of significant political and military developments , in particular the signing of the bilateral agreements in Pretoria and Luanda , and the troop withdrawals undertaken by Angola , Burundi , Rwanda , Uganda and Zimbabwe ( see paras . These developments occurred while consultations among the Congolese parties on the establishment of a transitional government continued . Inter-Congolese dialogue The initial round of consultations among the signatories of the agreement concluded at Sun City , on the sidelines of the inter-Congolese dialogue , commenced at Matadi , Democratic Republic of the Congo , in May . The talks , which ended on 6 July , highlighted serious differences between the Mouvement de libération du Congo ( MLC ) and the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning , in particular , the power-sharing arrangements for the Supreme Council of Defence and the procedure for designating the Prime Minister . In August , however , the participants reached agreement on the 167 articles of the transitional constitution . At my request , my Special Envoy , Moustapha Niasse , undertook an exploratory mission to the region from 13 to 30 June 2002 to ascertain the possibility of helping the Congolese parties to reach an all-inclusive political agreement . The Special Envoy began his mission in Lusaka and Addis Ababa , where he met the Chairman and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity . He then visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo for discussions with President Joseph Kabila , Jean-Pierre Bemba of MLC and the leadership of the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie ( RCD ) - Goma . In Kinshasa , and later in Matadi , the Special Envoy met with political parties , representatives of civil society , and some armed groups . Subsequently , the Special Envoy visited Sir Ketumile Masire , the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue , in Gaborone , as well as the Presidents of Gabon , Rwanda , South Africa and Zimbabwe , and the Foreign Minister of Angola , in their respective capitals . My Special Envoy's interlocutors stressed the need to reach an all-inclusive agreement and expressed their readiness to continue informal discussions under his auspices , on the understanding that any agreement reached informally would then have to be endorsed by the inter-Congolese dialogue . During the second phase of his mission , from 9 July to 17 August , the Special Envoy discussed with his Congolese interlocutors their views pertaining to power-sharing during the transition and , in particular , the structure of the transitional institutions and the distribution of responsibilities among the various State organs . He asked them to base their proposals in this regard on the objectives and principles agreed upon at Sun City . On 3 September , my Special Envoy started the third phase of his mission . The Government and the RCD-Goma delegations , which have been meeting in Pretoria since mid-September , seem to have reached a common understanding on a government structure and power-sharing formula . MLC has clarified its position in this regard and has had bilateral consultations with the Government and other parties . On 2 October , some representatives of the political opposition and civil society held consultations in Pretoria under the auspices of the Government of South Africa . My Special Envoy believes that the Congolese parties are close to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all . Developments in the wake of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements My special report on MONUC provided information on the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Since then , the Ugandan withdrawal has continued and all Uganda People's Defence Forces personnel , numbering 2,287 , with the exception of a reinforced battalion stationed at Bunia and troops patrolling the western slopes of the Ruwenzori Mountains , have now withdrawn from the country . The Zimbabwe Defence Forces have also continued to withdraw . The total number of their repatriated forces as at 11 October was 3,477 . A small number of Angolan military forces withdrew at the same time . In addition , it was reported that , as at 11 October , 700 troops of the Forces armées burundaises had been withdrawn from the country . Most significant has been the withdrawal of the Rwandan Patriotic Army ( RPA ) , which commenced on 17 September . According to information verified by MONUC , as at 11 October , the total number of RPA forces withdrawn from the Democratic Republic of the Congo stood at 20,941 . The withdrawal , which began in Kindu / Kalima , was subsequently extended to the remainder of Maniema Province , as well as to Katanga and North and South Kivu . There were withdrawals from a total of 32 positions in the east . The troops transited through 21 assembly areas and reached entry points into Rwanda at Cyangugu , Bugarama , Gisenyi and Kanombe Airport , Kigali . MONUC observers were present at most of the 21 RPA assembly sites and at all exit points , where detailed certificates were prepared and signed by MONUC , as well as at entry points into Rwanda , where the numbers were again cross-checked . RPA has claimed that a total of 23,760 troops had been withdrawn . MONUC therefore asked for a formal explanation of the resulting discrepancy of 2,819 . MONUC has received some unconfirmed reports that RPA forces may have entered the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly around the Bukavu area , before the present withdrawal began , and that RPA may have left significant amounts of weaponry , as well as some of its personnel , with RCD-Goma . MONUC intends to verify these reports and to revisit those areas from which foreign forces have been withdrawn , in an effort to verify , together with the third-party verification mechanism , that all RPA troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been repatriated . A thorough investigation may also require visiting the present locations of the withdrawn troops in the home countries . As mentioned in my special report , the third-party verification mechanism has successfully begun its activities . Its terms of reference were finalized and its procedures of work further developed . The mechanism has verified the departure of the declared RPA troops at various departure and arrival points . Prior to the withdrawal of those troops , the mechanism met with expert groups from the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda , in Kinshasa and Kigali respectively , to discuss the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . As the withdrawal of foreign forces proceeded , the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 24 September declared all political leaders of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda ( FDLR ) persona non grata , and ordered them to leave the country within 72 hours . FDLR had claimed leadership of many of the ex-FAR / Interahamwe elements in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , including those cantoned in Kamina . The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was criticized by the Government of Rwanda and RCD-Goma for not handing over the FDLR leaders to the International Tribunal for Rwanda . The Prosecutor of the Tribunal announced , however , that none of the FDLR leaders were on the list of those indicted by the Tribunal . Eight members of FDLR left the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 2 October for Brazzaville , but they were arrested there by local authorities and deported back to Kinshasa the same day . They have since been held at the port of Kinshasa by the immigration authorities , pending further negotiations between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo . In another significant development , Tharcisse Renzaho , the former préfet of Kigali , who is on the list of those indicted by the Tribunal , was arrested on 29 September in Kinshasa and transferred to Arusha . Situation in the north-east During the last three months , the overall security conditions in the north-eastern town of Bunia and the entire Ituri region have continued to deteriorate . There have been recurrent ethnic clashes since June , when the Union des patriotes congolais ( UPC ) , a primarily Hema militia , was reinforced and resupplied . On 10 July 2002 , following intense fighting between UPC and RCD-ML troops in the centre of the city , the governor and RCD-ML authorities fled to Beni , leaving Bunia in the hands of the militia . In mid-August , UPC continued its offensive and succeeded in capturing some of the district's important towns , such as Irumu , 80 km from Bunia on the road to Beni . The violence and the resulting displacement of the population have deepened the mistrust among the communities of Ituri , which is also related to the distribution of resources , as well as manipulation by both internal and external actors . After the signing on 18 April of the Sun City agreement , the Government sought to restore State authority in Ituri through cooperation with RCD-K / ML . The Government dispatched officials to Bunia and Kampala , in order to define the conditions for the extension of its administration and to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of Ugandan troops . The reactions of the local factions varied , UPC , in particular , expressing its strong opposition to the proposed restoration of State administration . Subsequent events in the region , including the incident in which the Government's Minister for Human Rights was taken hostage , were covered in my special report . Increased violence in the Isiro region ( Province Orientale ) has also been sparked by the advance of RCD-N towards , and its occupation of , Faradje , Watsa and Nia Nia in territory formerly controlled by RCD-K / ML . MLC has reportedly reinforced and supported RCD-N with equipment , ammunition and personnel . The armed elements of the two organizations share the same name , Armée de libération du Congo ( ALC ) . Their activities seem to be driven in part by a desire for territorial strength as negotiations towards an all-inclusive transitional government progress . At the same time , there are indications that the Government is providing material support to RCD-K / ML , and that RCD-N is forging links with UPC . Situation in the Hauts Plateaux and South Kivu In the Hauts Plateaux area , to the north-west of Lake Tanganyika , RPA and RCD-Goma operations continued against the Banyamulenge group of Patrick Masunzu , which broke away from RCD-Goma earlier in the year . Prior to the initiation of the RPA withdrawal , there were indications that the bulk of this fighting was being conducted by RPA . From mid-August to mid-September , RPA captured some key airstrips , in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which it alleged were being used by the Government to deliver supplies to armed groups fighting RPA . In reaction to the growing popularity of Commander Masunzu , RCD-Goma "" purged "" some of its members suspected of siding with the Banyamulenge rebellion , in an effort to halt popular support for the movement in South Kivu . On 7 June , during a meeting in Bukavu , the President of RCD-Goma , Adolphe Onusumba , called for the formation of a "" unified front "" against the military operations led by Commander Masunzu . Subsequently , the reinforcement of RPA troops in the Uvira sector indicated that Rwanda might continue to feel threatened by the military resistance of Commander Masunzu and his supporters . However , the situation in the area is now reported to have changed with the withdrawal of RPA forces . According to unconfirmed reports , troops led by Commander Masunzu have reassumed control of the Hauts Plateaux region . Kindu In July , the population in Kindu and in the adjacent village of Alunguli reported outbreaks of intense violence as a result of fighting between RCD-Goma and the Mayi-Mayi . Subsequently , RCD-Goma troops reinforced Kindu and the RCD-Goma Deputy Chief of Staff assumed control over the movement's operations in the area . RCD-Goma subsequently launched an offensive from Kindu to drive Mayi-Mayi elements out of the region . Well-organized and equipped Mayi-Mayi launched limited but effective counter-attacks . Reports were received of indiscriminate killing of civilians in the course of the fighting , including at Kitongi where some 80 people , mostly women and children , were reportedly burned alive . In the wake of the RPA withdrawal from Kindu and Kalima , violence erupted on 19 September in Kindu town with a firefight between RCD-Goma and the Mayi-Mayi . While the violence subsided that same day with the mediation of MONUC , two Mayi-Mayi activists took refuge on MONUC premises in Kindu for a number of days . RCD-Goma , which made several public statements against MONUC , including specific threats by its President against United Nations personnel , remains in control of Kindu . On 21 September , RCD-Goma troops reportedly engaged in a number of targeted killings of suspected Mayi-Mayi supporters in the area . While the situation remains tense in Kindu , relations between MONUC and RCD-Goma have somewhat improved . Activities of the Mission and the United Nations in support of the peace process Military During the reporting period , MONUC continued to monitor and verify the new defensive positions of the parties , in accordance with its phase II mandate . It also continued to prepare for phase III activities . MONUC currently has some 90 military observer teams located at 50 sites ; 25 of these teams are mobile and available for deployment on a range of monitoring and verifying activities . In addition , 3,590 armed troops are protecting MONUC sector headquarters , logistic bases and coordination centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . MONUC therefore has a total of 4,258 military personnel , against a mandated ceiling of 5,537 ( see annex ) . The situation along the disengagement line remains generally stable . While a few positions continue to be occupied in contravention of the disengagement and redeployment plan , the Sun City agreement has had a positive effect on the status of the MLC / RCD-Goma and FAC separation line . The only major violation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement during the reporting period occurred in Pweto in June . The village , occupied by RCD-Goma authorities in violation of the Lusaka Agreement , was taken over by a group of Mayi-Mayi . A subsequent meeting of the Joint Military Commission in Kinshasa concluded with a joint communiqué indicating that the location should be handed over to the Government . However , on 29 June , RCD-Goma recaptured Pweto and remains there now . In Kisangani , following an incident in June when the local RCD-Goma Brigade Commander assaulted MONUC military guards at the Onatra port facility , MONUC has worked actively with local authorities to reduce tension and has stepped up patrols by its military observers . On 8 October , however , MONUC personnel , caught in a demonstration against RCD-Goma , were slightly injured and their vehicles burned . MONUC troops assisting at the scene were compelled to shoot in the air to disperse demonstrators surrounding them . The demonstration was apparently triggered by an alleged robbery attempt and assault by RCD-Goma elements on a university professor . As planning for phase III develops , MONUC is identifying and progressively establishing additional observation sites in the east , in order to create the conditions for future disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operations and to monitor and verify the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country ( as noted in para . To this end , and subject to security conditions , MONUC plans to deploy military observer teams to Punia , Kalima , Shabunda , Walikale , Baraka , Bunyakiri , Kamituga and Lubutu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the same time , teams will be deployed to Lubumbashi and Kamina in Government-controlled territory , to verify reports of ex-FAR / Interahamwe presence in those areas and to monitor the airfields allegedly used to resupply armed groups in the east . In the meantime United Nations riverine operations continued , allowing MONUC to escort resupply and humanitarian relief barges . Consequently , the first commercial barge convoy in four years , accompanied by MONUC vessels , was dispatched from Kinshasa to Lisala and Bumba on 20 July ( see paras . 36 and 37 ) . Disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration With the conclusion of the Pretoria Agreement on 30 July , the ongoing withdrawal of foreign forces and the easing of political obstacles to the process of disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration , MONUC is refining its comprehensive strategy for this process , in cooperation with the United Nations agencies and international actors involved . This ongoing activity has been given further impetus by the increasing willingness of the Government to address the political obstacles underlying successful disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration , as well as reports by MONUC that several small to medium-sized groups of ex-FAR / Interahamwe may be considering participating in the process . MONUC intends to continue to implement ad hoc disarmament , demobilization and repatriation operations , pending deployment of the two task forces to be based in Kindu and Kisangani , as recommended in the special report ( S / 2002 / 1005 ) . In this connection , the French Ambassador in Kinshasa has recently announced his Government's intention to make available 1 million euros for disarmament , demobilization and repatriation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for both Congolese and foreign armed groups . Since my eleventh report , MONUC has established a disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration presence in Goma , Bukavu and Butembo . Plans are under way for a similar presence in Kamina , Lubumbashi and possibly Shabunda to implement the process in an ad hoc way in those areas . Despite existing security constraints and the difficulties in accessing the armed groups , MONUC will continue to explore the possibility of opening additional offices and sites for reception centres in the east of the country . On 30 September , a first group of 69 Rwandan ex-combatants and 10 civilians left Kamina , where they had been cantoned by the Government , on an exploratory visit to Rwanda . MONUC had earlier succeeded in completing an initial screening of 1,981 combatants at Kamina in December 2001 , but could not complete their demobilization because of their refusal to provide the necessary information concerning personal identification and military background . The exploratory visit has clearly been facilitated by the signature of the Pretoria Agreement and the banning of FDLR , which was opposed to attempts to repatriate the ex-combatants . The group , which was accompanied by MONUC personnel and by South African representatives of the Third Party Verification Mechanism , was flown to Rwanda on MONUC aircraft and spent some 10 days in Kigali and their home communes . MONUC is following up on this exploratory visit with a view to repatriating all the ex-combatants at Kamina . In July , a MONUC disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration team in Beni demobilized Rwandan combatants among a small group of 46 persons , which included dependants and Congolese citizens , who had already been disarmed by the local RCD-K / ML authorities . Although the combatants agreed to be demobilized , they were reluctant to be repatriated . Accordingly , at the invitation of MONUC , the Government of Rwanda sent a team to persuade the ex-combatants to return home . Only eight have returned , however , although other members of the group now appear willing to consider repatriation . In July , MONUC held consultations with the Government of Uganda and the Ugandan Amnesty Commission , concerning a process of disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration for 300 to 400 Allied Democratic Front ( ADF ) combatants present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Provided that the security situation around Bunia does not deteriorate , this operation is expected to commence soon . It is to be conducted under the overall supervision of the Ugandan Amnesty Commission and MONUC , in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration and a Ugandan non-governmental organization , with the support of UNICEF and WFP . The Donor Technical Group on Uganda , which consists of prominent international donors , has agreed to finance the operation , in which the role of MONUC will be limited to disarming and demobilizing the ADF combatants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . In the meantime , MONUC has undertaken efforts to further mainstream disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration within the Mission by intensifying internal consultation in the planning of future such operations during phase III . Such planning takes into account the recent political developments , such as the Pretoria Agreement , lessons learned from previous exercises of this kind conducted by other peacekeeping operations , and the Mission's experience in Kamina and Beni . As indicated in my special report , MONUC has established a Joint Coordination Committee for disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration and has continued its consultations with United Nations agencies , the World Bank and the diplomatic community , in order to refine the division of labour in respect of these operations and to transform the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration concept into a joint operational plan . In this context , the cooperation of MONUC with the World Bank is crucial . The World Bank has initiated activities under the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Programme for the Greater Great Lakes Region , which is designed to support the consolidation of peace in the region . The Programme was established to provide financial and technical assistance to national programmes , regional initiatives and special projects within the framework defined by the greater Great Lakes regional strategy for demobilization and reintegration endorsed by nine countries involved in , or affected by , conflicts in the region , as well as 30 partners from regional organizations , donor countries , international financial institutions and relevant United Nations agencies . Through the Multi-Country Programme , the World Bank and partners will be working closely with national Governments , as they are doing now with the Government of Rwanda , in preparation for reintegration programmes for returning ex-combatants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . MONUC is collaborating closely with the World Bank to ensure that the process beginning with disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which MONUC will be responsible under the proposed assessed budget arrangements , continues seamlessly towards reintegration of the same groups in Rwanda , where the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Programme , funded by the Multi-Country Programme , would assist former combatants in their transition to civilian life . Most recently , MONUC participated in a seminar conducted by the Bank in Nairobi from 17 to 21 September 2002 to facilitate dialogue between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda with regard to the technical aspects of the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . The seminar identified in some detail the main activities to be performed during the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operations , indicating where the responsibility for performing them lay . MONUC is mandated only to disarm , demobilize and repatriate the foreign armed groups listed in the Lusaka Agreement . However , circumstances might arise when Congolese groups or individuals might present themselves at a MONUC reception centre , to surrender their weapons in the hope of becoming eligible for some sort of national Congolese demobilization and reinsertion programme . Bearing in mind the responsibility it might be considered to have incurred in agreeing to disarm men in such circumstances , MONUC has also been consulting with specialized agencies and donors about steps it could take , within its mandate and resources , to facilitate their subsequent demobilization and reinsertion . A working arrangement on the ground with the participation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , MONUC and UNDP is being considered , for example , to assist with the disarmament , demobilization and reinsertion of Congolese armed groups into society . Reopening of the Congo River There were hopes that significant progress could be achieved towards the reopening of the Congo River after the signature in May of an agreement between the three main parties under the auspices of MONUC . On 20 July , 12 barges set off from Kinshasa to Lisala and Bumba ( northern Equateur ) in the first attempt to resume commercial exchanges in nearly four years . A further commercial convoy of four barges left Kinshasa on 8 October . This will be joined en route by at least four additional barges . In Kisangani , the RCD-Goma authorities continue to insist on convening a tripartite committee meeting to discuss "" technical issues "" with the Government and MLC before lifting all restrictions on river traffic . This demand reflects a disagreement between RCD-Goma and the business community in Kisangani over taxes . MONUC is actively trying to bring the concerned parties together to settle their differences . In the meantime , the slow progress towards an agreement between the three main parties continues to pose a serious threat to the restoration of the freedom of movement of people and goods on the river . Civilian police MONUC is preparing a detailed plan in regard to possible expansion of civilian police activities to meet the rapidly changing circumstances on the ground , especially in the light of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements . There are currently 52 United Nations civilian police officers deployed in Kinshasa , Kisangani and Goma . In accordance with Security Council resolution 1376 ( 2001 ) , the civilian police component is in the process of implementing a pilot project for training the local police in Kisangani . The programme includes a refresher course for already existing police units , and specialized training for traffic and court police , as well as for criminal investigators . The latter comprises training for police cadets , and an advanced training course for police inspectors . As part of the programme , MONUC will proceed , as soon as possible , and in cooperation with bilateral donors , with the refurbishment of the police training centre in Kapalata , as well as the procurement of basic materials such as uniforms , vehicles and communication equipment , through the special trust fund established by the Mission for this purpose . The first session of the short-term "" train-the-trainers "" course in Kisangani was concluded on 31 August and a second session was completed on 15 October . A refresher course for judicial police is to begin on 21 October . Public information Public information deployment and activities have reinforced the visibility of MONUC in all sectors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Radio Okapi broadcasts news programmes in five languages from Kinshasa to eight locations : Kisangani , Goma , Kalemie , Kananga , Mbandaka , Gbadolite , Kindu and , as from 6 October , Bukavu . These eight regional FM stations have also commenced locally produced programming . Three short wave transmitters have been installed in Kinshasa and will be fully operational by the end of October , covering the entire country and the region . Radio Okapi has started an information campaign on disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration with specific programmes in French , Swahili and Kinyarwanda targeting both the armed groups and the Congolese population . United Nations agencies have also increased their contributions to Radio Okapi programming . During the reporting period the publication information component of MONUC has produced 60,000 posters and 50,000 bumper stickers in five languages ; these are being disseminated throughout the sectors , by public information staff , military observers , non-governmental organizations and other cooperating partners . In addition , it produces and widely disseminates 5,000 copies of a monthly magazine in French to increase the public's understanding of the Mission's mandate and of new developments in the peace process . This component also issues a daily press review , which covers international media and press clippings , a weekly newsletter and a bi-weekly bulletin . At the same time the photography unit of the Mission has created an archiving system and makes regular contributions to MONUC publications , media requests , and the MONUC web site , www . monuc . org . The video unit has been reinforced and has produced an informational video on the Mission . It also produced a video on the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation in Beni and disseminated it to the sectors . Full video coverage of the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation in Kamina-Kigali was also produced and presented to the ex-combatants in the Kamina camp on 10 October before dissemination to all sectors , as part of the information campaign on that process . MONUC is also disseminating information to areas where armed groups are located . Radio Okapi and MONUC publications are increasingly being used to encourage combatants to disarm and repatriate . Three portable mobile radio facilities with FM transmission , to be used for this purpose , were recently procured and should be installed soon . There were several incidents in which local authorities harassed and intimidated Radio Okapi journalists . On 27 August , in Kindu , RCD-Goma military officers arrested and physically assaulted a Radio Okapi journalist . On 13 September , in Gbadolite , another Radio Okapi journalist was detained for eight days by MLC authorities for reporting on the condition of child combatants in the MLC forces . Human rights MONUC continues to receive regular information indicating that the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains precarious . In recent months , in areas controlled by the Government , there have been several cases of prolonged detention of human rights defenders , a wave of arrests of journalists and the heavy sentencing of some for imputations dommageables , the arrest and detention of relatives and supporters of the leaders of an opposition political party , the Union pour la démocratie et le progrès social ( UDPS ) , and cases of prolonged detention without trial on the order of the Military Prosecutor General . Information received by MONUC includes allegations of arbitrary killings and rapes and excessive use of force by the security forces of all the parties . The situation is particularly worrying in the east . MONUC is especially concerned about consistent reports of violence against women by security and armed groups . On 20 June , the international non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch issued a report documenting the systematic use of rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls by armed groups operating in the east . The victims do not always report these incidents , primarily for fear of rejection by their communities and of reprisals . Consequently , there is no appropriate treatment immediately available to these women and girls . MONUC is following up on this report with a view to increasing the protection of women and girls against rape and other violations of human rights . Widespread and grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law continue to be perpetrated by the armed opposition following several armed conflicts between RCD-Goma / RPA on the one hand , and the Mayi-Mayi and uncontrolled , foreign armed groups on the other , especially in South Kivu and Maniema Provinces . MONUC continues to gather information and report on the conditions of detainees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , where another aspect of the human rights situation is the deplorable state of prisons and other detention centres . Throughout the country , people continue to be detained without due process . Detainees are treated in a degrading and inhumane manner . Detainees who are beneficiaries of presidential amnesties remain imprisoned . The past three months in Kindu have been marked by human rights violations that have far surpassed the predicted worst-case scenarios . The crisis erupted in August , shortly after RCD reinforced its eighth Brigade with a new commander and chief of staff , both of whom were allegedly involved in the massacres of 14 May in Kisangani . In retaliation for a failed offensive against the Mayi-Mayi , the RCD-Goma soldiers summarily executed 46 civilians , including a 15-year-old boy , and seven members of the same family . In Kindu itself the President of RCD-Goma , in a radio broadcast , accused MONUC of complicity with the Mayi-Mayi . This speech was followed by an outbreak of violence against suspected Mayi-Mayi sympathizers , which reportedly resulted in the killing of 25 people . Most recent reports involve the public execution , on 22 September , of three RCD-Goma soldiers who robbed a trader and , on 6 October , the summary execution by RCD-Goma of six fishermen suspected of being Mayi-Mayi . The number and scale of gross human rights violations is growing rapidly and the situation demands greater protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence . Report of the Commission on Human Rights on Kisangani At the request of the Security Council , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in cooperation with MONUC undertook an investigation of the events of mid-May in Kisangani , covered in the eleventh report on MONUC ( S / 2002 / 621 ) . From 16 to 22 June , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of the Commission on Human Rights , Asma Jahangir , conducted a fact-finding mission to Kinshasa , Goma and Kisangani . On 16 July , the then High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , submitted a report on the Special Rapporteur's findings and recommendations on the Kisangani situation to the Security Council . The Security Council condemned the actions of RCD-Goma in Kisangani and demanded that the rebel movement bring the perpetrators of the killings to justice . Child protection The reporting period was marked by a disturbing upsurge in the recruitment of child soldiers . MONUC verified the existence of a training camp run by RPA in the area of Luvungui north of Uvira . Of the estimated 500 Mayi-Mayi in training at that location , between 50 and 100 were children under the age of 18 . The majority of the victims in the ongoing Hema-Lendu conflict in the area of Bunia are women and children . Among the hundreds of injured women and children admitted to hospitals in Bunia , 80 per cent suffer from wounds to the head , hands and extremities . The perpetrators used knives , cudgels , machetes and other sharp implements as their weapons . The fighting between UPC and RCD-K / ML forces in the north-east has led to a significant rise in the number of child soldiers being recruited by the forces in that area . In Bunia , the forces of Commander Thomas Lubanga have recruited large numbers of child soldiers . Although UNICEF , MONUC and non-governmental organizations continue to plan for and advocate child demobilization in rebel-held areas , rebel parties have not yet agreed to give the international community access to military sites . Discussions on the establishment of child demobilization subcommissions have not yet borne fruit . It is hoped that the latest UNICEF / RCD-Goma efforts will result in the establishment of a subcommission in Kisangani in the near future . Plans for the demobilization of child soldiers in the context of overall disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration are well under way . This is being done in conjunction with other relevant partners , most notably UNICEF . With the Government of Norway's financial contribution to support the peace process , the Child Protection Section has finalized a plan to augment the capacity of local non-governmental organizations to receive and aid possible child ex-combatants completing the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration exercise in the Beni-Butembo area . Child protection advisers work together with UNICEF , which is providing similar emergency expansion capacity to local child protection non-governmental organizations in Bukavu in anticipation of needs related to disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration in the area . Gender issues Raising the gender awareness of MONUC personnel , agency partners and the population has been the focus of the work of the gender section . The medium - to long-term objective is to ensure the integration of a gender perspective into all aspects of the Mission's work . On 23 July , the gender section convened a strategic planning meeting with the Mission's military and civilian staff to create an action plan for integrating the concept of gender into all MONUC activities . The next step will be to form Mission-wide gender working groups to assess the gender dimensions of the Mission's work and ensure that gender concerns are accounted for in all of its activities . Sessions on gender sensitivity also continue to be a regular part of the induction programmes offered to all incoming military , civilian and civilian police staff . This is in addition to the gender awareness training of trainers for the local police in Kisangani . Meetings with Congolese civil society organizations , media , and church organizations across the country to discuss their views on the peace process are still being held . The major outcome of such work is to harmonize the vision of women's groups from the east and the west so that they can work out strategies to ensure their full participation in the implementation of the Nairobi Declaration adopted prior to the inter-Congolese dialogue . A plan of action to address the reports of violence against women in the east was also discussed by various stakeholders . Humanitarian activities Humanitarian conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain deeply disturbing . Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the crisis . Approximately 17 million people – almost a third of the country's population of approximately 53 million – are in need of urgent food aid , while approximately 2.2 million people are displaced within the country . During the reporting period , significant new displacement was reported in Ituri and Maniema Provinces . Women , children and the elderly are the most affected by the conflict . A humanitarian assessment team comprising the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and representatives of MONUC travelled to Minembwe-Itombwe on 2 August , under the protection of RPA . The team was , however , denied access to other areas further west in the Hauts Plateaux , where there had been fighting between RCD-Goma / RPA and Commander Masunzu's forces 48 hours before the mission . On 3 August , the team travelled to Fizi-Baraka , but a hostile crowd of civilians and soldiers prevented them from leaving the airport . The mission was successfully completed on 8 August , however . The Humanitarian Coordinator described the situation in the border region of Uvira , the Hauts Plateaux and Fizi-Baraka as a "" creeping disaster "" , with over 100 villages deserted and 20,000 newly displaced families , bringing the total number of internally displaced people in South Kivu to an estimated 400,000 . In the context of continuous military offensives against Masunzu's stronghold , humanitarian assistance in the area remains limited to ad hoc interventions conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross . Humanitarian affairs officers have witnessed an increase in recent months in the harassment of relief workers and the looting of their assets . Humanitarian staff in Bunia and Dungu experienced threats of physical violence and looting , which in Bunia resulted in the loss of nearly 14 tons of food destined for vulnerable populations . Several humanitarian teams were evacuated , most notably from Shabunda and Nyankunde . In many areas where there is widespread insecurity , health conditions are reported to have deteriorated alarmingly , and there is evidence of very high malnutrition rates among the populations . Access to war-affected areas remains critical for humanitarian partners . The deteriorating humanitarian situation against the backdrop of planned disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration activities requires a reinvigorated humanitarian effort that expands coverage to more locations . Following consultations with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other United Nations and non-governmental partners , MONUC will shortly extend its humanitarian presence beyond its current locations in Kinshasa , Mbandaka , Bukavu , Kisangani , Gbadolite , Kalemie and Goma to under-served locations with significant humanitarian needs . MONUC logistical capabilities have been a great asset to the humanitarian community's relief efforts in the country . From June to September , MONUC transported more than 95 tons of humanitarian cargo . MONUC also supported the 2002 National Polio Vaccination Campaign during those months ; the campaign achieved 85 to 90 per cent coverage . Mine action While less of a hazard than in other mission areas , mines and unexploded ordnance are still present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Most mines were planted in 1999 and 2000 . In particular , the areas of Kisangani and Ikela are heavily mined . Reportedly , FAC , RCD , UPDF and RPA frequently used mines in the Mbuji-Mayi , Kabinda , Kabalo , Pweto , Beni , Buta and Tshopo areas . As a consequence of the conflict in Burundi , landmines were planted in Kivu in the Uvira region , close to the Burundi border . It is believed that Uvira , Baraka , Makobolo and the Ruzizi Valley are mined . Reportedly , UPC has also used mines in the recent fighting around Bunia . MONUC works in close collaboration with the Mine Action Coordination Centre , with offices in Kinshasa and Kisangani . MONUC and the Centre share a database on mines and unexploded ordnance and have well-defined standard operational procedures . Mine-clearing activities conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are limited to the work of a Belgian non-governmental organization which works closely with the Mine Action Coordination Centre , local partners and MONUC military engineers . Demining activities in support of MONUC operations in Kindu are currently under contract negotiation , while the contract in Kisangani has been finalized . Quick-impact projects In enhancing its effectiveness , MONUC is endeavouring to engage actively with the local population as a means of winning the support necessary to carry out its mandate . The Mission has made extensive use of quick-impact projects , with a view to making a demonstrable , positive difference in the lives of the people where MONUC is deployed and to enhance its credibility with the local population . MONUC has focused on high visibility projects in the areas of restoration or enhancement of water services and water purification ; provision of public sanitation ; provision of basic medical equipment and medical supplies ; repairs to school buildings and provision of basic school furniture / materiel ; repairs to hospitals / medical facilities ; and repairs to basic community infrastructure . The Mission's phase III activities , outlined in the special report , will imply deployment into new areas in the east , most of which have suffered from years of conflict . It will be essential for the success of the phase III activities to continue reaching out to the local population to ensure their acceptance of the Mission , and therefore to extend funding for quick-impact projects during phase III . Review and assessment mission The Department of Peacekeeping Operations sent a review and assessment mission to MONUC from 28 July to 8 August , led by former Assistant Secretary-General Manfred Eisele . The aim of the mission was to review the present capability of MONUC to implement its mandate and to meet future challenges , especially in the face of major changes in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The review team , which travelled all over the Mission area , examined various aspects of the MONUC operations and also met with members of the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda as well as the diplomatic community in Kinshasa and Kigali . The review mission found MONUC staff members to be active and committed to fulfilling the Mission's mandate . They were extremely frank with the review mission in expressing their views on how MONUC could improve its activities as it geared up for phase III activities . The mission found that the main areas in need of enhancement include the setting of overall strategic direction and communication of such direction throughout the Mission and beyond ; strengthening management of the Mission through the appointment of a second deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for operations and management , strengthening a number of key posts and ensuring that the Mission is properly staffed ; reviewing the delegation of authority and ensuring appropriate command and control arrangements throughout the Mission ; enhancing information flows and policy and analysis functions , as well as coordination of activities throughout all components of the Mission ; and ensuring that the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration programme is "" mainstreamed "" through the Mission and is provided with the full support of all components . The report of the assessment mission was presented to me on 1 October , and the members of the Security Council and troop-contributing countries were briefed on the main elements . Subsequent to my approval of the review mission's wide-ranging recommendations , the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has initiated an action plan so that MONUC can more effectively implement its mandate . In due course , the Department will conduct a review of the implementation of these important recommendations . Logistical activities As MONUC continues its eastward deployment and intensifies the preparations for the launching of a full-scale disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation , the daunting logistical support tasks that lie ahead become ever more apparent . Arrangements for the deployment of the two task forces and setting up of temporary reception centres would involve a carefully planned and coordinated engineering effort , requiring an integrated civilian and military approach to optimize the use of the limited engineering resources available in MONUC . Since many of the reception centres may be located in remote and scattered locations with poor or no road access , additional air assets will be required to deploy personnel and equipment to establish , operate and dismantle the centres and associated accommodation camps for ex-combatants and possibly their dependants . Consideration will also have to be given to modalities and funding arrangements for the transportation of the combatants and their families ( estimated at around 90,000 persons ) from the reception centres to their final destinations . Additional technical expertise for the upkeep of airfields associated with centres and camps and to support air operations in general will also need to be considered . The capacities of the logistic bases in Kinshasa and Kisangani will be increased and a new logistic base at Kigoma , United Republic of Tanzania , is being considered to optimize the delivery of equipment and stores . Since logistics operations involving the mobile disarmament and demobilization sites will be complex , the two task forces will have to be self-sustained , and it is expected that all major contingent-owned equipment will be provided under "" wet lease "" arrangements . The task forces will also need to have sufficient integral engineering and aviation assets to support MONUC operations in the specific areas of the establishment of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration reception centres and associated camps , water purification , maintenance of runways / landing grounds and local access road networks , airfield support services and operational demining tasks . Financial aspects The General Assembly , by its resolution 56 / 252 C of 27 June 2002 , appropriated an amount of $ 581 . 9 million for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 . Since its establishment in October 1999 , the Trust Fund to support the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has received voluntary contributions amounting to $ 1 . 1 million , with expenditures authorized to date in the full amount . As at 31 August 2002 , unpaid assessed contributions to the MONUC special account amounted to $ 322 . 9 million . The total outstanding assessed contributions for all peacekeeping operations at that date amounted to $ 1 , 781 . 1 million . Observations Since my last progress report to the Security Council , there have been significant developments in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The signing of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements , the consequent withdrawals of foreign forces from the country , the arrest of three persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Luanda , Brazzaville and Kinshasa , the banning of the FDLR leadership based in Kinshasa , the successful exploratory visit to Rwanda of a group of ex-combatants and their dependants from Kamina , and the increased contacts between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda and Uganda are all major steps which can have lasting , positive implications for the political and military situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The parties should be congratulated for the political will they have demonstrated in moving the peace process forward . Nevertheless , there continue to be serious challenges . Heavy fighting continues in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the country . The fragile peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and recent gains made in the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement are in serious danger of being reversed because of the most recent military offensive undertaken against Uvira and other key locations in the east . I urge all parties to put an end to all hostilities and take advantage of the positive atmosphere and opportunities created by recent developments in the country , and especially welcome the role of the Government of South Africa in its persistent effort to keep the peace process on track . The situation in the Ituri region remains worrying . My previous progress reports described the continuing violence and abuses in that area , which have worsened recently . All parties concerned should now work together to promote confidence . I commend the establishment in the Ituri region of the Joint Pacification Commission , under the terms of the Luanda Agreement , and hope that it will serve to restore peace and stability in this troubled region of the country . Equally , the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source of grave concern . The current culture of impunity that exists in many parts of the country must end , and those responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law must be held accountable . The recent arrests of individuals indicted by the Tribunal and their transfer to Arusha is encouraging in this regard . I strongly condemn the threats and harassment against MONUC staff , including those working for Radio Okapi . The instigators of the latest incidents in Kisangani and elsewhere in the Democratic Republic of the Congo bear responsibility for such acts and must understand that , in order for peace and normalcy to return to the country , the safety and security of United Nations personnel must be guaranteed . There must also be a free flow of information ; the role of Radio Okapi is fundamental in this process . As the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo moves forward , the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration of foreign armed groups will become a central part of MONUC operations . The Mission has been active in promoting the early implementation of this crucial programme . I am gratified by the close collaboration between MONUC and the different international partners , including the United Nations agencies and programmes , the World Bank , and other members of the donor community ; the United Nations is determined to strengthen this vital coordination . The progress achieved so far in the inter-Congolese dialogue is encouraging . The increasing willingness of the various political actors to engage and address their counterparts is a welcome sign . In this regard , I urge all parties to be guided by the interests of the Congolese people . I believe it is essential to look beyond the distribution of posts in the transitional administration leading towards a new political dispensation , and to begin addressing issues such as security sector reform and the extension of State authority throughout the country . Above all , the Congolese leadership must focus on the creation of a reformed and revitalized State that can meet the aspirations of its people . We must not allow the present opportunity to be lost . I also call on all parties to cooperate in the mediation efforts of my Special Envoy , Moustapha Niasse , and the Government of South Africa , with a view to reaching an early understanding on the transitional arrangements foreseen under the Lusaka Agreement . The United Nations will continue to do its utmost and work with the Congolese parties and people to achieve these aims . To do so , the full support of the international community is needed . In my special report , I have already referred to the need to give strong impetus to the peace process . I once again encourage the Security Council to take the necessary decisions in this regard . Finally , I wish to express my appreciation to my Special Representative , Amos Namanga Ngongi , to the Force Commander , Major General Mountaga Diallo , and to all the men and women of MONUC , military and civilian , for their untiring efforts under the very challenging circumstances still prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

Domestic Violence Counseling Referral Sources : For those who choose to use violence , and for those who have experienced violence . Batterers Intervention Lack of anger management does not cause relationship violence . Violence is a choice . A batterers intervention group is the most effective resource for the person who has been physically , emotionally , and / or sexually abusive to his or her partner . Group intervention has the potential to hold those who use violence and anger the most accountable for many reasons . The group dynamic creates a mechanism for batterers to confront each other on their use of denial and blaming others , as well as other controlling dynamics utilized by batterers . Groups should be at least 26 weeks and some studies show that batterers groups do not even begin to break through the layers of denial for many participants until 36 weeks . The focus of these groups should be on power and control ( not anger management , since out-of-control anger is not the issue with domestic violence ) and on accountability ( taking responsibility for one's behavior ) . Financial Management Manual : A resource for domestic and sexual violence programs This Manual is intended to serve as a guide for rape crisis centers in establishing effective and efficient accounting procedures and policies to ensure a high level of integrity in the accounting process .

1350	"Domestic Violence - A Workplace Issue She was one of the top customer service reps in the company . To her coworkers , Suzanne seemed to have it all - a doting husband , children , a lovely home and a successful career . Every night at the end of her shift , her husband was waiting outside in their car for her , and she was out the door promptly at five . One day her manager approached her just before quitting time and asked to speak with her in his office . She became flustered and asked if it could n't wait until the next day . He shrugged her off . "" It 'll only take a few minutes . I wo n't keep you long . "" He was true to his word but when Suzanne opened the door to leave her manager's office , her fuming husband was standing there . He ordered her to go to the car . What Suzanne's colleagues did n't know was that she spent the following two days being insulted , assaulted and locked in her own bedroom , all at the hands of her "" devoted "" husband . What is domestic violence ? Domestic violence ( also called battering or intimate partner violence ) is a pattern of abusive behaviour used by a person to gain power and control over his or her partner in an intimate relationship . The abusive behaviour can include intimidation , verbal abuse , emotional attacks , threats or use of violence , sexual assault , and homicide . The batterer may also use other means to control his or her victim , such as controlling finances , interfering in the victim's work , isolation , limited or no communication , blaming , apologies , promises to change and gifts . Victims of domestic violence come from all walks of life , however the majority are women . The SafeWork website reports that in the United States , 1 in 3 women will report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives . Domestic violence tends to become more severe over time with the highest number of assaults and homicides occurring after victims leave their abusive partners . So why is domestic violence a workplace issue ? When a victim leaves the abusive relationship , the abuser knows that the one place the victim can be found is at work . Ten signs of domestic violence If you suspect that one of your employees or colleagues may be in an abusive relationship , look for a pattern of these signs : Injuries such as bruises , black eyes , or broken bones with no , or unlikely explanations such as blaming the injuries on falls or being clumsy Large number of phone calls , emails , and texts from a current or former partner and reluctance to respond to them Disruptive visits to work by current or former partner What employers can do As an employer , you have the power to keep your employees safe at work . Ultimately , this will also protect your community as well as your company's bottom line . You can start by developing a domestic violence policy . You can also train your managers , supervisors and all employees about proper response steps , and raise awareness about the issue . Train managers and supervisors to : recognize - be aware of signs of violence for potential victims and abusers refer - know who to call internally and externally if a situation of domestic violence becomes known Training should include issues of privacy and confidentiality . Start a program in your workplace to address domestic violence : Make prevention of and response to domestic violence part of your workplace violence prevention program . Create awareness by talking about domestic violence with your employees . Communicate that your workplace is a safe environment for them to reach out for help with domestic violence . Provide employees with information on how to recognize the signs of a troublesome or abusive relationship so they know when to seek assistance for themselves or for co-workers . Make information on counseling and support resources available both inside and outside the organization . Educate employees regarding security procedures available to keep themselves and others safe in the workplace , including where and how to report a potential threat and how to avoid unintentionally giving the abuser access to the victim . remove the employee's name and phone number from automated phone messages or directories ; do n't give out any employee's personal information to others ; ensure the employee knows the specifics of your workplace policy and how to report any incident or threat ; rework the employee's work assignment or schedule . Develop an effective workplace response to domestic violence that includes an organizational safety plan as well as working with victims to develop individualized workplace safety plans . Domestic violence is a workplace issue . In April 2009 Ontario tabled Bill 168 , an act to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act . The proposed bill specifically addressed the issue of domestic violence in the workplace by requiring Ontario employers to "" take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances "" to protect workers from domestic violence that would likely cause physical injury to workers in the workplace . This obligation on the employer arises only if the employer is - or should be - aware of the situation . What constitutes "" domestic violence "" is not defined . The new legislation is expected to be passed in the Fall 2009 . Hazard Alerts Print this article Lead in the Workplace Last year , some childhood lead poisonings in Maine came from an unusual source . Parents got lead dust on their clothes at work and then carried it into their cars , inadvertently exposing their children . Workers can be exposed to lead in the workplace by inhaling fumes and dusts , or by accidentally ingesting it from lead-contaminated hands , food , drinks , cosmetics , tobacco products , and clothing . As in the case of the family in Maine , workers can take lead home on their clothes , skin , hair , tools , and in their vehicles , potentially exposing their families to harmful health effects . In an updated health and safety bulletin , Work Safe Alberta offers guidance on lead in the workplace and how to protect workers and their families from lead exposure . Lead exposure Until the 1980s , the main sources of lead exposure for Canadians were lead paint and emissions from cars using leaded gasoline ( which stopped in Canada in 1990 , except for some specific types of vehicles ) . Today lead is used in many of the following products : batteries lead shielding for x-rays crystal ceramics and pottery glazes stained glass lead solder - used in water pipes in older homes , electronics , radiator shops cosmetics - many of the pigments and other substances used in cosmetics contain lead pesticides ( lead arsenate ) ammunition lead weights and tools electroplating glass in computer monitors Occupations with lead exposure risks include : Cable splicing Construction Manufacturing of ammunition , ceramics , electrical components , pottery and lead batteries Stained glass Mining Painting Radiator repair Recovery of gold and silver Repair and reclamation of lead batteries Smelting Welding Health effects The most common ways that workers are exposed to lead are inhalation of airborne lead dust or fumes and accidental ingestion . Workers ingest lead by touching the face and handling cigarettes or food when their hands are contaminated with lead . About 5 to 15 percent of the lead an adult ingests is absorbed into their body . Lead is not normally absorbed through the skin unless there is a break in the skin such as a cut or scrape . Symptoms of acute lead poisoning include headache , excessive tiredness , nausea , abdominal cramps , and joint pain . Other effects such as a metallic taste in the mouth , vomiting and constipation or bloody diarrhea can also occur . Harmful effects due to short-term exposure to inorganic lead compounds are rarely seen any more because of strict controls used in workplaces where lead exposure might occur . However , lead accumulates in the body where it can be stored for decades and released back into the blood long after the original exposure . Inorganic lead compounds are well known to cause significant health effects following long-term ( chronic ) exposure , including effects on the : Reproductive system ( causing effects on fertility and developmental effects in children ) Nervous system Digestive system Cardiovascular and blood system Kidneys Work Safe Alberta's health and safety bulletin provides greater detail on the health effects as well as information on managing lead in the workplace , exposure levels , monitoring methods , and preventive measures .

Part three provides a survey of some of the research relating to children's learning in science and begins to focus on the role of ICT . Issues of pupil age and gender as well as that of teachers' science knowledge are identified with reference to research findings . A discussion of the implications of a constructivist approach to science is undertaken , highlighting the following challenges : ' One of the principal problems a teacher faces when using constructivist approaches to science teaching is the consideration of the unique ideas and experiences 30 individuals bring to each new science topic . How can the teacher elicit and challenge all of these to ensure that children develop the desired scientific concepts ? How can s / he ensure that each child is involved in science investigation ? How can s / he promote group work with limited science resources so that children can co-operate in science projects ? ' p 20 The view is presented that the primary curriculum should be made more exciting and comprehensible by focusing on observation and description , leaving explanation for KS3 . ' The author of this report strongly recommends that primary children should not be taught aspects of science that are too difficult for their teachers . ' p 18 Part four evaluates how ICT is currently being used to support primary science based on different modes of use . The value of spreadsheets and databases as tools in the primary curriculum is discussed as outlined in the following extract . ' Poole ( 2000 ) , however , warns that primary children have used spreadsheets without going through all the preliminary stages such as selecting axis scales and deciding on the best type of graph to explore patterns in the data . He suggests that the key issue is the pupil's ability to handle and interpret the data , so that the use of ICT for graphing needs to be part of a well-coordinated programme for teaching graphical skills . When the use of spreadsheets is considered in terms of the skills , concepts and attitudes summarised in Table 2 ( see source ) , however , it appears that the only added value of using a spreadsheet in terms of primary science is the speed with which the data can be presented graphically . This could indeed prove to be problematic because if the children are not drawing the graphs for themselves , they may experience a ' conceptual gap ' between measurements and their graphical representation . McFarlane ( 2000b ) , however , argues that using the graphing applications of spreadsheets can allow data handling exercises to focus on presentation and interpretation rather than simple construction . The issue could be analogous to that of children using calculators routinely instead of mental arithmetic ' p23 The term ' drawing graphs for themselves ' may be the cause of confusion here . Rather than being an issue of the technology used to create a graph ( i . e . pencil , paper and ruler versus computer and software ) , it may be an issue of agency and experience in the design of graphs for differing purposes . Data logging is evaluated positively but issues of practicality are highlighted . CD-ROMs and the Internet are evaluated as a reference source . Examples of students' evaluations are included . E-mail , digital cameras , PowerPoint and Interactive Whiteboards are evaluated as a means of communicating concepts and understanding . The view is expressed that ICT can realise its greatest potential as support for presenting scientific information . Control technology , simulators and virtual reality are evaluated as a means for exploration and investigation . The final part of the report identifies opportunities for research focusing in particular on the subject knowledge of the primary science curriculum , the match of software to science learning , the impact of using spreadsheets and the design of CD-ROMs .	3
98	How does the news shape the way we see the world ? Here 's the world based on the way it looks -- based on land mass . And here 's how news shapes what Americans see . This map -- ( Applause ) -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in February of 2007 -- just one year ago . Now , this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities . There was massive flooding in Indonesia . And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming . The U. S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage . And when we take out the U. S. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of Iraq -- that 's that big green thing there -- and little else . The combined coverage of Russia , China and India , for example , reached just one percent . When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here 's how the world looked . What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith . This story eclipsed every country except Iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report . And the cycle continues ; as we all know , Britney has loomed pretty large lately . So why do n't we hear more about the world ? One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half . Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi , New Delhi and Mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa , India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people . The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper . And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news . Local TV news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news . And what about the web ? The most popular news sites do n't do much better . Last year , Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page . And they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events . Similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U. S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters , and do n't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it . So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today's college graduates as well as less educated Americans know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago . And if you think it 's simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong . In recent years , Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent . The real question : is this distorted world view what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world ? I know we can do better . And can we afford not to ? Thank you .	0
921	"A Dash from Diamond City George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | Chapter XXXVIII . The Surgeon's Words . "" Bad enough , poor fellow ; but I think I can pull them both round . Nothing vital , you see , touched , and these Mauser bullets make wonderfully clean wounds ! "" "" And the other ? "" "" Bad flesh-wounds--great loss of blood . I just got at that artery in time . "" West heard these words spoken by someone whose head kept getting in his way as he lay staring up at the great bright stars directly overhead , and it seemed very tiresome . He tried to speak and ask whoever it was to move aside ; but his tongue would not stir , and he lay perfectly still , trying to think what it all meant , and in a dull far-off sort of way it gradually dawned upon him that the people near him were talking about the Boers he had somehow or another and for some reason shot down . Then , as he thought , the calm feeling he was enjoying grew troubled , and he began to recall the fact that he had been shooting somebody's ponies to supply somebody else with food , and that he must have been mad , for he felt convinced that they would not be nice eating , as he had heard that the fat was oily and the flesh tasted sweet . Besides which , it would be horrible to have to eat horseflesh at a time when his throat was dry with an agonising thirst . Then the terrible thought forced itself upon him that while shooting down ponies he had missed them and killed men instead , and once more all was blank . The next time the power of thinking came to the poor fellow all was very dark , and a jarring pain kept running through him , caused by the motion of his hard bed , which had somehow grown wheels and was being dragged along . Cattle were lowing and sheep bleating . There were shouts , too , such as he knew were uttered by Kaffir drivers , and there were the crackings of their great whips . After a while he made out the trampling of horses and heard men talking , while in an eager confused way he listened for what they would say about those two wounded Boers , one of whom had nearly bled to death before that artery was stopped . These , he felt , must be the Boers he shot when he ought to have shot ponies . And as he got to that point the trouble of thinking worried his brain so that he could think no more , and again all was blank . At last came a morning when West woke up in a great room which seemed to be familiar . There were nurses moving about in their clean white-bordered dresses , and he knew that he was in some place fitted up as a hospital . Several of the occupants of the beds wore bandages suggestive of bad wounds , and to help his thoughts there came from time to time the dull heavy reports of cannon . He did not recollect all that had preceded his coming yet ; but he grasped the fact that he had been wounded and was now in hospital . He lay for a few minutes with his brain growing clearer and clearer , and at last , seeing one of the nurses looking in his direction , he tried to raise one hand , but could not . The other proved more manageable , and in obedience to a sign the nurse came , laid a hand upon his forehead , and smiled down in his face . "" Your head's cooler ! "" she said . "" You 're better ? "" "" Yes , "" he replied : "" have I been very bad ? "" "" Terribly ! We thought once that you would not recover . "" "" And Ingleborough ? "" "" Ingleborough ? Oh , you mean your companion who was brought in with you ? "" West nodded : he could not speak . "" Well , I think he will get better now ! "" "" But his wound : is it so bad ? "" "" He nearly bled to death ; but you must not talk much yet . "" "" Only a little ! "" said West eagerly . "" Pray tell me , he will get better ? "" "" Oh yes : there 's no doubt about it , I believe . "" "" Oh , thank goodness ! "" cried West fervently . "" But what place is this ? "" "" This ? Why , Kimberley , of course ! "" "" Ah ! "" cried West excitedly , and his hand went to his breast . "" My jacket ! "" "" Your jacket ? "" said the nurse . "" Oh , that was all cut and torn , and soaked with blood . I think it has been burnt . "" "" What ! "" cried West . "" Oh , do n't say that ! "" "" Hush , hush ! What is this ? "" said a deep , stern voice . "" Patient delirious , nurse ? "" A quiet , grave-looking face was bent over West's pillow , and the poor fellow jumped at the idea that this must be the surgeon . "" No , sir ; no , sir ! "" he whispered excitedly , catching at the new-comer's arm . "" I am better : it is only that I am in trouble about my clothes . "" "" Clothes , eh ? "" said the doctor , smiling . "" Oh , you will not want clothes for two or three weeks yet . "" "" Not to dress , sir , "" whispered West excitedly ; "" but I must have my jacket . It is important ! "" "" Why ? "" said the surgeon , laying his hand upon the young man's brow soothingly . "" I was bringing on a despatch from Mafeking when I was shot down , sir , "" whispered West excitedly . "" It was sewn up for safety in the breast . "" "" Indeed ? "" said the doctor , laying his fingers on the lad's pulse and looking keenly in his eyes . "" Yes , sir , indeed ! "" said West eagerly . "" I know what I am saying , sir . "" "" Yes , you are cool now ; but I 'm afraid the jacket will have been burned with other garments of the kind . Of course , the contents of the pockets will have been preserved . "" "" Oh , they are nothing , sir , "" cried West piteously . "" It is a letter sewn up in the breast that I want . It is so important ! "" "" Well , I 'll see ! "" said the doctor gravely , and , signing to the nurse who had been in attendance , he left the ward , with West in a state of feverish anxiety . At last , to West's intense satisfaction , the horribly blood-stained garment was brought in , and his hand went out trembling to catch it by the breast , fully expecting to find the missive gone . "" Yes , "" he cried wildly , "" it is here ! "" "" Hah ! "" cried the doctor , and , taking out his knife , he prepared to slit it up , but West checked him . "" No , "" he panted : "" the Commandant . Send for him here ! "" "" My good lad , he is so busy , he would not come ! Let me cut out the message and send it to him . "" "" No , "" said West firmly ; "" I will not part from it till he comes . "" "" But really -- "" "" Tell him a wounded messenger from Mafeking has a letter for him , and he will come . "" West was right : the magic word Mafeking brought the Commandant to his bedside ; and as soon as he came up he stopped short and made what little blood poor West had left flush to his face , for he cried : "" Hullo ! Why , it is our illicit-diamond-dealer ! I thought we were never to see you again ! "" "" It is not true ! "" cried West . "" The man who denounced me lied ! "" "" Then you have been to Mafeking ? "" "" Yes , sir : Mr. Ingleborough and I. "" "" And brought back a despatch ? "" "" Yes , sir : here it is ! "" "" Where ? "" said the Commandant , glancing down at the stained tunic on the bed . "" Open it now , sir , "" said West to the doctor , who took out his knife again , slit the cloth , and drew out the big letter , terribly soaked with its bearer's blood . "" Bravo ! Brave messenger ! "" cried the Commandant , grasping West's hand before tearing open the packet and finding enough of the despatch unstained to allow him to decipher the principal part of the text . "" Hah ! "" he cried , when he had finished , "" on the whole good news ; but , "" he continued , glancing at the date , "" you have been a long time coming . "" "" Have I , sir ? We lost no time ! "" "" The poor fellow has been lying here for a fortnight , sir , "" said the surgeon . "" A fortnight ago ? Why , that was the day when the reconnoitring party returned with the captured sheep and cattle . Yes , I remember now : they had a brush with the Boers up the river . Of course , yes : they were attracted by the firing , and saved two young Englishmen . You are one of them ? "" "" Yes , sir . "" "" Well done , then ! Our raiding party did good work , though they did have a desperate fight afterwards to get through the Boer lines . Getting better ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , with a sigh of relief : "" now that I have got my despatch safely into your hands ! "" "" But what about your bad character ? "" "" It was a false accusation , sir ! "" cried West indignantly . "" The man who denounced me was the criminal himself . "" "" Well , you have done your duty so truly that I believe you in preference to him . "" "" But I shall be able to fully clear myself , sir , soon , for this man is a prisoner now with the cavalry brigade . Has that come into the town yet , sir , with the prisoners , guns , and the convoy they captured ? "" "" Hah ! "" cried the Commandant : "" this is news indeed ! Has the brigade captured all you say ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , and he told all that had taken place up to the time of he and Ingleborough being cut off and chased by the Boers . "" We knew nothing of this ! "" said the Commandant . "" We are prisoners ourselves ; but your news gives us hope of a speedy release , for the General is not one to let the grass grow under his feet . "" "" He is not , sir ! "" said West . "" Then you shall bring me and the man who accused me face to face . "" "" The sooner the better , my lad ! "" said the Commandant warmly . "" How soon will he be up , doctor ? "" "" Within a fortnight , I hope , sir ! "" was the reply . "" Then goodbye for the present , my lad ! "" said the Commandant . "" Your long-delayed despatch will send a thrill of hope through all here in Kimberley , for it breathes nothing but determination to hold the Boers at bay . "" "" May I say one word more , sir ? "" said West excitedly . "" What do you think , doctor ? "" "" He has said enough , sir , and if he talks much more we shall have the fever back . Well , perhaps he 'll fret if he does not get something off his mind . "" "" What is it , then ? "" said the Commandant . "" I had a brave comrade to ride with the despatch , sir . "" "" To be sure , yes , I remember . What about him ? Not killed , I hope ? "" "" No , sir , but badly wounded , and lying somewhere here . "" "" Poor fellow ! I must see him . There must be promotion for you both . "" "" If you would see him , sir , and speak to him as you have spoken to me , "" said West , with the weak tears rising to his eyes . "" Of course , yes ! There , shake hands , my lad : you have done splendidly ! Do n't worry about the diamond charge ! I can feel that it was a contemptible lie ! Now , doctor , take me to your other patient . "" "" Ha ! "" sighed West , nestling back on his pillow with a calm look of content in his eyes , which closed directly after for a sleep that lasted ten hours at the least . | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | E-Books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by Athelstane E-Texts ."	6

322	"LONDON - The Deputy Prime Minister , John Prescott has come down heavily on the cost of buying houses in Britain and said that unless people were already on the real estate market , they would find it tough to buy a decent house in the country . He was speaking on the occasion of announcing the nine winners who had won the right to submit designs to build his £ 60,000 homes . The Deputy Prime Minister chose nine building consortiums to build the two-bedroom developments , which are touted as the most affordable houses for first-time buyers . "" I think everybody thinks they are too high , unless you have bought one , and that 's one of the problems of this present stage , "" Mr. Prescott said about the cost of homes in Britain . The £ 60,000 home project is going to build around a thousand ultra-cheap homes "" made from timber , steel , glass and brick and guaranteed to last 100 years . "" Asked as to what he considered as the ideal price for a home Prescott replied , "" I would love to sell a £ 60,000 house . Would n ' t you like to buy one at £ 60,000 ? "" Dismissing criticism , especially from the Tories about the project , Mr. Prescott challenged , "" Unless you have some other arrangement , and we have shown a way forward . But I generally recognize , unless we lift the amount of houses in supply , we are not likely to reduce greatly that increase in prices in housing , which even now is two or three times people's yearly earnings . "" The Conservative spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said that the £ 60,000 was from construction alone and that there would be more costs afterward . "" The grim reality is that the homes are in less than desirable locations - such as next door to mines , prisons and landfill - and are all on contaminated land . The sale prices will be six-figure sums each , and only a mere 300 homes will be affordable , "" she said . However , Mr. Prescott appeared surprised by these allegations and said , "" The pressure was on me to build more and more on brownfield sites . And we have now reached a record level of 70 % . "" The nine finalists announced by John Prescott will now have to submit their designs and one among them will be chosen to build the homes .

63	"CHAPTER III . _IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS , IMMANIOR IPSE_ . Now , in 1482 , Quasimodo had grown up . He had become a few years previously the bellringer of Notre-Dame , thanks to his father by adoption , Claude Frollo , -- who had become archdeacon of Josas , thanks to his suzerain , Messire Louis de Beaumont , -- who had become Bishop of Paris , at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472 , thanks to his patron , Olivier Le Daim , barber to Louis XI . , king by the grace of God . So Quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame . In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church . Separated forever from the world , by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity , imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle , the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow . Notre-Dame had been to him successively , as he grew up and developed , the egg , the nest , the house , the country , the universe . There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church . When , still a little fellow , he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults , he seemed , with his human face and his bestial limbs , the natural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement , upon which the shadow of the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms . Later on , the first time that he caught hold , mechanically , of the ropes to the towers , and hung suspended from them , and set the bell to clanging , it produced upon his adopted father , Claude , the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak . It is thus that , little by little , developing always in sympathy with the cathedral , living there , sleeping there , hardly ever leaving it , subject every hour to the mysterious impress , he came to resemble it , he incrusted himself in it , so to speak , and became an integral part of it . His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral ( if we may be allowed this figure of speech ) , and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that , its natural tenant . One might almost say that he had assumed its form , as the snail takes on the form of its shell . It was his dwelling , his hole , his envelope . There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy , so many magnetic affinities , so many material affinities , that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell . The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell . It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular , symmetrical , direct , almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice . It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him , after so long and so intimate a cohabitation . That dwelling was peculiar to him . It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated , no height which he had not scaled . He often climbed many stones up the front , aided solely by the uneven points of the carving . The towers , on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering , like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall , those two gigantic twins , so lofty , so menacing , so formidable , possessed for him neither vertigo , nor terror , nor shocks of amazement . To see them so gentle under his hand , so easy to scale , one would have said that he had tamed them . By dint of leaping , climbing , gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become , in some sort , a monkey and a goat , like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks , and plays with the sea while still a babe . Moreover , it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral , but his mind also . In what condition was that mind ? What bent had it contracted , what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope , in that savage life ? This it would be hard to determine . Quasimodo had been born one-eyed , hunchbacked , lame . It was with great difficulty , and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk . But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling . Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen , a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes : the bells had broken the drums of his ears ; he had become deaf . The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed , and forever . In closing , it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo . His soul fell into profound night . The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity . Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb . For , in order not to make others laugh , the very moment that he found himself to be deaf , he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone . He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose . Hence , it came about , that when necessity constrained him to speak , his tongue was torpid , awkward , and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty . If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick , hard rind ; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism ; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature , to elucidate his obscure corners , his absurd no-thoroughfares , and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave , we should , no doubt , find the unhappy Psyche in some poor , cramped , and ricketty attitude , like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice , who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them . It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body . Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image , moving blindly within him . The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind . His brain was a peculiar medium ; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted . The reflection which resulted from this refraction was , necessarily , divergent and perverted . Hence a thousand optical illusions , a thousand aberrations of judgment , a thousand deviations , in which his thought strayed , now mad , now idiotic . The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things . He received hardly any immediate perception of them . The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us . The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious . He was malicious , in fact , because he was savage ; he was savage because he was ugly . There was logic in his nature , as there is in ours . His strength , so extraordinarily developed , was a cause of still greater malevolence : "" _Malus puer robustus_ , "" says Hobbes . This justice must , however be rendered to him . Malevolence was not , perhaps , innate in him . From his very first steps among men , he had felt himself , later on he had seen himself , spewed out , blasted , rejected . Human words were , for him , always a raillery or a malediction . As he grew up , he had found nothing but hatred around him . He had caught the general malevolence . He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded . After all , he turned his face towards men only with reluctance ; his cathedral was sufficient for him . It was peopled with marble figures , -- kings , saints , bishops , -- who at least did not burst out laughing in his face , and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness . The other statues , those of the monsters and demons , cherished no hatred for him , Quasimodo . He resembled them too much for that . They seemed rather , to be scoffing at other men . The saints were his friends , and blessed him ; the monsters were his friends and guarded him . So he held long communion with them . He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues , in solitary conversation with it . If any one came , he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade . And the cathedral was not only society for him , but the universe , and all nature beside . He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows , always in flower ; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out , loaded with birds , in the tufts of the Saxon capitals ; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church ; of no other ocean than Paris , roaring at their bases . What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice , that which aroused his soul , and made it open its poor wings , which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern , that which sometimes rendered him even happy , was the bells . He loved them , fondled them , talked to them , understood them . From the chime in the spire , over the intersection of the aisles and nave , to the great bell of the front , he cherished a tenderness for them all . The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages , whose birds , reared by himself , sang for him alone . Yet it was these very bells which had made him deaf ; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering . It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear . On this score , the big bell was his beloved . It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him , on festival days . This bell was named Marie . She was alone in the southern tower , with her sister Jacqueline , a bell of lesser size , shut up in a smaller cage beside hers . This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu , who had given it to the church , which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfauçon . In the second tower there were six other bells , and , finally , six smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing , with the wooden bell , which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the morning of the day before Easter . So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio ; but big Marie was his favorite . No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded . At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him , and said , "" Go ! "" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it . He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell ; he gazed at her a moment , devoutly and lovingly ; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand , like a good horse , which is about to set out on a long journey . He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer . After these first caresses , he shouted to his assistants , placed in the lower story of the tower , to begin . They grasped the ropes , the wheel creaked , the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion . Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled . The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver . Quasimodo vibrated with the bell . "" Vah ! "" he cried , with a senseless burst of laughter . However , the movement of the bass was accelerated , and , in proportion as it described a wider angle , Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely , phosphoric and flaming . At length the grand peal began ; the whole tower trembled ; woodwork , leads , cut stones , all groaned at once , from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit . Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed ; he went and came ; he trembled from head to foot with the tower . The bell , furious , running riot , presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat , whence escaped that tempestuous breath , which is audible leagues away . Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat ; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell , breathed in this overwhelming breath , gazed by turns at the deep place , which swarmed with people , two hundred feet below him , and at that enormous , brazen tongue which came , second after second , to howl in his ear . It was the only speech which he understood , the only sound which broke for him the universal silence . He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun . All of a sudden , the frenzy of the bell seized upon him ; his look became extraordinary ; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed , as a spider lies in wait for a fly , and flung himself abruptly upon it , with might and main . Then , suspended above the abyss , borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell , he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps , pressed it between both knees , spurred it on with his heels , and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body . Meanwhile , the tower trembled ; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth , his red hair rose erect , his breast heaving like a bellows , his eye flashed flames , the monstrous bell neighed , panting , beneath him ; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo : it was a dream , a whirlwind , a tempest , dizziness mounted astride of noise ; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper , a strange centaur , half man , half bell ; a sort of horrible Astolphus , borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze . The presence of this extraordinary being caused , as it were , a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral . It seemed as though there escaped from him , at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd , a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame , and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate . It sufficed for people to know that he was there , to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion . And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand ; it waited on his will to raise its great voice ; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo , as with a familiar spirit . One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe . He was everywhere about it ; in fact , he multiplied himself on all points of the structure . Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers , a fantastic dwarf climbing , writhing , crawling on all fours , descending outside above the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows . Again , in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera , crouching and scowling ; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought . Sometimes one caught sight , upon a bell tower , of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope ; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus . Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework , which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse ; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame . Then , said the women of the neighborhood , the whole church took on something fantastic , supernatural , horrible ; eyes and mouths were opened , here and there ; one heard the dogs , the monsters , and the gargoyles of stone , which keep watch night and day , with outstretched neck and open jaws , around the monstrous cathedral , barking . And , if it was a Christmas Eve , while the great bell , which seemed to emit the death rattle , summoned the faithful to the midnight mass , such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng , and that the rose window was watching it . And all this came from Quasimodo . Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple ; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon : he was in fact its soul . To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed , Notre-Dame is to-day deserted , inanimate , dead . One feels that something has disappeared from it . That immense body is empty ; it is a skeleton ; the spirit has quitted it , one sees its place and that is all . It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes , but no longer sight ."	6

50	"CHAPTER II . The Pool of Tears ' Curiouser and curiouser ! ' cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ; ' now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good-bye , feet ! ' ( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ) . ' Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I 'm sure _I_ sha n ' t be able ! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; -- but I must be kind to them , ' thought Alice , ' or perhaps they wo n ' t walk the way I want to go ! Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . ' And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . ' They must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; ' and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one's own feet ! And how odd the directions will look ! ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT , ESQ. HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , ( WITH ALICE'S LOVE ) . Oh dear , what nonsense I 'm talking ! ' Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door . Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again . ' You ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said Alice , ' a great girl like you , ' ( she might well say this ) , ' to go on crying in this way ! Stop this moment , I tell you ! ' But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall . After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' Oh ! the Duchess , the Duchess ! Oh ! wo n ' t she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! ' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' If you please , sir -- ' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go . Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ' Dear , dear ! How queer everything is to-day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual . I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ? Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! ' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . ' I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ' for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n ' t go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n ' t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! she knows such a very little ! Besides , SHE'S she , and I 'm I , and--oh dear , how puzzling it all is ! I 'll try if I know all the things I used to know . Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is--oh dear ! I shall never get to twenty at that rate ! However , the Multiplication Table does n ' t signify : let 's try Geography . London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome--no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain ! I must have been changed for Mabel ! I 'll try and say "" How doth the little -- "" ' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do : -- ' How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! ' How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! ' ' I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! ever so many lessons to learn ! No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! It 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "" Come up again , dear ! "" I shall only look up and say "" Who am I then ? Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else "" -- but , oh dear ! ' cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ' I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here ! ' As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' How CAN I have done that ? ' she thought . ' I must be growing small again . ' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether . ' That WAS a narrow escape ! ' said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden ! ' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ' and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ' for I never was so small as this before , never ! And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! ' As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case I can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . ( Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . ) However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . ' I wish I had n ' t cried so much ! ' said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . ' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure ! However , everything is queer to-day . ' Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself . ' Would it be of any use , now , ' thought Alice , ' to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . ' So she began : ' O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ' ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar , ' A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse ! ' ) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing . ' Perhaps it does n ' t understand English , ' thought Alice ; ' I daresay it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . ' ( For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . ) So she began again : ' Ou est ma chatte ? ' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book . The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . ' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings . ' I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ' ' Not like cats ! ' cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice . ' Would YOU like cats if you were me ? ' ' Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a soothing tone : ' do n't be angry about it . And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . She is such a dear quiet thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she 's such a capital one for catching mice--oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . ' We wo n ' t talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . ' ' We indeed ! ' cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail . ' As if I would talk on such a subject ! Our family always HATED cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! Do n't let me hear the name again ! ' ' I wo n ' t indeed ! ' said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . ' Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs ? ' The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : ' There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you ! A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things--I ca n ' t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear ! ' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ' I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went . So she called softly after it , ' Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we wo n ' t talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , ' Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ' It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore ."	6
1596	"Procedures Are Pertinent Understanding types of repair information offered by OEMs , and where to find them , improves your repair plans for smoother workflow . Andrew Johnson iStock Auto manufacturer information is available for nearly every step of the repair process : disassembly , body and structural work , refinish , and post-repair quality assurance . Repairers must constantly refer to them for every procedure on every car because designs are changing faster than technicians can be trained . There are an estimated 242 vehicle types that will be re-engineered , redesigned , or introduced as brand-new models over the next three years , says Bill Stage , senior director of development for I-CAR . And those changes are driving updates in required methods for panel attachment , welding , equipment , tools , materials and diagnosis . With so much repair information available , reliance on your memory just does n't cut it these days . So habitual reference to OEM resources are critical for quality , accurate and efficient work to be produced at your facility daily . The Problem Failure to refer to OEM processes is a trend that 's surprisingly common throughout the country , Stage says . Some technicians do n't have time to search for the information , some do n't know where to look , some do n't know what types are available , and others simply do n't know the information even exists . Without the information , Stage says technicians tend to make repair decisions based on guesses , past experience or memory . They start cutting , heating , welding and installing components to try to repair things , but they 're not always accurate . Vehicle updates are made so frequently that many of the processes technicians knew of yesterday are no longer relevant today . That results in several common repair mistakes , he says , such as improper methods for heat application , sectioning , bonding , riveting and restraint system installation . That leads to poor efficiency , cycle time , comeback and customer satisfaction numbers , as well as safety and liability issues – problems that will eventually have a negative impact on sales performance . "" Relying on memory to repair the vehicle will no longer guarantee compliance with OEM procedures , "" Stage say . That 's true even for seasoned veterans . "" With the technology utilized in constructing today's vehicles , you can not safely repair them without access to the information . Sometimes , you ca n't repair them at all , "" he says . What You Need There are more than 20 million pages of OEM repair information available to collision repairers , says Dan Espersen , senior product marketing manager of collision for ALLDATA . The issue for many technicians is the time-consuming task of sifting and sorting through the documents . Here are three main areas that your technicians should learn to find quickly and have on hand at all times : 1 . Restraint system updates : Vehicle restraint systems are regularly modified , even within the same model . Without procedural information , technicians are susceptible to making installations that endanger safety systems throughout the car . Douglas Gan , president of Airbag Solutions , points to the Honda FIT as an example . The 2007 and 2008 FIT restraint system used a pre-tensioner in the belt and an anchor on the driver side . In 2009 , Honda altered that to only a pre-tensioner on both the driver and passenger side . 2 . Material identification : Several new types of high-strength materials are present on new model vehicles – such as steels , aluminum , and in the future , carbon fiber . Technicians must identify the type , location , dimensions , hardness , strength and tolerance of every material because they require updated repair methodology . "" You can not continue to apply the same old methods and logic in today's environment , "" Stage says . "" There are just too many types of materials and construction used in every vehicle . "" Consider this 2013 Honda Accord ( pictured left ) . The B-pillar is 1500 MPA ultra-high-strength steel , Stage says . It ca n't be heated in order to maintain its strength . In addition , where the bottom of the B-pillar meets the rocker panel is an area that requires MIG brazing . Without knowing that , technicians would perform a different outdated process that is likely to weaken the component . "" That would change the vehicle's crash test rating , "" Stage says . "" Occupants wo n't be as protected as they should be in a future wreck . "" 3 . Vehicle complexity : Vehicles are not designed solely of one type of material . That means each component of the car can not be repaired the same way . So knowing the type and location of each material used is crucial . Look at this 2013 Dodge Dart ( right ) . The design features six different types of materials – mild steel , high-strength steel , advanced high-strength steel , press-hardened steel , aluminum and plastic – each of which has its own specific required processes . Espersen says material identification and associated repair methods are among the most important pieces of information for technicians to have easy access to today . But that 's not all . Here 's a look at a few other areas that can dramatically vary between vehicle models where updated information is required : • Structural and panel attachment methods , and required tools and materials to perform the process I-CAR CENTRALIZATION : Even with all these resources available , Gan says it can still be a time-consuming task for technicians to dig through websites and find the information they need . They often feel they do n't have time , which sticks technicians in a dilemma between cycle time and supplement issues . "" Shops want to do the right thing , but are finding it difficult to sort through it all , "" Gan says . "" Shops do n't know where to look , have n't got time to look , and need the information immediately . "" He suggests the industry needs a simpler solution that provides shops with direct connections to information that pertains to the repair they 're performing . Fortunately , I-CAR will soon launch a new initiative to ease technicians' searches for information . The organization is developing a centralized database for all published OEM procedures to create easier and affordable access for shops . The structure for the effort has not yet been determined , but Stage says it will make acquisition of OEM processes much more efficient . Obtain Access Even when technicians know they need OEM repair information , Stage says they do n't always know where to look . He suggests a few resources to utilize during your daily routine : • OEM websites : All auto manufacturers host repair information and technical bulletins on their own websites . Some information is free and some is subscription-based . Shops can purchase short or long-term access to fee-based information from the sites . • OEMOnestop.com : Repairers can visit this website and be directed toward information for all auto manufacturers . • Information providers : The three major estimating companies – Audatex , a Solera Company , CCC Information Services Inc. and Mitchell International have all made developments to build OEM procedures into their systems . Stage says they have developed tools that all shops should take advantage of , such as automatic integration of information within estimates . • ALLDATA : ALLDATA is a single entity that compiles both collision and mechanical OEM repair information into a software package . Visit the company's website , alldata.com , for more information . • Airbag Solutions : Airbag Solutions is an online resource that compiles vehicle restraint system information and procedures for all auto manufacturers .

1219	"Cancer lie military clerk Simon Buckden jailed A former military clerk who lied about having cancer to swindle victims out of money and services worth more than £ 7 , 500 has been jailed for 16 months . Simon Buckden , 44 , from Leeds , received donations including a £ 2 , 000 holiday after lying about his condition . He also falsely claimed to have served in the SAS and seen active duty in Bosnia and Northern Ireland . He was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court having pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud midway through his trial . For live updates and more from across West Yorkshire Buckden described traumatic experiences from his fabricated career , including holding a dying child in his arms , and claimed he suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) as a result . But jurors heard Buckden was a military clerk who had carried out one overseas deployment to Bosnia but had never experienced front line active service . He claimed he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer midway through a challenge to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks to raise awareness of PTSD . Judge Christopher Batty told Buckden : "" You are a dishonest and manipulative man . "" Over a period from at least 2009 , you developed a fictitious persona , a dishonest life history in order to advance your own prospects in life . "" The disrespect you have shown to those who have suffered cancer and to those who have lost their battle with it is quite breathtaking . "" At one stage during the challenge he ran from Leeds to Westminster , receiving the praise of former Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Cameron said : "" I 'm happy to pay tribute to those people who have achieved so much through that run . "" Among his victims Buckden , who in 2012 took part in the Olympic torch relay , duped therapist Kimm Fearnley out of services worth about £ 240 . She said : "" He preyed on people who were kind and generous . "" My daughter died of cancer and to actually have somebody pretending to have cancer is abhorrent . "" Ex-serviceman Phil Lee , who was also conned , said Buckden "" bamboozled me with his sob story "" and he thought it was a "" no-brainer "" to offer his help to "" this very unfortunate person "" . He said Buckden's actions "" deeply offended "" genuine veterans . Buckden was given a restraining order banning him from contacting the prosecution witnesses in the case or making any comment about them on social media ."	8
49	"CHAPTER VI The next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen . A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice . Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over , I felt ready to perish with cold . Breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was not burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small . How small my portion seemed ! I wished it had been doubled . In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class , and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me : hitherto , I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood ; I was now to become an actor therein . At first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and I was glad when , about three o ' clock in the afternoon , Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c . , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same . At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance . It was English history : among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at the top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom . Even in that obscure position , Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : -- "" Burns "" ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , "" Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . "" "" Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in . "" "" Burns , I insist on your holding your head up ; I will not have you before me in that attitude , "" & c . & c . A chapter having been read through twice , the books were closed and the girls examined . The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship - money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point . I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out -- "" You dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning ! "" Burns made no answer : I wondered at her silence . "" Why , "" thought I , "" does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? "" My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether I had ever been at school before , whether I could mark , stitch , knit , & c . ; till she dismissed me , I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements . When I returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import ; but Burns immediately left the class , and going into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end . This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs . Not a tear rose to Burns' eye ; and , while I paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression . "" Hardened girl ! "" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd ; "" nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away . "" Burns obeyed : I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek . The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o ' clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty . On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil , Burns , I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when I passed the windows , I now and then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside . Probably , if I had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace ! as it was , I derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , I wished the wind to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour . Jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , I made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , I found Burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers . "" Is it still ' Rasselas ' ? "" I asked , coming behind her . "" Yes , "" she said , "" and I have just finished it . "" And in five minutes more she shut it up . I was glad of this . "" Now , "" thought I , "" I can perhaps get her to talk . "" I sat down by her on the floor . "" What is your name besides Burns ? "" "" Helen . "" "" Do you come a long way from here ? "" "" I come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of Scotland . "" "" Will you ever go back ? "" "" I hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future . "" "" You must wish to leave Lowood ? "" "" No ! why should I ? I was sent to Lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object . "" "" But that teacher , Miss Scatcherd , is so cruel to you ? "" "" Cruel ? Not at all ! She is severe : she dislikes my faults . "" "" And if I were in your place I should dislike her ; I should resist her . If she struck me with that rod , I should get it from her hand ; I should break it under her nose . "" "" Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations . It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the Bible bids us return good for evil . "" "" But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : I am far younger than you , and I could not bear it . "" "" Yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you _can not bear_ what it is your fate to be required to bear . "" I heard her with wonder : I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser . Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes . I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the matter deeply ; like Felix , I put it off to a more convenient season . "" You say you have faults , Helen : what are they ? To me you seem very good . "" "" Then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : I am , as Miss Scatcherd said , slatternly ; I seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; I am careless ; I forget rules ; I read when I should learn my lessons ; I have no method ; and sometimes I say , like you , I can not _bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements . This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular . "" "" And cross and cruel , "" I added ; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence . "" Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd ? "" At the utterance of Miss Temple's name , a soft smile flitted over her grave face . "" Miss Temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if I do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally . One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though I value it most highly , can not stimulate me to continued care and foresight . "" "" That is curious , "" said I , "" it is so easy to be careful . "" "" For _you_ I have no doubt it is . I observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you . Now , mine continually rove away ; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often I lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream . Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland , and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden , near our house ; -- then , when it comes to my turn to reply , I have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , I have no answer ready . "" "" Yet how well you replied this afternoon . "" "" It was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me . This afternoon , instead of dreaming of Deepden , I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did ; and I thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown . If he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending ! Still , I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him , poor murdered king ! Yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed . How dared they kill him ! "" Helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten I could not very well understand her--that I was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed . I recalled her to my level . "" And when Miss Temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ? "" "" No , certainly , not often ; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain . "" "" Well , then , with Miss Temple you are good ? "" "" Yes , in a passive way : I make no effort ; I follow as inclination guides me . There is no merit in such goodness . "" "" A great deal : you are good to those who are good to you . It is all I ever desire to be . If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse . When we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again . "" "" You will change your mind , I hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl . "" "" But I feel this , Helen ; I must dislike those who , whatever I do to please them , persist in disliking me ; I must resist those who punish me unjustly . It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved . "" "" Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but Christians and civilised nations disown it . "" "" How ? I do n't understand . "" "" It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury . "" "" What then ? "" "" Read the New Testament , and observe what Christ says , and how He acts ; make His word your rule , and His conduct your example . "" "" What does He say ? "" "" Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . "" "" Then I should love Mrs. Reed , which I can not do ; I should bless her son John , which is impossible . "" In her turn , Helen Burns asked me to explain , and I proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments . Bitter and truculent when excited , I spoke as I felt , without reserve or softening . Helen heard me patiently to the end : I expected she would then make a remark , but she said nothing . "" Well , "" I asked impatiently , "" is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ? "" "" She has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as Miss Scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you ! What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart ! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings . Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs . We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph ! Surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? No ; I can not believe that : I hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight , and to which I cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss . Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end . "" Helen's head , always drooping , sank a little lower as she finished this sentence . I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts . She was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great rough girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent -- "" Helen Burns , if you do n't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , I 'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it ! "" Helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay ."	6

933	"The face seemed more heavy and more wrinkled , while that ominous venous tinge was more pronounced as he panted up the hill . The clean lines of his cheek and chin were marred by a day's growth of grey stubble , and his large , shapely head had lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first I glanced at him . He had a letter there , the same , or another , but still in a woman's hand , and over this he was moping and mumbling in his senile fashion , with his brow puckered , and the corners of his mouth drawn down like those of a fretting child . So I left him , with a vague wonder as to who he might be , and why a single spring day should have wrought such a change upon him . So interested was I that next morning I was on the look out for him . Sure enough , at the same hour , I saw him coming up the hill ; but very slowly , with a bent back and a heavy head . It was shocking to me to see the change in him as he approached . "" I am afraid that our air does not agree with you , sir , "" I ventured to remark . But it was as though he had no heart for talk . He tried , as I thought , to make some fitting reply , but it slurred off into a mumble and silence . How bent and weak and old he seemed--ten years older at the least than when first I had seen him ! It went to my heart to see this fine old fellow wasting away before my eyes . There was the eternal letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers . Who was this woman whose words moved him so ? Some daughter , perhaps , or granddaughter , who should have been the light of his home instead of ---- I smiled to find how bitter I was growing , and how swiftly I was weaving a romance round an unshaven old man and his correspondence . Yet all day he lingered in my mind , and I had fitful glimpses of those two trembling , blue-veined , knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them . I had hardly hoped to see him again . Another day's decline must , I thought , hold him to his room , if not to his bed . Great , then , was my surprise when , as I approached my bench , I saw that he was already there . But as I came up to him I could scarce be sure that it was indeed the same man . There were the curly-brimmed hat , and the shining stock , and the horn glasses , but where were the stoop and the grey-stubbled , pitiable face ? He was clean - shaven and firm lipped , with a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great shoulders like an eagle on a rock . His back was as straight and square as a grenadier's , and he switched at the pebbles with his stick in his exuberant vitality . In the button - hole of his well-brushed black coat there glinted a golden blossom , and the corner of a dainty red silk handkerchief lapped over from his breast pocket . He might have been the eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning before . "" Good morning , Sir , good morning ! "" he cried with a merry waggle of his cane . "" Good morning ! "" I answered how beautiful the bay is looking . "" "" Yes , Sir , but you should have seen it just before the sun rose . "" "" What , have you been here since then ? "" "" I was here when there was scarce light to see the path . "" "" You are a very early riser . "" "" On occasion , sir ; on occasion ! "" He cocked his eye at me as if to gauge whether I were worthy of his confidence . "" The fact is , sir , that my wife is coming back to me to day . "" I suppose that my face showed that I did not quite see the force of the explanation . My eyes , too , may have given him assurance of sympathy , for he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low , confidential voice , as if the matter were of such weight that even the sea-gulls must be kept out of our councils . "" Are you a married man , Sir ? "" "" No , I am not . "" "" Ah , then you can not quite understand it . My wife and I have been married for nearly fifty years , and we have never been parted , never at all , until now . "" "" Was it for long ? "" I asked . "" Yes , sir . This is the fourth day . She had to go to Scotland . A matter of duty , you understand , and the doctors would not let me go ."	6
1565	The normal thing is for internet marketing specialists to take charge on their own on-page SEO and to outsource the link building aspect . This makes sense as they have specialist knowledge with conversion optimization and may constantly tweak landing pages . Having knowledge of both conversion optimization and SEO enables an internet marketer to build a high converting and well optimized landing page . The majority focus would be on the sales conversion aspect while good basic on-site SEO would enable each landing page to have a decent organic SEO ranking . Working with a company with specialist knowledge of internet marketing SEO can further improve potential returns . This is due to them having expert staff members able to deal with both aspects of performing SEO and optimizing landing pages for sales conversion . As more and more people turn to the internet to buy goods and services , it is becoming more important to rank highly on search engines to get found . Competition is fierce and will continue to grow in the next few years . This could mean a profitable internet marketer doing everything themselves quickly falls behind and struggles to survive . If they had outsourced the work beforehand when the times were good it would be easier for them to remain profitable as they would have a much more diverse product range to offer consumers .	2

261	News Item : 3 February , 2003 Citizenship to stay at Key Stage 4 Citizenship remains a statutory subject at Key Stage Four under the government 's recently published outline strategy for 14-19 education . The Citizenship Foundation welcomes Citizenship's inclusion alongside Maths , English , Science , Religious Education and PE in a slimmed down National Curriculum . The essential theme of the proposals is to establish a new coherence and more flexibility from 14 , an approach we hope will see statutory Citizenship provision extended to 19 . New compulsory ' work-related learning ' programmes for all will also be introduced as part of the proposed changes . The Citizenship Foundation's First Friday seminar on 7 February , hosted by the TUC , will focus on the links between work-related learning and citizenship , with speakers from Middlesex University , the Nuffield Foundation , Ealing LEA and Lambeth Education-Business Partnership .	2
1502	"In Love ' Em or Lose ' Em , the authors persuasively argue that the ever-increasing "" race for talent "" can be effectively won only by those who adopt a mindset and behaviors that truly support their employees . They then describe how to do so , with a focus on the important role that managers play . Based on research with 17,000 people who have job longevity , the authors identified five top "" stay factors "" such as opportunity for growth , meaningful work and great co-workers . Using these factors , they outline dozens of easy-to-implement strategies for increasing engagement and retention . The book focuses on the practical , suggesting that managers take the initiative by telling their talented employees how much they 're valued and asking the question , What will keep you ? Armed with this invaluable information , managers can then customize their retention strategies to meet each valuable employee's needs . The book uses hands-on exercises and stories of others' failures and successes to get its message across . One reviewer summed up Love ' Em or Lose ' Em by saying : Any manager who dreads losing a top performer would do well to consider this book ."	5

817	Bifurcation Theory In a dynamical system , a bifurcation is a qualitative change in the behaviour of the system caused by a small smooth change in the value of a system parameter . Bifurcations are responsible for the creation and annihilation of equilibria and periodic solutions in a given system and their occurrence is accompanied by a change of solution stability . The knowledge of such qualitative changes is paramount to understanding the long-run behaviour of any dynamical system . The occurrence of bifurcations can be investigated geometrically by analysing the phase space for different parameter values of a given system . Geometric representations of bifurcation structures have the advantage of allowing a visual interpretation of how the parameters of a system affect its behaviour . A bifurcation diagram is a plot of the solutions ( or some feature of the solutions such as the maximum or L2 norm ) of a given system against a single system parameter . These plots are commonly used to display how the stability of solutions changes as the given parameter is varied . In the analysis of dynamical systems with more than one parameter , it is important to determine not only which parameters will cause bifurcations when their values are changed , but also how the bifurcation structure for a particular parameter is affected when changing the value of another . This is known as two-parameter bifurcation analysis . Generally , two-parameter bifurcation diagrams include curves of codimension-1 bifurcations , as well as specific points on these curves defining codimension-2 bifurcations . In order to characterise a particular bifurcation , the behaviour of the system within the region of a local bifurcation point can often be reduced to a simplified normal form . The normal form is the system with a minimum number of parameters and nonlinear terms whereby all systems undergoing the same bifurcation are topologically equivalent . A system that fulfils these requirements is known as the topological normal form of a given bifurcation . The Hartman-Grobmann theorem states that within the local region of a hyperbolic equilibrium , the behaviour of system is topologically equivalent to a linear system . However , at a bifurcation point , the number of eigenvalues with zero real parts is non-zero and thus the point is always non-hyperbolic . Consequentially , the topological normal forms of bifurcation points are always nonlinear .	4

1308	"Ideo : Why Would You Trade Away Your Online Privacy ? 6 Case Studies Personalized services have to offer value discreetly , to get people to share useful information . Most people are still careful to protect their personal information , but more and more of us are choosing to store our most intimate details online : financial information , health records , personal preferences , and even our schedules and location . This is not because we are more trusting , but because sharing information unlocks access to personalized services that support us in meaningful ways . Services such as Flickr , Facebook , and Mint have created platforms to collect personal information and , in turn , have built value around their customers' willingness to provide it . Netflix asks for direct input in exchange for personal recommendations , but the Toyota Prius works in the background , unobtrusively capturing our driving behavior and playing it back to us . Building on the power of information , these services can transform unintended consequences into intentional change . As people share more , their expectations are evolving from archiving services to personalized services that adapt to them , and even anticipatory services that nudge them in positive ways . This has resulted in services that capture people's history , filter their information , and turn it into tailored recommendations , options , alerts , and connections . 1 . Make people feel safe Allow people to reveal themselves selectively and give them control over how their data is used . Let them experience different levels of customization and take ownership of their data . 2 . Support the moment of decision Do n't choose for people . Instead , support them in decision-making when it matters most . Reveal options , choices , and tradeoffs at the right time . 3 . Nudge , do n't push Do n't cross the threshold from nudging people to pushing them with heavy-handed advice . Allow information such as trends , comparisons , and accepted standards to inspire people toward outcomes that they themselves believe in . 4 . Do n't be obtrusive Design noninvasive and intuitive platforms to collect information , and be subtle when nudging people with choices or alerts . Provide ambient services that fit well into people's lives . Surfacing the Hidden Leif is pushing 50 and some of his friends are already facing serious medical problems . So he decided it was time to start taking his own health needs more seriously . He looked into 23andMe . Although it seemed like a credible service , he did have some reservations . What if he learned he carries a rogue gene ? What if an insurance company uses this information against him in the future ? But the benefits outweighed the risks , so he ordered a sampling kit . A month later , he was logging on to the 23andMe website and exploring his DNA sequence . Leif discovered that he has an undiagnosed propensity toward glaucoma . The information from 23andme tells him what to pay attention to and nudges him toward preventive care . How might we help people connect with the invisible , reflecting a new perspective ? How might we allow our own history to introduce a new understanding of ourselves ? Informing Decision-making A year into her first real job , Claire had saved very little and knew she had to do something to keep her finances in check . Her best friend persuaded her to try Mint , an online financial tool that could help her track her spending patterns without the chore of budgeting . What jumped out at her was the $ 800 she spent that month just eating out -- a full $ 150 more than the average among young singles in the NYC area . She cut back , and a month later Mint confirmed that she had spent $ 200 less on food . Seeing her spending patterns and knowing how she compares with her peers gave her a powerful nudge . This new window into her financial life has made her feel more mature and more responsible . How can we reveal the big picture across behaviors in order to inspire proactive change ? Managing the Everyday Karan is a physician at the Northwestern Hospital in Chicago , and he has a demanding schedule . He used to depend on a little notepad for organizing his life , but with a new baby at home he is having trouble keeping up with all of his daily errands . When searching for some iPhone apps , he came across Remember The Milk , which promised to help him manage his tasks and never forget anything . Karan is now addicted to this service and can not imagine going back to his notepad . It 's almost as if he has a personal assistant . Remember The Milk helps Karan from feeling so overwhelmed all the time . And now he promotes the app to all his friends . FoodFlex Safeway's free online tool , FoodFlex , has really changed Karen's buying behavior . Generally , she and her husband think of themselves as healthy eaters , but FoodFlex flagged her sodium intake as exceeding USDA recommended guidelines . Karen's commitment to her Safeway Club Card has completely changed . It 's no longer just a way of spotting bargains . She uses it to keep track of her family's food habits and hopes to slowly change her shopping pattern toward healthier choices . Facebook Connect The whole point of Facebook is to allow people to share personal information with their friends . Now members can bring their data with them to any website that supports Facebook Connect , enabling third-party services to provide focused , relevant information . For example , Workstir is an online service for finding work leads . Mike , a carpenter in San Jose , California , logs into Workstir with his Facebook account and regularly finds three or four work requests in his area . ZumeLife Dave follows a set regimen every morning for his meds , but last month his doctor doubled his medication for an acid blocker . At first , he would often miss the second dose because it was not part of his usual schedule . Fortunately , he now uses Zuri , a device from ZumeLife , which reminds him every day at 5 : 30 to take his second pill . It also lets him log his food intake and pain symptoms . After so many years , Dave has learned that however good your doctor , you still have to take responsibility for yourself .

367	World Usability Day at User Vision User Vision , November 2005 The User Vision office was a hive of activity on November 3rd as over 50 visitors tried to meet the challenges of User Vision's ' Usability Obstacle Course ' . Visitors from a wide variety of companies came to User Vision to learn about usability first hand by trying to meet some of the common usability challenges we face in our modern world . User Vision prepared a series of ' obstacles ' to reveal the design features that can make or break the user experience , and everyone had a chance to see if they could succeed in the tasks such as : Setting the VCR to record a TV programme Buying a product online from a website Changing the ring tone on a mobile phone Transferring a song to an MP3 player - and then playing it Guessing the icon functions on a printer Opening the plastic packaging on a product - without using their teeth ! The epic battle : Man vs. VCR Some of the results are worth noting : Only half the vistors could change the ringtone on a Nokia 6630 mobile phone and most gave it a rating of ' very difficult ' , whilst 92 % could perform the task on a Samsung D500 It took an average of 3.12 minutes to set the VCR ( the slowest was over 6 minutes , and there was notable ( and audible ) exasperation in front of the telly ! Opening the packaging of a plastic wrapped CD took nearly 1 minute on average with the record being set at 9 seconds ( and a few broken nails in the process ! ) In the battle of the MP3 Players , the iPOD won handily over Creative's Zen Micro , although previous familiarity with the popular pod no doubt helped some 9 % were unable to make an e-commerce purchase due to difficulties in using the site - something that many e-retailers should note Less than 60 % of people could figure out what the icons on our printer mean ( that 's why we 've had to stick little labels on them ! ) Printer icons - are these symbols supposed to MEAN something ? Now , there must be ringtones in here somewhere .. Many Eyes on Usability Testing - and Ears on Accessibility The other main event of the afternoon was a rolling programme of usability tests on a variety of sites , including e-government , finance , online travel and e-commerce . On one side of a one-way mirror in User Vision's Usability test lab a test subject worked through tasks and described their impressions to a User Vision consultant , whilst on the other side up to a dozen observers were riveted on their every move and comment . There were some moments of teeth-gnashing frustration from the observers , who thought they could see what would be the most logical next step , which often was not seen by the test subject . The value of usability testing was clearly demonstrated , and the subject's comments and actions clearly showed up some issues in the sites tested . In User Vision's focus group room a demonstration of screen readers used by blind and partially sighted web users was a compelling introduction to web accessibility . Many visitors took the opportunity to ' hear ' their sites as a blind user would , whilst User Vision consultants explained the accessibility features or shortcomings . Certainly the importance of creating accessible sites was highlighted after getting an insight to how many disabled people use the web . Overall , World Usability Day at User Vision proved to be very successful and enjoyable for everyone taking part in the event . Not only did it help to raise awareness of usability but it allowed people to have an understanding of some of the obstacles that consumers and end users have when faced with the task of using an everyday product , software or website .

640	"Childhood Memories That Made Me Who I am Today : I was 15 when my father died and after his death I received my result card through the post . I was really happy to see that I passed the exam with excellent marks but I wanted to go to college but it was hard for my brother to send me to college . But I started to teach other children in the village . They really needed help in their studies because their parents could n't read or write they send them to me in evenings after school . So in the morning I 'd go to college and in the evening I teach them and I 'd use the money they gave me to pay my college fees , bus fare and I made my uniform with my own money and I was really happy because I had got everything that I want . I worked hard that 's why I want my son to work hard to carry on with his studies . I was born in the Yemen in 1976 . I lived in a village called Yafa with my Mum and two brothers . My dad lived in England because he was working there and he was sending us some money to live on . I hardly knew my dad because the first time I saw him was when I was 2 years old , which is a time I ca n't remember . When I was about 4 or 5 years old my dad came to visit us and I will never forget that day because he bought me a big doll which I really loved and he bought us lots of things . I was very happy . We used to live a very poor life . We all stayed in one room . We slept , cooked , ate and sat in the same room but me and my brothers were very happy and we used to spend most of our time outside playing . My Mum was n't very well . Also she had to work very hard because in the village we had to go very far to fetch the water from the well and to fetch the wood to cook on . We had electricity but it only came on at night for a few hours . We also had to help my granddad in the field . After a few years my Mum's health deteriorated and my Dad wanted us to go and live with him . We were very happy and we went to the city to go to the British Embassy . The city life was very different to the village life . It was more modernised and I loved it and I still remember the blue sea , it was beautiful . However the bad news was that the British Embassy refused to let me go with my parents to England because the law in Yemen did not allow any children who were over 7 years old to go out of the country and unfortunately I was seven years old . My brother's were younger than me so they went with my Mum . We all were sad and disappointed especially my Mum she was devestated but she was very ill . Her Mum and Dad told her to go and leave me with them . I remember the day when she left she was crying all day but I was excited and happy to live with my grandparents . When my Mum kissed me goodbye I saw her crying and I started to cry . I was very happy with my grandparents and they loved me very much and they did their best to make me happy . They gave me everything I wanted and they were very nice and kind to me . My grandparents house had one room and a very small kitchen . They had a cow , some sheep and some chickens and I used to help look after them which I really enjoyed . I used to go to school . I started just before my mum left but I did n't like it . I stayed in school for four years then I left because I wanted to help my grandparents more . What I really enjoyed the most was fetching the water from the well with my friends . We used to have lots of fun and we used to go to fetch some wood and it was very far away so we used to go up the hills and down and we played on the way and we had a laugh . We had to get up very early just before the sun rise and we came back after the sunset . I think that these were the best times in my childhood . As I grew older I missed my mum and brothers very much . I used to cry every night as I remembered them and I never stopped thinking about my parents They used to send me some letters , clothes and money and we talked on the phone only once in two or three years because the telephone was very far from our house and very expensive . When I was about 12 years old I used to do everything in the house such as cooking , cleaning , taking care of the animals and helping my granddad in the fields as well as fetching the water and the wood . My day would start at 5.30 in the morning and would end when I went to bed which was about 8 . 00pm In the morning when I saw the other kids going to school , I realised how much I missed school and I wanted to go back so my friends and me decided to go back and we did . I really liked it this time and I did n't want to leave because we had such a good time . When I was 13 years old , I realised how much I missed my family because when I was younger it did n't really bother me but then I really wanted to see them . One day just a few months before my 14th birthday I received a letter from my mum and dad and she said they wanted me to join them in the UK . The law in Yemen had changed because the south and the north of Yemen were united . I was very happy and very excited and at the same time I was shocked because I did n't expect that to happen as I thought they might come to visit . I was so happy that I could n't sleep that night I could n't believe that I was going to see them after 7 years without them . After a few months and just a week before my birthday I finely went to England and my granddad came with me . It was very hard to leave my grandma and all my friends . When I arrived at the airport my mum and dad were there and I did n't recognise them but I was very happy to see them . When we went home and I saw my brothers I could n't believe how big they were , because I was imagining them small like when they were in Yemen but they looked different . I liked the house even though it was a small 3 bedroom house , but it was different compare to the house in Yemen . A few weeks later it was my birthday . I had a big party and I had lots of presents . I was playing with my dolls and I felt like a child again because in Yemen I felt like an adult I was only 13 years old , but I had lots of responsibility and I did n't have time to play . For the first few months I was very happy and I loved England until I started school . I did n't like school because I could n't speak English . I did n't understand a word and it was very difficult for me to make friends . Some children used to make fun of me and they used to call me names and they used to say horrible things to me which I did n't understand at the time but they knew it was n't nice and my teacher was n't nice either . I was the only child who spoke Arabic in the school . I hated school and sometimes I used to come home crying . In the school I felt like I was deaf and dumb because I did n't know what they were saying to me and I could n't talk to them . It was terrible . At home I felt a bit strange . I felt like I did n't know my family even though my mum and dad used to spoil me and they bought me everything that I Iiked . My brothers used to be jalice of me and I did n't like that . I hated England and I wanted to go back to Yemen . I really missed my grandparents and my friends and all the things that I used to do . I remember when we first came to England - my granddad - on one day regularly he used to always take my 3 brothers , my sister and myself on the 75 bus from our house on Barnsley Road - it was a very long journey to Millhouses park . It used to be our treat . He used to put us on the peddle boats and then pay for an ice-cream each then we used to get on the bus back home . My granddad was a very caring person this makes me always wanting to be there wherever my children are , know what they are always doing . It was the day before Eid . I was about 8 years old , and I living in the Yemen with my grandparents . "" Is it Eid tomorrow ? "" I asked my grandmother happily . "" We do n't know yet , We have to wait til the sun goes down , then we will foind out "" . "" Why ca n't we find out now ? "" I 'm going outside to look if I can see the moon "" , I said angrily . I went outside and I was looking to the sky , the sky was very clear , but I could n't see the moon . I walked back to house slowly and sadly . My grandmother was getting the food ready . "" I want to help your grandmother , what can I do ? "" "" Go and get the things ready for the fire "" . My grandmother said , so I ran quickly to the top of the house and I got all the things we needed for the fire . If the next day was Eid everyone would go to the roofs of their houses and light a little fire and that was the sign . We see the fire and the hole village know it 's Eid the next day . I was very excited and I could n't wait till the sun goes down . I went to the kitchen and I said "" The fire is ready grandma . What shall I do now . "" ' The food is ready , so there 's nothing to do now . We have to wait till the sun goes down . There was only about 10 minutes left but it seemed very long and it went past so slowly . When I was child and go to school when I came back from school my Mom wanted me to help in the kitchen but I said I needed to do my school work . I admired my Mum she was very great because she brought me from there to here . She taught me everything . Now I think what Mom said to me about doing house work is true . At that time it was very difficult to do all things but it is good how much I learned then . Now I can do everything like handle my house , cooking , serving , looking after my guests and my inlaws are happy with me . Now I am really happy with my Mom . I remember the closed doors when I came to England . Everyone shut their doors . In Pakistan all the doors were kept open and everyone shared everything . We often visited each other 's houses I was born in Somalia second capital city of Somalia it was a big city . My mum has 3 boys and 3 girls I am second child of my mum I used to be when under 10 I like to play outside play with the boys and girl . I used to go to school in a morning walk to school it 's far from my house come back and then I would go to religious school as well . I was beastly as a child ; I used to love playing outside I do n't like the indoors my mum she used to be shouting at me all the time "" come on in and help me "" I used to help my mum cooking and cleaning the house I used to do quickly the house work to go outside and play , I would make it a race they used to be girls working in the house no boys always girls I say spare to me to play outside they never do house work but my girl friends always racing saying whose going to finish house work first we finish quickly as soon as we can to play outside . I love my life my dad worked we have a lovely life my mum was so kind , my mum still live same house I was born . I finish secondary schools and after this my uncle shop to work y uncle shop , you know I was so beastly little girl . I get married when I was 16 I had my first baby when I was 18 years old my I was so scared my mum help me she help with the baby I was so young I was scared my son is now 24 years old . I am not having another baby I had my second 10 years after my first . We came to England , I left my son with my mum my and my husband came to England December 1990 I had 4 children here 2 girls and 2 boys since I born I had a lovely time I have good health still carry on my life , I 'm still a beastly women I working in school lunchtime supervisor for 6 years I do n't know what I 'm doing I 'm still beastly ! I was born in England but we lived in Pakistan and well , we had a nice house and lived with my grandparents ' cos I remember my mum since she got married always had to live with her in-laws . I remember us all being born '' cos we were kept like a second thing in my mum's life ' cos of my grandparents . We had to wash the clothes and that because there was n't a washing machine , I remember my 3 brothers when we first had our cycle because in Pakistan we could l get a cycle with five seats it was a beautiful moment when we could all sit on the cycle together and ride away on the uneven roads they were all dusty and uneven but it made it special because we were all a family . My dad came to England to work before he bought us all when he could afford to bring us all and he bought my grandparents . I remember my granddad always used to take us on a bus to Millhouses park once a week all 5 of us on the bus and he 'd buy us and ice cream and put us in the boats , oh he was such a good natured person he was so loveable and cuddly all the time with us my dad is totally different he 's a bit hard with us he 's not a soft person he does n't do that with my kids , his grandchildren . My granddad used to do that with us all the time . When he passed away it was a real emotional time . Those are the memories that I like to keep ."	1

1477	The Dr Xavier Clinic would like to introduce you to the Halo EliteTM - an effective hair loss laser . The programme offers a Genuine Solution for Hair Loss and Balding . Has your confidence suffered due to of hair loss and balding ? This NEW exciting treatment may be the answer you have been looking for , to restore your hair - and your confidence . The only non-medication based treatment that is approved by the FDA ( The US drugs regulator ) Over 96 % of women achieve thicker hair in the vertex area Over 19 new hairs per cm2 Over 83 % of men achieve thicker hair in the vortex and frontal areas 80 % increase in tensile strength of hair Increased hair thickness and density Many Premier League football clubs now use LLLT to help improve injuries and speed up recovery times . Each treatments session lasts just 12 and a half minutes and could n't be easier , simply sit back , relax , read a magazine and let the laser do its work . 95 % of people have seen significant improvement in their hair loss and re-growth when having Halo EliteTM laser treatment . Halo EliteTM has 171 high quality 650 nm laser diodes - the only type of laser FDA approved for hair growth - more than any other device . This is achieved by increasing production of energy used for cell division , increasing cell metabolism and improving blood and nutrient supply to the scalp . For more detailed information on why we lose our hair and how we can prevent this please read the FAQ section below or click here for more information about Halo EliteTM hair loss treatment . During the Anagen growth phase your cells will divide rapidly . The newly created cell then takes over the necessary functions and the other cell dies . The dead cells are pushed upwards from the dermal papilla into the hair follicle where they undergo Keratinisation - this where the dead cells are compressed together and pigmented . These Keratinised cells are then pushed up out of the scalps follicles as hair . Hair is basically the excretion of dead keratinised cells from the scalp / body . What is Follicular Miniaturisation and why do we lose our hair ? Our hairs grow thick and strong until the age puberty when testosterone levels in the body increase . Our bodies convert Testosterone in to something called Dihydratestosterone - commonly known as DHT . DHT is the key ingredient in the production of sperm and enabling the functions of the sex organs . Unfortunately our bodies produce more DHT than it needs for these functions . Excess DHT must bind to special DHT receptors for it to be broken down and the only place these receptors are found , apart from the sexual organs , is the dermal papillae in the scalp . When this binding takes place cells that would normally produce hair by dividing and dying , must now devote their energy to breaking down DHT . This results in reduced cell division and a decreased production of keratinised cells . As this decrease means less Keratinised cells , hair produced is thinner , shorter , weaker and less dense . Consequently hair produced becomes thinner and thinner and the hair follicle shrinks around it , further restricting growth . This eventually leads to the follicles shifting permanently in to the growth cycles resting phase and no more hair is produced . Am I a suitable candidate for Halo EliteTM Hair Loss Therapy ? The chances are if you suffer from hair loss , then the Halo EliteTM can help . As with all hair loss treatments early intervention and prevention is best but not absolutely necessary - If you are already bald , providing you still have active hair follicles , then Halo EliteTM Laser Treatment can still help . At your consultation you will be assessed by our expert therapists using a 200X magnifying digital microscope so that we can easily identify your active hair follicles and explain exactly what results you can expect from your treatment - Based on Your Active Hair Follicles , Your Results Can Even Be Guaranteed .	2

New research and practice in preventing youth violence 27 April 2010 Jenny Wilson In an Australian first , national and international experts met in Brisbane in April to discuss the latest research in the emotionally challenging field of youth sexual violence and abuse . The Symposium on Preventing Youth Sexual Violence and Abuse brought together researchers , government policy advisers , judiciary and legal professionals , police , social workers , psychologists and psychiatrists to share the latest developments in understanding , treatment and prevention . Australian expert and Griffith University criminologist , Professor Stephen Smallbone explained , "" This is a situation where young people are at risk both as victims and offenders . In Queensland alone , one in five sexual offences reported to police involve youth under 18 as the identified offender "" . While typical public policy responses are preoccupied with trying to "" fix the problem "" after it has already occurred , for example by punishing and incapacitating the offender and ameliorating the impact on the victim , Australian experts and leading international researchers , Elizabeth Letourneau ( Medical University of South Carolina ) ; Patrick Lussier ( Simon Fraser University ) ; and Michael Miner ( University of Minnesota ) , focused solidly on prevention . The Brisbane Symposium was particularly timely as Queensland amends its legislation to widen the capacity of courts to ' name and shame ' young people convicted of violent offences . Speaking in the media recently ( The Courier Mail , 6 April 2010 ) , Professor Smallbone explained how international experience introduces a note of caution into Australian policy developments , particularly Professor Letourneau's research on the effects of US youth sexual offender registration and community notification laws . "" Her research shows that these laws do not reduce the overall rate of youth sexual violence nor deter sexual or violent recidivism . Instead US registration and notification laws tend to produce the unintended effects of increasing the rate of plea bargaining ... reducing the rate of successful prosecutions for sexual offences and increasing the rate of arrests of registered youth for minor offences "" . As Director of the Griffith Youth Forensic Service ( GYFS ) , Professor Stephen Smallbone leads a team of practitioners and researchers to deliver an innovative practice model for assessment and intervention with young people who have committed sexual offences . GYFS clinical staff travel throughout Queensland , including to regional and remote locations , to conduct comprehensive assessments , prepare pre-sentence psychological assessment reports for the courts , and to deliver specialised and individualised treatment interventions in collaboration with local community partners . GYFS is a working model that demonstrates the close connection between research , policy and practice and exemplifies how research serves to shape policy and practice . "" Sexual abuse tends to elicit strong emotions and moral outrage , but good evidence and a clear head are needed if we are to reduce its occurrence . We need to respond effectively when sexual abuse happens , but we also need to be thinking about how we can prevent it from happening in the first place "" , Professor Smallbone said . "" Simplistic , black-and-white solutions such as indiscriminate naming and shaming or introducing ever more severe punishments may appeal to some sections of an outraged public , but they are a weak and ineffectual substitute for evidence-based , prevention-centred policy . "" The symposium was organised by the Griffith Youth Forensic Service ( GYFS ) and the Key Centre for Ethics , Law , Justice and Governance , part of The Griffith Institute for Social and Behavioural Research . Notes GYFS is widely recognised by the courts , police , youth justice and child safety , and has been formally recognised with an Australian Crime and Violence Prevention Award ( 2003 ) , a Queensland Child Protection Award ( 2003 ) , a Ministers Award for Excellence in Culturally Inclusive Practice ( 2006 ) , and a Ministers Award for Excellence in Collaborative Practice ( 2007 ) ."	8

The terms of reference of this workshop were also to include assessing approaches to minimize the adverse effects of response measures on developing country Parties . This workshop was held from 16 to 18 May 2002 in Bonn , Germany , under the guidance of Ms. Daniela Stoytcheva , Vice-Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation ( SBI ) , acting on behalf of Mr. Raúl Estrada Oyuela , Chair of the SBI , and Mr. Halldor Thorgeirsson , Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice ( SBSTA ) . Scope of the note This document contains a short description of the proceedings of the workshop ( section III ) , a summary of the discussions ( section IV ) , and issues identified for further consideration ( section V ) . The agenda of the workshop is included in the annex to this document . The workshop was attended by 36 experts in the field of modelling , representing Parties international organizations and research institutions . Some of these experts were involved in the preparation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Third Assessment Report ( TAR ) , and in the development of models at academic institutions . In accordance with the mandate , the workshop focused on the following main issues : Evolution and current status of modelling activities to assess the adverse effects of climate change , identification of gaps and limitations in current approaches to modelling , and recommendations for improving the effectiveness of modelling activities in the context of assessing adverse effects of climate change ; Evolution and current status of modelling activities to assess the impact of implemented response measures , identification of gaps and limitations in current approaches to modelling , assessments of approaches to minimize the adverse effects of response measures on developing country Parties , and recommendations for improving the effectiveness of modelling activities in the context of assessing the impact of response measures ; Enhancing the participation of developing country experts in modelling activities to assess the adverse effects of climate change and the impact of implemented response measures . The workshop consisted of an introductory session , working sessions devoted to each of the objectives , followed by a panel discussion , and a concluding session . There were discussions and exchange of information on the experience of national experts from developing and developed countries , and organizations , in applying current methodologies , the usefulness of data , and uncertainties , among others . The experts discussed the limitations of the current models , identified some possible areas for improvement , and made suggestions regarding the evolution of such modelling activities . Participants in the panel discussion included representatives from Brazil , Burkina Faso , Portugal , Saudi Arabia , United States of America , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) . General Modelling activities for assessing the adverse effects of climate change and the impact of the implementation of response measures have evolved considerably in the past decade ; in particular , spatial and temporal resolution have greatly improved . During the same period modelling capacity has become more widely disseminated and more data have become available for some models . The ability to adjust modelling activities to changing circumstances has also improved , although it was recognized that more improvement is necessary before the output of such models can be integrated in the decision-making process . Although modelling capacity is generally concentrated in industrialized countries , efforts are being made to develop models and modelling frameworks that can be adapted and used in developing countries . This is particularly true for modelling the adverse effects of climate change . Expertise for modelling the impacts of response measures is concentrated at research institutions and in a number of international organizations . Developing country participants stressed that their countries are still at an early phase of model development . Some participants attributed this lag to , for example , the lack of information on existing models , language constraints , the need to adapt such models to national circumstances , and the high costs of acquiring the models , conducting relevant training and developing extensive databases for their application . Some participants stressed that the main challenge facing developing countries is that most models and their coverage are optimized for use in developed countries and therefore do not respond to the circumstances and needs of developing countries . Very few models are able to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of climate change or perform an integrated analysis of impacts of response measures . Specific shortcomings of models were also discussed in detail . The main ones highlighted were gaps in data sets , limited regional downscaling , limited model validation , deficiencies in the development of assumptions and in applicability , verification , and separation of the impact of different policies , and the high degree of uncertainty in attempting to simulate the future . Other limitations relate to the reliability of models , the availability of accurate data , comparability of models and the availability of sector-specific models , particularly as applicable to developing countries . The modelling process for assessing the adverse effects of climate change has similarities and differences with that for assessing the impact of implementation of response measures . Both address global models with national disaggregation , have top-down and bottom-up perspectives , have difficulties with non-price issues and with inter-comparability , and suffer from a lack of adequate data and uncertainties associated with results , and their simulations rest on long-term climate scenarios . But modelling the adverse effects of climate change addresses aggregate changes applied to specific locales , whereas modelling the impact of response measures examines the impact of individual policies in different locales . Modelling results do not always meet the needs of stakeholders , and participants stressed the need for stakeholder involvement in the modelling process , both for framing the questions that the models should endeavour to answer at the outset of the exercise , and for ensuring that the outcome of the models are in a form that is usable in the context of the existing decision-making framework . Involving stakeholders will also help increase confidence in and acceptance of the model output . An essential function of modelling is to support informed decision-making . Because of the gaps and limitations in the modelling process , the usability of the models or their results and the reliability of the output are less than what is currently needed by decision makers and other stakeholders . As these shortcomings are not likely to be overcome soon , there is a need to improve decision-making under uncertainty , in order to render the outcome of the models usable , despite their limitations . An approach suggested for developing countries was to address modelling for climate change within the wider context of sustainable development . Such an integrated outlook would enable a comparison of the costs of climate change adaptation and mitigation with those of other priority objectives , including poverty alleviation , and would be useful for developing countries in which climate change issues ( and related modelling efforts ) may not be a high priority . In this context , many participants emphasized that one useful approach to modelling at the national level would be to adopt a methodology that would engage all key stakeholders and promote national consensus building , and would link development activities with climate change vulnerabilities , adaptation and impacts on economic , social and environmental goals . An "" action impact matrix "" method presented at the workshop , complemented with sectoral and local models which focus on impacts , adaptation and mitigation options , would provide such an approach . It was noted that , in developing countries , the data required as input to models for simulating the adverse effects of climate change and of implemented response measures are not consistently available or collected , are inaccessible or are of poor quality . At the same time , it was also stressed that the process of data collection and processing for using these models should be cost-effective , hence the need for coordinated data-collection efforts at the national , regional and international levels . In order to help developing country experts to choose the models most appropriate to their needs for conducting country-specific analyses , information provided with the models should include descriptions of the assumptions made and of the analytical approaches used for the models ; this would permit a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of a model for a given purpose . Consideration should be given to forging links among existing national , regional and international institutions , particularly those involved in gathering data for climate impacts models , such as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the European Commission ( EC ) , and various non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) . For data required to run economic models , collaboration among organizations such as the United Nations Statistical Office ( UNSO ) and other UN agencies , the World Bank , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the Latin American Energy Organization ( OLADE ) , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the IEA , was suggested . National communications from Annex I and non-Annex I Parties were mentioned as useful channels for disseminating experience on the appropriateness of modelling activities to assess the adverse effects of climate change , the impact of the implementation of response measures , and approaches to minimize the adverse effects of response measures on developing country Parties . National communications were also seen as an important tool for communicating to the modelling community what the needs of Parties are in furthering the modelling process in a way that is consistent with national priorities . It was considered useful for Parties to use the national communications process to identify modelling capacity-building needs and priorities and assessment efforts already completed or under way . Adverse effects of climate change Global climate modelling techniques have undergone steady development in the past decade . Research efforts have been directed towards developing models and approaches aimed at improving information about climate change on the regional scale . But Global Circulation Models ( GCMs ) , as tools for drawing critical conclusions regarding global climate change , are limited in their ability to simulate important atmospheric phenomena and to accurately represent complex natural interconnections . There is much uncertainty surrounding climate scenarios , particularly at the national and local scales and for climate variables other than temperature , precipitation and sea level . Consequently , the modelling process to assess the adverse effects of climate change does not currently produce results that are trustworthy enough to serve as a basis upon which decision makers can address adaptation options . This is particularly true when trying to model the effect of a changing climate on the frequency , magnitude and spatial occurrence of extreme weather events such as floods , cyclones and droughts . To date , GCMs have been unable to present unambiguous results relating to extreme events . Most models assume only gradual changes in climate . Many impacts arise from quite localized climate conditions but most climate GCMs provide results only across fairly large geographic areas . There is a need for enhanced regional specification of climate variables at geographic levels consistent with the impacts of climate change . For example , there are no models focusing on the adverse effects of climate change in the Sahelian region , which is prone to drought , desertification and fragile ecosystems . Another major challenge confronting the use of GCMs , and adding to the uncertainty of their outputs , is the lack of data at adequate temporal resolutions , particularly for climatic variables other than temperature and rainfall . Climate impact sectoral models currently used by developing countries cover primarily agriculture , water resources , health and coastal zones . Most allow some quantitative assessment of biophysical impacts . Some include adaptation into this assessment . The workshop discussed in detail the current status of modelling activities in the sectors of health and of agriculture and food security . Current knowledge on the relationship between climate and health is limited . Most models concentrate mainly on the statistical association of climate variability with the incidence of disease . It is not easy to extrapolate these findings to the assessment of long-term impacts of climate change , especially given the uncertainties of climate change scenarios . Modelling climate change impacts on agriculture was seen to be more advanced than modelling in other sectors . The simulation crop growth models allow an effective evaluation of impacts arising from changes in climate variables as well as from the effects of direct carbon dioxide fertilization , and are able to incorporate different adaptation options in the assessment . For the purpose of supporting adaptation to climate change , an important issue for the evolution of modelling activities in all sectors is how to incorporate into the modelling process the different categories of adaptation options for natural and human systems ( anticipatory , reactive , natural systems , human system , planned , autonomous ) , how to assess adaptive capacity and how to address the link between climate change and climate variability and extremes . In addition , methodological issues such as the use of discount rates , intergenerational equity , risk assessment , opportunity costs , and weighting uncertainty in cost-benefit analyses , are some of the areas in need of further attention . One constraint facing the user community is insufficient knowledge of all the modelling options available , and of their detailed specifications , limitations , data needs , accuracy and assumptions . It would be useful to centralize this information for easy access by users , in particular by developing countries , by establishing a comprehensive catalogue to enable comparisons and informed selection . In spite of efforts towards improving cooperation in the development and use of models , there is not enough sharing of experience in the use of models , particularly among developing countries where synergies could be promoted by pooling information on data needs , appropriateness to specific sectors or geographical regions , accuracy of results , best practices and lessons learned . The involvement of stakeholders in the modelling process for climate impacts is important and needs further promotion to ensure that these modelling activities integrate well with national development priorities , and that they provide the relevant answers to questions posed by policy makers in assessing adaptation options . In this context , there is a need for interagency coordination at the national level in the process of model development and application . In this light , the paradigm surrounding modelling activities should evolve into one that is stakeholder-driven and supportive of national sustainable development priorities . Modelling activities should be seen as a component of support for decision-making under uncertainty , particularly for the evaluation of adaptive responses to climate change . Participants concluded that more efforts should be made in developing and / or adopting methodologies and tools for conducting detailed sector and case study specific vulnerability assessments , which could lead to a more precise assessment of how to implement specific adaptation options . In this regard , the enhancement of regional networks can be an effective means for overcoming scale issues in the development of modelling frameworks and for sharing insights . Impact of the implementation of response measures and approaches to minimize such impact Although some modelling work has been done to date to assess the impact of the implementation of response measures , current models are not able to model climate policy impacts adequately . Results vary depending on the model used and on input data or assumptions . Existing models produce a wide diversity of short-term impacts , although if a full portfolio of mitigation options is used , all models show that potential adverse impacts would be reduced . In the longer term ( post 2020 ) , with more aggressive reductions , impacts may be greater - although this depends on policy choices . Existing models have been developed mainly in industrialized countries such as the United States , Australia , Japan and in Europe , and the concerns and national circumstances of developing countries have not been fully integrated into their structure . In particular , they are unable to fully disaggregate the impacts of a suite of climate change measures and mechanisms given the intricate linkages between national and international economies , the complexities among sectors , and the transdisciplinary nature of such impacts . However , existing models may serve as a useful basis for future work in meeting the analytical needs of developing countries . The greatest benefit of economic modelling is that it provides a structured framework for organizing data and ideas , but there is substantial uncertainty associated with the results of such modelling exercises as a result of data gaps , model structure inadequacies and the incomplete analytical framework for evaluating the impacts of response measures . These uncertainties raise serious questions about the appropriate use of models . They further limit the value of the absolute quantitative outcomes of models and the significance of individual quantitative calculations . However , all participants viewed comparison of policy approaches as a fruitful use of modelled data . There are other difficulties associated with the use of such models , relating to availability of comprehensive data sets , the validity of assumptions and the compatibility and applicability of these assumptions to the modelling exercise , verification , quantifying the economic impacts associated with the different policies and policy instruments ( fiscal , monetary , regulatory ) and separating climate policy consequences from consequences of other policies ( e . g . energy , environment , social ) . Some participants believed that approaches to modelling should focus on the impact of individual policies but others felt that they should address packages of policies . At the moment most approaches focus on a portfolio of policies covering all sectors . In terms of conceptual or methodological challenges , in order to determine the impact of response measures it is necessary to compare current economic conditions with those of an idealized world in which no measures are undertaken . Additionally , most academic and government analyses of response measures are normative and focus on the implications of policies not yet implemented for developed countries . Further improvement in these models is needed in the types of policy covered , the gases modelled , and how to model trade policies and their effects , among others . Additionally , training for proper interpretation of the data from existing models needs further urgent attention . There are many other methodological complexities that may influence a model's simulation of the impacts of response measures . First , there is the issue of defining policy choices - which polices are used ; which gas , fuel and sector is the focus of the simulation ; when do the polices take effect and how are these then modelled . Second , within the policy choices there is the question of definition of specific policies and their coverage of greenhouse gases , given that these are not equally divided among all sectors , although energy and carbon dioxide are considered to be the most important sector and gas , respectively . It is important to disaggregate emissions by sector and by gas for useful policy analysis . Based on information from the IPCC Third Assessment Report ( TAR ) , the way models generally treat policies affects the assessment differently , depending on whether they are top-down , bottom-up , General Equilibrium Models , input-output or macroeconomic models . Market policies are often stylized representations only , and market imperfections are not well represented , if at all . With regard to technology policies , most models require exogenous assumptions on behaviour and preference . Most models are seldom able to account for new technology , or to accurately estimate the geographic diffusion of existing technologies . One presenter noted that impacts to response measures differ with types of economies , and that one may not be able to generalize in this regard . The TAR suggests that there may be adverse impacts of response measures on some developing countries , and further work is needed to determine , with less uncertainty , the magnitude of the impact of response measures and to assess the impacts of response measures on individual countries . To this end , it was suggested that a specific chapter in the fourth assessment report of the IPCC could be dedicated to analysing ways to minimize the impact of response measures on developing countries . Some participants stressed the urgency for refining methodologies to assess the impacts on developing countries of policies already implemented by Annex I Parties . In order to do so , current models for evaluating the effects of response measures need to be expanded in their coverage of countries and of issues . The objective should not be to determine which model or group of models is more advanced , but rather to agree on which existing models can be used as part of a portfolio of tools for decision-making . These participants also suggested that in assessing the effects of policies , such factors as market approaches ( taxes , subsidies , cap-and-trade ) , regulations , and research and development need to be included in the simulation . A major constraint for assessment is incomplete data on specific policy information and a lack of methods to parameterize them properly . To date , the interactions between multiple policies - either within or across countries - are not fully understood . There is also an inadequate assessment of technology development . In addition , few models have been tested against present day observations . In the light of these constraints it was proposed that more modelling efforts , which would provide a detailed examination of welfare , terms of trade and socio-economic impacts on individual developing countries , be undertaken . These efforts should also strive to improve the effectiveness of current modelling activities for assessing the impact of implemented response measures in areas such as : Data sets ( technology , energy data , economic and social indicators ) ; Development of assumptions that are widely accepted based on standardized approaches so as to improve the effectiveness and speed of the process , and reduce costs ; Verification of existing data ; Improving the models so that they can address implemented rather than potential policies and measures ; Establishment of baseline data . Enhancing the participation of developing country experts in modelling efforts Several initiatives and support programmes have been launched in the past five to eight years to advance scientific knowledge on climate change impacts and vulnerability , to build capacities on methods to assess vulnerability and adaptation and identify adaptation measures , and to provide related training tools and materials , especially for developing countries . Some notable initiatives funded by the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) were implemented since 1993 , such as the UNDP / GEF CC : Train Programme ( executed by UNITAR ) , the UNDP-PICCAP project and most recently the UNDP / GEF National Communications Support Programme . An evaluation conducted on some of the existing training initiatives on modelling revealed that current software is restricted in its coverage of observed data sets to four large geographic regions ( Europe , South Asia , North America and southern Africa ) . This resolution is too coarse for some countries or regions , especially for Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) and mountainous countries . A second constraint is a lack of consideration of inter-annual climate variability . Two other concerns were the lack of models and related technical material in languages other than English , and the high costs to acquire modelling tools and their related training material . Developing country participants reiterated the urgent need for support for data collection . In order to maintain the quality of these methods and methodologies and update them to the needs of users , ongoing support is also needed for periodic revision , training for their utilization and interpretation , and translation and dissemination of information on the models into official UN languages for developing countries . Models applicable to developing countries are currently being developed , but there is a need for capacity-building and more involvement of experts from these countries , and in particular from the poorest economies . Such efforts are expected not only to help in customizing models to the needs of these countries , but also to integrate the results of modelling tools into policy and strategy development . Participants mentioned the following key issues as possible areas for further consideration : Utilizing national communications as a useful channel for disseminating information on modelling . Annex I Parties could include information on support for non-Annex I countries to improve their capacity in modelling activities and to assess their vulnerability under Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention . Non-Annex I Parties could include in their national communications information relating to their capacity-building needs for modelling , and on activities completed or under way in this regard . Making available detailed information on the logic and data needs of individual models , and compiling and disseminating information on generic modelling methods and tools . Ensuring cost-effectiveness in funding modelling activities and disseminating modelling results , through increased collaboration among existing national , regional and international entities engaged in data gathering and data management for climate impact models , such as WMO , WHO , FAO and UNEP , as well as non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) . For economic models , collaboration with the United Nations Statistical Office ( UNSO ) and other UN agencies , the World Bank , OECD , OPEC , IEA , and others , should be enhanced . Providing capacity-building to developing country experts for constructing and strengthening data sets , improving the quality of analytical tools , and disseminating results of these efforts in sectors that can contribute to climate change impact analysis , and for the development of models to assess impacts of response measures . As a first step , this could be accomplished by increasing the participation of developing country experts in the technical work conducted by relevant organizations such as IPCC , FAO , IEA , and OECD , and increasing cooperation on modelling activities among UN organizations and other agencies and research institutions and universities in the South . In establishing such links experts in developing countries can be trained to use the models and interpret the results , so as to be able to make the right choices using existing multilateral and bilateral arrangements . Mobilizing the process of implementation of Article 6 of the Convention on education , training and public awareness , with the objective of enhancing the participation of developing country experts in the international modelling development process , in particular in the context of Article 6 ( a ) ( iii ) and 6 ( b ) ( ii ) . Continuing research on improving model quality by building upon the work already compiled by the IPCC in the Third Assessment Report . The IPCC may also wish to consider increasing the participation of developing country experts in the preparation of future IPCC assessments on modelling activities . Compiling and disseminating information on modelling methods and tools for assessing the vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change and the impact of the implementation of response measures under Article 4.8 of the Convention . This could include the preparation of a catalogue of existing models currently in use . The catalogue could categorize models in terms of attributes for decision-making and selection of models , including information on their use , cost , data requirements , coverage , strengths and limitations , as well as contact information . The catalogue could also clarify similarities and differences between models , and the appropriateness of the use of certain models for specific circumstances , sectors or regions , and would include examples of the successful application of such models , particularly in developing countries . Enhancing the Stakeholder consultation process at all stages of model specification , validation and acceptance ."	3

1343	"Destroyer From DarkSpace WIKI Destroyers find the middle ground between speed , armor , and weapons . Although less heavily armored than cruisers , destroyers have the maneuverability to hit targets which cruisers and dreads can not without imposing a large risk on themselves . They are the first ships that require a Shipyard to spawn . UGTO ST-22 Gunboat Destroyer While the ST-22s are heavy on particle projection weapons they are still well-balanced light combatants , able to engage smaller targets quite effectively and even pose a threat to capital ships in sufficient numbers . Often seeing prominent duty on the front lines and anti-piracy patrols , these ships are considered a cornerstone of the UGTO fleet and a key step on an officer's track to a more prestigious command . Even senior admirals are known to look back on their time commanding "" Double-deuces "" fondly . ST-23 Missile Destroyer The ST-23s are dedicated light missile platforms , with the bare minimum of close-range defenses and a formidable missile battery . When their crews are n't listening , they are sometimes described as "" missile spam in a tin can "" . With the vital systems and crew quarters crammed in around the missile launchers they can be cramped and unpleasant to serve on , but the satisfaction from sending all that firepower downrange is considered worth it . Role : Missile Boat Weapons : 3 Chemical Beam Lasers and 6 Ion Tracker Missile Launchers Shipyard Requirements : 40,935 Resources | 45 Technology | Metals Rank Requirement : Lieutenant Commander Badges required : Bronze Combat "" Missile Spam in a tin can "" as they are called . The Missile Destroyer may have lost favour with Captains and the Trade Navy in general , however they still have a few dedicated Captains which use them to great effectiveness .. ST-24 Assault Destroyer Employing a tried-and-true design philosophy that has served the UGTO and its predecessors well , the ST-24s are frontal assault ships intended to engage and destroy their targets in close-quarters combat . To this end they are armed with heavy beam arrays and torpedo payloads . Only the most aggressive and ambitious commanders actively seek out a career in these ships , as their lighter armor can not withstand quite as much punishment as most destroyers and the nature of their armament requires them to get into suicidally point-blank range in order to attack . Sometimes good things come in small packages , and this is true for the Assault Destroyer . Its heavy weapons load can easily carve holes in the armour of enemy ships , but beware , its light armour means it can not take the damage that other Destroyers can . ST-28 Picket Destroyer The ST-28 is armed with a comprehensive beam armament to provide excellent point-defense coverage in all directions . Affectionately known by the Trade Navy as "" God's Flashlight "" , it also carries a decent gun armament to help it in combat with other light warships . Unfortunately , the modifications to the hull necessary to carry its heavy armament leaves no room for an auxiliary reactor . As a result it suffers from low power generation at speed , making it unable to keep up with conventional attack Destroyers in a dogfight . Role : Point Defense Weapons : 10 Chemical Beam Lasers and 8 Particle Cannons Shipyard Requirements : 39,900 Resources | 45 Technology | Metals Known as ' Gods Flashlight ' , these Destoryers are armed to the teeth with laser's . So it 's not surprising that its main role is missle defense . The Picket Destroyer also carries a light Cannon layout for dealing with smaller ships . However , due to the amount of weapons it carries , it does not carry a Aux reactor . This leads to energy draining quickly if you are not careful . M-192M Missile Destroyer Role : Missile Boat Weapons : 3 chemical beam lasers and 6 ion tracker missile launchers . Rank Requirement : Lieutenant Commander The Missle Destroyer is more powerful than a Missile frigate , but can have energy problems if not managed properly . Not many use this this ship once they unlock the Missile Cruiser , as it can fire a much greater amount of missiles with little less dodging penality ."	4
1192	"You ca n't change other people ; you can only change yourself  is one of those lessons I 've had to learn over and over again . And then sometimes I forget it and have to learn it again . You do n't get very far in a family business , for example , without learning this lesson . I am very thankful that my siblings and I learned it early and often . Think about a sibling for a minute . Can you change even one of his or her possibly annoying behaviors ? No. You ca n't . Siblings are who they are , and you can only change your own reaction , response , and behavior . Some people do this by moving to other states , or even countries . Some people do this by never speaking to their siblings again . But in a family business that 's committed to staying a family business , you learn to change yourself . It does work ! Of course this truth applies to other relationships , as well . Sometimes no amount of effort to influence can create the change you want to see . In an intimate relationship , that can be heartbreaking . Whether it 's something big or something little ( is anything really "" little "" in a relationship ? ) , it 's the same : All you can do is change your own reaction , response , and behavior . If you truly , genuinely express your heart and someone does n't respond the way you 'd like him or her to , and you try something different and it still does n't work , you have to face the honest truth that the only thing you can change is yourself . Sometimes that means staying in the relationship in a different way . Other times , it means leaving it . So how does this truth impact those of us who desire to "" change the world for the better ? "" It occurs to me this is the deeper meaning of the famous quote from Gandhi : "" Be the change you want to see in the world . "" All we can truly do is be change agents of ourselves , and act accordingly . For example , I have one very good friend who still , after all my encouragement , scientific facts , and continued efforts will not buy organic fruits and vegetables for his / her child – a child who exhibits all the signs of sensitivity to toxins , which wreaks havoc with his / her behavior and causes all sorts of stress for my friend . As frustrating as it is to watch and see that my efforts are ineffective , I also realize that I ca n't "" fix "" someone who does n't really want to be fixed . There 's another famous saying for that : "" You ca n't help another who will not help him or herself . "" I 've often coached employees on this same type of situation . I 've said a couple of times to people , "" If beating your head against a brick wall over and over does n't make a difference , at some point you have to realize you 're only damaging your own head . "" What are the options ? Try another tactic , go around the wall , or walk away from the wall . Sometimes a wall is a wall , and you ca n't knock it down without explosives ... but then that would be terrorism . So all you can do is change your own reaction , response , and behavior . Or , if you 're a manager , change the people you choose to work with . Does all this mean we will never change the world ? Does all this mean we will never change other people ? No. It just means we ca n't really control it and therefore can not be attached to the outcome . All we can really do is control what we decide to do . That is why we need to do what makes us feel healthy , happy , and fulfilled – do what makes us open to change . No one else can do that for us , or can make us do it , either . We can only do it for ourselves . And hopefully , by being our true , fulfilled selves we make the world a better place just by being in it ."	0
166	"Hey , I am Michael Shermer , the director of the Skeptics Society , the publisher of Skeptic magazine . We investigate claims of the paranormal , pseudo-science , and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between -- science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , bad science , non-science and plain old nonsense . And unless you 've been on Mars recently , you know there 's a lot of that out there . Some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term . But let 's face it -- there 's a lot of bunk , and we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there , flushing out . Well , we 're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas -- ( Laughter ) -- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas . I 'll show you an example of a bad idea . I brought this with me . This was given to us by NBC Dateline to test . It 's the -- it 's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia . It 's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod . ( Laughter ) This was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece . It 's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it . You could dowse for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers . ( Laughter ) So the way it works is , you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker . So it looks something like this . I 'll show you . ( Laughter ) No , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias . So , I 'll show -- well , this is science , so we 'll do a controlled experiment . It 'll go this way for sure . ( Laughter ) Sir , you want to empty your pockets . Please , sir ? ( Laughter ) So the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers ? And the answer is , If you open enough of them -- yes . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits . And that 's probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astrologers , and tarot card readers and so on . People remember the hits ; they forget the misses . In science we have to keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits is somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance . In this case , we tested it . We had two opaque boxes , one with government-approved THC marijuana , and one with nothing . And it got it 50 percent of the time -- -- which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin flip model . So that 's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do . Skeptic is the quarterly publication . Each one has a particular theme , like this one is on the future of intelligence . Are people getting smarter or dumber ? I have an opinion of this myself because the business I 'm in . But , in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter . Three IQ points per 10 years , going up . Sort of an interesting thing . With science , do n't think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing . Are science and religion compatible ? It 's like , are science and plumbing compatible ? These -- they 're just two different things . Science is not a thing . It 's a verb . It 's a way of thinking about things . It 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena . I mean , what 's more likely -- that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush , Kansas to promote skeptic . com , our webpage ? Or is it more likely that a reader of Skeptic did this with Photoshop ? And in all cases we have to ask -- ( Laughter ) -- what 's the more likely explanation ? And before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it 's not in this world . What 's more likely -- that Arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ? Or that the World Weekly News makes stuff up ? ( Laughter ) And part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon . For those of you in the back , it says here "" Then a miracle occurs . I think you need to be more explicit here in step two . "" This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments . There 's nothing more to it than that . ( Applause ) You can say a miracle occurs . It 's just that it does n ' t explain anything . It does n ' t offer anything . There 's nothing to test . It 's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists . Whereas -- and it 's true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that . Until we figure out what it is , we 'll just call it this . It 's the beginning of the causal chain for science . For intelligent design creationists , it 's the end of the chain . So again , we can ask this -- what 's more likely -- are UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes , or even fakes ? This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena , California , looking down over Pasadena . And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it 's because it is . You do n't even need Photoshop , you do n't need high-tech equipment , you do n't need computers . This was shot with a throw-away Kodak Instamatic camera . You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go . Camera 's ready -- that 's it . ( Laughter ) So , although it 's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it 's more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles . On a more serious note , in all of science we 're looking for a balance between data and theory . In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn . First of all , there was no theory of planetary rings . And second of all , his data was grainy and fuzzy , and he could n ' t quite make out what it was he was looking at . So he wrote that he had seen -- "" I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . "" And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw . So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you ca n ' t have a good theory . And it was n ' t solved until 1655 . This is Christiaan Huygens's book in which he cataloged all the mistakes that people made in trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn . It was n ' t till -- Huygens had two things . He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated . And then , he had better telescopic , more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn , then we catch up with it . And we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there . And that , in fact , turns out to be true . The problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases . So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level . And then I 'll go to more serious ones . Like , we have a tendency to see faces . This is the face on Mars which was -- in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians . Well , it turns out -- here 's the close-up of it from 2001 . If you squint , you can still see the face . And when you 're squinting , what you 're doing is you 're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain . And so , you 're reducing the quality of your data . And if I did n't tell you what to look for , you 'd still see the face , because we 're programmed by evolution to see faces . Faces are important for us socially . And , of course , happy faces . Faces of all kinds are easy to see . ( Laughter ) You can see the happy face on Mars , there . If astronomers were frogs perhaps they 'd see Kermit the Frog . Do you see him there ? Little froggy legs . Or if geologists were elephants ? Religious iconography . ( Laughter ) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996 . He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer . Here 's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville , just down the street . Or is it up the street from here ? Tree bark is particularly good because it 's nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals . Here 's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo . Now , here 's the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino , of course , this being America . ( Laughter ) This casino paid 28,500 dollars on eBay for the cheese sandwich . ( Laughter ) But who does it really look like , the Virgin Mary ? ( Laughter ) It has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look . Virgin Mary in Clearwater , Florida . I actually went to see this one . There was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their -- wheelchairs and crutches , and so on . And we went down , investigated . Just to give you a size -- that 's Dawkins , me and The Amazing Randi , next to this two , two and a half story size image . All these candles , so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this . So we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect . Here 's the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off . I guess you can only have one miracle per building . ( Laughter ) So is it really a miracle of Mary , or is it a miracle of Marge ? ( Laughter ) And then I 'm going to finish up with another example of this with audio -- auditory illusions . There is this film , "" White Noise , "" with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us . By the way , this whole business of talking to the dead , it 's not that big a deal . Anybody can do it , turns out . It 's getting the dead to talk back that 's the really hard part . ( Laughter ) In this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena . There 's a ReverseSpeech . com web page on which I downloaded this stuff . Here is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these . Here 's the forward version of the very famous song . Boy , coudl n ' t you just listen to that all day ? ( Laughter ) All right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there . What did you get ? ( Audience : Satan . ) Michael Shermer : Satan ? OK , well , at least we got Satan . Now , I 'll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear , and then hear it again . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You ca n ' t miss it when I tell you what 's there . ( Laughter ) All right , I 'm going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization . We 're always looking for little , good things that people do . And in England , there 's a pop singer . Very -- one of the top popular singers in England today , Katie Melua . And she wrote a beautiful song . It was in the top five in 2005 , called , "" Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing . "" It 's a love story -- she 's sort of the Norah Jones of the U. K. -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth . And she has this one passage here . ♫ We are 12 billion light-years from the edge ♫ ♫ That 's a guess ♫ ♫ No one can ever say it 's true ♫ ♫ But I know that I will always be with you ♫ Well , that 's nice . At least she got it close . In America it would be , "" We 're 6,000 light years from the edge . "" ( Laughter ) But my friend , Simon Singh , the particle physicist , now turned science educator , and he wrote the book "" The Big Bang , "" and so on . He uses every chance he gets to promote good science . And so , he wrote an op-ed piece in The Guardian about Katie's song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge . You know , it 's 12 -- it 's 13.7 billion light years , and it 's not a guess . We know within precise error bars there how close it is . And so , we can say , although not absolutely true , that it 's pretty close to being true . And , to his credit , Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out . And said , "" I 'm so embarrassed . I was a member of the astronomy club , and I should have known better . "" And she re-cut the song . So I 'll end with the new version . ♫ We are 13.7 billion light years ♫ ♫ from the edge of the observable universe ♫ ♫ That 's a good estimate with well-defined error bars ♫ ♫ And with the available information ♫ ♫ I predict that I will always be with you ♫ ( Applause ) How cool is that ? ( Applause ) </content"	0
60	"The Bremen town musicians There was once an ass whose master had made him carry sacks to the mill for many a long year , but whose strength began at last to fail , so that each day as it came found him less capable of work . Then his master began to think of turning him out , but the ass , guessing that something was in the wind that boded him no good , ran away , taking the road to Bremen ; for there he thought he might get an engagement as town musician . When he had gone a little way he found a hound lying by the side of the road panting , as if he had run a long way . "" Now , Holdfast , what are you so out of breath about ? "" said the ass . "" Oh dear ! "" said the dog , "" now I am old , I get weaker every day , and can do no good in the hunt , so , as my master was going to have me killed , I have made my escape ; but now , how am I to gain a living ? "" - "" I will tell you what , "" said the ass , "" I am going to Bremen to become town musician . You may as well go with me , and take up music too . I can play the lute , and you can beat the drum . "" And the dog consented , and they walked on together . It was not long before they came to a cat sitting in the road , looking as dismal as three wet days . "" Now then , what is the matter with you , old shaver ? "" said the ass . "" I should like to know who would be cheerful when his neck is in danger , "" answered the cat . "" Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt , and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice , and my mistress wanted to drown me ; so I took myself off ; but good advice is scarce , and I do not know what is to become of me . "" - "" Go with us to Bremen , "" said the ass , "" and become town musician . You understand serenading . "" The cat thought well of the idea , and went with them accordingly . After that the three travellers passed by a yard , and a cock was perched on the gate crowing with all his might . "" Your cries are enough to pierce bone and marrow , "" said the ass ; "" what is the matter ? "" - "" I have foretold good weather for Lady-day , so that all the shirts may be washed and dried ; and now on Sunday morning company is coming , and the mistress has told the cook that I must be made into soup , and this evening my neck is to be wrung , so that I am crowing with all my might while I can . "" - "" You had much better go with us , Chanticleer , "" said the ass . "" We are going to Bremen . At any rate that will be better than dying . You have a powerful voice , and when we are all performing together it will have a very good effect . "" So the cock consented , and they went on all four together . But Bremen was too far off to be reached in one day , and towards evening they came to a wood , where they determined to pass the night . The ass and the dog lay down under a large tree ; the cat got up among the branches , and the cock flew up to the top , as that was the safest place for him . Before he went to sleep he looked all round him to the four points of the compass , and perceived in the distance a little light shining , and he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off , as he could see a light , so the ass said , "" We had better get up and go there , for these are uncomfortable quarters . "" The dog began to fancy a few bones , not quite bare , would do him good . And they all set off in the direction of the light , and it grew larger and brighter , until at last it led them to a robber's house , all lighted up . The ass . being the biggest , went up to the window , and looked in . "" Well , what do you see ? "" asked the dog . "" What do I see ? "" answered the ass ; "" here is a table set out with splendid eatables and drinkables , and robbers sitting at it and making themselves very comfortable . "" - "" That would just suit us , "" said the cock . "" Yes , indeed , I wish we were there , "" said the ass . Then they consulted together how it should be managed so as to get the robbers out of the house , and at last they hit on a plan . The ass was to place his forefeet on the window-sill , the dog was to get on the ass's back , the cat on the top of the dog , and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch on the cat's head . When that was done , at a given signal they all began to perform their music . The ass brayed , the dog barked , the cat mewed , and the cock crowed ; then they burst through into the room , breaking all the panes of glass . The robbers fled at the dreadful sound ; they thought it was some goblin , and fled to the wood in the utmost terror . Then the four companions sat down to table , made free with the remains of the meal , and feasted as if they had been hungry for a month . And when they had finished they put out the lights , and each sought out a sleeping-place to suit his nature and habits . The ass laid himself down outside on the dunghill , the dog behind the door , the cat on the hearth by the warm ashes , and the cock settled himself in the cockloft , and as they were all tired with their long journey they soon fell fast asleep . When midnight drew near , and the robbers from afar saw that no light was burning , and that everything appeared quiet , their captain said to them that he thought that they had run away without reason , telling one of them to go and reconnoitre . So one of them went , and found everything quite quiet ; he went into the kitchen to strike a light , and taking the glowing fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals , he held a match to them in order to kindle it . But the cat , not seeing the joke , flew into his face , spitting and scratching . Then he cried out in terror , and ran to get out at the back door , but the dog , who was lying there , ran at him and bit his leg ; and as he was rushing through the yard by the dunghill the ass struck out and gave him a great kick with his hind foot ; and the cock , who had been wakened with the noise , and felt quite brisk , cried out , "" Cock-a-doodle-doo ! "" Then the robber got back as well as he could to his captain , and said , "" Oh dear ! in that house there is a gruesome witch , and I felt her breath and her long nails in my face ; and by the door there stands a man who stabbed me in the leg with a knife ; and in the yard there lies a black spectre , who beat me with his wooden club ; and above , upon the roof , there sits the justice , who cried , ' Bring that rogue here ! ' And so I ran away from the place as fast as I could . "" From that time forward the robbers never ventured to that house , and the four Bremen town musicians found themselves so well off where they were , that there they stayed . And the person who last related this tale is still living , as you see ."	6

1151	"Puerto Rico walks away from commonwealth . I will not pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands . This must be the words of thousands of Puerto Ricans living in the island today wishing that their small island would once and for all become free from the colonization of the United States . Puerto Rico has been living under U.S. domination for the past 92 years and it 's considered the last nation in Latin America that is still living in colonization . Puerto Ricans want to be free and should be allowed to be free ; to have the opportunity to vote for the president who sends its young people to war , to have their own currency , to fly one flag in all their schools and finally to feel pride in being an independent nation and not labeled with terms like "" territory "" and "" commonwealth "" . Bigger and more powerful nations that inhabit smaller nations for various benefits should never deny a nation's culture and roots , instead in these modern times people should be allowed to govern themselves and be independent nations . In the midst of the struggle over status ( U.S commonwealth or Independency ) only one clear realization can come of this , Puerto Rico ought to be independent and refuse commonwealth to the United States of America . One of the many benefits citizens from all democratic countries enjoy is the ability to choose their chief in command . As a commonwealth under the United States , Puerto Rican citizens can not vote during the presidential campaign . They are allowed to participate in presidential primaries but not the final event . This is somewhat of an insult to the younger generation on the island being sent off to fight wars representing the U.S. having been denied the privilege to choose the person who is sending them . As an independent nation Puerto Ricans would have the right to participate in elections choosing who their leader would be . The island does have its own elections where they get to choose who will become governor and other various members of the political cabinet but all of these have limited power in deciding the fate of the island . The Governor is allowed to run the island and handle domestic issues but Washington has the final word . This struggle for power has also affected the economy and the ability to export and carry out trades with other nations ; United Sates keeps a tight hold on who the island does business with , ultimately creating a dependent economy . Puerto Rico should be allowed to diversify their sources of capital and their export market something that would strengthen its economy and eliminate the economic dependency that has been created throughout the years . Many in the island believe that independency would allow Puerto Rico to open a broader trading market and as stated by Eric Negron , tax adviser to the independence party , "" as an independent nation Puerto Rico could attract foreign investment and it would at the same time be better able to direct what sort of industries is brought to the island . "" Remaining a commonwealth takes all of these economic privileges away from the people and the government of Puerto Rico who want to see the island's economy soar to a new level . Nations across the world can be proud of their heritage and culture , which makes up their country and it 's the backbone to each individual society . A nation's language is a stamp of their history ; the DNA that makes up its people . Puerto Rico as a commonwealth could be in danger of losing its national language . Spanish has been the island's national language since the Spanish conquistadors first discovered it in 1492 . United Sates wants Puerto Rico to make the change from Spanish to English and demands that both Spanish and English be the national languages ; many schools across the island have already made the transaction and now teach in both languages . Being a Puerto Rican is not being part of an ethnic group or speaking Spanish is not speaking a dialect ; these citizens are people who have their own language and roots and deserve the right to conserve their heritage and most important their culture . However , as a person born in Puerto Rico I have enjoyed many of the benefits that being a commonwealth has provided in my life . One of the most important benefits is the right to American citizenship upon birth . All Puerto Ricans who are born in the island are American citizens and are free to enter the mainland U.S. If Puerto Rico remains a commonwealth this is a benefit that future generations will continue to enjoy . Another benefit the island enjoys is the aid provided by the United States and the tax exemption the island receives ; Puerto Rico is exempt from paying federal taxes . Many supporters of the commonwealth status clearly point out the help the island receives and how life would be if Puerto Rico did not receive the strong financial support from the United Sates and research provided in the CQ Researcher article , Puerto Rico : The Struggle Over Status points out that "" Puerto Rico receives generous tax benefits and more than $ 6 billion a year from the U.S government "" clearly something that the island will not receive if it became independent . All of these benefits the island receives still do not amount to independency and the benefit to govern itself . As an independent nation Puerto Rico would open its trading market with various countries around the world expanding the economy and not having to depend on the help the Unites Sates provides . American citizenship could be obtained through the necessary legal steps and travel between the island and the U.S. will still be available . Receiving the benefits Puerto Rico receives from the United States has helped the island through the years develop into the place it is today but it has come at a costly price with words like "" territory "" and "" commonwealth "" attached to it . No nation should turn its back on their heritage , culture and language at the expense of tax exemptions and financial aid . Instead , Puerto Rico ought to be independent to steer its own course and have the ability to conduct economic trades with other nations , keep Spanish as the main language and have the final word in government issues that affect its people . The Puerto Rican people need to cut the umbilical cord it has created to the United States and stand by their roots , culture and independency . The voice of thousands of Puerto Ricans living in the island need to come forward and make Puerto Rico a free independent nation ."	0

137	"H-Darrieus Wind Turbine with Blade Pitch Control Abstract A procedure for computing the optimal variation of the blades' pitch angle of an H-Darrieus wind turbine that maximizes its torque at given operational conditions is proposed and presented along with the results obtained on a 7 kW prototype . The CARDAAV code , based on the "" Double-Multiple Streamtube "" model developed by the first author , is used to determine the performances of the straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine . This was coupled with a genetic algorithm optimizer . The azimuthal variation of the blades' pitch angle is modeled with an analytical function whose coefficients are used as variables in the optimization process . Two types of variations were considered for the pitch angle : a simple sinusoidal one and one which is more general , relating closely the blades' pitch to the local flow conditions along their circular path . A gain of almost 30 % in the annual energy production was obtained with the polynomial optimal pitch control . 1 . Introduction Following the 1973 energy crisis , large-scale research and development programs were initiated , directed toward finding replacement solutions to the limited fossil fuel reserves . Wind energy was given , along with photovoltaic , solar , hydroelectric , biomass , and other resources , particular attention as a renewable and environmentally friendly energy alternative . Its technological progress has been spectacular , especially in the last ten years and , due to its steady growth in competitiveness , wind power developed into a mainstream energy source in many countries worldwide . At the global scale , over 74000 MW of wind power are already installed , and current estimates indicate that by 2030 wind energy could cover as much as 29 % of world's electricity needs . In the wind power domain two main technologies were considered as having the necessary potential for a viable development : the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine ( HAWT ) and the Darrieus-type ( lift-based ) Vertical Axis Wind Turbine ( VAWT ) . A number of features have made HAWT to be preferred and become the dominant design type , especially in the utility-scale ( large and very large turbines ) segment . But , in certain conditions ( sites with highly turbulent wind like in the mountains or in urban environment ) , VAWTs seem to offer a better solution for the wind energy harnessing . If , through further and well-targeted research , increased attention is paid to the known VAWT drawbacks ( a somewhat less overall efficiency than the one of an HAWT , difficult / impossible self-starting , lower output due to operation closer to the ground , higher level of vibration caused by the inherent torque ripple and dynamic stall of the blades ) , at least in the "" small wind "" domain the VAWT design might become a major player . Among the most important problems that are now under study in the VAWT technology , the "" variable pitch "" for the H-Darrieus turbines is regarded as a promising solution for the alleviation of the negative effects of the blades dynamic stall ( efficiency loss , vibration ) , improvement of the rotor's self starting qualities , and torque ripple smoothing [ 1 – 3 ] . At École Polytechnique de Montreal , Canada , in the wind energy research the major effort is devoted toward the development and improvement of the performance prediction of VAWTs [ 4 ] . The variable pitch is also included in the current research subjects in this domain , and results were already published [ 8 ] , obtained from the analysis that was carried out to determine if the performance of a VAWT , in terms of the power output , could be improved by simulating the operation of the blade just below stall . The present study aimed at determining if a more general cyclical pitch variation can be determined , so as to maximize the performance of an H-Darrieus ( straight bladed ) vertical axis wind turbine at given operation conditions . In order to perform this investigation , an optimization package was set up to serve in the determination of the optimal variation of the blade's pitch angle for a small two-bladed VAWT . The paper presents first the main components of the numerical tool that was developed . Then , the results of an optimization case are discussed . Finally , several conclusions are formulated at the end of the paper . 2 . The Optmization Tool Since the local flow parameters on the blades vary along their circular path and differ quite significantly between the upwind and the downwind parts of the rotor , an optimization procedure had to be employed to determine the best law of variation of the blades' pitch angle . In the present study a tool for numerical optimization was set up by coupling the code CARDAAV , which computes the flow through and the performances of a VAWT , to an optimizer based on the genetic algorithm method . These ( main ) components of the optimization package are briefly presented in the following sections , along with the objective function , its variables , and the constraints that were imposed on their value during the optimization process . 2.1 . The CARDAAV Code CARDAAV , the numerical tool used in this analysis , is based on an improved version of the "" double-multiple streamtube "" ( DMS ) model [ 4 ] . This model considers a partition of the rotor in streamtubes and treats each of the two blade elements defined by a given streamtube as an actuator disk . Figure 1 illustrates such a streamtube and shows the values of the velocity of the flow at a number of key stations along it . Disk 1 represents the upwind blade element while disk 2 represents the downwind blade element . The actuator disk theory is based on the momentum conservation ; therefore , the velocities of the wind must be known in order to compute the force acting on the disks . The different values of the velocity ( see notations in Figure 1 and relations ( 1 ) depend on the incoming ( "" undisturbed "" ) wind velocity and on the interference factors u and u ( 1 ) To determine the interference factors , a second set of equations is used . Those equations are derived from the blade element theory [ 4 ] , which equates , in each streamtube , the normal forces acting on the upwind and downwind blade elements to the forces acting upon the actuator disks . To compute the normal and tangential forces , the blade element theory is applied , and the lift ( C l ) and drag ( C d ) coefficients , obtained from the airfoil data , are used . For the upwind interference factor u , the following expression , relating it to the azimuthal angle θ , is obtained : u ( θ ) = K K ( 2 ) with K = 8 π r ( 3 ) A similar set of equations is derived for the downwind interference factor u ' . An interference factor equal to 1 is assumed at the beginning of the iterative process . Once the force given by the blade element theory equates the one given by the actuator disk theory , the convergence is achieved and the upwind and downwind velocities are obtained . Then the torque and the mechanical power are computed . CARDAAV has the capability to analyze several predefined or user-defined rotor shapes with straight or curved blades ( parabola , catenary , ideal and modified troposkien , and Sandia shape ) . The code requires three main sets of input data , giving the geometry definition of the wind turbine ( diameter , height , blade section airfoil , blade shape , etc. ) , the operational conditions ( wind velocity , rotational speed , atmospheric conditions ) and the main control parameters ( convergence criterion , computation of the secondary effects , and the effect of dynamic stall ) . The software includes several dynamic stall semiempirical models : Gormont [ 5 ] and its variations ( Strickland , Paraschivoiu , and Berg ) and the one based on the indicial method [ 4 ] . Dynamic stall results in increased peak aerodynamic torque and affects the structural fatigue of the Darrieus turbine . This effect significantly impacts the drive-train generator sizing and system reliability . The dynamic stall used in this study was the Berg version of the Gormont model , because it was found out to be the best correlated with the experimental studies carried out on similar rotor configurations as those used in the present investigation . CARDAAV is also able to account for the so-called "" secondary effects , "" such as those due to the rotating central tower , struts , and spoilers . CARDAAV has made it possible to design , analyze , and build more efficiently and at lower costs wind energy systems such as the Darrieus-type VAWT . The code is used to determine , at specified operational conditions , aero-dynamic forces and power output of VAWTs of any blade geometry . Wind speed can vary with height above ground according to a power law . The program output consists of the local-induced velocities , the local Reynolds numbers and angle of attack , the blade loads , and the azimuthal torque and power coefficient data . Each of these is calculated separately for the upwind and downwind halves of the rotor . The numerical models used by the program have been validated for different Darrieus-type VAWTs , through comparison with experimental data obtained from laboratory tests ( wind or water tunnels ) or from field tests , thus making CARDAAV a very attractive and efficient design and analysis tool . In Figure 2 the power output of the SANDIA 17 m wind turbine computed with CARDAAV is compared with experiments and results provided by other numerical codes . A M is an empirical constant used to correct C l and C d for dynamic stall effects [ 6 ] . 2.2 . The Optimizer To search for the best pitch variation law , an optimization strategy was adopted , namely , one that uses a genetic algorithm ( GA ) method . At the beginning of the optimization process , a genetic algorithm randomly selects an initial "" population "" composed of "" individuals "" , which are solutions of the analyzed problem computed for particular , randomly selected , values of the optimization variables . Three operations are typically performed by the genetic algorithms on the analyzed "" population "" : "" selection "" ( choice of the "" individuals "" for the next generation , according to a "" survival of the fittest "" criterion ) , "" crossover "" ( operation which allows information exchange between the "" individuals "" by swapping parts of the parameter vector in an attempt to get better "" individuals "" ) and "" mutation "" ( operation which introduces new or prematurely lost information in the form of random changes applied to randomly chosen vector components ) . Like in any optimization study , an "" objective function "" had to be defined . In this case the inverse of the rotor power , for given conditions of operation ( wind speed , rotational speed ) 1 F = P ( 4 ) was used as optimization function F. On the other hand , for the pitch angle the following analytical expression was considered : τ = x ( 5 ) For different values given to the optimization variables x , the variation of the blade pitch angle τ with the angle of azimuth θ will be different . Since the local angle of attack α of a blade element α = s i n ( 6 ) contains the pitch angle , the later influences the aerodynamic characteristics , the torque , and ultimately the power output of the rotor . Hence , through relations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) an indirect link is established between the objective function ( 4 ) and the optimization variables x , which control the variation of τ . The genetic algorithm evolution strategy optimization package , GENIAL v1 . 1 [ 7 ] , was employed to minimize the objective function . This code includes three main modules , which perform the above mentioned operations . A number of parameters are available in each module to control its functioning during the optimum search process . As mentioned above , the coefficients x of the pitch variation function ( 5 ) were used as optimization variables . Their values were subjected to certain constraints , to avoid any possible mathematical invalidity and to keep the pitch angle within reasonable or practical ( technically feasible ) limits . 2.3 . The Optimization Package To set up the optimization package , including GENIAL and CARDAAV as principal components , a main program ( MAIN ) and a new subroutine ( PITCH ) had to be coded . When the program is launched , MAIN reads some of the parameters that control the optimization process , namely , those that are frequently changed ( size of the "" population "" – number of "" individuals "" , number of evaluations , constraints to be set on the optimization variables ) . These parameters have to be provided through the keyboard when a new optimization is initiated . Then , MAIN calls the optimizer ( GENIAL ) , which takes control and carries through the optimization process . For each combination of the optimization variables , defining a distinct ' individual "" , GENIAL calls ( using a "" system function "" ) PITCH then CARDAAV , which performs the analysis of the VAWT for that specific variation of the blades' pitch angle . With the turbine power , calculated by CARDAAV , the objective function ( 4 ) is determined and , based on it , the "" fitness function "" which characterizes that "" individual "" is obtained . Depending on its "" fitness "" , an "" individual "" can be maintained or eliminated from the "" population "" during the optimization process . Selection , crossover , and mutation are used to advance the "" population "" from one optimization cycle to the next until the optimum or the predefined limit of evolutions is reached . At the end of the optimization , MAIN outputs the optimal values of the x variables ( as found through optimization ) , which define the best variation law for the pitch angle . Corresponding to this , the performance characteristics of the turbine are computed and stored in a file for postprocessing purposes . As the name indicates , the subroutine PITCH uses relation ( 5 ) to calculate the pitch angle over the entire circular trajectory of the blades , based on the values of x received from GENIAL . It stores the azimuthal and the pitch angles in a file where CARDAAV seeks this information before performing each new analysis . 3 . Results This study was carried out on an H-Darrieus VAWT , having two constant-chord blades with an NACA 0015 airfoil cross section . It is a small , 7 kW rated power prototype , its rotor having the ( main ) geometrical characteristics given in Table 1 . The performance ( power , power coefficient , Figures 3 and 4 ) of this turbine was computed with CARDAAV in several situations : without taking into account the influence of the dynamic stall , by applying the dynamic stall correction , with a blade pitch that had a sinusoidal variation and with a blade pitch that varied according to relation ( 5 ) in which : x . These calculations , as well as all the other that are presented in this paper , have been performed for a constant rotational speed of 125 rpm and at one or several different wind speed values ."	3
1267	Like many of its neighbors , Slovakia's telecommunications system has improved over the years , becoming more modern and more reliable . Rapid growth in the mobile cellular sector has also occurred . According to IndexMundi.com , three operators provide cellular services in Slovakia . In July 2000 , Slovak Telecom Inc. ( now known as T-com ) was privatized with 51 percent ownership by Deutsche Telecom AG and 49 percent remaining under the Slovak government's control . Competitors include : Orange , UPC , SWAN , Dial Telecom , and many others . The number of mobile subscribers outnumbers landline users with over 5.7 million mobile users compared to just over 994,000 landline users . Three international exchanges facilitate international calling from Slovakia . While it 's easy enough to dial an international phone number from Slovakia , using national networks is n't the only choice available . Many Slovakians use international calling cards , VoIP systems , and even international conference calling plans to stay connected with their friends , family members , and colleagues located outside of the country . Each options has its own pros and cons . For example , while calling cards often have cheap rates , they are also clumsy to use . Sound quality is often questionable . Sound quality is also an issue with some VoIP calling options as dropouts and echo noises are common . Some international conference calling plans have minimum fees which may or may not be worthwhile . Fortunately , pay as you go plans are also available . If you need to call other countries from Slovakia , a pay as you go international conference call using a traditional telephone network is a high quality , low expense choice . Though they are designed for conference calls , you can invite just one or two callers if desired . Several tools such as MP3 call recording and moderator dial out add to the appeal of using an international conference call as an alternative to expensive international long distance calls from Slovakia .

1387	The MOST satellite design originates from trying to fit as large a telescope as possible , all the electronics to interface with the telescope , the satellite bus equipment that allows the storage and transmission of the science data to the ground , the ACS hardware that is required to maintain better than 25 arcsecond pointing accuracy for the telescope , and a power system to provide enough power to the satellite , all into a package that can meet the requirements for launch as a secondary payload on a Delta II launch vehicle ( with Radarsat-2 as the primary payload ) . It probably bears little resemblance to the satellite design that would have resulted had a launch on the Rockot been planned from Day 1 . However , that is the nature of microsatellite design . The telescope is a 15cm diameter aperture Maksutov telescope . A periscope mirror allows the long axis of the telescope to lie perpendicular to the aperture of the telscope and therefore fit into the Delta II secondary payload physical constraints . Attached to the telescope , separate from the satellite bus structure , is a two stage passive cryocooler that is capable of maintaining the focal plane of the telescope at a temperature of -40 ° C. Covering the aperture of the telescope is a door that is designed to actively close to protect the instrument focal plane from direct sunlight . The satellite structure is based on a tray stack design . The structure consists of aluminum trays that house the satellite's electronics , battery , radios , and attitude actuators . These trays are stacked forming the structural backbone of the satellite . To this backbone , the telescope is mounted with its barrel parallel to the axis of the stack . Six aluminum honeycomb panels , acting as substrates for solar cells and carriers for attitude sensors , enclose the tray stack / telescope assembly . An actuated telescope door mounted on the star facing side of the satellite protects the telescope focal plane from direct stares at the Sun should the satellite tumble or lose attitude lock .	4
763	Stem cells reside in small numbers in most body tissues and control the healing processes subsequent to disease or injury . Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) can produce various different tissue types including bone , cartilage and fat . However , the mechanisms by which different tissue types are produced from MSCs is very complex and therefore difficult to understand using intuition alone . Mathematical models provide a means to analyse complex systems such as the mesenchymal stem cell system . Therefore we propose an innovative approach to analyse how bone tissue is produced with the help of mathematical modelling in conjunction with experimentation . In particular we will use mathematical models to examine how gene expression correlates with stem cell activity and , significantly , how this correlation changes with age .	3
1326	"raditionally , biology research begins with a hypothesis . A biologist then collects experimental data and analyzes them to support or disprove the hypothesis . However , information technology is changing this sequence of events . Today , large-scale exploratory experiments are gathering as much data as possible ; for example , the Human Genome Project is enumerating the three billion amino acids in the human genetic blueprint . So now when a biologist forms a hypothesis , the data may already be in such a collection , just a computer search away . An NPACI alpha project led by Russ Altman of Stanford University is developing new tools and techniques to extract insights from growing biology data collections . Alongside these collections , a new discipline has emerged , called bioinformatics . Bioinformatics researchers develop and apply computing tools to extract the secrets of the life and death of organisms from the genetic blueprints and molecular structures stored in digital collections . However , while large-scale activities are amassing vast quantities of data , the techniques for routinely analyzing these collections have not kept pace . "" Because of activities like the Human Genome Project , exploratory data collection has come to be seen as more cost effective , "" said Altman , associate professor of medicine in the section on Medical Informatics at Stanford University Medical Center and leader of NPACI's Molecular Science thrust area . "" The collectors do not necessarily know why they are collecting . They figure that out later . This project will develop the infrastructure that will allow biologists to answer questions using these data collections . "" For example , a biologist might hypothesize that a protein with certain features--such as a particular sequence or structure--must exist to carry out some task in a cell . A time-consuming approach is to devise an experimental technique to search for the hypothesized protein . However , with bioinformatics techniques , the biologist can scan a collection such as the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) for proteins that meet the hypothesis criteria . LEGION-SCALE ANALYSIS The Bioinformatics Infrastructure alpha project is making a three-pronged assault on the problem : analysis , access , and movement of data . In the analysis component , participants are developing molecular scanning and comparison algorithms for various collections , and the Legion metasystem will recruit the computing resources required for large-scale analyses . "" Legion's architecture and past work on other biological codes will allow us to make progress quickly , "" said Andrew Grimshaw , the leader of the Legion effort and NPACI's Metasystems thrust area leader . "" We already have a framework for similar database analyses , which can easily take advantage of Legion's built-in fault tolerance . "" Altman's group , including Liping Wei , Allison Waugh , and Catherine Ying , have developed a scanning code that examines a PDB entry for active sites for which models exist , such as that for calcium . NPACI support has contributed to code improvements . Glenn Williams at Stanford is now working with the Legion team at the University of Virginia to modify the code to scan the entire PDB . "" Our code takes a PDB entry and derives information about potential calcium binding sites , "" Altman said . "" Any similar code could be used , and we want to make tools like these more readily available . "" The project also includes a molecular comparison algorithm for the PDB called combinatorial extension by Phil Bourne and Ilya Shindyalov at SDSC . An algorithm for phylogenetic analysis from David Hillis at the University of Texas and a genetic sequence comparison algorithm by David States at Washington University in St. Louis both run on sequence databases such as SWISS-PROT and GenBank . To run a scanning algorithm against every record in the PDB takes time proportional to the number of PDB entries . For example , Altman's code takes about 0.01 seconds per atom to scan a 3-D structure . With more than 10 million atoms in the PDB , the code takes days to scan the PDB on a workstation . All-versus-all comparisons , in contrast , take time proportional to the square of the number of entries . Last year , Bourne and Shindyalov used their combinatorial extension code , which finds similarities between structures , to compare more than 8,000 proteins in the PDB against every other protein . The effort consumed more than 24,000 processor hours on the Cray T3E at SDSC . On a workstation , the effort would have taken almost three years . Figure 1 . Growth of Biological Data The Bioinformatics Infrastructure alpha project is developing the tools and techniques for analyzing the the growing amount of biological data in databases . Left : The DNA base pairs stored in GenBank through August 1999 . Right : The structures stored and deposited in the Protein Data Bank through October 1999 . MIXED INFORMATION ACCESS In the data access component , participants from the Molecular Science and Data-Intensive Computing Environments ( DICE ) thrust areas are working to address the information access challenges of seamlessly accessing the information in different molecular data collections . When complete , the project will permit analyses to span not just one collection but several . "" The information access challenge is to take these data collections and compare them on a high-performance system such as the Centurion cluster at the University of Virginia , "" said Reagan Moore , associate director of SDSC and leader of the DICE thrust area . "" To do that , we must have definitions of how the collections are organized , and we have to understand the structure of objects in the collection . "" Operated by NPACI partners Rutgers University , SDSC , and the National Institute for Standards and Technology , the PDB is the premiere worldwide repository of 3-D protein structures , with 11,000 such structures today . Bourne leads the SDSC team . The Institute for Biomedical Computing at Washington University , directed by States , mirrors several protein and genetic databases . These databases include GenBank , which holds 3.4 billion bases in 4.6 million entries from 47,000 species , and SWISS-PROT , with 29 million amino acids in 80,000 entries ( Figure 1 ) . The collection that promises to seriously tax the data-handling infrastructure , however , is being created by Montgomery Pettitt , director of the Institute for Molecular Design at the University of Houston . Pettitt is creating a database of molecular dynamics trajectories , time-slice snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations . A one-microsecond simulation might , for example , produce a time slice every femtosecond--or one million database entries from a single simulation . This diverse set of collections will be integrated by applying technologies developed in the Mediation of Information using XML ( MIX ) project , led by Chaitan Baru at SDSC and Yannis Papakonstantinou , director of UC San Diego's Database Laboratory ( see enVision , July-September 1999 ) . The MIX software acts as a mediator between data sources with different structures , such as the collections in the alpha project . The MIX tools will use infrastructure-independent XML representations being developed by the collection maintainers to allow biologists to query , access , and analyze data from any or all of the collections from a single application or Web interface . STREAMLINED DATA MOVEMENT The data movement component joins the access and analysis components and is essential to the ultimate goal of the alpha project--large-scale analyses across more than one collection at a time . Initially , the Legion-enhanced codes will access data directly from the data collections , but the longer-term goal of moving data across the Grid is being addressed by efforts to integrate the SDSC Storage Resource Broker ( SRB ) , the cornerstone of NPACI's data-handling infrastructure , with the Legion architecture . "" The only challenge for Legion will be the amount of data the codes will produce , "" Grimshaw said . "" We do n't have enough disk space , so we 'll need some way to manage the storage . "" In addition , the code results could potentially exceed Legion's current 4-GB file size limit , and even when Legion allows larger files , the question of where to put the data remains . The SDSC SRB provides an interface to distributed , heterogeneous data resources . When requesting data through the SRB , applications and users need not know how or where a data collection is stored . With an interface between Legion and the SRB , an algorithm will be able to marshal both computing processors and data collections across the network . "" Traditionally , data movement is handled by copying files via FTP to local disk or into memory , "" Moore said . "" We need an architecture to stream the data from collections to an application on an as-needed basis . That 's where the SRB fits in . "" The DICE activities in this project build not only on NPACI activities , but also on externally funded projects with the NASA Information Power Grid , the Department of Energy's Visualization Interaction Environments for Weapons Simulation ( VIEWS ) , and the National Archives and Records Administration . BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERY While the project will require many new developments on the underlying technologies , the success of the project will be measured in part by how well the underlying infrastructure permits biology researchers to make new discoveries from the collections . For these users , the alpha project will provide a number of new resources and capabilities . First , the test codes run by the participants will provide both benchmarks and biological results . Second , the experiences of the participants will be captured in templates for performing similar analyses . Timings on resources , formulas for extrapolating from workstation runs to Legion runs , and other information will help determine the resources needed to answer a hypothesis and hence develop an NPACI allocation request . Eventually , the test codes and algorithms may be made available for execution , possibly via the Web . "" In some ways , the biology community is depending on projects like this alpha project to keep up with the rapid growth of biology data collections , "" Altman said . "" Using the Grid to marshal the resources necessary to scan databases such as the PDB and GenBank , this project will make this kind of bioinformatics capability routine . "" -- DH *"	4

1171	"Help Me Please ! Question : Hello . I think I am depressed . I feel like there is no point in my life anymore . I want out . I cry myself to sleep because I 'm scared and I hate the world I live in . I am sick and tired of my crappy life .... I am depressed . Can you give me some tips not to be depressed ? Please help me and email me back . Janet ( 13 year-old girl ) Answer : Janet my dear , I almost did n't choose your question , because you gave so little information about yourself . But then I looked at your age , and I thought , ' How brave of her , how strong she must be to defy her Depression , and find a way of asking for help ! ' So , I had to try and do something for you . Janet , I know nothing about your family , where you live , how you were treated as a little child , what pressures there are on you . I am just guessing that your life is no worse than that of millions of other teenagers . So , what I write may not fit , but chances are it will . Depression is sort of a monster . It sits inside your head and whispers things to you . It 's been with you since you were little , so it can exactly imitate your thoughts . When Depression speaks , it feels like the thoughts were your own . I know , because I 've been myself where you are now . I spent YEARS of my life being miserable , simply because I did n't know that help was possible . In fact , you are ahead of me : you know that someone , somewhere , can help you . I did n't even seek help , because I thought that no-one could have done anything anyway . So I just suffered . And because I suffered , I became a better person . I am a psychologist and help people like you , because I have been terribly depressed myself . You can choose to do something similar . Start now to steer your life towards being someone who can help others to fight their problems . That will give you an aim in life , a purpose , a reason for living . How did I fight my Depression ? All by my lonely self , I invented a method that I later found to be very similar to something called Cognitive Therapy . Scientists have studied the way Depression affects people , and have developed this method -- and I had done the same for myself . And all this time , I believed myself to be stupid and useless , because that 's what my Depression had said to me , and I simply accepted it as true . Janet , when it is Depression speaking instead of you , the words and pictures going through your head will be different from when the thoughts are yours . They will be absolutes : ' I can NEVER do anything right . ' Of course you can , sometimes , and muck things up at other times . You did something right in posting this question . There are MILLIONS of kids out there who are suffering like you , but , like me , they do n't even consider asking for help . So , you are smarter than I was at your age , smarter than all those other poor kids . ' No-one loves me . ' ( or something similar like ' I have no friends at all . ' ) Janet , every time a thought involves ' always ' , ' never ' ' everyone ' , ' no-one ' and so on , it is GUARANTEED to be wrong . The world does not work like that . There are exceptions to everything . I am ABSOLUTELY SURE that there are people in your life who do love you , who feel friendly towards you , who would like to be nice to you . I ca n't find them , but you can . Look around your life now , and think back to the past . You will find them . They will say bad things about you : My worst one was ' I am an idiot ' and versions of it like ' I can NEVER do anything right ' . It may be ' I am SO ugly ! ' or whatever . Any thought that you are much worse than other people belongs here . Janet , I have never met you , but I KNOW that you have good points as well as bad . People given to depression have a double standard . It 's OK for other people to make mistakes , but if I do , that 's intolerable and I must beat myself over the head about it . Another girl is allowed to have a few pimples , and still be attractive , but if I do , it proves that no-one could love me . And so on . They will paint the world in very dark colors : ' This is TERRIBLE . ' ' Everything is so hateful . ' Whenever something bad happens in your world or shown on the news , Depression zeroes in on it and uses it as proof that the world is a terrible place . But when something good happens , when there is joy and beauty and laughter and people being kind to one another , Depression puts blinkers over your eyes so you probably wo n't even notice it . If you do notice it , Depression will tell you it 's just an oddity , or that it 's OK for others but does n't apply to you , or that others have the luck not you . And if despite all this you manage to have a good experience , Depression will make you forget it very soon . The worst is that Depression tells you that things can never get better . This is the worst of Depression's lies . It is the one that drives so many sufferers to suicide , it was the lie that stopped me from seeking help . Janet , you can beat this monster the way I did . Only , you can seek help . I do n't even know what country you live in . I do n't know how much ( or how little ) money your parents have . But somewhere near you , there will be a psychologist or social worker or school counselor who is trained in using Cognitive Therapy . You have already taken the first courageous step in defeating your depression : posting this cry for help . Now take the second : organize therapy with that person . If you ca n't , you and I might be able to work together to defeat your depression . We can use email . Only , first we need permission from your parents , and they will need to pay me a little bit of money for each ' session ' . But working with a helper face to face will be better for you at this stage . Have a good life , Bob This question was answered by Dr. Bob Rich . Dr. Rich has 31 years experience as a psychologist and is registered with the Australian Psychological Society . He practices in Australia . Dr. Rich is also a writer and a "" mudsmith "" . Bob is now retired from psychological practice , but still works with people as a counsellor ."	7

Eco-Friendly Wedding Favors If you are determined to have an eco-friendly wedding , there are multiple ways you re your wedding can be green from start to finish . You can even choose to send your guests home with wedding favors that help them to continue eco-friendly behavior well after your wedding is over . Below are some things to look for in an eco-friendly wedding favor , invitation and other wedding accessories . If you are an eco-friendly persona , you probably already know that you should not have your guests throw rice at your wedding because it is not healthy for the birds . Confetti is not much better because it has harmful dyes that can be detrimental to the environment . Wildflower seeds may seem like a good idea on the surface , but may not be appreciated by neighbors or the venue at which your ceremony is held .	0

1533	The IRS has allowed tax benefits to people by way of the 401k for many years now . That 's why 401k plans have become the largest employer-sponsored retirement account type . If you are looking for rules for 401k distributions , you have either reached time to retire or want to tap the 401k for some much needed money . Regardless of the reason , you should be careful to abide by the 401k distribution rules , which are different for early 401k withdrawals and those made at the age 591 ⁄ 2 or older . As for early 401k withdrawals , they have the likelihood of causing two taxable situations on the individual's tax return . Aside from paying Federal income tax on the sum withdrawn , an early withdrawal in most cases also causes penalties of 10 % on the distribution sum . However , there is a 401k hardship rule , also applied to 403b plans and 457 plans , which makes allowances for early 401k withdrawals in certain situations . They include expenses for medical care , costs of the purchase of a principal residence , educational fees , funeral expenses and certain repair expenses . Do not forget that the abovementioned exceptions just specify conditions when you may get access to your 401k assets , but not represent exceptions to penalties or tax . The penalties wo n't apply if distributions before reaching age 591 ⁄ 2 are effected in the certain situations . They include payments made to the beneficiary in result of the death of the participant , disability of the participant , and a number of others . Meanwhile , you have to realize that although the IRS makes provisions for early distributions , it may happen that your employer's plan does n't allow premature distributions because of the added costs incurred . We remind that a 401k withdrawal penalty wo n't apply to participants who separate service from their employer in or after the year of turning 55 ( in the meantime , for qualified public safety employees that age is 50 ) . Since 401k distribution rules provide that you can start taking a 401k early withdrawal after turning 55 only from your current employer , it makes good financial sense to roll older 401k 's into your current employer before getting retired . If your want to withdraw 401k assets at retirement , you can choose from three options , assuming that you 're at least 591 ⁄ 2 and no longer employed : take a lump sum , leave your plan assets with your employer , or rollover 401k to IRA . 1 Trackbacks For This Post	7
778	Division :: Developmental Neurobiology Head of Division :: Dr David Wilkinson Our Division studies how the nervous system develops in the embryos of vertebrates . The brain and spinal cord originate from the neural epithelium , a tissue that forms early in embryo development . The developing nervous system becomes intricately patterned such that different regions of the brain are formed , and different cell types are formed at appropriate positions . The connection of nerves with specific targets within the embryo establishes the foundations of the mature nervous system . Our research studies genes responsible for patterning the neural epithelium and we investigate how their expression results in the formation of different regions and cell types . Since development of neural tissue is very similar across different types of vertebrates , our labs use the distinct experimental advantages of different organisms ( including mice , chicks , frogs and zebrafish ) to gain a better understanding of how the nervous system develops .

1083	"The schedule of a Happiness Engineer working in live chat When I was first hired as Trial Happiness Engineer , I was concerned about the flexibility of live chat . I imagined a live chat operator being chained to their desk all day . But since this is Automattic the pioneers of remote working , how was this possible ? How was it going to work ? Now I work on as a Happiness Engineer on a team that has a primary focus on live chat . Part of what attracted me to Automattic was the schedule flexibility . I 'm happy to say I have a very flexible schedule and I do n't work the typical 9am – 5pm Monday thru Friday schedule . I 'm also anything but tied to my desk . So how does it all work ? Scheduling / Flexibility The following is my own personal schedule , but each Happiness Engineer is different . There is no one-size-fits-all schedule for Happiness Engineers . At Automattic we have a saying that communication is oxygen . Since everyone has a different schedule , part of the oxygen that allows the Happiness team to function is communicating your schedule . Since every Happiness Engineer does this , this allows for us to efficiently schedule coverage for the week . I make my own schedule . It 's flexible in that I pick the days and times that I work , which amount to 40 hrs a week . Out of those 40 hrs my goal is to spend around 25 hrs live chatting . Currently , we sign up for live chat shifts . So I pick the hours I 'd like to live chat . We have a rough estimate about how many Happiness Engineers we need per an hour . Happiness Engineers get to sign up for which hours they 'd like to work . So it 's a balance of working the hours I 'd like but also trying to work hours where we need more coverage . What does a typical day look like ? I consider my "" core "" work to be live chatting . So I spend between 4-5 hrs live chatting each day . I then schedule the rest of my day around my live chat shifts . Around 1 hr answering tickets Then I spend around 30 minutes to an hour catching up on p2 posts & Slack and commenting ( p2 posts are our internal blog system ) . I also try to give myself between 30 minutes -1 hr each day for time to follow up with any live chats , where I need to test something or send them a follow up email . How flexible is Automattic with scheduling ? In my personal opinion , very flexible . I 'm not a morning person . I 've found I need a few days during the week to sleep in or do errands . This keeps me happiest . So on Wednesdays and Fridays , I start work at noon . Yeah , really ... 12pm . I also tend to work Sunday afternoon-evening anyways , preparing for the week . This works out great , because I get to help out with weekend & evening coverage . So on average I work around 4-6 hours every weekend . Here is what my weekly schedule looks like : My Personal Schedule If I need to take off work a bit early one day , I would log in later in the evening or weekend to help with coverage there . I communicate with my team and my team lead about these kind of changes in my schedule often . For example , when I 'm testing changes to my schedule and trying out new hours to see what works best for me and for live chat coverage . I let them know . This communication is healthy and let 's them know when I 'm around in case they need me . I never felt like I had to jump through hoops to get what I personally feel like is my dream schedule . I feel like Automattic trusts me to work the hours that I need to work , and that I find a schedule that keeps me happy , productive , and contributes to my team's goals . While I choose my own schedule , I try to schedule myself for times when I 'm needed the most . The wonderful thing about Automattic is that we truly are a remote company and no matter what time you choose to work - there is always plenty to do Having a company that is so flexible with me and my schedule , I tend to be flexible in return . If I notice that we may need an extra hand in the evenings or weekends , if it 's not a huge inconvenience to me or my schedule , I jump in and help out . This does n't mean that I work "" extra "" hours - I switch out those hours for hours that are well covered and either take a longer lunch to run an errand or leave a bit earlier then usual on another day . I still work around 40hrs a week , with those switches . I spent a good 9 months testing out schedules trying to find what worked best for me , before I settled on the schedule I 've currently working . Being flexible but consistent I 've personally found that the key to my own efficiency was being consistent . I 've spent about a year testing different times of the day that I live chat best at . I 'm best when I chat roughly around the same time each day . I 've also found that I do n't like working in live chat for more then 2 . 5hrs at time . Usually by then I 'm ready for a break and want to step away from the computer for a bit . I 'm most productive when I live chat right before lunch or the end of the day , so I get a nice break after my live chat shift . So on most days from 9am – 11 : 30am and then again from 2 : 30pm – 5 : 00pm works best for my schedule . When I do my best to generally do my "" core work "" during those hours this helps me get more done , since my brain now is hard-wired to know that it is crunch time . For each live chat shift - I stay in one place . I 'm either at home at my desk or at my coworking spot . I try to stay in a place where I can be most effective there since I have fast wifi and a large screen for multiple windows . Although somedays ... when I need a change of scenery I 'll go to a local coffee shop for my live chat session . Of course , this is what works best for me . Each Happiness Engineer is different and prefers a different schedule . Live Chatting : What 's it like ? One of my biggest concerns as Happiness Engineer Trial was Live Chat . I found the idea of it to be very intimidating . What 's live chat actually like though ? Well ... my first few live chats were a little nerve wrecking . After I got over my own fears , I found live chat to be so much fun . It 's my favorite way to support our users - since I 'm able to resolve a users issue in real time . Once you get a good rhythm , I 've found it to be easier to connect with our users via live chat . I 'm able to get to know them ... and the sites that they 're building . Our users are awesome . They 're kind and patient . So getting to chat with them all day is fun ! What kind of questions are you asked in live chat ? There are all different kinds of questions that come in , and you never know what you 're going to get . We get a lot of domain questions . Which is one of my favorite things to troubleshoot now . For example , when it comes to helping a user map a domain they own elsewhere to use with their WordPress.com site by updating name server settings or by helping a user purchase a domain . We also get a lot of questions about getting a theme set up or selecting a theme for their site . Do you have to know the answer to everything ? I can say that I certainly do n't know everything . While I 'm always striving to learn more . Something that 's helped me be successful is focusing on how to search for the answer . Knowing where to look for the answer is more then half the battle for me rather than having the pressure of knowing every single answer . Also for when I ca n't find the answer to a question , we have a Slack channel specifically for those in Live Chat . Since you 're working in live chat with a group of other Happiness Engineers , we 're all in the same Slack channel together and it 's pretty active . It 's one of my favorite channels because the conversation easily shifts between helping each other troubleshoot and small talk . I rely heavily on this channel . So even when I do n't know the answer , someone there usually does . It 's a great resource and helped me feel like I had a safety net for when I first jumped into live chat . So in Summary ... I love my schedule , live chatting , and Automattic . It really is a blast and the cool part is you could join us because we 're hiring . If you have any questions about my schedule or how Happiness Engineers schedule themselves , leave a comment below ! Hi Tish ! This is n't necessarily a schedule question , but as someone who is looking to apply for a Happiness Engineer position , do you have any pointers ? I know it 's absolutely necessary to stand out among the crowd . Any suggestions you have would be wonderful Thank you ! Your article inspired me to go for it and apply at Automattic ! You 've made me super dee duper excited about interviewing for the HE position ! I love that the interview is via Slack ... What a cool concept ! I 'm soooooo excited !! I hope to join you and the rest of the team ... definitely my type of vibe Thanks for this great "" day in the life ! "" Can I ask you how much previous experience you had with wordpresss + HTML / css you had prior to this position ?

For example , if you search for a restaurant chain , you may want to find one near you . When searching for movie showtimes , you may want listings in your area . Such search results are made possible by location-based customization . The location used to customize your results is clearly indicated on the left side of your results page . Our location detection technology will automatically set a location for you , or you can easily specify an alternate location . Automatically detected location To provide you with the most relevant results , Google attempts to automatically detect your location and customize results based on that detected location . A location that 's labeled "" Auto-detected "" is chosen based on the following factors : Your IP address . Google Toolbar's My Location feature . If you have Google Toolbar installed and have the My Location feature enabled , your approximate location ( if detected ) will be used to customize your search results . If you do n't want Toolbar to attempt to determine your approximate location , you can turn off My Location See the wrong location ? We 're continuing to improve our location detection technology , and the automatically detected location may be less accurate in certain areas . If you notice an incorrect location , please set your location manually by following the instructions below . If you 're being redirected to a Google domain that does n ' t match the country you 're in ( for example , Google . com . au instead of Google . com ) , please let us know ; we may be incorrectly detecting your IP address . Do n't see a location ? Sometimes we wo n ' t show any location if we ca n ' t accurately determine one for you . We 're working hard to improve our location detection technology . Also , the location setting will not always be available depending on your language and region . We are working to make the location setting more widely available . In the meantime , if you do n't have any location shown , it 's easy to set a location yourself by following the instructions below . Specify your preferred location If you 'd like to change your location , click Change Location and enter a street address , zip code , city and state , or country in the box that appears . Click Set to save your location setting . You can only specify a location within the country of your current Google domain . For instance , it 's not possible to set a U. S. address on www . google . es , the Google domain for Spain . If you 'd like to see results for a region outside of your Google domain , please specify the location in the search query ( like [ bicycle repair paris ] ) or visit a different Google local domain instead . If you do n't already have a location set , enter a location in the box next to "" Search near , "" then click Set . Your manually set location will be saved in a browser cookie on your specific computer and internet browser only . When you use the same computer and browser , this manually set location will be used to customize your search results instead of the automatically detected location . If your location preference does n't remain saved on the browser or computer where you set it , please check your browser settings . To clear your manually set location , click on the auto-detected location . This will clear the location setting saved in your browser cookie , and your results will be customized based on the automatically detected location . Can I turn off location-based customization ? The customization of search results based on location is an important component of a consistent , high-quality search experience . Therefore , we have n ' t provided a way to turn off location customization , although we 've made it easy for you to set your own location or to customize using a general location as broad as the country that matches your local domain . If you find that your results for a particular search are more local than what you 're looking for , you can set your location to a broader geographical area ( such as a country instead of a city , zip code , or street address ) . Please note that this will greatly reduce the amount of locally relevant results that you 'll see . What information about location does Google store ? Google has many services that collect or use location data , including Google Maps , Latitude , Toolbar , and others .

1667	"God Sends Sunday was the last book of the Harlem Renaissance . It was published in 1931 by one of New York's major publishers . It appeared in bookstores more than a decade after the start of the concentrated upsurge in artistic creation by African Americans , centered in Harlem , that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance . The book's author was a relative latecomer to Harlem : Arna Bontemps moved there in 1924 , after graduating from college in California . He began teaching at the Harlem Academy , and he put himself into the middle of Harlem's artistic tumult through friendships with other writers and a string of prizes that he won for his poetry in 1926 and 1927 . But the stock market collapsed in late 1929 , and the economic disorder that evolved into the Great Depression began to spread . Bontemps continued teaching while he was writing what would become God Sends Sunday . Harcourt , Brace agreed to publish the book in 1931 , and it received generally positive reviews . Yet larger forces buffeted Bontemps and those around him . As he wrote , drily , in 1968 : Within weeks after the publication of my first book , as it happened , I had been caught up in a quaint and poignant disorder that failed to attract wide attention . It was one of the side effects of the crash that brought on the Depression , and it brought instant havoc to the Harlem Renaissance of the twenties . I was one of the hopeful young people displaced , so to speak . The jobs we had counted on to keep us alive and writing in New York vanished , as some observed , quicker than a cat could wink . Bontemps's job at the Harlem Academy ended in 1931 ; he and his family moved to Alabama , where he taught at a small college and continued writing and also meeting and corresponding with those he had met in Harlem . He would eventually end up in Chicago , and then at Fisk University in Nashville , and become one of the most important chroniclers of the Harlem Renaissance and of African American literary culture . God Sends Sunday was not the last book of the Harlem Renaissance solely because it was published at a time when economic and social forces were dispersing Harlem's concentration of writers and artists . Bontemps's novel also showed some of the dissatisfaction that younger black writers felt toward what they saw as older writers' attempts to conform to white middle-class expectations about respectability and success . God Sends Sunday is a novel about a jockey in St. Louis ; it deals in violence and sex and sports and drinking and failure among African Americans , and its rendering of that world , and particularly its speech , is lyrical and vivid . W.E.B. Du Bois was among those who did not give the novel a positive review ; he criticized its lack of uplift and labeled it "" a profound disappointment . "" But it was this sort of perspective that Bontemps was pushing back against . So too , Bontemps based the novel's main character , Little Augie , on his Uncle Buddy – on a real life , in other words , lived by a real , complicated man . Richard Wright would most ferociously express this resistance to a Du Bois-like perspective in the late 1930s and '40s , and his work , among others ' , would represent a decisive break from that of the Harlem Renaissance . Bontemps himself would continue to push in a similar direction with his next novel , Black Thunder , published in 1936 , about a failed slave revolt in Virginia . It would become a more popular book than God Sends Sunday . But God Sends Sunday remains , as the last book of one of the most extraordinary eras of creativity in American history , a more significant milestone ."	4

1187	Dear Ms. Blacksmith , Did you know that in Genovia : · Only 33 % of kids get to see the inside of a high school classroom ? · 56 % of kids will die from starvation or easily-curable diseases before they see adulthood ? · 98 % of the population is illiterate ? When I 'm asked why we should care about what happens in Genovia , I think about Sophie . When Sophie first came to our school , she could n't read . As the eldest sister , she was in charge of caring for her siblings while her parents went out and worked . Her future looked bleak : without an education , she was destined to live a life on the streets . Because of our mobile school for Genovian children , we were able to provide comprehensive care for Sophie's whole family . Sophie went to school , while her younger siblings were also cared for . Sophie is in medical school now . Her goal ? To become a doctor , and come back to work with Genovian children to provide much-needed health care . Investing in Sophie's life , was like investing in all the children of Genovia . This year , we have the ambitious goal of opening more Mobile Classrooms . Wo n't you consider helping us give the children of Genovia a brighter future ? After all , your small investment can last for generations . Sincerely , Francis Fake , Executive Director Hope for Genovia	2

The . XXX top-level domain is the first of many generic top-level domains ( gTLDs ) to be released .

373	Booth's poverty notebooks For each of London's streets , Booth extracted information from the detailed record sheets kept by the small army of attendance officers employed by the London School Board . He and eight collaborators entered this information by hand ( mostly using pencil ) , in a total of 65 notebooks . The first 55 notebooks contain highly detailed family data , the remaining 10 notebooks contain less detailed street information . The family notebooks Early in the poverty survey , Booth began to collect information for every family in each street of London that had children . He and his collaborators entered this information into notebooks that Booth had specially printed for his inquiry . During the early part of the family survey , Booth actually had three different notebook layouts printed . As the example illustrated below reveals , the notebook entries include the street number , occupation of the head of household ( usually highly abbreviated ) , an indication of the wife's occupation ( especially if they were the household head ) , the number of childen in various age groups , the number of rooms occupied and rent paid ( often a single summary for an entire street ) , and notes on the social position of the household . Here is part of a page of the notebook recording informaiton for families in a street in Poplar : When the original information had been gathered from the attendance officers , Booth and his co-workers converted the head of household occupations into a ' section ' number , and gave each family that had children a letter ( A to H ) that indicated to which of seven social classes they belonged . Finally , each street was given a colour which indicated its general social condition . ( Booth devised a set of eight colours based largely on the social mix of street residents . ) These additional items of information can all be seen on the example notebook page above . Note how the employment section number is entered in the ' Rent ' column , and the family social class letter is written in the ' Wages' column . The street colour ( ' l bl ' for light blue ) is written alongside the street name . The street notebooks As the poverty survey progressed , Booth began to record information for entire streets ( or parts of streets ) , rather than for individual families . Again , he had notebooks specially designed and printed to record the information gathered from the School Board attendance officers . As the example illustrated below reveals , the notebook entry for individual streets includes comments on the character of the housing , the number of children of school-going age , general comments on the social character of the street , and the number of families in each social class . Because the street entries occupy a two-page spread of the notebook , the extract below is split into two sections . This is the left-hand side of the entry for five streets in Lambeth : Here is the right-hand side of the entry for the same five streets : Again , Booth assigned a colour to each street according to the social mix of its residents and its general condition . It is not entirely clear whether the street colour was assigned during discussions with the attendance officers , or following subsequent analysis of the summary data .	3
1660	"The Slippery Rock Sliders were formed for the 2007 season to ensure an even number of teams with the Frontier League's addition of the Southern Illinois Miners . The Sliders played 32 home games at Jack Critchfield Park in Slippery Rock , Pennsylvania , with the remaining 64 played on the road . For the 2008 season , the Sliders became a traveling team , playing all of their games on the road under the geographical moniker , Midwest . The Sliders ' 2009 season began on May 29 , at Eastern Michigan University ' s Oestrike Stadium located in Ypsilanti , Michigan . The Sliders played strong - a 33-33 record after 66 games . However , countless injuries and the sale of top starting pitching led to a late-season slump . Pitcher James Albury was sold to the Chicago White Sox and pitcher Caleb Graham was sold to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim . The Sliders had 42 scheduled home dates with 54 scheduled road dates . The Oakland County Cruisers were scheduled move into Diamond at The Summit on July 16 , 2010 after playing three three-game series ( nine games total ) at Oestrike Stadium during the first half of the 2010 Frontier League season , however , the organization was unable to obtain funding in time for this to occur . The Cruisers played 78 of its 96 regular-season games on the road . The Cruisers led the Frontier League East for better than two months . However , the high amount of road games ( 30 more than any other team ) and the solid play of the Windy City Thunderbolts and Traverse City Beach Bums down the stretch led to a third-place finish - only four games out . Interim Manager Gera Alvarez won 2010 Frontier League Manager of the Year . Pitcher P.J. Zocchi and first baseman Joash Brodin were named to the Frontier League End-of-Year All-Star Team . Zocchi tied the Frontier League record for saves in a season with 26 ( matched Matt Petty of the Windy City Thunderbolts in 2007 ) and was named Frontier League Relief Pitcher of the Year . Construction on Diamond at The Summit was supposed to begin in October 2010 with the stadium completed in June 2011 . The complex would hold approximately 4,000 fans and function as a year-sound sports and entertainment complex in Waterford Township . After a groundbreaking ceremony with officials of Waterford Township , the area still sits as a vacant parking lot to the adjoining and vacant Summit Place Mall . A small sign touting the construction project sits on the corner of two shopping mall "" streets "" with fading color in a sea of weeds . The Sliders were Ypsilanti's first pro baseball team in nearly a century , since they were awarded a franchise in the Class D Border League in 1913 . The Border League was sometimes called a "" trolley league "" because its six franchises ( in southeastern Michigan and Ontario , Canada ) were located on the interurban lines ; they played a limited schedule of games , primarily on weekends . Managed by former major-leaguer Ducky Pearce , the unnamed Ypsilanti team took the pennant with a 24-10 record , then folded with the rest of the league . Ypsilanti thus held the distinction of being one of the few cities to win a championship in its only season hosting a pro ballclub . College baseball remains popular in Ypsilanti : Eastern Michigan University won a NAIA national championship in 1971 and made it all the way to the championship game of the NCAA College World Series in 1976 before losing to Arizona . The Hurons ( now Eagles ) remain the last northern school to play for the CWS title ."	4
837	Nathan Cooke is that boy , he likes music and draws on his bag in biro . He should be in Glastonbury discovering women , but is in fact on holiday with his mother against his will . To exact his revenge on her for keeping him from possibly kissing a girl for a first time he takes a vow to only speak in Pulp lyrics ... it works . >> YouTube teaser Review In Pulp Boy , young storyteller-stroke-stand-up Terry Saunders imagines a typically moody teenager who vows , for a while , only to speak in the lyrics Jarvis Cocker made famous . Under the lad's bizarre logic , it 's a way of tackling the feelings of being displaced , misunderstood and unloved and a rebellion of sorts against his killjoy mother who 's dragging him on a budget break to Spain while he 'd much rather be going to Glastonbury with his pals . While his self-imposed affliction could lead him to ridicule , it also leads him to the first flushes of love , sparking a holiday romance with a girl equally enamoured with the band . Saunders's touching tale which he reads unapologetically from a printout is remarkable in the way he captures the feelings of being lost and alone when 15 , combining the certainty that you know all with the frustration the rest of the world does n't see it , for a reason beyond your comprehension . Our protagonist is at once romantic and crassly unsympathetic , seeing himself as a complex not contradictory . Saunders excels at recreating that maelstrom of conflicting emotions , speaking in the authentic tone of a defiant but confused young man . Pulp Boy is wonderfully written , poignant and quirky . It 's not a side-splitting romp , nor is it intended to be , but there are plenty of moments of rich humour , mostly in the struggle to find just the right lyric for the occasion . This is a fulfilling , grown-up piece of comedic artistry , warm , sincere and worthy of a wider audience .

192	"Eleventh session New York , 24-28 June 2002 Statement by the Chairman of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on the progress of work in the Commission The eleventh session of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf was held at United Nations Headquarters , New York , from 24 to 28 June 2002 , pursuant to its decision taken at the ninth session ( CLCS / 29 , para . 24 ) and paragraph 20 of General Assembly resolution 56 / 12 of 28 November 2001 . The following 18 members of the Commission attended the session : Hilal Mohamed Sultan Al-Azri , Alexandre Tagore Medeiros de Albuquerque , Lawrence Folajimi Awosika , Harald Brekke , Galo Carrera Hurtado , Noel Newton St. Claver Francis , Peter F. Croker , Indurlall Fagoonee , Mihai Silviu German , Abu Bakar Jaafar , Mladen Juračić , Yuri Borisovitch Kazmin , Wenzheng Lu , Yong-Ahn Park , Fernando Manuel Maia Pimentel , Philip Alexander Symonds , Kensaku Tamaki and Naresh Kumar Thakur . Osvaldo Pedro Astiz , Samuel Sona Betah and Yao Ubuènalè Woeledji did not attend the session . Upon the recommendation of the Subcommission established to consider the submission by the Russian Federation ( CLCS / 32 , para . 16 ) , the Commission also invited two former members of the Commission and the Subcommission , Karl H. F. Hinz and Iain C. Lamont , as experts , to attend those parts of the proceedings of the eleventh session of the Commission pertinent to the work of the Subcommission . The Subcommission recommended their participation so that they might answer questions and provide explanations , as necessary , during the consideration by the Commission of the recommendations prepared by the Subcommission in regard to the submission of the Russian Federation . The Commission had before it the following documents : - Provisional agenda ( CLCS / L. 14 ) , which , was adopted with amendments ( CLCS / 33 ) ; - Original submission of the Russian Federation presented to the Commission on 20 December 2001 , including the executive summary , proposals on lists of geographical coordinates of the points defining the lines of the outer limit of the continental shelf of the Russian Federation in the Arctic and Pacific oceans , and illustrative maps used in substantiating the outer limit of the continental shelf of the Russian Federation in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans ; - Additional materials submitted to the Subcommission on 3 April 2002 , including additional data and information to support the submission of the Russian Federation for the establishment of its continental shelf in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; - Additional materials for the submission by the Russian Federation on establishing the outer limits of the continental shelf , received by the Secretariat on 15 May 2002 ; - Recommendations of the Commission in regard to the submission made by the Russian Federation on 20 December 2001 of information on the proposed outer limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles ( prepared by the Subcommission established for the consideration of the submission made by the Russian Federation . Adopted by the Subcommission on 14 June 2002 , and transmitted for approval to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf . The meeting was opened by the Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , Ralph Zacklin , Assistant-Secretary-General in charge of the Office of Legal Affairs . In his opening statement , Mr. Zacklin congratulated the members on behalf of the Secretary-General on their election to the Commission . He noted that the Commission was of paramount importance to the United Nations and to the international community and that it was envisaged to serve the cause of maintaining stability in international relations . He pointed out that the Secretariat of the United Nations had stood and continued to stand ready to assist the Commission in carrying out its functions . The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs had been entrusted with the primary responsibility of that important task . He further pointed out that , at the previous session of the Commission , an important step had been taken with the beginning of the examination of the submission of the Russian Federation . That task illustrated in a striking manner the fact that , in the course of examining each submission of a coastal State regarding the outer limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from its coast , the Commission would have to analyse a large volume of complex geodetic , bathymetric , seismic and geophysical data in order to verify that the geological and geomorphologic conditions supported the submission . He assured the Commission of the cooperation of the Secretariat and emphasized that the expectations of the international community were high with regard to the skilful and independent discharge of members' functions . The results of that examination would prove that the members of the Commission had applied their expertise with complete independence and integrity , allowing no political considerations whatsoever to enter into their deliberations during the examination of submissions . The members would deliberate with regard only to the requirements of the Convention and the completeness and accuracy of the data and material submitted . Mr. Zacklin then presided over the election of the new Chairman of the Commission . Following consultations , the Commission elected Peter Croker by acclamation as its Chairman . The Commission also elected three Vice-Chairmen , Osvaldo Pedro Astiz , Lawrence Folajimi Awosika and Mladen Juračić , and the Rapporteur , Yong-Ahn Park . All officers were elected to a term of two and a half years . In accordance with rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission ( CLCS / 3 / Rev. 3 ) , each member of the Commission , before assuming his functions , is required to make a solemn declaration in regard to the performance of his duties in the Commission . All members of the Commission present at the eleventh session made the solemn declaration at a ceremony convened for the occasion . Following the ceremony , the Chairman proposed the draft agenda ( CLCS / L. 14 ) for consideration by the Commission . One member of the Commission suggested that the agenda should be amended to include training issues . In the absence of objections , the agenda was adopted as amended ( CLCS / 33 ) . Subsequently , the Chairman outlined the programme of work . He stated that , in addition to the election of its officers , the Commission was to renew the composition of two of its standing subsidiary bodies , the Standing Committee on provision of scientific and technical advice to coastal States and the Committee on Confidentiality , as well as to re-elect the chairmen of the two open-ended bodies , the Editorial Committee and the Training Committee . He further outlined the schedule for the Commission's deliberations on the recommendations prepared by the Subcommission established to consider the submission of the Russian Federation . Regarding subsidiary bodies , the Commission , upon nominations from the regional groups , appointed the following members to the Committee on Confidentiality : Osvaldo Pedro Astiz , Samuel Sona Betah , Harald Brekke , Abu Bakar Jaafar and Yuri Borisovitch Kazmin . The Committee met and elected Mr. Jaafar as Chairman , Mr. Brekke as Vice-Chairman and Mr. Astiz as Rapporteur . Upon nominations from the regional groups , the Commission also appointed the following as members of the Standing Committee on provision of scientific and technical advice to coastal States : Lawrence Folajimi Awosika , Noel Newton St. Claver Francis , Mihai Silviu German , Philip Alexander Symonds and Kensaku Tamaki . The Committee met and elected Mr. Symonds as Chairman , Mr. Tamaki as Vice-Chairman and Mr. Awosika as Rapporteur . The Editorial Committee met and elected Harald Brekke as Chairman . At the meeting of the Training Committee , Indurlall Fagoonee was elected Chairman . The Commission then began its deliberations of the recommendations prepared by the Subcommission . In that connection , one member of the Commission , Mr. Kazmin , expressed his view that pursuant to article 5 of Annex II to the Convention and paragraph 16 in section VII of the Modus Operandi of the Commission ( CLCS / L. 3 ) , the representatives of the coastal State were entitled to participate in the proceedings , without the right to vote . He emphasized that , in his opinion , the discussion of the recommendations was part of the relevant proceedings referred to in article 5 and that the provision of the Convention should in this case prevail over rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission and that the delegation of the Russian Federation should be present at the meetings of the Commission when the recommendations regarding its submission were considered and adopted . ( Rule 51 stipulates , inter alia , that "" the coastal State shall , in accordance with article 5 of Annex II to the Convention , be invited to send its representatives to participate , without the right to vote , in the proceedings deemed relevant by the Commission . "" ) The Chairman pointed out that no official communication from the coastal State expressing the wish for its representatives to be present during the proceedings had been received by the Chair or the Secretariat , and that the Commission would only address the issue if and when such a communication was actually received . Subsequently , on 26 June , the Chairman received through the Secretariat a letter from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations informing him that a delegation of the Russian Federation was present at Headquarters in order to make a presentation on the submission for the benefit of new members of the Commission or to answer any additional questions regarding the submission that the Commission might have . In the renewed discussion regarding the participation of representatives of the coastal State in the proceedings , Mr. Kazmin restated his arguments concerning the right of the representatives of the coastal State pursuant to article 5 of Annex II to the Convention to participate in the proceedings . However , a differing opinion was expressed by the Chairman , namely , that the Rules of Procedure developed the provision of article 5 of Annex II , and that the Rules had been adopted a long time ago , and had been widely distributed and made available to all States . It was emphasized that the Commission should continue to be guided in its work by those Rules . It was further pointed out that at the tenth session , the representatives of the coastal State had already been invited by the Commission on two separate occasions to present the submission and that , furthermore , the Subcommission had held six meetings of consultations in the form of questions and answers between the members of the Subcommission and the representatives of the coastal State . In addition , it was emphasized that , in accordance with rule 4 of annex II to the Rules of Procedure , which had been amended by the Commission at its ninth session in May 2001 , "" the deliberations of the Commission and Subcommission on all submissions made in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 8 , of the Convention shall take place in private and remain confidential "" . Therefore , at the current , final stage , the Commission should consider and adopt the recommendations at a private meeting . Owing to the impossibility of reconciling the differing views and of achieving a consensus on the issue , the Chairman suggested that the matter should be put to a vote in which the members would respond to the following question : "" Do you agree that the Commission may discuss the recommendations of the Subcommission and the Commission in a closed meeting , and consider those proceedings as ' not relevant ' for the purposes of inviting the coastal State pursuant to article 5 of Annex II to the Convention and rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission ? "" In that context , a number of members pointed out the sensitive nature of the matter and requested that the vote should be conducted by secret ballot , in the light of the provision of rule 38 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission , which stipulated that the Commission should normally vote by show of hands ( emphasis added ) . The motion to proceed with a secret ballot was approved . In the secret ballot , the question was answered positively by 15 votes against 3 negative votes , out of 18 members present and voting , with no invalid ballots and 12 votes required for a two-thirds majority ( the Chairman having ruled that what was under consideration was a matter of substance ) . After the vote was taken , Mr. Kazmin stated that although he accepted the results of the vote he continued to maintain , and wished to put on record , that the decision was contrary to the provision of article 5 of Annex II to the Convention . The Commission then continued in a closed meeting its deliberations on the recommendations prepared by the Subcommission . The Chairman of the Subcommission , Mr. Carrera , made a presentation on the work of the Subcommission and on the recommendations . He stated , inter alia , that following its establishment during the tenth session of the Commission on 28 March 2002 , the Subcommission had undertaken a brief review of the submission and had come to the conclusion that the consideration of the submission would take more than two weeks . That had been reported to the Commission on the same day . He further stated that the Subcommission had reconvened on 1 April and had held a total of 20 meetings between 1 and 12 April 2002 . Six afternoon meetings had been devoted to consultations in the form of questions and answers between members of the Subcommission and the group of experts of the delegation of the Russian Federation . Thirty-six questions had been posed by the Subcommission and written answers had been provided by the team of experts of the Russian Federation during the consideration of the Russian submission . He further noted that a number of points of clarification had been sought from members of the delegation of the Russian Federation , and additional data and information had also been requested . Some of the requested material had been submitted during the consultations . Other additional materials had been provided to the Subcommission through the Secretariat on 15 May 2002 . Following those consultations , Mr. Carrera stated , the members of the Subcommission had agreed on the format , contents and main conclusions of a document bearing the working title "" Outline recommendations of the Subcommission "" . Different members of the Subcommission were given the task of drafting the various parts of the document during the inter-sessional period . The Subcommission decided to reconvene in New York from 10 to 14 June 2002 , before the expiration of the term of office of the first membership of the Commission on 15 June 2002 . The Subcommission met throughout the week of 10 June 2002 to consider the new material which had been submitted and to finalize its recommendations . Upon the completion of its work , the Subcommission submitted its final recommendations dated 14 June 2002 through the Secretariat to the Commission at the present session . In the second part of his presentation Mr. Carrera elaborated on substantive elements of the recommendations . After a series of deliberations and informal consultations , the Commission concluded its examination of the recommendations prepared by the Subcommission , made several amendments to it and adopted the recommendations of the Commission by consensus . In conformity with the provisions of the Convention , the recommendations of the Commission will be submitted in writing to the coastal State that made the submission , via the Secretariat , and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations . The Commission wished to put on record its special thanks to Karl H. F. Hinz and Iain C. Lamont , who had participated as invited experts in part of the proceedings . The Commission also decided to address a letter of appreciation to all former members of the Commission , namely to Ali Ibrahim Beltagy , Andre Chan Chim Yuk , Kazuchika Hamuro , Karl H. F. Hinz , Iain C. Lamont , Chisengu Leo Mdala , Daniel Rio and Krishna-Swami Ramachandran Srinivasan . The Editorial Committee met during the eleventh session under the chairmanship of Mr. Brekke . In its report to the Commission , Mr. Brekke stated that the Committee had decided , in view of certain discrepancies between basic documents of the Commission ( Rules of Procedure ( CLCS / 3 / Rev. 3 and Corr . 1 ) , Modus Operandi ( CLCS / L. 3 ) and Internal procedure of the Subcommission of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf ( CLCS / L. 12 )) , to undertake a review of those documents and , if necessary , propose editorial amendments to make them consistent . The Scientific and Technical Guidelines should not be subject to such review . Furthermore , it was agreed that the review of the procedural documents should be limited to editorial issues , with a view to eliminating the inconsistencies or making certain provisions more practical and that those efforts should not lead to their revision . The Chairman of the Editorial Committee would consult with members of the Commission and report to it at its next session . The Training Committee met under the chairmanship of Mr. Fagoonee . The Chairman of the Working Group on Training reported that , among other things , the Secretary of the Commission had presented to the Group the information concerning the issues with regard to the preparation of the training manual . The Secretary had also informed the Group that , after consultation , it had been decided that the manual should appear in the form of a kit , consisting of printed material and compact discs with maps , figures and interactive material . The Secretariat further reported that two members of the Commission , namely Mr. Brekke and Mr. Carrera , had agreed to assist the Secretariat as coordinators and that some funds had already been earmarked for the production of the manual . The Secretary also provided information with respect to the status and operation of the Trust Fund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by developing States , in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States , and compliance with article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea . The Working Group also discussed other training issues and activities , in particular the need for a medium - to long-term training strategy plan , especially bearing in mind the needs of developing coastal States . Under the agenda item entitled "" Other matters "" , the Chairman of the Commission informed the Commission about the proceedings of the twelfth Meeting of States Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea with regard to the Commission and its status at the Meeting . He noted that the Commission had been granted observer status by the Meeting . One member of the Commission referred to the 2000 open meeting of the Commission and informed the Commission about a series of briefings organized by the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations concerning the implementation of the Convention , in particular its article 76 . In that context , he proposed that the Commission should consider holding another open meeting in the future . The members of the Commission endorsed the proposal and agreed , especially in view of the need for planning , that the modalities for the open meeting would be discussed at the next session . The Commission further discussed the time and venue of its next sessions . In view of the fact that the Commission had completed its work on the recommendations , on the submission of the Russian Federation , it was decided not to hold the session originally scheduled to take place from 26 to 30 August 2002 . It was further decided that two sessions should be held in 2003 . The twelfth session would be held from 28 April to 2 May , followed by two weeks of meetings of a subcommission in the event a submission was made to the Commission . The thirteenth session was scheduled to be held from 25 to 29 August 2003 . The Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs , the Legal Counsel , Mr. Hans Corell , addressed the Commission at the final meeting of its eleventh session . He welcomed the newly elected members and expressed his support of the important work of the Commission . He pledged that the Secretariat would continue to do its best to provide the required services and technical support to the Commission despite budgetary constraints . Finally , the Commission renewed its expressions of appreciation to the staff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea , as well as to the interpreters , translators and other staff for the assistance and services provided during the current session ."	0
1135	"' The Eagle Huntress' Review : Nature Doc Doubles as Stellar Girl-Power Statement Portrait of Mongolian girl who defies tradition to become an eagle-hunting champion soars high ' The Eagle Huntress ' follows a preteen as she becomes Mongolia's first female hunter – Peter Travers on why this girl-power doc is a must-see . ' The Eagle Huntress' Review : Nature Doc Doubles as Stellar Girl-Power Statement There 's a spirit that soars in German filmmaker Otto Bell's first feature documentary , The Eagle Huntress , which tells the story of 13-year-old Aisholpan Nurgaiv and her quest to break through a centuries-old gender barrier . Specifically , she wants to become the first girl in 12 generations of her family to hunt game in partnership with a wild eagle . Girl power is the theme and the driving force behind the film – it 's narrated by the young Force Awakens discovery Daisy ( "" Rey "" ) Ridley – as Aisholpan shows her nomadic Kazakh tribe that she has the stuff to open up an honored position that 's been passed down from one generation of males to the next . Aisholpan's father has been awarded several medals for eagle training while her mother is mostly seen at home slaving over the stove . Point taken , though Bell rarely tires of remaking it . There are times when the footage Bell captures seems less found than engineered . But from the moment we see Aisholpan climb down a steep slope on the snow-covered Altai Mountains to capture an eaglet for training , we 're hooked . And watching her compete against grown men in the Golden Eagle Festival is especially satisfying as reflected in the eyes of the young girls who find inspiration in watching her . Simon Niblett's cinematography , utilizing drones to catch impossible scenes of flight , is extraordinary , especially in the winter hunting sequences that end the film . But it 's the face and skill of of Aisholpan you 'll remember . Over the end credits , Sia sings a song with the lyrics , "" You can do anything . "" No need for the reminder .

144	"I 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you 've already heard , and I 'll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them . I want to start with what I call the "" official dogma . "" The official dogma of what ? The official dogma of all western industrial societies . And the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom . The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worthwhile , essential to being human . And because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf . The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice . The more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have . This , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it would n ' t occur to anyone to question it . And it 's also deeply embedded in our lives . I 'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us . This is my supermarket . Not such a big one . I want to say just a word about salad dressing . 175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you do n't count the 10 different extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you . So this is what the supermarket is like . And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , CD player , tape player , tuner , amplifier . And in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems . We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store . You 've got to admit that 's a lot of choice . In other domains -- the world of communications . There was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell . You rented your phone . You did n't buy it . One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke . And those days are gone . We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones . These are cell phones of the future . My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and creme brulee torch . And if by some chance you have n ' t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon you will . And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question . And do you know what the answer to this question now is ? The answer is "" No. "" It is not possible to buy a cell phone that does n ' t do too much . So , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , The same explosion of choice is true . Health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do . Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , well , we could do A , or we could do B. A has these benefits , and these risks . B has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do ? And you say , "" Doc , what should I do ? "" And the doc says , A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? And you say , "" If you were me , Doc , what would you do ? "" And the doc says , "" But I 'm not you . "" And the result is -- we call it "" patient autonomy , "" which makes it sound like a good thing . But what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely the patient . There 's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we ca n ' t buy them . Why do they market to us if we ca n ' t buy them ? The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask prescriptions to be changed . Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate . We do n't inherit an identity , we get to invent it . And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like . And that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . With respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could . The only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after . Nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs . I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to . And it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less diligent . It 's because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , "" Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ? Should I get married later ? Should I have kids first , or a career first ? "" All of these are consuming questions . And they 're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses . And indeed they should . These are important questions to answer . Work -- we are blessed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel . ( Laughter ) There is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi works . I 'm not telling you about it because I want to use it . So what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or should n ' t be working . We can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps . And even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , "" Should I answer this cell phone call ? Should I respond to this email ? Should I draft this letter ? "" And even if the answer to the question is "" no , "" it 's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would 've been . So everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice . And the world we used to live in looked like this . That is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice . And the world we now live in looks like this . And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ? And the answer is yes . ( Laughter ) We all know what 's good about it , so I 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it . All of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people . One effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation . With so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all . I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this , a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans . A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard , the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces . And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered , rate of participation went down two percent . You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . Why ? Because with 50 funds to choose from , it 's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you 'll just put it off until tomorrow . And then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes . Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they do n't have enough money to put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer . By not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution . So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices . And I think it makes the world look like this . ( Laughter ) You really want to get the decision right if it 's for all eternity , right ? You do n't want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong salad dressing . So that 's one effect . The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from . And there are several reasons for this . One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? It 's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision . The more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose . Second , what economists call opportunity costs . Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to . Well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you 've chosen . Here 's an example . For those of you who are n ' t New Yorkers , I apologize . ( Laughter ) But here 's what you 're supposed to be thinking . Here 's this couple on the Hamptons . Very expensive real estate . Gorgeous beach . Beautiful day . They have it all to themselves . What could be better ? "" Well , damn it , "" this guy is thinking , "" It 's August . Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away . I could be parking right in front of my building . "" And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space . Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific . And the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs . Here 's another example . Now this cartoon makes a lot of points . It makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly . But one point it makes is that whenever you 're choosing one thing , you 're choosing not to do other things . And those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attractive . Third : escalation of expectations . This hit me when I went to replace my jeans . I wear jeans almost all the time . And there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel OK . So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and I said , "" You know , I want a pair of jeans , here 's my size . "" And the shopkeeper said , "" Do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ? You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid washed ? Do you want them distressed ? You want boot cut , you want tapered , blah blah blah ... "" On and on he went . My jaw dropped , and after I recovered , I said , "" I want the kind that used to be the only kind . "" ( Laughter ) He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and I walked out of the store -- truth be told -- with the best fitting jeans I had ever had . I did better . All this choice made it possible for me to do better . But I felt worse . Why ? I wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself . The reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up . I had very low expectations . I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor . When they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect . And what I got was good , but it was n ' t perfect . And so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected . Adding options to people's lives ca n ' t help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be . And what that 's going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they 're good results . Nobody in the world of marketing knows this . Because if they did , you would n ' t all know what this was about . The truth is more like this . ( Laughter ) The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise . Nowadays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be . You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof . The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife , and she 's really quite wonderful . I could n ' t have done better . I did n't settle . But settling is n't always such a bad thing . Finally , one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear . The world is responsible . What could you do ? When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available , and you buy one that is disappointing , and you ask why , who 's responsible ? It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you . You could have done better . With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure . And so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them , they blame themselves . Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation . I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high . And then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they 're at fault . And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse . So let me remind you . This is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all false . It is not true . There 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it does n ' t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice . There 's some magical amount . I do n't know what it is . I 'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare . Now , as a policy matter -- I 'm almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this . What enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence . There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice . Their problem is that they have too little . So the stuff I 'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , Western societies . And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install child seats do n't help . It 's a waste of money . What I 'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it 's not simply that they do n't help . They actually hurt . They actually make us worse off . If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also . This is what economists call a Pareto-improving move . Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us . So to conclude . You 're supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , "" Ah ! What does this fish know ? You know nothing is possible in this fishbowl . "" Impoverished imagination , a myopic view of the world -- and that 's the way I read it at first . The more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something . Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible , you do n't have freedom . You have paralysis . If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction . You increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction . Everybody needs a fishbowl . This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us . But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery , and , I suspect , disaster . Thank you very much . ( Applause ) </content"	0

296	"Apache vs Yaws · Spoof signs  A succinct interview with Chomsky , touching on the morbid state of democracy in the USA , the "" War on Terror "" , Iraq , oil , all the usual stuff ... Some very interesting ( but short ) comments on China towards the end as well . Now let 's talk about withdrawal . Take any day's newspapers or journals and so on . They start by saying the United States aims to bring about a sovereign democratic independent Iraq . I mean , is that even a remote possibility ? Just consider what the policies would be likely to be of an independent sovereign Iraq . If it 's more or less democratic , it 'll have a Shiite majority . They will naturally want to improve their linkages with Iran , Shiite Iran . Most of the clerics come from Iran . The Badr Brigade , which basically runs the South , is trained in Iran . They have close and sensible economic relationships which are going to increase . So you get an Iraqi / Iran loose alliance . Furthermore , right across the border in Saudi Arabia , there 's a Shiite population which has been bitterly oppressed by the U. S. - backed fundamentalist tyranny . And any moves toward independence in Iraq are surely going to stimulate them , it 's already happening . That happens to be where most of Saudi Arabian oil is . Okay , so you can just imagine the ultimate nightmare in Washington : a loose Shiite alliance controlling most of the world's oil , independent of Washington and probably turning toward the East , where China and others are eager to make relationships with them , and are already doing it . Is that even conceivable ? The U. S. would go to nuclear war before allowing that , as things now stand ."	0
1169	"HEALTH AND HEALING AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Throw out the bottles and boxes of drugs in your house . A new theory suggests that medicine could be bad for your health , which should at least come as good news to people who can not afford to buy expensive medicine . However , it is a blow to the medicine industry , and an even bigger blow to our confidence in the progress of science . This new theory argues that healing is at our fingertips : we can be healthy by doing Reiki on a regular basis . Supporters of medical treatment argue that medicine should be trusted since it is effective and scientifically proven . They say that there is no need for spiritual methods such as Reiki , Yoga , Tai Chi . These waste our time , something which is quite precious in our material world . There is medicine that can kill our pain , x-rays that show us our fractured bones or MRI that scans our brain for tumors . We must admit that these methods are very effective in the examples that they provide . However , there are some "" every day complaints "" such as back pains , headaches , insomnia , which are treated currently with medicine . When you have a headache , you take an Aspirin , or Vermidon , when you can not sleep , you take Xanax without thinking of the side effects of these . When you use these pills for a long period , you become addicted to them ; you can not sleep without them . We pay huge amounts of money and become addicted instead of getting better . How about a safer and more economical way of healing ? When doing Reiki to yourself , you do not need anything except your energy so it is very economical . As for its history , it was discovered in Japan in the early 1900s and its popularity has spread particularly throughout America and Western Europe . In quantum physics , energy is recognized as the fundamental substance of which the universe is composed . Reiki depends on the energy within our bodies . It is a simple and effective way of restoring the energy flow . There are no side effects and it is scientifically explained . Opponents of alternative healing methods also claim that serious illnesses such as HIV / AIDS and cancer can not be treated without drugs . They think so because these patients spend the rest of their lives in the hospital taking medicine . How can Reiki make these people healthy again ? It is very unfortunate that these patients have to live in the hospital losing their hair because of chemotherapy , losing weight because of the side effects of the medicine they take . Actually , it is common knowledge that except for when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage , drugs also can not treat AIDS or cancer . Most of the medicine these patients use are to ease their pain and their sufferings because of the medical treatment they undergo . Instead of drugs which are expensive and have many side effects , you can use your energy to overcome the hardships of life , find an emotional balance , leave the stress of everyday life and let go of the everyday worries . Most of the chronic conditions such as eczema or migraine are known to have causes such as poor diet and stress . Deep-rooted anger or other strong emotions can contribute to viral infections as well . Since balancing our emotions and controlling our thoughts are very important for our well-being , we should definitely start learning Reiki and avoid illnesses before it is too late . Some people may still maintain that in our material world , everything depends on time . It is even "" lacking time "" that causes much of the stress that leads to the illnesses we mentioned . How would it be possible to find time to do Reiki to ourselves and the people around us when we can not even find time to go to the theater ? This is one good thing about Reiki ; it does not require more than 15 minutes of our time . There is no need for changing clothes or special equipment . It is a wonderfully simple healing art , an effective method of relaxation and stress-relief . Most important of all , it is less time consuming than medicine if we think of all the time we spend taking medicine for some complaints and taking some more for the side effects as well . Having said these , resistance to Reiki would be quite illogical . Reiki is natural and drug-free . What is more , it is easy to learn by anyone , regardless of age and experience . It can be used anywhere , anytime . It also enhances physical , mental , emotional and spiritual well-being and the benefits last a lifetime . It is definitely high time to get away from the drug boxes we store in our drug cabinet !"	0

1521	"The Goldilocks Principle – Definition The Goldilocks Principle describes a situation that is "" just right "" rather than too much or not enough . This ideology is derived from the popular children's story and has been applied to many disciplines , including astronomy , biology , psychology , economics , and more . In astronomy , a Goldilocks Planet is one that is just the right distance from a star to be able to sustain life on the planet . In ecomonics , a Goldilocks Economy is one which sustains moderate growth and low inflation . In cognitive science or education , the Goldilocks Principle is observed when a task is neither too simple nor too complex for the learner to grasp . In medicine , The Goldilocks Principle is the ideal dosage of a drug for a particular patient based on their physiological needs . In each of these examples , optimal balance is reached within certain margins rather than reaching for extremes . In "" The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears "" each item in the cottage symbolizes a situation in Goldilocks's life that is out of balance . As she finds "" just right "" with the item , she discovers a state of "" just right "" within herself . Symbolically , the item serves as the medicine for a particular physical or energetic ailment in her life . The porridge provides physical nourishment . The chairs provide a sense of self as she "" takes her seat . "" The beds provide both physical rest and sleep as well as a sense of peace . Just as a doctor is considered on some levels a healer , the food , home , and energy of the bears in the cottage of this adaptation of the story is what heals Goldilocks of her ailments by bringing her to a state of equilibrium akin to The Goldilocks Principle . In this simple example , Goldilocks's encounter in the bears' cottage serves to bring "" just right "" to her root chakra ( food nourishment ) , her core chakra ( taking her seat in her Self ) , and her crown chakra ( sleep and dreaming in spirit world ) ."	4
1681	"In Eichmann in Jerusalem , Hannah Arendt described the machinations of one of the architects of the Holocaust as "" the fearsome , word-and-thought-defying banality of evil . "" Adolf Eichmann , the Nazi official who had inspired that turn of phrase , was the main organizer of the Wannsee Conference , a meeting of 15 senior Nazi leaders in suburban Berlin on January 20 , 1942 . There is perhaps no better window into the banality of evil than a collection of bureaucrats gathering at a working lunch to discuss the most-efficient means of murdering millions of European Jews . Eichmann had joined the SS in November 1932 . Just over a year later , he was assigned to Dachau , the first Nazi concentration camp in Germany . Dachau had been constructed within weeks of Adolf Hitler ' s rise to power , and it initially housed political prisoners of the Reich . In 1938 , after the Anschluss , Eichmann was tasked by SS chief Heinrich Himmler with purging Vienna's Jews , and he led a similar mission to Prague a year later . When all of Germany's security and secret police forces were consolidated into the Reich Security Central Office under Reinhard Heydrich , Eichmann was assigned to its section on Jewish affairs . It was in this role that Eichmann would convene the Wannsee Conference . Prior to 1942 , the Holocaust was carried out on a largely ad hoc basis . Jews were forced into ghettos in occupied territories , where conditions were harsh and disease was rampant , and it was assumed by Nazi officials that many would perish in forced labor camps . Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , and the following month Hermann Göring ordered Heydrich to craft a "" final solution to the Jewish question . "" In autumn 1941 , as German armies advanced into Soviet territory , tens of thousands of Jews were massacred at sites such as Babi Yar ( outside Kiev ) , Rumbula Forest ( outside Riga ) , and Ponary ( outside Vilnius ) . Heydrich viewed such mass shootings as too costly in terms of both morale and matériel . With Eichmann he devised a plan to bring about the Vernichtung ( annihilation ) of Europe's Jews , although the written record of the Wannsee Conference carefully avoided such direct language . Phrases such as "" evacuation to the east "" were used to euphemize the destruction of millions of lives , and the conference's attendees were urged to use the powers of their various commands and ministries to achieve the "" final solution . "" A vast logistical network was developed and maintained to ensure that the flow of Jews to the extermination camps would continue throughout the war , and Eichmann prided himself on his ability to keep the trains moving . Of the 15 attendees at Wannsee , 5 did not survive the war and 1 died within days of Germany's surrender ( Heydrich was assassinated by a pair of Czech commandos in 1942 ) . Two were executed for war crimes in the years immediately following the war ; all but one of the remaining attendees stood trial for war crimes and either served short sentences or saw charges dismissed altogether . Eichmann fled Germany after the war , but in May 1960 he was apprehended by Israeli secret service agents in Argentina . He was smuggled out of the country and faced a war crimes trial in Jerusalem . He was found guilty of all charges and was executed on May 31 , 1962 ."	0
1391	"Real Estate Information Archive Blog Question : Allison , I heard that Congress recently changed some of the capital gains laws . What have you heard ? Answer : Hardly anybody noticed it , but Congress tucked away a valuable bit of holiday cheer for real estate when it passed its final tax bill of the year . It was the first substantive change in years to the generous capital gains rules governing sales of principal homes . According to Kenneth Harney , most homeowners and real estate professionals can recite these rules in their sleep : Married , joint-filing sellers of houses can exclude up to $ 500 , 000 of gain , and single-filing sellers can take up to $ 250 , 000 ... provided they 've used the property as a principal residence for a cumulative two of the previous five years . But what happens when a married home owner dies ? Does the surviving spouse still qualify for the full $ 500 , 000 -- or does she or he only get to exclude $ 250 , 000 ? The answer from the IRS has been this : you only get the full $ 500 , 000 if you sell during the tax year in which you were married and filing a joint return . Otherwise , the tax code sees you as single , and then you 're limited to $ 250 , 000 . In other words , if your wife or husband died in June of 2007 , you can only claim the full $ 500 , 000 benefit if you sell before December 31 , 2007 . After that , as long as you remain unmarried , you 're capped at the $ 250 , 000 limit for single taxpayers . As a practical matter , most surviving spouses inherit their husband's or wife's share of the property at what 's known as a "" stepped up "" tax basis , with no capital gains tax liability at the current market value . Well , now they 've got it . Legislation signed into law before the holiday recess gives surviving spouses two full years to qualify for the $ 500 , 000 exclusion -- even though technically they 're single . And who says Congress does n't have a heart ? Since your tax professional may not be familiar with this yet , here 's the official citation : The bill is H.R. 3648 . The capital gains change is in Section 7 . Question : Our goal for this next year is to buy a home in Summit County . We want to get some information on financing and are considering using an Internet lender . What would be the benefits of working with someone locally versus working with an Internet lender ? Answer : There are numerous advantages when using a local mortgage lender as compared to a mortgage lender obtained over the Internet . Customer service is the number one advantage . A local mortgage lender is familiar with the properties in their area , whereas an Internet lender may have limited knowledge of the requirements associated with a resort area . With a local lender the borrowers will have an individual who is personally working on their loan application , as every borrower's needs and financial situations are unique . The borrower also has a contact person to check the status of their application and to answer any questions they may have . Plus they will be able to speak directly with a local lender without having to play phone tag or leaving messages in voice mail that can be associated with the larger mortgage corporations . This can be frustrating to the borrowers . The lender is responsible for ordering the appraisal on the property , which should be from a local appraiser . This is very important . A local appraiser is familiar with the area and the values of the properties and any changes in the area that can affect those values . When purchasing a condominium unit , local lenders will be familiar with the condominium projects in the area and will know if the project meets the lender's requirements . There is also the working relationship with the local title companies , surveyors and insurance companies to meet the state's requirements to provide each borrower with clear title to the property . There are several steps that must be completed to take a borrower from application to approval to the closing date . Working with the local mortgage lenders , title companies , appraisers and surveyors makes all these steps come together . You have the advantage of the individuals familiar not only with the area but also the requirements of each purchase contract . Purchasing a home whether it 's your first home , vacation home or a rental property can be stressful , working with your local professionals can make this process a lot easier . Question : Our Realtor has suggested that we hire an interior decorator to "" stage "" our home . Is there any benefit in this ? Answer : Originally popularized in California , staging helps homes sell quickly and for more money . Staging concentrates not on changing the interior in terms of painting or adding carpeting , says Carole Talbott of home decorating company Visual Coordinations . These are things the buyers would most likely prefer to choose themselves . Rather staging depends on "" selling the space . "" When a home is staged , it 's reorganized--first with the furniture , then artwork , and finally by accessories . The furnishings remain the same , except for well-worn pieces or those that break up the design . Many times accessories are used to add color to a room . Stagers charge approximately $ 500 to $ 750 for a three-bedroom , two-bath home ; Talbott advises owners to stage only the main living areas to avoid high costs . Some staging advice for homeowners who want to go it alone : furniture should be kept away from walls by grouping at angles in the middle of the room ; colors should be chosen from artwork and fabrics , and accessories should be chosen to accentuate them ; collections should be kept together ; and mirrors should be placed in locations where favorable scenery will reflect . To attract attention to the exterior , the front door should be the first thing painted or decorated . Question : I am thinking of buying a condominium in Summit County and want to find a property with low homeowner's association dues . How important is it for the association to have a capital reserve fund ? Answer : Condominium buyers should be wary of associations that lack adequate reserves--money set aside to pay for emergency or major repairs--because they could be forced to pay special assessments to cover costs when the association can not . Additionally , a future sale or refinancing could be denied based on the association's reserves ; and it is difficult to find a buyer under such conditions . Insufficient reserve funds can lead to declining property values , as educated buyers refrain from purchasing condos in the community , according to the Community Associations Institute , a national nonprofit organization that educates and provides resources to homeowner groups . Annually , an association's board of directors is required to predict the next year's income and expenses--usually through a reserve analysis study . This report consists of a property evaluation--architectural and engineering--by qualified engineers . The engineers determine the useful life and repair costs of things like boilers , elevators , and roofs to determine how much money should be set aside each year to plan for future replacement . The reserve funds are generally collected from the condo owners on a monthly or quarterly basis and deposited into Treasury bills or other secure government-insured funds . If a repair is necessary and the association needs to raise the money immediately , there are three steps it can take : increase the monthly assessment amount ; impose special assessments , in which the owner immediately pays a fee based on the percentage interest he / she has in the association ( sometimes amounting to hundreds of dollars ) ; or get a loan . Answer : Although reverse mortgages are an ideal fit for many senior homeowners , they are not the best option for all of them . A reverse mortgage would not be in the best interest of someone who intends to make a move in the foreseeable future , the AARP and other sources note . Reverse loans usually come with stiff upfront fees and closing costs of up to 10 percent of the loan amount , which are distributed over the life of the loan . Owners who sell their homes quickly will also lose their equity quickly . Reverse mortgages may not be suitable for seniors who want to leave a free-and-clear property behind as a legacy to their heirs . At the same time , some experts say elderly homeowners should consider a reverse loan as a way to meet living expenses or settle medical bills while they are alive , without worrying about what will happen when they die . Their offspring still can keep the property by paying off the reverse mortgage with funds from the estate or with their own money , or by taking out a new mortgage . Experts warn that reverse loans may not be the solution for the youngest seniors , because longer life expectancy qualifies borrowers for less money , or for those in the midst of a temporary financial emergency , who might be better off taking out a home equity line instead . Finally , another alternative , such as selling the property and using the proceeds to downsize into a smaller house or to rent , might make sense for some seniors . Question : Allison , we 've heard a lot about 1031 tax-deferred exchanges and would like to know if our second home would qualify for a like-kind exchange with another piece of property that is closer to our home . We have never rented our current property , but consider it an investment due to it 's appreciation the past few years . Answer : Your question is a good one – and one that has been in the media and in the courts quite a bit in the past few months . To get an accurate assessment of your particular situation , I recommend you speak with a company that specializes in 1031 tax-deferred exchanges . According to Inman News , a similar case to yours was tried in court . Here are the details . In 1988 Barry and Deborah Moore purchased a second home on Clark Hill Lake . It included a home to which the Moores added a deck and other improvements . The property was a three-hour drive from their principal residence . The Moores and their children visited the property two weekends each month between April and September each year . But in 1995 the Moores changed their primary-residence location , making the drive to the Clark Hill Lake property a five - to six-hour trip . As a result , they used the property only a few times each summer . The Clark Hill Lake property was never offered for rent to short - or long-term tenants . On their income-tax returns , the Moores deducted their mortgage interest and property tax payments as personal itemized deductions . In 2000 , the Moores found a five-bedroom , four-bathroom house on 1.2 acres of land adjoining Lake Lanier , just a few hours from their home . It has five screened-in porches , a party deck and veranda . They decided to make an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred trade of the Clark Hill Lake property for the larger and closer Lake Lanier property . They justified the exchange by stating both properties were held for "" investment "" rather than for personal use . Upon audit , the IRS denied the IRC 1031 tax-deferral on the sale of the Clark Hill Lake property . The IRS auditor noted the property had never been rented and was used only by the Moore family on weekends . But the Moores argued they held the property as an investment for future appreciation in market value . They took their dispute to the U.S. Tax Court . If you were the judge would you allow the Moores to defer the capital gains tax on the trade of the Clark Hill Lake property as an investment ? The judge said no ! To qualify for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , the judge began , both properties involved in the trade must be held for investment or for use in a trade or business . Although the Moores pointed to the appreciation potential of the Clark Hill Lake property , he continued , "" It is a taxpayer's primary purpose in holding the properties that counts . "" "" Property held for investment is property held for the production of income , "" the judge explained . "" We accept as fact the Moores hoped that both the Clark Hill and Lake Lanier properties would appreciate , "" he noted . "" Mere hope or expectation that property may be sold at a gain can not establish an investment intent if the taxpayer uses the property as a residence , "" the judge emphasized . There was no convincing proof either property was held for the production of income as a rental since the family used both properties primarily as vacation retreats , he added . Because the evidence strongly showed both vacation homes were held for personal use , rather than for production of income , neither property qualifies for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , and the Clark Hill Lake property sale is taxable , the judge ruled ."	7
913	"It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation . Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . Everything had gone so well till now ! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . Had the hour of adversity come ? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . Poor fellow ! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions . He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising . Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind . On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable . Passepartout cleared up with the weather . Some of the sails were unfurled , and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed . The time lost could not , however , be regained . Land was not signalled until five o ' clock on the morning of the 6th ; the steamer was due on the 5th . Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the Yokohama steamer would , of course , be missed . The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong . Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . He had confided his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal ! -- tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put Passepartout in a passion . Mr. Fogg , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama . "" At high tide to-morrow morning , "" answered the pilot . "" Ah ! "" said Mr. Fogg , without betraying any astonishment . Passepartout , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck . "" What is the steamer's name ? "" asked Mr. Fogg . "" The Carnatic . "" "" Ought she not to have gone yesterday ? "" "" Yes , sir ; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow . "" "" Thank you , "" returned Mr. Fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon . Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , "" Pilot , you are the best of good fellows ! "" The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong . At one o ' clock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore . Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . Mr. Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour ."	6
1211	"Brexit must happen on time , Theresa May insists Theresa May has said she is "" clear "" she expects to start talks on leaving the EU as planned by the end of March . The prime minister also played down the chances of an early general election , saying the next one "" should "" take place as scheduled in 2020 . The government is appealing against the High Court's decision that MPs and peers should vote on triggering Brexit . Mrs May said judges should "" specify how "" the vote might happen , if ministers are defeated again . The High Court ruled last Thursday that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks . Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process . Brexit live : Rolling text and video updates Judges ' could need democratic controls' Brexit court ruling : Your questions answered The legal questions at the heart of the High Court Article 50 ruling But the government argues that a parliamentary vote is not necessary as it already has powers to decide when negotiations with the EU should start . The Supreme Court is expected to hear its appeal early next month . Speaking to BBC Business Editor Simon Jack on a trade visit to India , Mrs May said : "" I 'm clear that I expect to be able to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year . That 's what I 've said consistently and I continue to work on that basis . "" She added : "" We believe the government has got strong legal arguments . We 'll be putting those arguments to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will make its judgement . "" There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament , or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead . Media captionLabour's Keir Starmer reacts to Brexit Secretary David Davis' statement on Article 50 Asked about this , Mrs May suggested that she would expect the court to set out which of the two options would be required . She said : "" If it were the case that the Supreme Court were to uphold the view of the High Court , then the judgement would set out what the details were . "" In recent days , the idea of an early election has been raised , but Mrs May said : "" I 've been clear the next general election should be in 2020 . "" The government is getting on with the job in delivering what people voted for on 23 June which was for Britain to leave the European Union . We 're going to put that in to practice . "" In June's UK-wide referendum , voters opted by 51.9 % to 48.1 % in favour of leaving the EU . Media captionBrexit Secretary David Davis' statement to MPs after the High Court ruling on Article 50 Earlier on Monday , Brexit Secretary David Davis gave the government's official response to the High Court's ruling , telling MPs the referendum result "" must be respected and delivered "" . He added : "" There must be no attempt to remain inside the EU now , attempting it behind the back door or a second referendum . "" For Labour , shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to have a vote on the issue , as it was "" sovereign "" and , because of this , "" that scrutiny matters "" . However , his party would not "" frustrate "" the process of invoking Article 50 , he added . Brexit : All you need to know What has actually happened since Brexit ? He told MPs the government's approach was "" unravelling "" in an "" ugly way "" , adding : "" We saw a series of appalling personal attacks on the judges , including the suggestion that they were ' enemies of the people ' . "" This was a reference to a headline used in the Daily Mail on Friday - the day after the High Court's decision . Mr Davis insisted that "" we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary "" , but defended the freedom of the press . "" Both these things underpin our democracy , "" he said . Suzanne Evans , one of the three candidates for the UKIP leadership contest , told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that judges could be "" subject to some kind of democratic control "" following the High Court's decision . She did not want to undermine "" their judicial independence "" , but added : "" I suppose that in this case , we have had a situation where we have judges committed to stay in the European Union ... "" I 'm questioning the legitimacy of this particular case . We know that the legal profession threw a collective hissy fit when we voted to leave . "" Scotland's Brexit minister , the SNP's Michael Russell , said he could not imagine any circumstances in which his party's MPs would vote in favour of triggering Article 50 ."	8

1413	Most people who have moderately arched feet mistakenly think they require motion control or shoes for flat feet . People often overestimate the amount their ankles roll inwards during their running cycle . Worse is that new runners often enjoy overpronating excessively . A simple correction of the running gait should be first checked especially for people with moderate arches Ask anyone about beautiful feet and they 'll always describe high arches . Society has attributed high arch feet to beauty and flat feet to strength . Consequently supportive bulky looking shoes for flat feet look like tanks while the pliable neutral shoes for high arches look sexy . This is a problem for some consumers because it has been noted that most buy shoes by the way they look . This is exacerbated by moderately arched women runners who tend to choose shoes that offer little support to their mild overpronation . They key here is to choose shoes for function first then appearance next . Moderately arched runners should realize that the best shoes for them are those that look like a cross between bulky sneakers and light neutrals . Shoes offering stability are flooding the market . But since they tend to cater to people whose gaits range from mild overpronation to moderate overpronation it can be a challenge to find the right one . Truth to be told motion control sneakers will fill better than the wrong pair of stability treads . Read reviews of these running shoes to find out if they provide too little or too much support for your unique foot . Remember not all moderately arched feet require the same amount of overpronation protection . You need the right form of stability to avoid injuries .	7

1461	"Springer Science + Business Media acquired Mekenatosj BV and Lifve Ltd. , known for the reference manager software tool , Papers . Developed by Alexander Griekspoor with his friend Tom "" Tosj "" Groothuis , Papers improves the way that researchers handle workflow as they search for , download , annotate , and organize scientific literature ( together with supplemental material ) , appropriately citing the works in in term papers ( students ) and publications ( scientists , authors ) . Lifve allows Papers users to share their collections with peers . Griekspoor will head the unit within Springer . The Mekentosj team is expected to remain in control of the strategic direction for the unit and product innovations . Designed simply to organize PDFs of scientific papers of developers Griekspoor and Groothuis for their personal studies while they attended university , this app has won an Apple Design award ( while remaining unavailable in the Mac App store ) . The tool , meant to facilitate the exchange of scientific literature and protocols , has become a favorite for users who like reading PDFs on their iPads that they want to annotate , consult again , or share with colleagues with similar research interests . ( A Windows version of the product – a collaboration with Scimatic – was released in February 2012 . ) How It Works Papers acts as a repository for digital academic documents in one's personal library , accepting 85 different types of documents , including books , articles , web pages , patents , reports , etc. Users can search bibliographic databases ( such as Scopus , ScienceDirect , PubMed , or Web of Science ) , importing relevant articles , into the system for future reference , review , and re-use . In addition to making the full text of the item available searchable , the system automatically populates metadata about the documents , attaching it to the PDF files , and will name PDFs to any convention the user specifies . Users can personalize imported documents , highlighting , annotating ( notes directly within the application ) , and tagging each , making the items meaningful to them . While storing full-text PDF files online , users can sync their desktop ( Mac or Windows ) with their iPads or iPhones . ( The system not only keeps track of imported items , but what is read . ) Papers stores and helps users organize references , using any number of styles to incorporate formatted references in manuscripts . The "" Magic Manuscripts "" function allows users to cite any type of item , in appropriate format to automatically generate a bibliography . The app synchronizes digital documents and folders with an iPad and sends references along with their PDFs via email , allowing individuals to share webpages and PDF files with the Papers user community . The Competition Competitors include a range of tools , some of which focus on reading and annotating PDF files ; others are more traditional in terms of managing citations for publications . With the acquisition of Papers , it may be helpful to look at the tools that have remained independent vs. those that are owned by other database vendors . The following selection of tools continue to remain independent of a major publisher or database vendor : Sente ( www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/site/SenteForMac.html ) , available for the Mac and iPad , is known for its clean interface and ease of PDF annotation . Targeted browsing lets users add references from many websites such as EBSCO host , JSTOR , and PubMed within Sente ; a second click downloads the PDF and adds it to your library . Quick Tags can help to organize references , easily adding fields to describe the resources downloaded . iAnnotate PDF ( www.branchfire.com/iannotate ) is an app for marking-up or making notations on PDF files on your iPad . Users can search , bookmark , add annotations , insert images , email , or open an image within another app . According to Dave Yearwood , "" iAnnotate responds well to many of the gestures that you have come to appreciate when using the iPad . Tap and hold , single and double tap , swipe , and drag , just to list a few . "" CiteULike ( www.citeulike.org ) is a free web-based social bookmarking and traditional bibliographic management tool for scientists and researchers who want to store , organize , share , and discover links to academic papers . By tagging papers they post , users build domain-specific ' folksonomies . ' As Kevin Emamy and Richard Cameron mentioned in their review of CiteULike for Ariadne ( 29 April 2007 ) , "" RSS feeds and Watchlists allow users to track tags and users' libraries that interest them , showing the latest additions to these chosen categories . "" Citavi ( www.citavi.com ) began in 1995 as LiteRat . Developed by Swiss Academic Software ( a Microsoft Certified Partner ) , the product has had a strong foothold within the German academic community . In 2003 , Citavi took its current shape in terms of features to support the entire research process , from searching for sources to finishing your paper . With the introduction of an English version , Cheryl LaGuardia noted in Library Journal ( March 2 , 2011 ) that the program "" is especially well-suited to inexperienced university students , since it guides them through the entire academic research process .... Citavi offers comprehensive online search and import options . Over 4,000 research databases and library catalogs can be searched from within Citavi . "" The free version of the software has a 100 reference limit ; Citavi Pro begins at $ 79 , though there are government , education , and not-for-profit discounts , plus alternative versions for teams . Adding Papers to the international publisher's lineup of tools to assist readers of their publications makes Springer competitive with ProQuest , which acquired RefWorks in 2008 and uses its COS Scholar Universe product to facilitate networking among individuals with common research interests ( with an eye toward future collaboration , creating new knowledge and generating new works for publication ) . Since 1999 , ISI / Thomson Reuters has acquired or developed three citation managers – EndNote , RefMan Reference Manager , and ProCite – though these software tools remain within the publishing and managing bibliographies space rather than online community development and collaboration . These reference managers , innovations in their time , have been mainstays within the academic library community , while two free reference managers , Mendeley and Zotero , have captured the imagination of students , happy with one-click captures and access via a web browser toolbar . Mendeley As Alison Hicks wrote this summer , "" Mendeley is a web / desktop / mobile tool used to manage the research process , including organizing , citing and collaborating . It builds on and combines traditional reference management tools such as Refworks or Endnote with academic social networking tools such as Linkedin or academia . edu to create a super category of productivity tools that is more in sync with today 's networked and collaborative research environment . "" Created in 2007 , the tool now has 2 million users with 313 million documents catalogued . Caveats : There is a 1G storage limit for a free account , and it does not manage book citations ( e.g. , WorldCat ) well . Zotero is simple , flexible , portable , and free . Today , it works with all browsers and platforms , syncs well , and sports multiple citation styles . Users add items to their Zotero library with a single click , organized and tagged as they like . Much can be automated and groups created or joined to share among colleagues . The Future Association with Springer is likely to give the Papers team additional resources to innovate . Concentrating on Lifve may allow Papers to catch up with the social network capabilities of the free , browser-based competitor , Mendeley . Projects for the near-term are likely to include further development of Papers for Windows and syncing ( between several Macs , several PCs , Macs and PCs , iOS , and Windows ) . According to Eric Merkel-Sobotta , executive vice president Corporate Communications at Springer , "" the Papers team does not have an Android version in development ... Technically , it 's more challenging than porting the Mac version to the iPhone . "" After enumerating other challenges , Merkel-Sobotta did note that "" everyone at Springer , including the Papers team , loves a challenge . "" Papers is expected to remain competitive at $ 15 per user , though institutional licensing is likely to expand , post-acquisition , with additional pay options . Other Mekentosj molecular biology apps ( e.g. , 4Peaks , EnzymeX , iRNAi , LabAssistant ) will not become part of the Springer family . These free apps have a new "" home , "" but the developers who worked on these products will be working on Papers , so users of these apps are not likely to see updates any time soon ."	5
1427	"Knowing When To Say When If you recall last Friday , we left you with a prescient market prediction .

Looks like we should have followed the law of opposites , which posits that one should always do the exact opposite of what they think they should do . You can see the inherent contradictions between these two laws . The answer : You do n't . And here 's the point . A new theory or new fangled idea always appears to be right , just until the moment it 's wrong . ~~~~~~ Advertisement ~~~~~~ What is the ETF Authority ?

What the next mania will be , we do n't know . That it 's coming is as certain as day after night . Tom Raum , AP Writer , on Saturday March 22nd , reminds us that the Federal Reserve "" ... is the only U.S. institution with the authority and ability to create money out of this air . "" That this is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution , Article I Section 8 , which gives Congress – not that Federal Reserve – the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof , does not receive mention . But that 's just an aside . "" -- slashed a key short-term interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point , to 2.25 percent . The cut was sixth since September . "" These steps followed moves to lend $ 100 billion in cash to banks and $ 200 billion in Treasury bonds to cash-strapped investment banks . The goal was to keep the financial system from seizing up . "" With the credit contraction calling into question the solvency of banks ... and the Federal Reserve throwing massive amounts of money back into the banking sector to counter act the crunch , traders did n't know whether to laugh or cry . So they did both . Knowing When To Say When Maybe the crisis has been averted . Or maybe it 's been postponed . But regardless , this massive money infusion is unhealthy . If you remember back to 2002 , the Alan Greenspan led Federal Reserve artificially lowered the rate of interest below the rate of inflation to soften the landing of the dot com bust that they 'd helped inflate . All the sham money went into housing and produced a sham housing boom . The boom was really just a Federal Reserve induced asset inflation . But now that housing prices are deflating , and that much of the debt that supported the sham boom prices is going bad ... the Federal Reserve is at it again – desperately trying to pump the bubble back up . Where the money will go this time may not be as fun . So far it seems to be showing up in prices at the grocery store , the gas pumps , and in your utility bill . Regardless of where the money goes , these repeated cycles of reflation are grotesquely unhealthy . For example , following the holidays Joe gained 10-pounds . He went on a diet , but , unfortunately , he only lost 5 of those pounds . Still five extra pounds are no big deal , right ? But the next year , the same thing happened . Now Joe's 10-pounds over weight . And the following year it happened again ... and on and on . Until after several more years Joe has morphed into a rotund and unrecognizable version of his old self . Joe's knees now hurt and his chest pounds when he walks up stairs . And when he fly 's on an airplane his weight causes those around him to be uncomfortable – both because he bulges into their space and because they must look at him up close . Little kids gawk and stare . And little old ladies look the other way in repulsion . All because Joe did n't know when to say when to the extra servings of mashed potatoes . So goes the U.S. economy ... it 's had more than enough binges upon cheap credit . But the Federal Reserve wants to keep dishing up more . For in their mind the pain of eating more is less than the pain of diet and exercise . Will the inflation Ponzi scheme continue or will a long Japanese deflation take over ? If we had our druthers we 'd choose neither . But that choice no longer exists . And even if it did , it 's not up to us ; it 's up to the fate of the gods to decide . Sincerely ,"	0
1131	"' Doctor Strange ' Review : Benedict Cumberbatch's Marvel Debut Casts a Spell The comic book Sorcerer Surpreme comes to the big screen – and his origin story is a psychedelic stunner ' Doctor Strange ' brings comics' Sorcerer Surpreme to the big screen – Peter Travers on why Benedict Cumberbatch makes this the best Marvel movie yet . ' Doctor Strange ' Review : Benedict Cumberbatch's Marvel Debut Casts a Spell More News What Robert Downey , Jr. is to Iron Man and Ryan Reynolds is to Deadpool – that 's what Benedict Cumberbatch is to Doctor Strange . By that I mean , he 's everything . The British actor , flashing an American accent eons away from the plummy tones of Sherlock or Hamlet , is the creative spark that ignites this bracing new entry in the Marvel cinematic universe . That 's no knock on the movie itself , which director Scott Derrickson – the horror guy from Deliver Us from Evil , Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose – has kicked up a notch with a visual dazzle and wit unseen around these parts since The Matrix and Inception . See it in 3-D IMAX , people , and you 're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year . And having Cumberbatch around really raises the bar on what 's possible in comic-book fantasy . Related From awards-worthy dramas and controversial history lessons to a new ' Star Wars , ' what you need to see Doctor Strange , the first in what looks to be a killer film franchise , is an origin story . And even if it feels carved out of the Marvel playbook of arrogant assholes who see the light ( read Tony Stark ) , Cumberbatch plays it fresh , funny and fierce . His Stephen Strange is a neurosurgeon with miracle hands and a grand ambition to match his gargantuan ego ; he wo n't even treat patients he thinks he ca n't cure . Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer , the ER doc who loves him , despite the fact that Strange thinks a romantic evening is inviting her to hear him deliver a lecture . Then , one dark night , Strange – texting while driving – crashes his Lamborghini Huracán , emerges with his hands mangled into useless digits and preps for a lifetime pity-party . As the comic book , created in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee points out , he finds salvation in the Eastern mysticism of Kathmandu , where he meets the Ancient One , played by Tilda Swinton in a role originally conceived as an Asian man . There have been protests , and there will be more , but Swinton – radiating otherworldly power – is a world-class mesmerizer . And cheers for the mystery Chiwetel Ejiofor brings to Mordo , one of the masters in the Ancient One's service . Just do n't call it a cult . Strange does . Bad move . Can our hero learn humility and the inner power to heal himself ? Can he bend and fold time into shapes with an out-of-body wizardry his hands can no longer provide ? You bet your ass . Cumberbatch , Swinton , and Ejiofer are not slumming at all here , and these top-of-the-line actors giving the blockbuster a riveting , resonant send-off , whooshed along by Michael Giacchino's propulsive score . Add Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius , the Ancient One's traitorous former disciple and Benedict Wong as Wong , the protector of the Ancient One's secret books . "" What , just one name , "" asks Strange sarcastically . "" Like Adele or Beyonce . "" Not like them at all , actually , something unique . Doctor Strange is similarly unique , deviating just enough from the cookie-cutter Marvel pattern to become its own living , breathing , thrilling thing – wait until you see his Cloak of Levitation , his encounter with the Dark Dimension , and the fight scene on the streets of New York that melts into a kaleidoscope of melting images scary enough to haunt your nightmares . Through it all , there 's Strange , a character that Cumberbatch catches in the fascinating act of inventing of himself as a new sorcerer supreme . Stick through the film's final credits and you 'll see a bonus scene that suggests Strange inching into the world of the Avengers . But for right now , Doctor Strange creates its own world .

1403	This card game contains 99 cards and follows the format of the original board game , focusing on specific problem or concerns of children . Like the original game , the card game is sure to help children communicate their feelings and develop insight into their problems . Full Description : The Talking , Feeling , and Doing Game - devised by Dr. Richard A. Gardner in 1968 and first published in 1973 - has enjoyed worldwide utilization as an extremely effective psychotherapeutic instrument . Most child therapist 's consider it an indispensable part of their playroom equipment . With a high degree of predictability , the game will engage the most resistant and inhibited children into meaningful psychotherapeutic endeavors . The game routinely facilitates disclosures often not otherwise obtainable . Further , the material elicited by the game serve as points of departure for meaningful psychotherapeutic interchanges . The game has proved helpful for shortening the psychotherapeutic process because quickly and predictably provides the therapist with information about the child's underlying psychological processes . Information that might have taken weeks or even months to elicit may even be obtained during the first few sessions . The game was originally designed to enable inhibited children to reveal themselves , but even children who are more freely engaged in direct discussion and insight-oriented therapy will find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience . Sales of the game are restricted to qualified mental health professionals . Buyers must hold at least a Masters Degree in psychology , counseling , social work or a related field , and should have received appropriate clinical training in working with children or adolescents . Please include license number or the name of your graduate school , degree , and year graduated as part of the order .	2

' A lot of people have said that , but you know in doing it I did focus it quite a lot - I just took off a couple of the things that might have made it really difficult to listen to , you know , really really aggressive tracks engineered to sound horrible stuck in the middle of a nice album . ' What kind of person do you think it will appeal to ? ' I suppose people like me , but I do n't know what ... I was trying to make an album that I would buy , so just trying to put all the things that I like in it . You know , I think there must be a lot of people who are both into club stuff and more song-based stuff but not divided up . I think you get a lot of music that is either for playing in clubs or , what everyone goes on about as a chill-out , you know , post club music ... I do n't know , I guess I was just trying to put different elements of all sorts of things that I like into one album . Not that I suppose it 's got ... I 'm going around in circles actually ... but you know what I mean , do n't you ? I have n't consciously thought about who will be buying it , but I sort of do think that it 's a principle that if you make something that you yourself would buy then at least it 's going to be a coherent thing . You know , like ... ' I think we 're gonna need some faster tracks ' ... so you purposely do some faster tracks , or ... ' I think we need a track that sounds like ... that ' ... I think then you get into problems . I was making it because ... partly I 've always wanted to make an album where I 've played everything on it and I 've recorded it all on analogue 24 track , it 's just kind of ideas I 've had that I 've been thinking about for a long time that , in principle , I thought might work like , you know , not using a computer to control the sampler to playing all the samples manually just onto tape . It 's a nice idea and for years I 've been thinking it would be nice if we could get around to that , and finally I got the chance to try a lot of things out , you know the slinky reverb which we used loads in the mixing . Things like that track , Needles , we made all the drum sounds by just dropping a stylus onto the record and blowing on it and stuff . So there were lots of ideas like that I just wanted to ... ' Where do you get ideas like that ? ' I 've just always thought that when you first put the needle on the record that it 's just a really good bass drum sound , and so I 've always thought that one day I must sample that .

1429	A How-To Guide for Purchasing Salvage Vehicles in Colorado Salvage yards are locations where vehicles that are worn out because of usage , cars that are no longer usable on the road , or vehicles that have been marked salvage by the state are kept . In addition , salvage yards in Colorado and other states are a destination for cars which have been seized by the state , an insurance company , or a financier . These institutions may repossess a vehicle from its owner because the owner defaulted on tax payments . Salvage yards may also house cars which have been recovered from crime scenes or have been found stolen . It may be difficult for the institutions that have seized the cars to maintain and store these vehicles because storing cars is an expensive endeavor . Said institutions may find it easier to sell off these cars to salvage yards in Colorado and other states to save costs . Therefore , salvage yards also house relatively new cars , which are brought to the site by these companies to be sold to new buyers for a cheaper price . The problem with newer salvage cars may be that their bumper is broken or their tail lights are smashed because of dangerous driving or from mishandling . There are numerous salvage yards in Colorado , and each of these yards also hosts their own website . If a potential buyer needs to locate salvage yards in Colorado , one simply needs to consult the yellow pages or go online and search for the salvage yard closest to one's vicinity . If one is interested in buying a car from a salvage yard in Colorado , one should follow a few steps . Firstly , one needs to register online by carefully choosing a salvage yard website and become a member of that online community . Secondly , after registration , which can be done online for a minimum fee , one will see a number of cars in the listing on the website . Each car listing will include numerous photographs taken from various angles of a specific car , and all other relevant information about the salvage car is provided to the user in a friendly way , if the site is well made . Thirdly , one needs to select which car he or she is interested in before one proceeds to place a bid for the car . Before one bids on the car of choice , one must ensure communication with the dealer by personally speaking with them at the salvage yard to determine exactly what is wrong with the specific car . If one is in the vicinity of the salvage yard , it is advisable to visit the yard firsthand along with an expert mechanic to find out what the car is missing . After this examination , the car can be purchased , and then the search for the missing spare part begins . The user can post a buying requirement at any of the salvage yards in Colorado via a website where the user is registered . This parts request sends information to all the warehouses in contact with the car dealer , and it is a much easier method for the user to locate the part , which can then be purchased for a reasonable price .	7
436	"Most liaison psychiatry posts are now managed and administered by a mental health trust . The consultant is therefore likely to be employed by the mental health trust although many people believe this is not an optimum arrangement . There is usually a Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) between the mental health trust and the acute general hospital trust for the provision of a liaison psychiatry service . In a few hospitals the liaison psychiatry service forms part of the acute general hospital trust and is managed by that organisation . The funding arrangements should be clarified . If the liaison psychiatry service forms part of a Service Level Agreement it should be established what budget the acute trust makes for the service and what level of provision is agreed . Ideally the budget for the liaison psychiatry service should be identified and the consultant should have considerable influence in determining how this is deployed . The joint report on "" The psychological care of medical patients "" ( RCP and RCPsych , 1995 ) recommended that funding for a liaison psychiatry service should come from a medical and surgical budget but should be managed within a mental health service . There should be one manager who has direct responsibility for the service , who works with the liaison psychiatry consultant and who reports to the relevant Chief Executive . After you have started your post it is helpful to arrange business meetings every four to six weeks with managers from both the acute ( general medical ) and community trust ( psychiatry ) . These meetings can be extremely helpful in terms of resolving issues between the general hospital and psychiatry . They can also be helpful in terms of future expansion of the service . Facilities Accommodation is a vital component of the service and should be located in a convenient position within the main general hospital where the service is provided . A consultant's office is essential . This should be identified and shown to the consultant before taking up the appointment . It is also essential that there is secretarial and administrative support with appropriate office accommodation and space for filing and record keeping . One secretary should be identified to provide secretarial support to the consultant . It should be explicitly stated in the job description which consultant has clinical responsibilities if a patient needs to be admitted to a psychiatric ward . Likewise , if a patient is admitted to a medical ward , the medical responsibility for that patient should be clearly stated . If the post holder is to retain medical responsibility for patients admitted to psychiatric services , the location of the beds should be identified and the number specified although it is likely that the full bed complement will not always be taken up . An acute adult psychiatry admission ward is often not ideal for the management of patients with combined medical and psychiatric problems but very few services have access to a special ward devoted to this type of patient . In many cases it is preferable to manage patients with physical and psychiatric co-morbidity on a medical ward , ideally a side room , with special psychiatric nursing ( RMN status ) provided for as long as is required . In these circumstances the funding for the RMN should be clarified . It is usual practice for this to come from the budget of the medical division from which the patient has been referred . If the liaison psychiatrist has no access to in-patient beds there must be an agreement with psychiatric colleagues to admit patients who require in-patient care to the relevant catchment area psychiatric ward . The medical responsibility of patients in the Accident & Emergency Department should be clearly established and stated in the job description . The position of patients seen by psychiatric nurses , but not by psychiatric junior staff , should be explicitly stated ."	9
1470	"Though the forecast for the economy is starting to improve , the plight of recession-weary businesses is still difficult . If you 're struggling to find a way to motivate your employees when offering money is n't an option , here 's some advice for you : Focus on becoming a great leader . There are few things your employees will appreciate more . By Charles Garcia After months of economic tough times , a glimmer of light is starting to appear at the end of the proverbial tunnel . Rather than being harbingers of doom , economic news stories are now starting to look ever so slightly brighter . This improved economic forecast will likely have many company leaders looking for ways to motivate their employees to keep up the hard work necessary for navigating their companies into calmer waters . Unfortunately , despite the recent economic uptick , most company leaders still ca n't offer what they view as their greatest motivational bargaining chip with their employees – the almighty dollar . Fear not . Money is n't the only way to rally your troops and boost morale during this crucial time . In fact , positive , strong leadership can often garner far greater results than offering money or other perks ever could . Too often businesses assume that offering more money is the only way to motivate employees . The reality is that employees value having strong leaders , who motivate them to do their best , just as much if not more . And there 's no greater defense against a tough economy than a workforce motivated to do their absolute best . There 's never been a more appropriate time for the rest of us to look to great leaders for inspiration . The lessons that can be learned from the White House Fellows mentors are universal and absolutely invaluable to any business leader smart enough to heed them . Remember , all the money in the world wo n't keep a hardworking but unhappy employee with your company . But follow the leadership principles that help you better motivate and encourage that employee and she will be just as invested in making your company a success as you are . Since leaving his Fellowship , Gallagher has been using that tool daily in his role as Director for the War of Ideas and Strategic Communications at the National Security Council's Office of Iraq and Afghanistan Affairs . Sure , you want your employees to stay focused on moving your company forward , and you might feel like it 's important to keep everyone's noses ( including your own ! ) to the grindstone right now , but it 's also summer time . There are barbecues and baseball games to attend , warm days to be spent at the park or by the pool , and much-earned vacation time waiting to be used ! Encourage your employees to spend time with their families , whether it results from taking an afternoon off or going on a week-long vacation . Doing so will help them power up for the difficult work to come . And remember to give yourself the same respect ! THE STORY BEHIND THE LESSON : Doris Kearns Goodwin At 6 : 00 a.m. on a cold January morning in 1973 , presidential historian , Pulitzer Prize-winning author , and NBC news analyst Doris Kearns Goodwin ( WHF 67-68 ) received a call from former President Lyndon B. Johnson , with whom she had become a trusted confidante while working on his memoirs . "" To commit yourself to just one of those spheres without the others is to leave open an older age filled with sadness , because once the work is gone , you have nothing left – no hobbies , no sports , "" Goodwin said . "" Your family may love you , but they are not in the center of your life as they might have been had you paid attention to them all the way through . And I always argue that the ability to relax and replenish your energy is absolutely essential . "" Mitchell Reiss ( WHF 88-89 ) has seen firsthand that a leader's focus on his or her people is an incredibly powerful tool . He learned that valuable lesson during his White House Fellowship from his principal , the National Security Advisor and former Secretary of State and former White House Fellow Colin Powell . After learning the value of quality communication from her Fellowship principal , U.S. Treasury Secretary William "" Bill "" Miller , Marsha "" Marty "" Evans ( WHF 79-80 ) carried on the tradition in her work with the Navy . Cesar Aristeiguieta ( WHF 02-03 ) was assigned to work with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson during his Fellowship . It was n't long before the young White House Fellow noticed an important leadership trait in his principal that he hoped to nurture in himself : Secretary Thompson was an outstanding listener . After listening to them for almost an hour , Aristeiguieta recalls that Thompson responded with the following : "" ' I 've heard you . I understand your concerns . Now I need you to tell me how you , as an industry , can help address this public health issue . ' Then he just sat back and listened again . Pretty soon they were talking about how they could step up and participate without being forced into it – how they could begin putting more healthy food choices on their menus and those kinds of things – and by the end of the meeting the tone had changed dramatically . They were n't attacking the secretary anymore . They were actually pleased , and they felt that they were part of the dialogue , and in fact , they probably went further than the secretary really expected them to go at that point . LEADERSHIP LESSON # 7 : Be a problem solver . Several years ago I returned from a business trip to find that my assistant had hung a gigantic fifteen-foot-long wooden sign above his office door . The sign reads , "" Do n't Bring Me Problems . Bring Me Solutions . "" In 1975 , President Gerald Ford chose former White House Fellow Julia Vadala Taft ( WHF 70-71 ) to direct the resettlement of refugees from Vietnam , Cambodia , and Laos after the collapse of Saigon . The resettlement program brought 131,000 refugees to the U.S. in six months . There was no template and no time plan . The work just had to get done , and Taft directed it all with humor , grace , and a backbone of steel . During her career as a public servant , Taft helped reshape the Refugee Act of 1980 , and helped organize relief for the people of war-torn and disaster-ridden countries throughout the world , including 25 million flood victims left homeless in Bangladesh , displaced people in Burundi , victims of a poison gas incident in Cameroon , the people of the Sahel and Ethiopia who were suffering from a widespread famine after a locust plague , and 800,000 refugees driven from Kosovo . When she died from colon cancer in 2008 , former White House Fellow and longtime friend Colin Powell was quoted in the New York Times obituary section as saying that Julia Taft "" was an image of American openness and generosity . Her professional life was committed to people trying to get by on a dollar a day , those who are hungry , without clean water , without medicine , without homes . "" Taft's obituary in the Washington Post on March 19 stated , "" It was her ability to bring order to chaos – plus her willingness to get on a plane , helicopter , jeep , or riverboat to go almost anywhere that enabled her to make a difference . Whether in the White House , a refugee camp , or meeting with government and [ nongovernmental organization ] officials , she knew how to get people moving . "" LEADERSHIP LESSON # 8 : Lead through experience and competence , not through title or position . For more than four decades , by pairing young people with established leaders , the White House Fellows program has given hundreds of young Americans the tools , experiences , and mentors necessary for them to become confident , well-prepared problem solvers and leaders . The ability to help propelled Arthur "" Gene "" Dewey ( WHF 68-69 ) from his post as assistant to a high-ranking military officer into a White House Fellowship at the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . Dewey's principal at USAID , Bill Gaud , put him right to work . He sent Dewey to Nigeria where USAID was spending a great deal of money supporting those caught up in the Nigerian-Biafran war , and Gaud wanted to make sure all of the supplies were getting through . Dewey found that the Nigerian Air Force was shooting down relief planes during the night airlifts , and so he hatched a plan to get food in by using a combination of sealift and riverboats . He presented the idea to Clyde Ferguson , President Nixon's special representative for Nigeria-Biafra at the State Department . Ferguson asked him to come work for him for a couple of weeks on what was dubbed the Cross River Scheme . With no previous experience coordinating large-scale relief efforts , Dewey set about the task of making the project safer and more efficient . As the efforts to bring relief to the people of Biafra – just over 3 million people fell under the plan – continued , Dewey became more involved in the diplomacy required to set up a formal , enduring procedure for getting food and other supplies to the Biafrans . Unfortunately , the Biafran leader , Governor Ojukwu , refused to accept the plan even though it was clearly designed to benefit his people . Ferguson and Dewey were heartbroken . Then Dewey had a fateful meeting with an initially very negative Catholic bishop on the island . The bishop complained that the U.S. was not doing enough to help the Biafrans . Dewey informed him that Ojukwu was the one holding up the agreement while his people suffered . He then explained the Cross River plan to the bishop , whose attitude gradually softened . The conversation closed with the bishop promising that when Ojukwu came to confession later that week , he would have a talk with him and get him to change his mind . Dewey says that the greatest leadership lesson he learned from his White House Fellowship was the necessity of being prepared and becoming an expert . His title as a White House Fellow meant virtually nothing as he designed and tried to execute the Cross River plan in Nigeria . What counted were his expertise and his attitude . Just because the economy has been slow and businesses have experienced set-backs , does not mean the fundamentals of leadership need to change . The leadership qualities espoused by mentors in the White House Fellows program translate perfectly to the workplaces and the government offices of 2009 America . Decide today to start motivating your employees by being the best leader you can be and you 'll all go far , despite the bad economy . # # # Oakland Athletics ( Oakland Athletics ) , is a home located in Oakland , California , United States Major League Baseball team , belonging to the American League West .
