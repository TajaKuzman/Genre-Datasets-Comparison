9,"Melissa is added to teas and preparations for melancholy, restlessness, migraines and to strengthen the spirit. It also works against the herpes virus on the lips. Brings happy dreams <p/> Melissa (Melissa oficinalis) has been used medicinally for more than two millennia. It has been used to treat heart and stomach problems and has been praised for its beneficial effect on the digestive tract. It was generally believed to stimulate digestion, strengthen the heart, nerves and spirit, banish fear and anxiety and provide happy dreams. <p/> Relieves confusion <p/> Both traditional and rational or scientific medicine now advise the use of lemon balm preparations for melancholy, tension, restlessness and confusion. The action of lemon balm is described as sedative and tranquilising. It has been shown to be particularly soothing in nervous disorders, migraine and nervous heart problems. <p/> Relieves digestion <p/> Melissa tea and other preparations are used to treat digestive disorders such as stomach cramps, constipation and lack of appetite. The tea is prepared as an infusion: two teaspoons of the mixture is poured over a cup of boiling water, covered and strained after ten minutes. Drink several times a day. The best tea is made from fresh leaves, so make the most of the summer time when they are abundant in your home garden. This tea, unlike mint (Metha pipperita), can be drunk continuously over a long period of time without worry, as it does not cause any undesirable effects. <p/> For children, the elderly and pregnant women <p/> It is very healthy and also tasty for children and the elderly. It also helps with vomiting in pregnant women and has a beneficial effect on painful or weak menstruation. <p/> Against herpes <p/> External use of Melissa preparations is recommended for herpes on the lips. Melissa has the power to kill herpes and other types of viruses, inhibit inflammation and destroy microbes. <p/> Tea for the forgetful <p/> If you are constantly forgetting things, I suggest a tea mixture of lemon balm and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to boost your memory: a teaspoon of lemon balm and a teaspoon of rosemary flowers are steeped in half a litre of water, covered and left to steep for ten minutes. The treatment should last for three months - drink the tea three times a day for ten days a month, one cup at a time. <p/> Melissa bath <p/> For a soothing and melancholy bath, make an infusion of two handfuls of lemon balm with a litre of water, cover and leave to steep for fifteen minutes.

23,"Beans <p/> Related <p/> Superfood <p/> Historically, beans have actually been highly valued, but then important high-class chosen ones, such as Catherine de Medici, decided that beans were a peasant food that was not elegant and special enough for their stomachs. They replaced it with the trend of processed food, which is still not rooted today. <p/> Meat of the rich <p/> Hence the now-famous saying that beans are the poor man's meat, which is no longer true since experts believe that animal protein causes many diseases. For a while, beans were accused of not having as complete a protein composition as meat. It is true that it lacks two amino acids, but it is not difficult to compensate for them if beans are combined with foods that contain them, such as cereals. So you can pour bean sauce over couscous, and more recent findings show that it is not even necessary to consume this combination in the same meal - it is enough to consume all the amino acids in the same day. <p/> (Not) sophisticated? <p/> The reputation of beans as not being a sophisticated food is certainly due to the problems they occasionally cause. Many argue that if legumes are consumed regularly and in small quantities, they disappear. You may also find some of the natural recipes suitable. Look for dried kombu seaweed in health food shops. Add them to the water in which you soak the beans. The algae will not affect the taste of the beans and will almost disintegrate during cooking. Besides, there is nothing wrong with algae particles floating around on the plate. The more familiar bay leaf should have a similar effect, and some people recommend chewing half a teaspoon of aniseed immediately after a meal or at the onset of flatulence. <p/> Easy to prepare <p/> Although there are many types of beans, all of them, from broad beans to white or black beans, cook in a very similar way, just adjust the time to the size of the bean. Always remove any unusually shaped, discoloured or broken beans first. There must also be no holes, however small, in the beans, as they are invisible 'inhabitants' to our eyes. <p/> This will not happen if the beans are stored in a well-sealed ceramic or glass container. It can wait for a year, but do not mix old and new stocks, as the beans will then cook for different lengths of time. Salt, lemon juice, vinegar, wine or tomatoes should not be added before the end of cooking as they slow down the softening of the beans. <p/> Most IN <p/> Due to their easier digestibility, mung beans and adzuki beans have recently become the most popular types. Due to their smaller size, they only need to be soaked for a few hours and cooked for one hour. Season with turmeric, basil, thyme or coriander. Adzuki is known as the sweetest and least 'beany' type of bean. In Japan, where it is said to be native, it is used to make milk and desserts. Most often, the beans and sugar are boiled into a filling. <p/> Both types of bean can be ground into flour. They are highly recommended in Chinese medicine for women, especially during menstruation and lactation, and are said to strengthen the bladder and kidneys and to give courage and energy. <p/> Both types of beans can be sprouted, but mung beans are best known in this form: their sprouts are called soya beans. Interestingly, the sprouts contain vitamin C, which beans do not. To produce your own, soak the beans overnight and then place them in a suitable container in a warm, dark but airy place, making sure they are kept wet at all times. It is not recommended to eat the sprouts raw, so fry them in coconut fat and season them with soy sauce. According to Chinese medicine, mung beans are supposed to cool and detoxify the body, and to relieve inflammation. <p/> The basis of a healthy diet <p/> You can play around with soups, sauces, stews, spreads, purees and salads, but don't forget the spices. You can always add parsley, savory, sage or marjoram to beans. Add a little vinegar to your dishes to make them even tastier. In the end, beans will really prove to you that even a healthy dish can be tasty and cheap. <p/> VIVIN TIP <p/> Superfood <p/> If you soak beans in cold water and cook them very slowly, they retain virtually all their nutritional value. Beans contain zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, manganese and selenium, as well as B vitamins. Folate lowers levels of homocysteine, the build-up of which in the walls of blood vessels causes the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibre from beans helps to eliminate bad cholesterol from the body. Beans even contain substances that prevent certain cancers. It has a good effect on blood sugar due to its low glycaemic index and is also very beneficial for people with high blood pressure (with the exception of canned beans). And it can be eaten even if you are constipated. In addition, harmful substances from the environment do not get further than the pod.",Instruction,dev

53,"VIRUSES IN CHILDREN <p/> Winter time and cold temperatures are the perfect opportunity for some viruses to spread quickly. These include viruses that cause gastrointestinal infections. The most common causes of intestinal infections in childhood are rotaviruses. Intestinal infection is manifested by diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, cramps and fever. <p/> CAUSERS <p/> The most common causes of diarrhoea in childhood are viruses, rotaviruses being the most common. Rotavirus infections occur every year, all year round, although more people are usually ill during the cold months. During these months, rotaviruses cause infection mainly in children up to 2 years of age.Entericadenoviruses cause diarrhoea and fever lasting for several days, with or without vomiting, in infants and young children, and may be accompanied by signs of a common cold. Of the bacterial agents, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are the most common, and diarrhoea can also be caused by parasites. <p/> SYMPTOMS <p/> The typical clinical picture of a child with a gastrointestinal tract infection is defecation and vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, headache and muscle pain. The problems last for a day or two. A child with a gastrointestinal infection, vomiting and diarrhoea loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes. Fluid loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. <p/> Signs of dehydration include: thirst, dry mouth, bright red lips, sore eyes, less urination. Then the child may become markedly tired or irritable, breathing is deep and rapid, as is the heart rate. In a dehydrated baby, the large lobe of the head drops, the urine may be darker and smaller in volume, the baby becomes more drowsy or irritable. Such a condition definitely requires immediate medical attention. <p/> TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION <p/> Infection spreads easily between children because even a small number of viruses are enough to make a person infected and ill. Viruses are transmitted by contact with an infected person, by touching toys or surfaces that have viruses on them, or by eating contaminated food or drink. When a child is ill, viruses are shed in high concentrations in the faeces for a few days to 14 days, or longer. During this time, apparently healthy children are infectious to the surrounding area. <p/> TREATMENT <p/> Fluid and electrolyte replacement is very important in gastrointestinal viral infections. The child should drink plenty of fluids (tea, isotonic drinks, soups, etc.) several times a day, in small amounts, and fizzy drinks are discouraged. Various oral rehydration solutions are also available in pharmacies. If the child is breastfed, breastfeeding should be continued. As this is a viral and not a bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, the infection should not be treated with antibiotics. <p/> WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR <p/> A child with an intestinal infection loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhoea. This loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Therefore, insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. A doctor should be seen if the condition does not improve after two days.A doctor's visit is also necessary for dehydration. <p/> PREVENTING TRANSMISSION <p/> Frequent and correct hand washing is very important. In particular after using the toilet or changing nappies, and before preparing food and before eating, hand washing should be regular and thorough. Foods eaten without pre-cooking should be thoroughly cleaned with hygienic water. Children attending kindergarten or school should return to the collective at least 24 hours after the cessation of diarrhoea or vomiting, preferably after three days. <p/> DOES CEPIVO exist? <p/> There is a vaccine against rotavirus infection. It is not given by injection, but is injected into the mouth. Two or three doses are needed, with at least 4 weeks between each dose. It is intended for young children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. There are insufficient data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in older children. Research to date has shown that protection against rotavirus infection by vaccination lasts for at least 2 years.",Information/Explanation,dev

Sometimes it is also a way for some people to earn a living and make our lives better. <p/> Chapter 1 gives a brief history of stamps with railway motifs. This is followed by images of stamps from Europe and the rest of the world. The stamps of the former Yugoslavia and Slovenian stamps after 1991 are presented in detail. All the locomotives on the stamps are additionally described, and I have added to the stamps their philatelic and catalogue value. Special mention is made of some of the steam locomotives of the Slovenian Railways (SŽ) and the Ocean locomotive, with an account of important events in Maribor during the construction of the Vienna-Trieste line. The chapter concludes with a selection of some famous steam locomotives of my choice. <p/> Chapter 2, after a brief introduction, presents in detail Honegger's composition Pacific 231. The composition is interesting because its origin is linked to a mistake made by the composer. This is followed by a short presentation of some of the Pacific series locomotives from France and the rest of the world. <p/> The third chapter shows the link between railways and poetry, or rather the influence of railways on the creation of 'railway' poems. The poems selected are Prešeren's On the Railway Road and Župančič's By Train. This is followed by a description of the locomotives that may have pulled the train that Župančič rode through Gorenjska on his way to Paris. Here again, the content of Župančič's poem does not correspond to the situation on the railway at the time of its composition in 1905. <p/> The chapter on railways and painting, after an introduction showing some famous paintings of railways, is dedicated to the pioneer of the expert treatment of the history of railways in Slovenia and the man most responsible for the establishment of the museum collection and the Railway Museum in Ljubljana. This is the academic painter Stane Kumar. It also describes where overconfidence in oneself, underestimating others and ignoring historical and professional facts in the name of artistic freedom can lead. This is exactly what happened to Stane Kumar. <p/> The last chapter describes the Bohinj railway, its history, important buildings, the landscape and people along it, and two famous locomotives from the past. <p/> An appendix explains some of the philatelic and railway terms that appear in the book. The wheel arrangements of steam locomotives from all over the world are thoroughly explained. A schematic of a steam locomotive and a data table of all the locomotives in the book are also added.

And they have many other advantages! <p/> 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution (Image source: sxc.hu) <p/> Coworking is a great solution for young businesses,... <p/> ... because you can separate work and family more easily. <p/> Many of today's very successful entrepreneurs have started their businesses in their own homes, whether in a dusty basement or in their living room. The fact is that young entrepreneurs start out with very limited funds, so renting their own office space is usually too expensive for them. <p/> This is why renting office space in a so-called coworking office, which is especially suitable for young companies with few team members, comes into play. These offices are much more affordable than traditional offices and allow the entrepreneur to easily separate home and office space. <p/> ... because you can build a real network of friends. <p/> Coworking offices bring together several entrepreneurial teams from very different business areas in one place. By renting office space in a coworking office, you will automatically become a member of the community and you will build a real network of friends. In this way, you will spread the word about your company and make new good friends. <p/> ... because doing business can be much faster and easier. <p/> Doing business in a coworking office is not only interesting and fun, it can also be much faster and easier. Need a programmer, a designer, an accountant? Don't worry, you'll probably find one in the next room, but if you can't find one, ask the other members of the coworking office for their contact numbers and recommendations, as they've probably used the services before. <p/> ... because working in an office is much more comfortable than working in a nearby pub. <p/> Laptops and almost unlimited access to the internet allow many entrepreneurs to work from different locations. One option that many people with space problems use is to work in a café with a cup of coffee or tea. The problem arises if the owners of the café do not approve of this and the entrepreneur has to leave the place... and let's not even waste words on the effectiveness of such work. <p/> You may be comfortable working from home, but your business partners or potential clients will be much more impressed if you meet them in a tidy office instead of in a room that is also your bedroom or kitchen. Prove to your clients and business partners that you are a serious person who does your job professionally.",Promotion,dev
74,"Even today - despite the strong influence of school and environment - what Jernej Pavlin wrote more than sixty years ago at the beginning of his story about today's Godovnjak is true: ""What children will ever be like depends most on their upbringing in the home. ""He adds, ""Holy parents sometimes have holy children. ""She is thinking of Brigitta of Sweden, the mystical wife and great saint whose daughter was St Catherine of Sweden, or Karin, whom the Church remembers today. <p/> Karin was the fourth of Brigitta's eight children. She was born in 1331 or 1332. She was put into a convent early on to be brought up. At her father's request, she married a pious nobleman when she was only fourteen. The young couple decided to imitate the virginal marriage of the Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph. Catherine began to dress simply and without excessive jewellery. Her example was imitated by many young ladies, her friends. Her mother, Brigitta, went to Rome after her husband's death and lived a pious life there. Catherine's desire for Rome was also aroused. Her husband defended her at first, but finally gave her permission. Because of his illness, he was unable to accompany her. She came to Rome in 1349, when she was eighteen. She was happy to embrace her mother again. Soon, however, she felt very homesick and was about to return home. At her mother's request, she declared that she was ready to leave everything and stay in Rome for Christ's sake, but she soon came to despise Rome outright and asked her mother's permission to return to Sweden after all. Brigitta considered her daughter's wish a dangerous temptation, and she began to pray. Christ appeared to her and said, ""Tell your daughter that she is already a widow. Convince her to stay. I will take care of her. ""After a long time, Catherine found inner peace. Her mother's spiritual director also guided her, and under his guidance she progressed in virtue because she was obedient to him in everything. She made several pilgrimages with her mother, including one to the Holy Land in 1372. They both had a kind of monastic life, in which prayer, work, rest and charity were interspersed. Her mother Brigitta, in a vision, was ordered to found a new order with its first monastery in Vadstena, Sweden, as early as 1346. She also drew up the rules of the order, which is called the Order of Brigitta or the Order of the Saviour, but it was not until her daughter Catherine that her idea could be realised. <p/> Shortly after her return from the Holy Land, her mother died in Rome on 23 July 1373. According to her will, Catherine transported her body to Sweden, where it was solemnly buried in the monastery church in Vadstena. The nuns of this monastery lived according to the rules of her mother and elected Catherine as superior. But after only a year, she travelled to Rome to seek the leadership of the Catholic Church to have Brigitta declared a saint. She spent five years gathering the necessary material, then returned to Vadstena, where the bishop confirmed her as superior, and she began to prepare for her death: she died on 24 March 1381. Her canonization was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, and her mother Brigitta was declared a saint in 1391.",Information/Explanation,dev

82,"The efficient use of condensing heat is influenced by a number of factors, the main ones being the hydraulic integration of the condensing boiler into the heating system and the temperature of the return water from the heating system. <p/> In low energy houses (NEH) and passive houses (PH), the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems are upgraded with solar systems. When designing solar systems, it is important to bear in mind that modern individual components are not a guarantee of good system performance. It is more important that the components are coordinated with each other and optimally integrated into the domestic heating and hot water system. <p/> Today, most houses have a habitable attic, and there is also intensive construction of attic dwellings. However, many loft dwellers dread the summer. It is unbearably hot in their apartments on summer nights. When building a new or adapted attic, you should also ask about the properties of insulation and other materials. This will save not only sleepless nights, but also later expenditure on ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which are not needed if the roof is properly and sufficiently insulated. <p/> The eco-material label is used to describe a product that is characterised by its ability to minimise the impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. In the case of thermal insulation materials, from the point of view of the user, a division between traditional materials and ecological or alternative materials has become established in practice. This division can be partly disputed, since when choosing any insulation material, one must take into account its good qualities, while at the same time taking into account its disadvantages. <p/> Photovoltaic modules, made up of cells connected in series, convert solar energy directly into direct current. The sun's rays fall on the surface of the solar cells and the sun's radiant primary energy is converted into electricity. The transformation is direct, with no intermediate transformation into thermal and mechanical energy. The incident light on the crystal lattice of the selected substance releases an electric charge. In radiation, light quanta - photons - strike the faceplate of the semiconductor and are absorbed. This releases electron pairs, which remain separated due to the internal electric field and thus generate an electric voltage. <p/> The use of geothermal energy (heat from the earth) as a source of energy which, in terms of the quantity of resources, meets the criterion of sustainability, does not increase global radiation due to CO2 emissions when harnessed, and can therefore be considered as a renewable source of energy.",Information/Explanation,dev

120,"Rayo Vallecano 2-3 Real Madrid <p/> Real Madrid won three more points at the Vallecas Stadium in a match in which they were already 0-3 up, but then things got complicated when Rayo Vallecano reduced the score from two 11th-minute penalty corners in just two minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo put Real Madrid in front in the third minute after a brilliant solo effort, and Benzema then extended the advantage in the first half when he scored with a header. The second half started in the same way as the first, with Ronaldo, the current top scorer in La Liga, hitting the net again after just four minutes of play. As with Benzema's goal, Bale was the assistant for Ronaldo's second goal, adding two more assists to his tally against Sevilla. After Real's third goal, however, everything turned upside down for Real, as the hosts had two penalty corners in just two minutes, both of which were successfully converted by Viera. Real Madrid then regained control of the game and successfully brought the match to a close, with the players already starting to think about Tuesday's game against Juventus. <p/> Real Madrid visited the Vallecas stadium with fresh memories of the big win against Sevilla three days ago at the Bernabeu and the good second half performance at the Camp Nou the week before. The start of the match did not point to an exciting ending. Already in the third minute, when Cristiano Ronaldo launched a counter-attack, he passed it to Luka Modric, who gave the ball back to him with a beautiful pass, and then Cristiano Ronaldo first played brilliantly between the legs of the last defender Rayo, and in the final minute, face-to-face, he coolly matted the home goalkeeper Martinez with a shot into the bottom far corner to put Real in the lead. A super goal from the Portuguese, showing how in great shape he and Carlo Ancelotti's team are. Real doubled their advantage in the 31st minute when Karim Benzema headed home after a precise cross from the right by Gareth Bale. It was the Welshman's third assist in the last two games and the Frenchman's third goal in four days. The visitors gave the home side a real lesson in finishing, although the Whites could have gone further ahead after the first half after Real had two more good chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tried a volley in the 44th minute after a pass from Di Maria but his shot went wide of the post, while Carvajal's header was also just missed by inches by the Ruben goalkeeper. <p/> The second half, in which Illarra replaced Xabi Alonso, who is making his comeback from a long-term injury, continued in the same way as the first, with a Real Madrid goal. In the fourth minute of the second half, Bale was at it again, winning the ball on the right, breaking into the middle and passing to Ronaldo, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 3-0. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's 13th goal in La Liga this season, making him the top scorer in the Spanish championship. After a big lead for Carlo Ancelotti's charges, everything looked like a peaceful ending, but the hosts came completely close just two minutes apart. After clumsy interventions from Pepe and Marcelo, head referee Alfonso Alvarez Iquierdo twice pointed to the harshest penalty. Jonathan Viera was the better of the two in his duel with goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The home team gained confidence after scoring twice, and it was Diego Lopez who had to prove his worth in the 65th minute when he masterfully stopped a shot by Alberto Bueno. The hosts chased the equaliser until the end of the match, and on the other side Real had a couple of chances to score their fourth goal of the game, including two more attempts from Ronaldo that were saved by the Raya goalkeeper, but the score remained 2-3 and Real's ninth victory in the Spanish championship this season.",News,dev

133,"JEDRO: The sum of two insurance benefits from two insurance contracts cannot be taken into account because each of the insurance contracts constitutes an independent factual and legal basis for the dispute. As none of the amounts claimed exceeds the audit threshold, no audit is admissible. <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <p/> REFERENCE: The applicant claimed payment of insurance benefits under two insurance contracts. He claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the supplementary accident insurance, taken out at the same time as the compulsory motor insurance, and SIT 955 603 under the collective accident insurance. Thus, by his primary claim, he claimed payment of SIT 1 655 603, and by his subordinate claim he claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the first contract and EUR 5 356 under the second contract, in which the sum insured was denominated in DEM. The Court of First Instance ruled that the defendant must pay the plaintiff SIT 170 000, dismissed the primary claim in excess and further ruled on the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Second Instance allowed the applicant's appeal only in part by modifying the costs order, but otherwise dismissed it and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance. <p/> The review was delivered to the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and served on the defendant, who did not reply. <p/> The review is not allowed. <p/> According to Article 367(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 73/2007 ZPP - UPB3), a review is admissible in property disputes if the value of the contested part of the second instance judgment exceeds the amount of EUR 4,172.926 (formerly SIT 1,000,000). The applicant has indicated an amount of SIT 1,485,603 (now EUR 6,199.31) as the review value of the dispute, but such a definition is not correct for the purpose of determining the review value of the dispute. It is the sum of two amounts which he was unsuccessful in the litigation: the rejected amount of SIT 530 000 (now EUR 2 211,65) in respect of the first insurance contract which he himself had concluded and the total rejected amount of SIT 955 603 (now EUR 3 987,66) in respect of the collective accident insurance. The sum cannot be taken into account because each insurance contract is independent, concluded at different times and with different content, and therefore the contracts also constitute different factual and legal bases for the dispute. Since the condition laid down in Article 41(1) of the CCP in conjunction with Article 39 of the CCP for aggregating the amounts in dispute is not met, the value of each individual claim must be taken into account under the second paragraph of the same Article. <p/> None of the amounts mentioned exceeds the audit threshold. Therefore, pursuant to Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Appeal decided on the applicant's unauthorised revision as set out in the operative part of the present decision, which also includes a decision on the applicant's claimed revision costs.",Legal,dev

Do you want to know why? <p/> The sun heats the sheet metal <p/> Children are much more sensitive to heat than adults, which is especially dangerous in summer if you park your car in the sun. The inside of a car can heat up to 50 degrees Celsius or more in about 15 minutes, which can cause heat stroke in children. As well as the temperature itself, it is also important how the child is dressed and how old they are. The younger the child and the darker the colour of the car, the greater the risk. Conversely, the older the child is, the more easily he or she can withstand the heat, and the more likely you are to give him or her certain things, tell him or her to drink water and so on. And if you thought that a slightly open window was enough, you were wrong, because it doesn't make any difference. <p/> Villains at work <p/> It's not just the heat that can be dangerous for a child. Parents often leave the keys in the car when we have to run ""quick errands"", either because we leave the air conditioning on, the radio on, or because we're going to be ""back quickly"" anyway. In this case, although the child may not be hot in the car, the dangers are no less. However impossible and remote kidnapping may seem to us, the fact is that these crimes do not only take place abroad and on the cinema screen, but are, unfortunately, all too common in this country too. It also happens more than once that the villain is distracted by a car and, because he is in a hurry, he takes us both away. <p/> Young explorers <p/> Whether the car is exposed to the sun, whether we have left the keys in it or not, one thing is certain - children love to explore. Especially what they are forbidden to do in the presence of their parents. Of course, this depends on the age of the children - a baby is not interested in such things - but slightly older children are usually eager for the chance to satisfy their curiosity. Since we parents don't usually let them press buttons of all colours and shapes, play with levers, press pedals and turn steering wheels, they take advantage of our absence. They are too young to be aware of the dangers involved, so it is up to parents to take care of them.

149,"The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of the Franciscans of Kamnik, located in a corridor next to the presbytery of the monastery church, is a unique piece of Plečnik's art, full of symbolism. The plans for it were drawn up in 1952 and it was completed in 1954. More... <p/> The monastery chapel was used as a prayer room and for the installation of the Nativity scene and the Holy Sepulchre. The architect was assisted by the local pater Martin Perc. Previously, Plečnik had rebuilt the church in Stranja and planned the baptistery in Nevlje on the orders of Father Perc. Plečnik stripped the plaster from the stonework in the chapel and emphasised the intermediate joints. The stone wall is connected to the lower edge of the plastered surface by a corrugation, which has the function of a seam. On the altar table stands a monolithic tabernacle made of underbaked brick, with stone and brass candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle. Behind the tabernacle is a luminous circular screen. The ceiling is a timber structure made of logs, supported on timber lintels on timber cantilevers. Three chandeliers are fixed on each side of the sloping beams under the logs. This is the theme of the tent, which Plečnik took from the famous mid-19th century German architect and theorist Semper. The walls and ceiling are executed in the architect's characteristic late-period sgraffito technique. Inscriptions, symbols of Christ's martyrdom and geometric borders are included. The window looking into the church has a pair of double polished dark marble mullions on each side. Opposite the altar, a figure of the Crucified is mounted on an alabaster slab in a T-shaped frame. The handle on the door is in the form of a stylised dove. The chapel's furnishings contain a great deal of symbolism. Small metal lights, which some believe resemble military helmets, are arranged around the ceiling. They radiate a short beam of light upwards, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The beams on the ceiling of the altar part suggest the stable or manger of Christ, while the monolithic tabernacle symbolises the rock tomb of Christ.

181,"Still a storm in no man's land <p/> Monday, 10 October, marked the ninety-first year since the Carinthians chose their country in a plebiscite. In the choice between the foreign Austria they knew and the native, Slavic Kingdom of SHS they did not, the former prevailed. Although they had won a country, their homeland was increasingly under threat. The struggle of the Carinthian partisans for their mother tongue, forests and justice has recently been the subject of two recent works by Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke. <p/> The Angel of Forgetting (Engel des Vergessens), a novel by Haderlap, was awarded one of the most important prizes in the German-speaking world, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, and Handke's work Still the Storm (Immer noch Sturm), which was awarded the Austrian Nestroy Theatre Prize for the best play of 2011, had its premiere at the Burgtheater in Vienna at the beginning of October, following its premiere at the Salzburg Gala Games and its premiere at the Thalia Theatre in Hamburg. Between autobiography and historical testimony, Maja Haderlap's novelistic debut tells the story of her ancestors from Lepen near Železná kapla, centring on her grandmother, who survived the torture of the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp (""She saved herself, yes, but if that is why she prefers to live, she doesn't know. ""), and his father, who fled to the partisans at the age of 12 after the Nazi torture that marked his life forever (""I would rather forget everything. ""). The first-person narrator, me, changes as the narrative unfolds from a girl who is still learning basic concepts, like, for example, the partisans, to a woman torn between her home environment and the world, Slovenian and German, the stage and reality and, most importantly, the past and the present. The story thus grows from simple descriptions of the domestic environment, family relationships and children's ideas of the world into a document of time, filled with a historico-political charge, which testifies to the relations between the Slovenian minority and the Austrian majority, to the forgotten, ignored and scorned partisan resistance, and to the shadows that the past casts over the divided Carinthian families of the present. That I always, regardless of age, tells its story in the present tense, in some places causing blurred transitions between the past and the present, but at the same time emphasising being trapped in time and showing how far into the past we have to reach in order to shed light on the present. The Constant Self also drifts into an overly direct autobiography on a few occasions, which, while intimately convincing the reader that the story being told is true, also strips away a bit of objectivity from the overall historical testimony. Otherwise, The Angel of Forgetting goes beyond testimony, and in some places even turns into poetry, a language of powerful images that is the antipode to the simple, clear and pure narrative tone. <p/> The Snows of History Still Storming, arguably Handke's most personal work to date, was to have been put on the stage of Vienna's Burgtheater as a guest performance by Handke's friend Claus Peymann, but a falling out broke out between the director and the playwright, and they broke off their collaboration. Handke then decided to publish the play as a book (by the German publishing house Suhrkamp) and left the direction to the Bulgarian-born director Dimitri Gotscheff (whose production of Aeschylus' The Persians was seen as a guest performance at Cankarjev dom in 2010) for the Salzburg Festival Games. Handke entrusted the Bulgarian director with an understanding of the Slavic soul and the tragedy of losing one's homeland, but he also wanted the director not to leave out much of the text and thus create a multi-hour play comparable to Über die Dörfer (Across the Village), directed by Wim Wenders for the Salzburg Festival in 1982. Gotscheff succeeded in putting on stage one of Handke's most powerful texts, which the author himself called a jaloig about the Carinthian revolt and the history of my family. The text, in which there are no clearly identified persons and their replicas, but also no didascalia, resembles a novel in dialogue rather than a dramatic work, moving between languages (choral German, Carinthian dialect and Slovene) and genres (lyric, epic, drama). The central narrator and observer is himself (an excellent performance by Jens Harzer), surrounded by his (dead) ancestors in the Carinthian foothills of Austria: his grandparents, his mother and her three brothers (Gregor, Valentin, Benjamin) and his sister (Ursula). Jaz's perspective resembles the view from the cradle of an elderly (blue) baby, asking, reporting and commenting, but sometimes it seems as if he is not there at all, or as if the whole action is taking place in his half-sleep. That it is just a nightmare that he doesn't know whether it is happening inside him or outside him, whether he is crawling inside it or being attacked by it (""Not that I leave you alone. Don't leave me alone, be still. You do not leave me alone, no and no. ""). I follows a family tragedy: the deaths of the (forcibly conscripted) Wehrmacht soldiers Benjamin and Valentin, and then the death of the (at first delighted and then disappointed) partisan Ursula (with the partisan name Snežena). The only son who returns to the family is Handke's uncle, the partisan Gregor. Gregor, whom Handke portrayed (though always differently) in several of his works, studied fruit-growing in Maribor and wrote a book on apple varieties, which the family on stage reads as a Bible (in Slovenian), but the product of his uncle Gregor, who was actually killed as a soldier in the Wehrmacht, is also supposed to have a special place in Handke's real life. The stage is completely empty and bare, the costumes do not change, there are hardly any props. There is a void, filled with words of rage and frustration, sadness and suffering. Words about the language the family wanted to save (""To save a language is to save a soul. ""), about the homeland it wanted to preserve (""To lose the homeland once, to lose the homeland forever. ""), and about the history it wanted to write (""History, it has swallowed up my life and our life, the feeling of life. ""). During the four-hour-long speech, green confetti keeps falling on the stage, fast or slow. History snows, slowly covering space, time and performers. <p/> Home, Church, Politics, History, Language and Self Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke build their texts in different narrative tones: she calmly and occasionally confessional, he wildly and preachily. She is drawn to sentiment and he to irony, we sense in her the fusion of words and landscape and in him their incompatibility. But the motifs that merge into the narrative flow remain the same. The house as the point of contact and the most important space for the whole family. Politics, which those who have been most deeply disappointed avoid in the greatest arc. A dream in which the past and the present are intertwined. A Church that has thrown away its own children because they have taken up the fight for the language in which its priests preached before the war. And last but not least, there is the point of contact with me, a person who was born too late to live, yet will never escape. Both writers feel the pain of politics devouring history and history devouring their own children (""They know that their past does not appear in Austrian history books, still less in those of Carinthia, where the history of the country begins with the end of the First World War, pauses and continues with the end of the Second World War. ""The Austrian post-war statehood was founded (among other things) on the resistance of the Carinthian Slovenians, on the blood sacrifice in the local forests and orchards, and then was sucked into the black hole of history. (""A country that does not want us, and it is because of us that it is allowed to exist as a state..."") One of the strongest motifs of both narrators is language - in Handke's case, it is the fear of its loss that is stronger, and the hope for its salvation or at least its recognition (""Our language, our strength. Beyond language, violence erupts. "", ""Language, mine, ours: the hen's ladder will be Jacob's ladder.""), while in Haderlap's case it is a more intimate search for one's own identity (""I hope that later I will find or invent the right language... "", ""Who am I, who do I belong to, why do I write Slovenian and speak German? ""The two narratives, which take place on the periphery of our territory, are not just a matter of province. Just as much as they are a matter for Austria because of its suppressed history, they are also a matter for central Slovenia, which most often does not hear the voices from the periphery. At the Burgtheater in Vienna, a section of the audience gave the production of Still the Storm a standing ovation, and there were shouts of enthusiasm from the boxes. Many audiences attend Maya Haderlap's many Austrian readings. When will the subtle stories from the periphery touch all Slovenian viewers and readers, and when will we begin to see their past as our own? The Slovenian translation of Handke's text (published by Wieser, translated by Brane Čop, reviewed by Florjan Lipuš and Peter Handke) will be available in the second half of November, while Maja Haderlap's novel will be published in Slovenian next summer (by Litera). <p/>Quotes",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

183,"As regards the mental anguish resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In this respect, the issue is one of shared causation. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The review is dismissed. <p/> Reasons <p/> The Court of First Instance rules that the defendant must pay the applicant SIT 2 460 020 in damages, with statutory default interest from SIT 36 660 from 1.4.1998 until payment, from SIT 3 360 from 21.7.1998 until payment and from SIT 2 300 000 from 7.3.2003 until payment. It further ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an annuity of SIT 2 000 per month from 1.4.2003 by the 15th day of each month for the preceding month. The Court dismissed the applicant's claim for higher relief. It held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damage suffered by the applicant in the accident of 28.1.1998. It awarded the injured party damages of SIT 900 000 for the physical pain suffered, SIT 200 000 for the fear, SIT 1 000 000 for the mental pain resulting from the impairment of his activity in life and SIT 200 000 for the mental pain resulting from the disfigurement. <p/> The Court of Appeal partially upheld the litigants' appeals and amended the judgment of the Court of First Instance by awarding the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, pecuniary damages of SIT 2 500 000, with default interest from 1 January 2002 to 7 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate less the base rate, and from 8 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in all other respects. It accepted the applicant's plea that the compensation for mental pain and suffering as a result of the injury was too low and awarded her SIT 400 000 for that purpose, while it considered the compensation for the other forms of non-pecuniary damage awarded to the injured party by the Court of First Instance to be appropriate. <p/> The applicant brought an appeal against that judgment on the ground of error of substantive law. The applicant requests the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia to uphold it and to amend the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejects the application, by awarding the applicant, in addition to the pecuniary damages of SIT 2 660 020 already awarded, SIT 2 000 000, with statutory default interest from 14.10.1999 until payment, and statutory default interest on the damages already awarded from 14.10.1999 until 31.12.2001. The applicant submits that, although the lower courts correctly established the factual situation, they subsequently awarded the injured party inadequate compensation for all forms of non-pecuniary damage. In awarding damages for the mental anguish resulting from the impairment of the applicant's activities in life, the Court of First Instance should not have followed uncritically the expert opinion of Dr W. that the applicant's classification as a category III invalid was only 20 % due to the physical injuries sustained in the accident and 80 % due to his medical condition. It was only as a result of the permanent consequences of the injuries sustained on 28.1.1998 that the applicant was classified in category III of invalidity, since he was no longer able to work. He was 48 years old at the time of the incident and will therefore have to endure the mental pain of reduced activity for a very long time. The Courts of First and Second Instance ignored the fact that the accident occurred in 1998 and that the defendant has not yet paid any compensation to the applicant. The decision on the commencement of interest on the pecuniary compensation for non-material damage is also incorrect. Neither the Law on Obligatory Relations (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 29/78-57/89, ZOR) nor any other law provides that interest on compensation for non-material damage is payable to the injured party only from 1 January 2002. In view of the stabilised economic and economic situation in the country, the monetary claim for compensation for non-material damage is payable after the expiry of a period of 14 days from the date on which the defendant received the claim and the documentation. The applicant sent the claim to the defendant on 29.7.1998 and the defendant received it on 30.7.1998, and has therefore been in default of payment since 13.8.1998. According to Article 277 of the Civil Code, a debtor who defaults in the performance of a pecuniary obligation owes interest in addition to the principal. The case-law to date has neglected the function of interest, which consists in the penalty for failure to comply with a monetary obligation in time. Such a decision is contrary to Article 17(1), (12), and Article 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code. <p/> The review was served on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and on the defendant, who did not reply to it. <p/> The audit is not substantiated. <p/> Pursuant to Article 370(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 36/04 - Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, p. 36), the review court and the parties are bound by the factual basis arising from the grounds of the judgments of first and second instance, and therefore, pursuant to Article 371 of the Civil Procedure Act, the review court examined the contested judgment within the limits of the ground raised by the reviser, namely error of substantive law. <p/> The fundamental principles governing the assessment of compensation for non-material damage are the principle of individualisation and the principle of objective conditionality of the amount of financial compensation. The principle of individualisation requires the determination of fair compensation in the light of the intensity (degree) and duration of the physical and mental pain and suffering and distress in the light of all the concrete circumstances of the individual victim. However, in accordance with the principle of the objective conditionality of the amount of pecuniary compensation, the court, in assessing it, must have regard to the importance of the good affected and the purpose of the compensation, and must ensure that it does not give way to tendencies incompatible with its nature and social purpose (Article 200(1) and (2) of the CPA). The Court of Second Instance, by awarding damages for physical pain (SIT 900 000), fear (SIT 200 000), mental pain due to the impairment of life activities (SIT 1 000 000) and mental pain due to disfigurement (SIT 400 000), found that the Court of First Instance had failed to award damages for the following reasons000) correctly met the legal standard of just pecuniary compensation, since the damages awarded are comparable to those awarded for similar harm and take into account all the applicant's individual characteristics, including her age at the time of the harmful event (see the reasons for the judgment of the Court of First Instance on pages 6 to 8 and the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Second Instance on page 3). As regards the mental pain resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the physical injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In that respect, the question of shared causation is one which the courts of the lower instances have resolved correctly in substantive law and in accordance with settled case-law. Since the applicant's current state of health or incapacity for work is also due to health problems which pre-date the harmful event, the defendant cannot be held liable for that part of the damage which is not attributable to the conduct of its insured. (1) <p/> The decision as to the commencement of interest is also substantively correct. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in a legal opinion of principle of 26.6.2002, adopted a position which ties the commencement of statutory default interest on a pecuniary claim for non-pecuniary damage (Articles 179-183 of the Law on Obligations, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 83/01, OZ, or Articles 200-203 of the Civil Code) to the entry into force of the OZ (1.1.2002), provided that an additional condition of delay in performance on the part of the person who caused the damage is also met at the same time. The applicant's legal position, which considers that it is in any event decisive when the insurer received the claim for compensation with the applicant's medical records, referring to the provisions of Articles 12, 17(1), 277 and 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code, is erroneous, since it would lead to unequal treatment of the injured party, contrary to the constitutional principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia) and to the principle of equal protection of the rights of the injured party (Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). <p/> The reality in the field of compensation litigation is that courts generally award compensation several years after a claim has been lodged. This reality means that, in the area of data on damages awarded by the courts, they reflect, among other things, a measure of the time lag between the moment of the decision and the occurrence of the damage. In other words, the amounts of damages awarded, which the Court used for comparison purposes, also took into account the factor of waiting for compensation as an important element. <p/> Since neither the grounds on which the revision was brought nor the grounds which the Court of Review is required to take into account of its own motion are present, the Court of Review dismissed the revision (Article 378 of the Civil Procedure Code). <p/> Footnote (1): The case-law on the issue of shared causation has been settled by a legal opinion adopted at the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia on 15.12.1998, Legal Opinions II/98, page 12.",Legal,dev

211,"Fortune Telling - Tricks Revealed <p/> Man has always been curious about what the future holds. In the past - and still today for some primitive peoples - the future was foretold from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, but today we have a variety of divination techniques at our disposal: the horoscope, the crystal ball, palm or coffee grounds divination, numerology, charts, runes and the list goes on and on. Is it just a good trick or does fortune-telling really predict the future? <p/> "" A sucker is born every minute "" <p/> is a statement attributed to P. T. Barnum, an American entertainer and businessman who was famous for his pranks. The Barnum effect, on which fortune-telling is based, is named after him. It is the idea that a person recognises his own personality traits in common or stereotypical descriptions of personality. He even finds the descriptions incredibly true for him! <p/> Divination is often based on claims that cannot be verified or disputed, e.g. "" You have great potential within you .""; "" You have a need to be liked .""; describes characteristics that are typical of a certain age, gender or status e.g. a fortune teller tells an elderly woman that her hearing is probably deteriorating and she will need a hearing aid predicts events that will happen to each of us sooner or later e.g. "" You will soon receive an interesting phone call ."". The word ""sometimes"" is often used in predictions e.g. "" Sometimes you say what you think clearly, but sometimes you bite your tongue to avoid resentment."" <p/> Divination is more convincing when it involves personal information: name, date of birth, date of marriage, etc. It is also important that divination evokes a sense of magic or special energies, e.g. divination using magic crystals. For example, dressing in magical clothes or in a cloak that reflects negative energy adds a special impression of magic. <p/> The use of unusual or repetitive hand movements, steady strokes or sounds serves to bring the divination into a trance state where the individual is even more receptive to what is being said. <p/> When the prediction comes true <p/> The fortune teller has told us what is in store for us, and then we go out into the world with this knowledge. When we expect something to happen, even completely unrelated and coincidental events can be perceived as connected. For example, a fortune teller tells you: "" You are going to have a car accident because of a flat tyre, you better not drive your car for a while. ""Just in case, you really don't get behind the wheel. A week later, your friend tells you that the last time he had a flat tyre, he narrowly avoided a collision. "" The guessing paid off! Good thing I wasn't driving! "", you utter, relieved that you have perceived two coincidental events as connected. <p/> Fortune-telling skills <p/> Good language skills are important for fortune-telling. A fortune teller speaks clearly, fluently and quickly enough that you cannot hear your own thoughts or reach out to him. At times he makes a claim and waits for your response. If you agree with the claim, he will reinforce it in the future. If you disagree, he will take the conversation in a different direction. Sometimes he will only make part of the claim and it is up to you to complete it as you see fit. <p/> A fortune teller must also be a good observer. He or she needs to recognise what you are communicating through your posture and facial expressions, what your clothes and fashion accessories say about you, your status and your lifestyle. Based on these insights, the fortune teller will be able to choose expressions that are even more suited to you. <p/> Fortune-telling is also helpful to the individual <p/> When fortune-telling predicts pleasant events and the successful achievement of goals, it can have a very motivating effect on the individual. He or she will embark on the journey to achieve his or her goals with confidence, working harder and better, as all his or her energy will be directed towards the goal. <p/> Divination can show a person a new way of looking at a problem and new solutions that they would not have thought of on their own. <p/> Is it possible to predict the future? <p/> So far, no divination has accurately predicted the future - so the claims could be scientifically verified.

221,"Where did the... domestic pasture go... <p/> Who doesn't remember the sweet sixties? A period of optimism, good humour and progress in all fields, every day. I'm thinking from a purely consumerist point of view, post festum of course, because like most of you I wasn't born yet. But with all these revivals and golden memories, I have utopically recalled that time when mass consumption went the other way. <p/> This time the Magdalene is a green square box, clumsily and naively designed for today, but interesting precisely because of this immediacy. The round title has mythological proportions and the black and white symbolic photograph shows nothing of sentimentality but the triumph of technology. However, since the scripture is not intended for design dogmas, I will abbreviate. Titania is the name of the product and it is a handmade macchino per pasta. <p/> My grandmother gave me this metal beast because she knows I like to cook. The seller's internal stamp shows that it was bought on 9 May 1968 in the shop 'La Casalinga' in Gorizia. Although I have never seen either my grandmother or my mother make pasta themselves - with or without a pasta maker - I have made one quite solid pasta from the first one. <p/> The process goes like this. First, the home-made dough is pushed through two rotating rollers, which roll the dough evenly into strips. Repeat the process, if necessary, with a narrower gap between the two rollers, depending on the type of pasta you want. Then pass the strips through the second spout, turn the crank and watch with glowing hearts the culinary miracle - noodles coming out the other side. Ugh, haute cuisine. <p/> Pasta is not exactly Slovenia's national dish and it arrived on the shelves relatively late. As I have gleaned from the web, the Mlinotest pasta factory was built in the late 1950s (proudly made since 1958). Housewives were stretching and drying simple noodles in their backyards long before that, since a product made of flour, eggs and water is a generic phenomenon rather than the alchemist's secret of a lodge of freebooters. <p/> If there is one product from our culinary treasure chest that is anti-potentine, it is the miller. They are made from rolled-out dough that has been baked in a whole piece in a bread oven, usually after baking bread. The baked dough was broken into larger pieces, soaked in water and thickened with whatever gravel was on hand. <p/> Since we don't usually have bread ovens at home, we can fascinate our invited guests with home-made pasta and hum a light Italian canzone as we turn the crank. Or spin a bouquet of evergreen Slovenian songs. Remember, we're in the sixties.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
225,"16 March 2010 - We have just five years to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is therefore calling for world leaders to adopt a global action plan at the UN Summit in New York this September to accelerate the achievement of these goals. <p/> ""We must not disappoint the millions of people who look to the international community to deliver on its promises in the Millennium Declaration. Let us come together in September to deliver on those promises,"" Ban said in his Keeping the Promise report, released today. <p/> For the Millennium Development Goals Summit on 20-22 September, the report will serve as the basis for intergovernmental agreements on the Summit's outcome document. The report identifies success factors, good practices, highlights gaps, highlights future challenges and makes proposals for action to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs over the last five years. Further complementary reports are expected, including an annex to the Secretary-General's report in April with basic statistics on the implementation of the MDGs. A more detailed report with statistics on the implementation of the Goals will follow in June, followed by an overall assessment of the shortcomings of international cooperation in early September. <p/> ""We have the knowledge and the resources to achieve the Millennium Goals,"" Ban stressed in his report, referring to the goals of the Millennium Declaration of 2000, which aim to end poverty, hunger, disease and significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by 2015. <p/> The report notes that some countries have made great strides in overcoming extreme poverty and hunger, increasing school enrolment and child health, expanding access to safe drinking water, strengthening control of malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and expanding access to HIV treatment (for more information, see Millennium Development Goals: A stocktaking exercise). <p/>These successes are being seen in some of the poorest countries, proving that the MDGs are indeed achievable if we have the right policies, the right level of investment and international support. <p/> Progress has not been the same everywhere, however, and the report predicts that many countries will not reach the goals. The greatest challenges are faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, and countries facing internal unrest. <p/> The report points out that the MDGs are not being missed because the targets are unachievable or there is too little time, but rather because of unfulfilled promises, inadequate funding and a lack of accountability. The result is a failure to provide financial incentives, services, technical support and appropriate partnerships. As a result, progress in poverty eradication has been unacceptably slow, and some of the hard-won successes are being eroded by the food and financial crises. <p/> Good practices <p/> Global action to achieve the MDGs has been underway for almost ten years and a number of good practices have emerged. The most important of these are development plans at national level. Successful countries are pursuing a pragmatic policy mix, focusing on their own development capacities. International development cooperation needs to support more intensively such national development strategies and actions to strengthen their own development capacities. <p/> Of course we need economic growth, but it is not the only condition for progress. Growth must be inclusive and equitable if we are to achieve optimal poverty reduction and real progress towards the MDGs. <p/> Hard-won progress can be undone by economic and other shocks. Countries need forward-looking macroeconomic policies that can promote balanced growth across the board. For example, the Millennium Goals can be achieved through sustained public investment and development strategies designed accordingly, and universal social protection. <p/> The report stresses that financing for the MDGs must start 'at home'. Developing countries must raise and allocate their revenues accordingly, and donor countries must deliver on their promises to increase ODA. Although development aid reached its peak in 2008, countries are still largely failing to deliver on their development aid promises. <p/> Countries pledged around USD 154 billion in ODA at the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and have not kept their promises. They have under-pledged by $35 billion a year and under-pledged by $20 billion for Africa. ""If promises are not kept, the poor suffer and die in even greater numbers,"" the report points out. <p/> The report outlines a number of promising government proposals to ensure adequate funding for the MDGs, including a new financing mechanism for better health systems and a new global approach to food security, which was elaborated at the 2009 G8 meeting in L'Aquila. These proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible if we are to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and lay a solid foundation for the G8 and G20 meetings in Canada in June 2010. <p/> At the same time, innovative financing schemes must continue to be developed and the MDG Summit in September this year must establish a transparent mechanism to promote the delivery of global development aid pledges. Such a mechanism must have its own action plan with timetables, forms of monitoring and enforcement. <p/> UN Secretary-General Ban calls for a new 'compact' that is not just government-led, but inclusive of all stakeholders, developed and developing countries, civil society organisations, private business, philanthropy and multilateral systems. Each of these stakeholders must strive to make the most efficient use of its own resources. They must act effectively and collectively. This September, the Summit will officially take place as a high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. It will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen collective action and partnerships to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. <p/> ""In September, we will come together to build on the achievements of the past years and to address the existing gaps. We have a shared responsibility to shape a better future for generations to come,"" the Secretary-General stressed. ""Achieving the MDGs is only possible by delivering on our promises, with the right policies, financial incentives and sustained action.""",News,dev

243,"The Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia (IVZ) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia are participating in a large-scale European project entitled ""Transmission of patients' key health information for treatment abroad"" or epSOS (Smart Open Services for European Patients). The project aims to make key medical data available for the healthcare of citizens seeking medical assistance in another European country, while respecting the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy. <p/> As European citizens become increasingly mobile, travelling and working abroad more and more, they increasingly need medical assistance abroad. In order to provide quality medical treatment, the doctor abroad also needs the patient's vital health information. Modern information technology has long allowed authorised health professionals to access important health data collected in the patient's home country, based on the patient's consent. This is why many initiatives have been launched in Europe to create the right environment and conditions to make use of such technical possibilities for the benefit of better healthcare for European citizens. <p/> The epSOS project involves 47 partners from 20 European Union (EU) countries and three non-EU countries. The aim of the project is to carry out pilot projects to establish two cross-border services - the transmission of summary patient data and e-prescribing and e-medication. Therefore, the key tasks will be to organise the relevant legal bases in each participating country, to ensure an appropriate organisation of the work and to put in place the technical solutions. The initial phase of the project will test the feasibility and acceptability of the general-technical, organisational and legal coherence of the proposed solutions. The epSOS services, which include patient summaries and e-prescribing/e-dispensing, will be available on a trial basis in some countries already at the end of this year. <p/> Slovenia will test data exchange in 2012, probably first with Austria and Slovakia. <p/> For more information in English on epSOS, please visit the project website www.epsos.eu.",Information/Explanation,dev

The mode of exercise and the underlying principles span the different exercise segments and are thus integrated into a whole. Therefore, OUTFIT is a workout where all the most important principles of modern exercise are worked out: coordination, body shaping, gaining fitness, strength, balance, stabilisation, flexibility, etc. It also differs from other functional workouts because of the emphasis on prevention and supervised execution of exercises. The point is to do something good for your body (to achieve as much as possible in a training period, in the best possible way). The workout is suitable for everyone, as it is uniquely adaptable to advanced exercisers as well as beginners. In the fresh air, you're sure to find something to love in 75 minutes of exercise. <p/> The workout consists of a functional warm-up, alphabet run, dynamic stretching. The main part of the challenge is mainly exercises for strength, flexibility, coordination, explosiveness, which are interconnected in an interesting sequence of exercises, separated by intensity or programmed in intervals, for the best possible results and a significant progress of the individual from term to term. This part of the term is about shaping the body and identifying personal weaknesses, with a clear outcome where progress is needed.

307,"Elvis Kudič, athlete (09 / 2013) <p/> When I first came to the Althea Centre, I was immediately taken care of. It all started with tap dancing, and then Nena and I talked about what I was training. I said athletics and that I was very scared of competitions, but Nena suggested mental training. After the first session I felt different, I have been doing it for a year now and the progress is very good (from 1 to 10 it's a 10! ). I am relaxed, confident, I have a goal in mind. Of course, there are still a lot of things to improve. I feel great in Althea. <p/> Kristina Novak, tennis player, 13 years old (09 / 2013) <p/> Filip Zupančič, tennis player (08 / 2012) <p/> I've had a lot of mental training, but none has been as reliable as the IMT® mental training at Althea®. During the training you relax (sometimes you almost fall asleep, although you are still fully concentrated) and when you wake up again you are full of energy. Nena and I have been working together for a little less than a year now and the results are obvious. I feel great even in the face of injuries, and I perform very confidently in tournaments. The exercises we do are reliable, they help me a lot. From my side that would be everything, I really recommend you if you have / will have any possible problem to come to Althea® and feel this great atmosphere. Filip <p/> Blaž Kavčič, top tennis player (07 / 2012) <p/> I first came into contact with the Althea® Health and Harmony Centre a little over two years ago when I had to put my best friend (tennis racket) in a corner because of a tear in the back of my leg. I was in great mental distress as no therapy was helping and I didn't know what to do. For a top athlete, there is nothing worse than having to lie down and rest... Since then, I have always turned to them when I am in trouble. <p/> As soon as I entered Althea I knew I had come to the right place. On the first day of therapy I was welcomed by a physiotherapist and her friend Tecar®. After just a few therapies I could feel a big difference. My leg was more relaxed and the pain slowly subsided, and soon I was able to return to the tennis courts again. But there was still one big problem... I couldn't put the same strain on my leg as before the injury and I felt I couldn't help it. I had a brake in my head ... <p/> That's when Nena came to my rescue. With IMT® training, we broke through the block in a few days and my movement on the court became much better and I felt I was the one on the court again, because it was very difficult to send the ball past me. Nena also taught me to listen to myself and my body. Now I can often help myself. <p/> I would like to thank everyone at Althea® from the bottom of my heart, because they have saved me many difficult days that I would have had to spend without tennis. Tecar®, Bionic®, IMT® and kinesiotaping is surely the best combination of therapies for injury recovery and I highly recommend Althea® to anyone who needs help. <p/> Blaž Kavčič <p/> Miran Stanovnik (28.5.2012, after his injury in Dubai, completion of therapy) <p/> After Miran's injury in Dubai, in addition to physiotherapy and kinesiotaping, we also did IMT® intuitive mental training and energy therapies as a support to the basic therapy, in order to speed up rehabilitation and to clean up the effects of the injury on all other levels, not only on the physical body. The following is a description of his experience, which was very powerful, because he gave himself completely to the therapy and his intention was to completely rehabilitate all the consequences (physical, mental, energetic) of this injury, as well as all the previous ones that had happened to him, in the shortest possible time, which is why the reaction was more intense and the result was extremely fast, which was his intention, which he had set for himself. <p/> Dear friends, My meetings with my pleasant and professional friends from the Althea® Centre in Lesce are coming to their final stage. The rehabilitation has more than succeeded. But I have tried something new again (at least for me). Nena kindly asked me if we could also try one energy therapy (reiki) together with IMT® mental training. Of course, why not. Of course I didn't expect any revolution, but I participated fully, like everything I do. She also warned me that I might get a little cold after the treatment because the energy would be cleansing... Well yes, it's no joke I can tell you that. I got so cold on the way home after the treatment that I set the internal temperature in my car to 28 degrees Celsius and it wasn't enough. At home I covered my head with two blankets (not duvets) and that was barely enough. But within an hour my body reacted with a fever (38 degrees). After a few hours I just lift my head and ask Nena for a commentary on the events. Such a strong reaction to everything we did, cleansing on all levels, because I was prepared for it and went into the process ""full on"", says my therapist. Yes, I spent a few more days in bed, but the very next day there was a significant improvement in the condition of the injury, and the very next day I forgot about the crutches for walking around the flat, which means that it helped, and since that day I have only used them for walking up the stairs... A crazy good experience, I tell you. Now I've read it again and I see that my writing looks terribly ""cracked"", but I'm not going to correct it, because everything I said is true. <p/> Miran <p/> Jure Robič, top extreme cyclist (09 / 2010) <p/> Dear Nena, I have been promising you for too long that I would write about how I experience our ""sessions"". Well, now I have made time for you, just as you have always made time for me whenever I need you, day or night. When I told you in the first session that I trusted you and believed in you and that you could do whatever you wanted, just to get better and get back to racing as soon as possible, I had no idea that change could be so fast and so effective. When you got me up and racing in four days after a serious injury, with the help of Bionic®, Tecar® and especially your IMT® mental technique, I started to understand why things were happening to me in the lake in the first place. A new world is really opening up for me, as you predicted. I know it's all in my head, it's just that now, with your help, I know how to put what's bothering me out of my mind. I can't wait for us to continue. See you)) <p/> Miran Stanovnik, top motorcyclist (07 / 2010) <p/> My first meeting with Nena and Althea® was the result of a conversation and a personal recommendation from Jureto (Robič), who couldn't praise the ""treatments"" enough. Despite the relatively long distance from my home, I regularly visited Althea® in Lesce when I had injuries, which are an integral part of almost every athlete's life. I have received individual massage treatment, Bionic® therapy, Tecar® therapy, as well as IMT® intuitive mental training, a method I am really enthusiastic about. The result was shockingly good for me. I don't bother with the details of how each segment works, because for me it's important that it works. And that is for sure. <p/> I did not believe in it at first, but then I was convinced by the real effects, and I was completely taken in. At the beginning, I thought, what is this going to do for me, how can this possibly work, this is just something, blah blah blah, ... but, as I said, I was fascinated by the effect. Every human being has certain blockages, unprocessed patterns, every human being has a problem somewhere - maybe they are aware of it, maybe they are not. Nena, I was taken by her very calmness, I felt that myself. She is a woman I trusted immediately. After giving birth, I had a big problem with iron. There was no way, even with medical help, that it would improve. Quite by chance, when I met Nena, I complained about the matter and she suggested that we look at where I might have a blockage, the psychological reasons that were causing it. Well, we did find the cause: I had a desperate guilty conscience because I wasn't with my daughter non-stop and all that was eating my iron, and when we looked at all these patterns of guilt, cleared them up, came to terms with it, when I looked the matter in the eye, it got abnormally better and better. During the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Nena and I spent a lot of time in contact via Skype. This IMT® mental training can also be done remotely, and she helped me to step over difficult mental barriers. I was able to. Sometimes you may think that the problem is somewhere on the surface, but when you look deep inside you realise that it's the patterns you have in you from childhood that are now ""jumping out"". I found myself in this IMT® training, in this therapy. It helps me a lot. It's not just a therapy for sport, it's a therapy that enriches me for life. I realise that I still have a lot of work to do on myself and this is a method where you can see the effect after just one therapy, you can see the progress, the change immediately. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be happy with themselves. For me, this therapy has opened my eyes, and I look at certain things with different glasses. I calm down when I have therapy with Nena, she calms me down, after all it is my time, which I spend on myself and enrich myself. <p/> Vasja Rupnik, biathlon team Slovenia (06 / 2010) <p/> I myself have never believed in intangible, unexplainable things, but after I started working with the Altheo® Centre, with Nena, I started to realise that it is only the ego that is the problem to a better and more confident performance in competitions, and in life! With the help of therapies, which are not even therapies, but a conversation, or with Nena's help, digging into your subconscious, you discover that fears and blockages are part of you, you just have to dare to discover them, to do that you need the desire for a better and easier life, of course, without Nena's help and guidance it's not possible, so thank you for the feedback and I recommend it for the future! <p/> Maja Kokol, children's presenter, animator and singer (05 / 2010) <p/> I have been dedicated to children in my work in various ways for 23 years. Working and socialising with them has confirmed to me over and over again how fairy-tale and magical this world is. That is why I believe in miracles, fairy tales and angels - Nena is certainly one of them. The severe trials, the extreme sadness and the fear of ""tomorrow"" are the circumstances that have brought her my way. I am a great optimist but I can say that without her help I would not have made it through that period - especially not in that way. Nena is not only a friend but also a great therapist who gives me energy, warmth, words... - whatever she feels I need at that moment. Because she is so visibly successful in all this, her ideas, advice or just telling me about something good always opens my heart and makes me curious - and so it was with the IMT® technique. She changed my life, completely - turned it upside down like a whirlpool, leaving behind the devastation of old patterns, thoughts, connections and sowing new seeds with a firm and determined will. That is why, my dear Nena, you are my angel - in all forms, in all areas. With your help, I have become who I am and for that I will always be grateful! <p/> Nika, tennis player (02 / 2011) <p/> IMT® therapy helps me with all the things I do, not just tennis. I have noticed much less fussing (if any) about others or about external things that I can't control. I am much more in touch with myself and my needs. I am somehow living more in a kind of ""peace"". At the beginning I had doubts in myself in terms of opening up. I am a person who finds it very difficult to trust someone completely and therefore to believe them. I have to say that I trusted you from the very beginning of our IMT® therapy, which is not typical for me. The therapies also help me in general in my life and are not only related to sports. In fact, for many years I lived in a bubble that I didn't want to get out of. Everybody could say or do anything to me, but I always acted completely calm on the outside. With your help, I am now actually speaking my mind, without fearing the outcome. I don't even think about what if it had been, or why it happened, but I live in the moment and do what needs to be done. My own execution, accuracy and power of my strokes has also improved with the IMT® therapies we do. <p/>Spella (12 / 2011) <p/>The barrel of repressed problems and fears has finally been filled. There was no more room and the eruption had to happen. For me as a psychological problem. I landed on antidepressants. But since I am still too young to walk with crutches (that's what doctors call treating mental problems with pills) I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that Nena had a health centre, but I had no idea how it could help me. But since the devil is still a fly in the ointment, I figured it couldn't get any worse and called her. We made an appointment for therapy. And lo and behold, after the very first IMT® session, I felt relief. A second one followed, and a third, ... Today I feel really great and I am eternally grateful to Neni. And yet more proof that the therapies really do help. One of my many fears was walking in the woods. I didn't go there alone if I could, even though I enjoy the woods. Every noise made me shiver, I was afraid of meeting a person, an animal... This fear of mine was rooted deep in my subconscious and stemmed from events in my past. After one of the therapies I went to the forest to test the effect. Alone. Amazing. The fear of forest visitors and the silence with the occasional rustling of leaves, wind, ... was gone. Walking means relaxation, recharging my batteries, talking to myself. <p/> Everything in life happens for a reason. Nena, you were one of the better and more beautiful ones. Thank you. I love coming back to therapy because it really helps me to understand what is going on around me. Therapies make my perception of the world more positive.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

The tension on both sides was high, as the match was almost decided on the third place of the national championship, but at the same time, due to the nature of the local derby, there is always some uncertainty in the mutual meetings. The match was won by the home team after an even game, for which we congratulate them and wish them every success in their future participation in the regional NLB league. <p/> We cannot avoid commenting on the officiating by the representatives of the Basketball Referees Association of Slovenia. In the first quarter of the meeting, when the refereeing was at its most correct, the players of our team were more than a worthy opponent for the favoured home team. However, from the beginning of the second quarter onwards, the judging criteria changed. The changed criterion, which was very clearly against Elektra Esotecha, was most clearly enforced on the floor by referee Dragan Gojkovič from Ljubljana. Even one of the best Slovenian and European delegates, Aleš Kamnikar, did not react to the changed judging criteria. <p/> We would like to point out that this season we have often been satisfied with the officiating, and a few times not so satisfied, but we have taken the decision not to bother with the referees and the officiating. But what referee Dragan Gojkovic allowed himself to do in the middle of the match goes beyond all the unwritten rules on tolerance of refereeing errors, which are based on the nature of their work. Dragan Gojkovic made what we consider to be a number of unusual and unfair refereeing decisions during the match, which he then made some compensatory decisions to mitigate at the very end of the match, when the winner was already decided. This kind of judging and compensation is certainly not honourable for a referee who officiates matches of the highest level. However, in order not to criticise, we would like to publicly praise the young and promising referee Uroš Kolar, who refereed the whole meeting correctly and fairly. <p/> The coach of the Elektra Esotech team made the following official statement after the match: ""I admit that I am guilty because I believed that hard work in the hall - even five or six hours a day - can bring results. Unfortunately, I found out that only stories from behind the scenes and cooperation with various grey eminences count. Today, I am asking the referees how it is possible to make 31 personal mistakes with 'rough' play, even though we were in a zone defence for 35 minutes. How is it possible to have a ratio of 31:20 for personal fouls and 18:35 for free throws. When we made eight free throws in the last minute of the game. I was able to go into the dressing room and look my boys in the eye, who were still in tears 10 minutes after the game. If only someone else had the courage to come into our dressing room and shake their hands for their tremendous play and incredible fight. I made this statement consciously, even though I know that the Premier League Players' Association made a decision before the season not to talk publicly about the trial. ""<p/> The management of Elektra Basketball Club fully supports Bojan Lazic's statement and we expect the Slovenian Basketball Referees Association to explain in this open letter how such a blatant fiasco by the representatives of the referees' organisation could happen in such an important game. At the same time, we expect an answer as to why some Slovenian referees want to decide the winners of the meeting instead of the players on the floor? <p/> In the hope that in the future the refereeing on Slovenian basketball courts will be more coherent, we would like to welcome you and at the same time to inform you that this year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of basketball in the Šaleška Valley and next year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Elektra Basketball Club. We would like to let you know that, based on the rich tradition in the Šaleška Valley, quality basketball will continue to be played in all age categories, regardless of the subjective opinion of individual referees as to how far the success of our club can reach. <p/> On behalf of Elektra Basketball Club and with the full support of the club management.",Other,dev

368,"Source of the survey, which is also at the bottom of this article. Author of the column. Thirty years ago, his parents might have had a problem with this innocent childish line. If there is a cult of personality and the state is a proletarian dictatorship - and in the SFRY it was almost a constitutional principle that the proletariat was in power - then children in schools must not make a fool of the supreme authority. <p/> Indeed, until the end of the 1980s and the Slovenian constitutional amendments, Article 133 of the Penal Code, which criminalised freedom of conscience and expression, was also in force. The verbal offence meant that one was not allowed to speak over the state, the system and the leaders. The statement ""Comrade Tito has a fat arse"" would have caused problems with the authorities in the SFRY. <p/> For many people who are strangers to Slovenia's obsession with socialism and Titoism, it is inconceivable how, in 2012, so many sensible people can be fascinated by the figure of one of the typical dictators of the 20th century. Because twenty years ago, nobody thought about Josip Broz.In the late 1980s, when democratisation was beginning, you would have laughed at someone idolising a marshal or even dressing in similar uniforms. <p/> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it did not occur to people to deplore Yugoslavia, Titoism or self-management. There were too many challenges, and faith in the future was strong. Interestingly, there was no noteworthy event at Dražgoše in that period either. Third-class officials spoke, a few hundred people gathered. <p/> At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Titoism died out in Slovenia. <p/> Then something started to change at the beginning of the new millennium. Dražgoše suddenly took on a whole new glow and significance. They became a kind of value centre for an orthodox, pre-modern and quasi-partisan political rallying cry, aimed at mobilising the far-left electorate. In the light of historical facts, Dražgoše became Lažgoše. <p/> On a broader, social level, a reinterpretation of Titoism and history in Yugoslavia began to take place. Instead of historians shedding light on all the characters of the time - the only exception being Professor Jože Pirjevec's biography Tito and Comrades - and honestly saying that Slovenia had a semi-colonial attitude towards the southern fraternal republics (no, Slovenians will never admit that), an avalanche of amateurish interpretations of our heroic history took hold. <p/> Suddenly, we became the only nation to have preserved the tradition of Titoism. Only in Slovenia is the attitude towards Josip Broz markedly positive, and the memories of the SFRY bright and nostalgic. <p/> What is the reason for this, why is it so? <p/> Probably from our social pathology. Because other, much larger and more historic nations, which have the historical traumas of the 20th century, face similar problems in evaluating their psychopathic leaders - regardless of the degree of their autocracy. The Spanish, for example, with Franco. But Franco was at least as benevolent a dictator as our Tito. <p/>The Italians did not come clean with Mussolini. Partly because of a horribly incorrect education system which has not yet established the right degree of critical distance from the fascist period. <p/> The Russians are reviving the cult of the Georgian Stalin. They, too, have freaks dressing up in uniforms just like those worn by the Generalissimo with the moustache and going around, addressing people, appearing at obscure and less obscure events, pinching children's cheeks and saying that they are Stalin. <p/>Sick. But in societies that have not come clean about their traumas and fears, it happens. There is not such a big difference between Russia and Slovenia in this respect. <p/> The only reason Germans can't openly emulate Hitler (except right-wing extremists, whose political activities are largely banned) is because they have been sent through a process of denazification by their Western allies. The Austrians got away with it, hence Haider. <p/> There are more problems with the Slovenes. I have already written about this. The worse the present, the better the memories of the past. Since there can be no biological link with Titoism in the younger generations, institutionalised nostalgia for the old days is reinforced. This is no longer an innocent joke perpetrated by a certain Godnič. The revival of memories of the Day of Youth and the Titoist relay is a phenomenon per se. It is yet more proof of how lost, hopeless and pre-oedipal our 'liberal' and 'democratic' society is. <p/> So that there is no misunderstanding: the cult of Tito, of Franco or of Mussolini should be cultivated by people in peace in their own homes and, for my sake, in their cellars. In their private lives, they can do whatever they want. They cannot do it in public, or even within the framework of public institutions. <p/> Can you imagine if we had been lamenting Titoism in 1988 or 1992? Of course not. Only a few radicals did it then. Most Slovenians were happy to be out of the SFRY and out of the poverty of a failing country. <p/>Why, then, does it feel different today? Because of the economic and social situation? Certainly, the middle class is already or will soon be impoverished, more and more people are living on the poverty line, and in such a crisis situation it is understandable to recall times that most people no longer even remember, but are considered socially just (nobody went hungry, everybody was employed and similar wingnuts). But only in a society that is still a long way from maturity. Only in a country that is not aware of the foundations of its statehood. <p/> The idolatry of Titoism and the cult of personality is not irrational, as many people think. In my view, it all comes together in the context of Slovenian social pathology. We lived a relatively comfortable life materially and socially in the SFRY. The party elite in general. When the system collapsed because it was based on economically unsustainable assumptions, we decided to try capitalism. <p/> Capitalism has not worked very well in Slovenia. A friend of mine, who is a top workaholic and manager, says that the reason it has not is that the Slovenes have been 'Balkanised' by Yugoslavia and simply do not want to work any more. <p/> That is probably true to a certain extent. But the key problem of the hysteria about Tito and the Day of Youth can be identified very easily: as a country we have no identity, as a nation we have no will and no energy. <We really do not deserve a country of our own. And to paraphrase our beloved Titoists, Josip Broz would never have given it to us either. <Josip Broz symbolises socialist Yugoslavia after the Second World War: the reconstruction and construction of a war-torn country, socialist self-management, resistance to Stalin and the policy of non-alignment. It symbolises peace and full employment. On the other hand, it symbolises the cult of personality, the Naked Island, the beheading of liberals and the post-war killings. Under his leadership, Yugoslavia enjoyed great prestige in the world, and he will be remembered as an exceptional statesman. <p/> Špela Šipek, editor <p/> I think most people remember Tito as the figure of the commander who led the partisan army to victory over the fascist invaders and traitors. He symbolises the figure on the pedestal through which the PR machine promoted positive values such as comradeship, brotherhood, education, strengthening of mind and body. And, on the other hand, it symbolises the crime against those killed immediately after the end of the war and the persecuted political opponents. It thus symbolises the trauma of a part of the Slovene nation whose ancestors were killed or imprisoned, and of a part of the Slovene nation that is proud of its resistance against fascism. Although Josip Broz-Tito symbolises the past in its entirety, he also symbolises the division of the Slovenian nation, which is no less fervent now than it was twenty or sixty years ago. <p/> Janez Furman, parish priest <p/> Broz and Kardelj once came to the cross while walking along Brdo and looked up at Christ. Edi begins to explain how their lives were not always exemplary, yet they had come so far and this poor man had worked for the good of mankind and finally ended up on the cross. The marshal replies, ""Eddie, when we die, they will have no nails. ""And indeed, at the time of their deaths, you had a hard time coming up with nails. Before a critical historical distance can place Tito in the real context of his era, there will be spears being broken about his personality and his time in charge of the late SFRY. The abuse and the immature view of democracy have led many to associate the Marshal's figure as a mythical hero. Others who survived the Naked Island or any other repression would have erected a memorial to his sacrifice. Despite his glorification, we are all ordinary mortals together. <p/> Nina Ivanič, actress <p/> It is difficult for me to answer this question objectively, because as a primary school pupil I was constantly listening to and learning about Tito as someone who was all goodness, honesty, heart, ability and I could go on and on. In our childhood eyes, he was a great hero and a man with a big heart. That is what we were taught, that is what we believed. But there are two sides to every story, and so there are two sides to Tito's story. Over the years, many things have been revealed and all the glamour around Tito has slowly dissipated. In my adult eyes, he now symbolises something quite different from all of the above. Behind the pretty veneer, there is often an ugly and dirty side. <p/> Jure Apih, columnist <p/> There is not one Tito, there are many Tito's. He is the locksmith apprentice from Zagorje who learned to play the piano without any schooling, who won a medal in sabre fencing from the Austrian army and danced with the Queen of England on his island. He is a Bolshevik agent who mysteriously survived Stalin's purges. He is the leader and marshal of the only real resistance army in the Second World War. He is the war criminal responsible for the greatest indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners and civilians in Europe. He is the only leader who dared to stand up to Stalin and to lead his people on a third path between socialism and capitalism, between one-man rule and self-rule. He is the historic spiritual leader of a non-aligned world, of more than half of humanity, and his funeral brought together a crowd of world leaders like never before. He was a thistle and a ""sweetheart white"". Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo is the apprentice against him. <p/> Irena Prijovic, economist <p/> JBT symbolises the leader of Yugoslavia. What this symbol means to whom depends on the individual. It depends on which generation one belongs to, whether one is and how one lived at that time, whether one is a foreigner or someone who was once a Yugoslav. It depends on how history is summarised and interpreted. Personally, I associate Tito with a peaceful childhood, my own ignorance and the kind of illusion we were living at the time. <p/> I have just returned from Berlin and I am still under the impression of the symbols of the divisions of post-war Germany in that city. While the East Germans demolished the wall for a long time in various ways, and once it physically fell, we ourselves paid the highest possible price by fighting a war on the premises of the former state. <p/> Dr. Samo Rugelj, columnist <p/> It depends for whom. For some of the older generation, Tito is often still a symbol of the ""good old days"", when life was more carefree, albeit with a lower standard of living and political monogamy, but without existential fears. To my generation, Tito was a great leader who was forged into heroic heights for us with stories and songs, but personally he is best remembered for his illness, his treatment at the Clinical Centre and his magnificent funeral. I no longer had any special emotional relationship with him: when I spent a good year in Belgrade a few years later in the army, I was not drawn to the House of Flowers, even though Slovenians like to go there. For the younger generations, our children, Tito is a textbook historical figure who led Yugoslavia, or the SFRY, and they need to think hard to remember what that acronym even means.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

Last time I was shopping in a shop in Litija in LJ (I won't advertise) I even got black nipples for 2mm, but luckily they gave me one nipple over, because it turned out that one of them was without a thread :-) <p/> Yeah, you'll probably have a lot of fun with that too. I find it very sad, though. I have no words at all. At least for the bikes they sell, they could have stock for all models, even past ones. I couldn't choose the colour, although black would have been spot on as you can see from the video. <p/> In principle, they have spokes in all bike shops, if they have a bike service next door. If they have a spoke that is the same as yours is another question. If your spoke thickness is the classic 2.0 mm there should be no problem, you just need to find out the length. <p/> Hi David, if you have a cracked spoke on the gear side you will have to remove them. otherwise it won't be possible.

SIPINA-E-SPEAKER consists of a Java GUI and several modules that provide the necessary operation and communication with the SIPINA system: for audio, the tcp/ip protocol, and the RTSP/MRCP communication protocol. For all interaction, the user needs nothing more than a microphone image. The microphone colouring and the audio signal signal the user when the system expects a response from him. While the system is playing the system message or information requested by the user, the microphone is inactive and does not allow control by the user. This ensures that the system speech is not recognised as user speech, which can be a problem with mobile terminals. <p/> The SIPINA-E-RECORDER is designed as a TCP/IP client. It consists of software to run on Android, Blackberry mobile phones, and also platforms such as tablets. The system is based on the Java programming language for mobile terminals.

The functionality of the individual modules is also described. <p/> SIPINA-E-RADER dialogue <p/> The dialogue in the SIPINA-E-RADER system is system-managed. The system defines the individual dialogue states and offers the user a set of choices in each dialogue state. The user can select from the given choices and thus determine the further course of the dialogue. The system messages, which are played to the user by the system in the form of voice messages, provide the user with all the necessary information to choose the continuation of the dialogue (self-declared system messages). The user can determine the continuation of the dialogue by speaking individual words or short phrases. The system messages include instructions on which words the user can use to continue the dialogue in a certain dialogue state. <p/> The user of the SIPINA E-BRALNIK system can choose between the following news sources: Radiotelevizija Slovenija, 24ur, Delo, Hefajst. For the selected source, the user can select the news areas covered by each source. The names of the areas for the selected source are transmitted by the system to the user in the form of a system voice message. At the same time, the speech recognition system's grammar (the set of words that the speech recognition system can recognise) is adapted to allow the recognition of the words of the areas of the selected source. The headline of the first news item of the selected source is then played after the selected area. The user can initiate the reading of a news item by saying the word ""read"" or the reading of the title of the next news item by saying the word ""next"". The user can trigger the reading of the title of the previous news by pronouncing the word ""back"".

When the ship finally returned to this ancient city by the sea, the animal made it ashore. Her parents disliked her even more from then on. And so the animal lives all alone in this hole in this ancient city by the sea! "" the mother finished. <p/> ""What about the animal papa? "" <p/> ""Since the animal has no teeth, it has to eat flies and worms,"" said the mother. <p/> ""Uh, I couldn't eat flies and worms! "" said the Little Goose. <p/> ""Yes, just be diligent, don't run away from home and don't show your tongue to anyone, don't sulk and don't get angry, and you'll be fine by me and your dad! It happens to naughty people that they have to go into a black hole. You see, for example, the fox, the badger, the mouse and the rat..."" <p/> ""That's right, Mum! I'll be diligent, not naughty like the badger and the fox! "" concluded the conversation of the Little Goose. <p/> GABRIELCA - the only child - wanted a brother. Since the maternity hospital no longer had any for her and she would have to stay on her own, she wanted at least an animal, be it a puppy, a kitten or a bird. Eventually she got to know all the dog breeds, but what she wanted most of all was a poodle - a curly-haired, ornamental city puppy, shaved to the lion's head, although she is afraid of anything that crawls and goes, and especially shakes when a larger dog appears and has to be picked up. <p/> Ata had to keep telling Gabrijelca that poodles, in particular, sucked in the house, they were a nuisance, as they were no guardians because they didn't dare to bite, and it was difficult with them if there wasn't a garden for them to run around and do their business by the fence, bush or tree. Such were Atos' contradictory teachings, but Gabrijelca only dreamt of a puppy. <p/>When she could already write, she wrote a letter to her teacher, Foltin, asking him to save one puppy - a little mix - for her to take on the bus home. She stuck the stamp on correctly, wrote the address and sent the letter. <p/> Teacher Foltin took her letter seriously. He brought the puppy - a baby - to the city himself, hoping that it would be well with Gabrijelca. <p/> Thus Gabrijelca's first wish came true: she became the proud owner of her beloved puppy. She named him Medo, because he was the most like a teddy bear. <p/> Of course, she had to show her teddy bear to all the children in the neighbourhood. They would all have loved to have a puppy like that, but this was hers. In time, she will teach him all sorts of arts and he will guard her faithfully in case a man with evil intentions ever comes, so she will make sure he is comfortable with her! <p/> Probably because Medo was from the country, he didn't know how to behave in the city in the first days and did the needful on the carpet. Mum patiently cleared the matter up. But as this happened several more times, she became unwilling. At night, Medo missed his mother's warmth and also craved her milk, so he cried and scratched at the door, so that his mother had to put him under the blankets, where he fell asleep, lying on his back like his father. <p/> But when all three of us had to leave the house in the morning, Medo whimpered sadly all morning and called for Gabrijelco. It would be like this all day long, so her mother started telling her that it couldn't go on like this, that the flat would start to smell, that the door would get more and more scratched and what else! She persisted for a few more days, but finally she ordered her to write to the teacher Foltin to come and get a puppy, because they couldn't have one. <p/> And Teacher Foltin wondered very much what the lovely animal had done to offend him so. And he really put Medek back in the car and drove him away. <p/> Gabrijelca silently endured her first sorrow. She realised that she could not have a puppy. To remember him, she pasted a colour photograph of herself with Medek in her arms into an album. <p/> ANIMAL <p/> Gabrijelca saw a tiny animal on top of a thistle. It was red with tiny spots all over its back and its head was all black. It was spinning around as if it did not know the way to the ground. It wanted to go somewhere higher, but it slipped on the ground. She crawled and crawled, up Gabrijelca's leg, onto her skirt, off her skirt onto her hand, and her hand right on the end of Gabrijelca's finger. No, she didn't bite her. <p/> As Gabrijelca was looking at her and she raised her finger to her eyes, the animal began to twist and turn. Then it lifted its two little caps, and spread its two transparent wings underneath, and it flew, high and far away - into the wide world. <p/> If only Gabrijelca could do all that! Her wing can barely stretch in the wind, but she cannot fly under the sky with it. Why is all this so? She would like to fly into the world that is for everyone... <p/> The animal was a ladybird. My father took a pen and wrote a poem after the ladybird. <p/> The little girl cries out to her. <p/> DRAGON <p/> In a hole in a wall made of big stones lived an animal - a little dragon. Perhaps he was the son of the great dragon that Ferdinand told us about. The little dragon was slipping from hole to hole, and supposedly had no other work to do. <p/> But a boy comes along with a bag. The dragon shows him his tongue and wants to go down the hole. The offended boy tears off his tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> But lo and behold: the next day, the little dragon shows his tongue again. The boy gets angry, tears off the tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> This is what the boy did on the third, fourth day of the holiday. When he had quite a few tails in his bag, he tied them together into one long tail, threw one end to a pig - over a cloud, climbed up on the cloud and looked at the world below him. He saw cities by the sea, ships and islands. So he sailed on a soft cloud around the world. And the sun warmed him so that he fell asleep. <p/> Apparently he was getting hungry. When he looked at the ground, he saw the old wall under him again. He crawled down on his bound tails towards the earth. He got to his feet right in front of the patisserie by the sea. He immediately ordered chocolate, blueberry and vanilla ice creams. He was about to bring it to his mouth when he woke up at home in bed. <p/> He wondered whether it was an illusion or the truth. <p/> BIRD <p/> If Gabrijelca wasn't allowed to have a puppy, she asked her mum and dad for a bird. One day, all three of them walked into a bird shop. <p/> Wow, there were so many cages and all kinds of parakeets: green, white and blue, and yellow, coloured and white canaries. And the turtledoves! They were hopping from stick to stick, swinging, flitting, climbing, chirping and singing to each other and huddling together in groups. Gabrijelca just opened her eyes, she would have loved to have them all, they were all equally cute. She chose the blue parrot, and my father had to reach into his pocket and they were marching with the little bird across the square and through the streets towards the idol. <p/> Mum set up the cage in the kitchen in the dining corner. My dad had told me to keep the cage open so that the bird wouldn't be locked in like a bandit. And it stayed that way. <p/> But the parakeet found nothing in the kitchen where he could sit down. It circled in the air in the shape of a figure of eight and landed on its cage, from where it surveyed its new surroundings, and when it got hungry or thirsty, it went to its home. <p/> Gabrijelca left the cleaning of the cage, the food and water to his mother and father. <p/> ""That's the way it is: children want something, but when they get it, they don't care about it anymore! "" the father declaimed. <p/> Gabrijelca waited for the parrot to start talking. She kept repeating some magic words to him, but the bird said nothing! The parrot, besides the cat, the dog, the horse and the elephant, must be an extremely clever witness, but you just have to understand it. And that they were poor birds who had to live in cigarette smoke and chirp to the company inside until midnight. He also thought that bird talk certainly meant nothing, because even human conversations often have no head or tail. He told Gabriélica to leave the bird alone, to behave itself. <p/> Well, he soon learned to fly on the toes of the atu. The atta brought an empty flower pot into the kitchen, which he liked to sit on and look around the kitchen, but he didn't like to go into the room. Over time, he would shriek if the tap dripped water, if the pot started to boil and when all three of them left the house. He watched carefully from a distance as his mother cleaned his cage. He also knew Gabrijelco and had become a member of the family. <p/> As Gabrijelca thought the bird was a bit lonely, she started to nag him to get a mate. One day, she and her mother brought home a brown-headed nuthatch. <p/> Dad looked down from under his forehead. But because he had had a dove when he was young, she was allowed to stay in the house. <p/> The parakeet was also looking at it from under his forehead. Curiosity or even jealousy drove him to visit the dove. Perhaps she was a threat to his kingdom. How he marvelled when the little bird tried to sing to him. He flew to her cage, tickled her with his beak and teased her until she ran out of the cage. Gentle and patient, she waited for her return, for the parrot to stop reigning on her chopsticks and eating her food. In the following days she wanted to return the visit, but she was not allowed in his cage. <p/> There was too much ghost on her throat, too much cleaning and worrying for both of them. Mum told Attu that one of the birds had to leave the house. <p/> ""The throat will have to go! "" the mother announced to Gabrijelci. Once, when her daughter wasn't home, she grabbed the cage and took it to the bird shop, saying: <p/> ""There you have it and keep it. Give it to whoever you want! ""And she was gone. <p/> The shop assistant was astonished. She watched for the strange woman, who disappeared down the nearest alleyway for hours. What was it about this lovely animal that she resented so much? What should she do with the bird: should she really give it away or sell it again? she thought. She had indeed sold it once. <p/> Dad had a few words of anger about Mum's hastiness. Mom just said: <p/> ""That's not the way it goes anymore! ""<p/> THE DEATH OF A DOG <p/> Four times Koki was very sad: when Gabrijelca went to the seaside with her mother and Ata for a holiday and he had to stay with strangers he didn't know and wasn't used to his new surroundings, even though he was doing well. <p/> But one day, at the beginning of his fifth year, he fell off his stick in his cage and lay on his back - dead. The zookeeper found that he had suffered a heart attack because his father had given him biscuits. All three of them mourned him. <p/> Gabrijelca respectfully buried the corpse, wrapped in newsprint, against the wall in the yard. She lined the grave with pebbles and placed a small wreath in the middle. <p/> One day, Gabrijelca cried convulsively. Through their tears, her father and mother found out that someone had vandalised Koki's grave, scattering flowers, a wreath and pebbles. She said she would complain about this barbarity at the residents' meeting. Her father and mother told her that if she told them that her Koki was buried in the grave, it must have been the naughty children who had done it. When her father asked her if Kokki's corpse had also been kicked out, she nodded and felt somewhat comforted. She herself went to dig him up and brought him to the balcony, where she buried him again in a flower trough, and on the new grave she put the first flowers of spring, and a new wreath, and stuck a wooden cross with a veil from one of her mother's dresses in the finger. One evening in mid-March, she lit two candles for him. The two little flames flickered beautifully, illuminating the walls of the balcony. <p/> The memory of Kokec lives on in the family. The corner where he made his home is now empty. They still feel that he will sing and fly on Gabrijelca's head.",Prose/Lyrical,dev

Matjaž Ambrožič (* 1967), after graduating from the social science and language gymnasium and serving his military service, began his theological studies at the Faculty of Theology in Ljubljana in 1987. He was ordained a priest in 1993. He first worked as a chaplain in Kočevje (1993-1996) and in Novo mesto - Šmihel (1996-1996). In the autumn of 1997 he went to Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he completed his post-graduate studies at the Faculty of Church History and received his doctorate in 2002. Then he was a spiritual assistant in Vrhnika (2001 - 2004) and today he works in the parish of Ljubljana - Stožice (2004 -). He is engaged in scientific research and lecturing at the TEOF of the University of Ljubljana and at its Unit in Maribor (assistant 2001, assistant professor 2004). His scientific and research activity is devoted to the field of local church and world history, as well as art history. He also spends a lot of time studying archival material. The results of Ambrožič's scientific research activity are mainly scientific monographs and treatises: - Bell Ringing in Slovenia, AES 15 (1993) - Il ruolo ecclesiastico, culturale e politico di dott. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar (1811-1884), Principe-vescovo di Lubiana, nella storia degli Sloveni, Roma 2002 - The Bishop of Ljubljana, Dr. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar.

410,"Some time ago I decided to go in for rainwater tanks. Since I have a garden, and since last year - as usual - the water ran out, and I intend to enlarge the garden this year, I had no choice but to buy this thing and get water for the rainy days. First of all, I was looking at flea cisterns. Then I sent out some enquiries for new cisterns. Finally, I found black tanks, the price was good, and I bought two. As the seller was willing to bring the two tanks to me, I squeezed his hand for another EUR 10 for the transport and the deal was done. Then the work began. <p/> On the first day we dug up one huge bush. We not only dug it up, we also broke it down into several smaller ones and on the second day we planted these smaller bushes by the road in another part of the garden. The next day we dug up the ornamental grass and planted it also in smaller pieces in another part of the garden (nothing goes away here). On the third day, we dug the soil for the trellis I had imagined. As the ground is uneven and I want the cisterns to be higher than the ground, they had to be raised. On the fourth day we made the trusses and then waited five days for 4 euros so that we could buy two knees for the gutter and finish the job. <p/> We waited five days for those 4 euros... :) You don't know whether to laugh or cry. On Tuesday I went to the ATM to see if by any chance any virtual money had come in, and yesterday when I checked again, it said that the card was blocked. Oops... the money was in the account, but how to get it and what happened on that night from Tuesday to Wednesday, I wondered. Lo and behold, the execution from Durs arrived. The contributions for the Social Insurance Institution, which I hadn't paid by the due date. I knew that would be the case, but I was kind of hoping that I would get the EUR 600 I had left (I had already paid EUR 700) before they remembered me. The important thing is that I paid the loan and that I still have some money left for the essentials, and the EUR 120 that the banks have charged me for the blocking, the execution and the costs, I will also have to swallow. In short, when I got the 4 euros, we could finish the job. Thank you... <p/> I know, yes, the plastic is not very pretty to look at, but I'm going to do some studying. First I need to see how the inox or whatever is around this plate heats up, then I'll either just cover the tanks with bamboo or plant some ivy around it. In any case, it will not stay as it is. Otherwise, I like it. The garden is right next door, the v-tank holds 1000 l, and the field is a little further on. It has to grow like a ludo, I would say.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

425,"How to buy a phone <p/> A normal smartphone is the same in hardware as a computer from a few years ago. Because we always have it with us, it is a powerful productive tool that is always at our disposal. Computers have made us more efficient, why not smartphones? <p/> With hundreds of millions of smart devices and the same (if not less) productivity, the main question that arises is whether it might all be too much? We carry a games console, a web station, a music box, a mailbox, a navigation system and the list goes on. Too often, we choose a phone because it is overloaded with features, and we end up using only five per cent of the hardware and software. The situation is reminiscent of the power ratio in word processors, where Microsoft Word is still the leader, even though most of us use only a handful of bundled features that could easily be covered by any free alternative. As with tablets, the most important thing is to know what we want from a smartphone. <p/> Choosing a smartphone is, at first sight, very similar to deciding on a tablet companion. The operating systems are almost all the same, they have the same applications, advantages and disadvantages. In principle, there is no difference between a phone and a tablet. In addition, it is wise to have both devices in the same camp, so that we do not buy apps twice and do not catch ourselves while working with the user interface. Unfortunately, it turns out in practice that smartphone buyers do not make their choices based on hardware. When they buy, they often even overlook the attractive design and usability of the bundled apps, because the pace at which devices fly off the shelves is dictated by mobile operators, which is why sales figures for different phones vary so much from country to country. If the country's biggest mobile operator drops the price of the best Finnish Nokia model to one euro at the time of bundling, it will outperform, say, Samsung's champion overnight, even though the Korean sells like hotcakes around the world and nobody wants a Scandinavian Windows phone despite its excellence.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

444,"Frames for your posters <p/> There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering poster frames. We also need to consider where the frames and posters will be placed. If it is a marketing poster that will be installed outside, you need to be aware that it will be exposed to the weather. It is wise in this case to purchase waterproof frames so that the first storm does not destroy the posters, because in this case our efforts would be for nothing. The easiest way to find quality poster frames is online, as there are many quality manufacturers (3d art). Of course, it is always best to choose one where you can see at first glance a good price/quality ratio. Frames also differ in a few other ways, mainly in terms of where they will be hung. So you can choose from shop window frames, wall frames, hanging frames and, wouldn't you believe it, car frames. In fact, larger vehicles can be fitted with frames designed for marketing posters. Not only are frames made in traditional sizes, but you can also adjust the size of the frames to suit your needs and your poster format. Nowadays, it is well known that designers love to be creative and for creative posters you will also need creative frames. It is for the latter that some companies specialising in the production of marketing accessories will be able to help you and provide you with what you expect at the best prices. You should also consider that the frames will be functional and that you will be able to easily change the posters on display.",Instruction,dev

Why don't they do it in the morning! ! ? ? <p/> I would ask for the following clarifications: <p/> Does the Municipality of Celje know about this problem? <p/> Why the Environment and Spatial Planning Inspectorate does not act or did not act when the occupancy permit was issued. <p/> Comments (1) <p/> 06 July 2006 at 09:38 <p/> You have contacted the Municipality of Celje with questions that we cannot answer accurately. There are several companies operating in the area of the former Štore ironworks: Steel Štore (formerly Inexa Štore d.o.o.), Valji d.o.o., Energetika d.o.o., Kovis Livarna d.o.o., ITRO Štore. The control of emissions from these facilities is not carried out by the Municipality of Celje, but by the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Inspectorate for the Environment and Spatial Planning, Unit Celje, Krekov trg 9, 3000 Celje. The Inspectorate is responsible both for controlling emissions from technological installations and for verifying whether the installation has an occupancy permit in accordance with the Building Construction Act. You are advised to address your questions to them. The inspectorate also has information on which undertakings are operating in compliance with the regulations and which have yet to bring their operations into line. According to Article 172 of the Environmental Protection Act, companies will have to obtain an environmental permit for installations that may cause pollution on a large scale by 31 October 2007. The law stipulates that if an undertaking fails to obtain an environmental permit by the prescribed deadline, the Ministry will issue a decision on the cessation of the operation of the installation.",Other,dev

Although there is a lot of talk about it being a commercial hill, it just coughs a bit and buries you in its bowels. Just like any other. This has nothing to do with the topic, but it occurred to me, when I was talking about Clement and Jake: do you remember that you were the first professional mountaineer, not only in YU, but far and wide? We went once with my dad to the Stol and on the slopes of the Maly Stol the mountain started to, um ... swell you up. And foter promised you 5 jur for reaching the top.

459,"Match Preview: Real Madrid-Borussia Dortmund <p/> Real Madrid, who have won seven consecutive Champions League matches at home, will take on the Bundesliga champions in tonight's match. The aim is to win three more points to regain top spot in the group two rounds before the end of this competition. <p/> Real Madrid return to the Champions League with the aim of regaining top spot in Group D after their match against Borussia Dortmund (20:45). The Whites will be looking to capitalise on the unconditional support of their fans, who are literally overwhelmed by such Champions League matches and who will be cheering the White Ballet on to an eighth consecutive European victory at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spanish league champions and top scorers in this year's Champions League will take on the winners of last year's Bundesliga and one of the few teams still undefeated in this year's European competition tonight. The importance of the opponent and the objective of reaching the top of the group again two rounds before the end of this part of the competition makes this match extremely serious and predicts one of the most interesting evenings in European football. <p/> More than a month and a half after their first Champions League match, Real Madrid will play their second match in this competition on home soil. The Whites will take on Borussia Dortmund with the aim of winning and returning to the top of the Group D standings two rounds before the end of the group stage. If they beat the German side, they will lead the standings by two points over Dortmund, but Real then have two more games to play: Manchester City away and Ajax at home. <p/> GROUP D <p/> City <p/> Team <p/> W <p/> N <p/> P <p/> Gd <p/> Gr <p/> Points <p/> 1 <p/> Borussia Dortmund <p/> 2 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 4 <p/> 2 <p/> 2 <p/> 7 <p/> 2 <p/> Real Madrid <p/> 2 <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 8 <p/> 5 <p/> 3 <p/> 6 <p/> 3 <p/> 3 <p/> Ajax Amsterdam <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 0 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 6 <p/> - -2 <p/> 3 <p/> 4 <p/> Manchester City <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 7 <p/> -3 <p/> 1 <p/> Another unwavering connection between the team and the fans at the Santiago Bernabeu will help the Whites to reach their goal.

The French striker, on the other hand, will be a notable absentee for Real, but despite that, this team has proven its attacking power on several occasions. In fact, Real's goal scoring in this competition is something to remember. The Real Madrid team has the highest number of goals in this competition (8 goals) and Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored five of them, is currently the top scorer in the Champions League this season. <p/> Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga champions in the previous two seasons, are not doing so well at home this season, finishing in fifth place with 16 points, 11 behind leaders Bayern.

462,"Movember: Cancer facts and misconceptions <p/> To raise awareness about men's health, Playboy Hall of Fame hockey players asked passers-by, acquaintances and friends what they knew about cancer. They chose 10 interesting statements and asked an expert in oncology, MSc. Mirjana Rajer, MD, PhD, who explained and justified whether the claims were fact or fallacy. <p/> 1. Cancer treatment is more stressful than the disease itself. <p/> Fallacy. Of course, treatment has its co-morbidities, but it cannot be said that treatment is more exhausting than the disease itself. The argument comes from history, when so-called 'supportive care' was not so developed and, for example, patients who received chemotherapy vomited profusely. Nowadays, we have very effective drugs to prevent this. But it is also true that patients often attribute problems to the treatment that are not really caused by it. It is easier for the patient to find the 'culprit' in the treatment. An example might be a patient who is having radiation to the chest area and has pain in his legs. The patient is more likely to think that the radiation treatment is to blame than, for example, that the vascular problems in the legs are the real cause. Nowadays, treatment is more tailored to the patient than ever before. If a patient is going to undergo a strenuous treatment, we talk to them beforehand, explain why it is necessary and they say whether or not they agree with what is proposed. <p/> 2. Any form of cancer is incurable. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are nowadays completely curable. Especially if the disease is detected at an early stage and treated as soon as possible. Rather, we can say that all cancers are curable if they are detected early enough. More than half of all cancer patients are completely cured. Of course, we can also say that the glass is half empty and say that we do not cure half of them, but the results of treatment are getting better every year, and we are all working very hard to do that. <p/> 3. People who get cancer can only lie in bed and be passive. <p/> Fallacy. Patients are physically active to the best of their ability. Many people with cancer continue to lead an active life, which includes both daily chores and sport. Many patients keep in excellent shape, go hiking, dancing ... Cancer does not mean that a patient can just lie in bed. Patients are even encouraged to be active. However, we notice that it is often the relatives who restrict the patient, saying that he or she is not allowed to work in the garden, go out of the house or similar. The important thing is to talk to the doctor, which is usually the time when we resolve any dilemmas about the patient's activity. <p/> 4. Cancer is only curable if you are lucky. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are - especially if detected in time - completely curable. Prevention and early detection are key. People are not sufficiently aware of the importance of screening programmes such as SVIT (for bowel cancer), ZORA (cervical cancer) and DORA (breast cancer). The aim of these programmes is to detect cancer at an early stage, when it is still curable. I often hear that people have received an invitation to take part in SVIT and have thrown the invitation in the rubbish. But when they hear that someone has been diagnosed with cancer and cured through this programme, they dig through the rubbish to see if the invitation is still there, and they go and take part in the programme. <p/> 5. If there is no family history of cancer, then I am not interested in cancer. <p/> Fallacy. Heredity is only one factor and contributes to a small number of cancers. Most cancers are caused by other things, such as environmental damage, smoking, etc... So it is a mistake to think that if no one in the family has had cancer, we will not get it either. <p/> 6. Lung cancer is caused by smoking alone. <p/> Fallacy. Smoking is an important factor, but there are other factors: I am pointing out heredity, the polluted working environment, radon in buildings ... 15-20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. However, smoking is a risk factor that can be prevented, so raising awareness of the harmful effects of smoking is very important. <p/> 7. Chemotherapy is harmful to the body and is only in the interest of pharmaceutical companies. <p/> False. Chemotherapy is one of the established options for cancer treatment. But of course, every drug has side effects. It is an exaggeration to claim that chemotherapy is only in the interests of pharmaceutical companies. Ask a person who is healthy as a result of chemotherapy. <p/> Fact. It is true that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances of cure. At this point, I would like to stress once again the importance of screening programmes. People should take part in them in greater numbers than they do now. <p/> Fallacy. We starve ourselves before we starve cancer. Most cancer patients who are treated for cancer develop metabolic changes that lead to a metabolic stress state. Stress metabolism is also characterised by processes in which glucose is formed from the body's protein and fat stores. Insufficient food intake or starvation further accelerates glucose production. In this way, the body's deterioration in the face of cancer is further accelerated. This does not kill the cancer cells, as they are able to obtain sufficient energy and individual nutrients one way or another. <p/> On the contrary, we have a lot of scientific evidence that weight loss contributes to poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, adequate nutritional support of the cancer patient is part of the cancer treatment according to modern medical recommendations. <p/> You can also find out more about cancer itself and prevention at free lectures organised by Playboy Hall of Fame players as part of the MoGame event. Cancer, the disease of a hundred faces. The lecture will be given by oncologist Mag. Mirjana Rajer, oncologist, and Marija Vegelj Pirc, psychooncologist, and former football player Jaka Jakopič will share his personal experience of cancer.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

It was a lot of action! <p/> The sly smile of Dusan Lukic let me know that this was going to be drifting action. The task was even more interesting: to find drifters who would knife each other.

494,"Description: Urban areas are characterised by high environmental pressures due to high population and economic development. In the past, these were the result of industrial plants and individual combustion plants, but now they are largely the result of increasing road traffic. A good understanding of the air pollution situation caused by traffic in the city is a prerequisite for designing effective environmental protection programmes and planning measures to reduce excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air. Emissions of pollutants from road traffic are difficult to measure and are therefore calculated on the basis of traffic data and vehicle category-specific emission factors. The methodologies used to control emissions from traffic differ in terms of input data, emission factors and the way emissions are calculated. Using the COPERT IV methodology, which is prescribed for national emissions reporting by the European Environment Agency but is less suitable for municipal reporting due to the difficulty of obtaining input data and the complexity of its application, we have determined emissions for the cities of Maribor and Celje. Based on the results of the COPERT methodology and data from the literature, we have developed a simplified methodology that requires less input data, is simple to use and at the same time efficient. Comparison of the results of the simplified methodology with the calculations of the COPERT IV methodology showed that the simplified methodology is suitable for estimating the total emissions of CO, NOx and PM10 pollutants from road traffic for the whole city of Maribor and smaller urban areas, and it is also suitable for estimating the CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic by vehicle category for urban areas with a number of registered vehicles above 20,000 and for estimating the total CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic for smaller Slovenian cities. Due to the expected changes in the structure of vehicles in cities, the simplified methodology should be reviewed and upgraded every three years Found in: keywords Summary of found:...

If you have the option, even find two separate businesses: one B2B and one B2C. And ideally, separate the businesses by more than one country. <p/> 2. Work from the heart <p/> If you don't enjoy what you are doing, quit because you will lack the energy to ""pull"" it forward. <p/> 3. Not every client is worth the energy <p/> Big clients are not always manna from heaven. Appreciate the clients you work and work well with, as the work will be mutually satisfying and get done faster. The surprise follows - such clients are usually even more profitable! <p/> 4. Plan your finances <p/> If you manage your cash flow, you can anticipate problems and investment opportunities in advance. I started out using a simple Excel spreadsheet with expected income and expenditure. It is always possible to get good terms if you say exactly when you will be paid and your clients trust you. <p/> Money earned from the business is not yours!

611,"Front page / Current / Columns / Column: If fish could talk <p/> 08.02.2021 <p/> COLUMN DZZŽ NOVO MESTO <p/> Last month I discussed children's desire for an animal friend and how sometimes parents recklessly choose an animal to please their child. In the meantime, I also touched on goldfish in passing, which reminded me that fish actually deserve a column of their own. They are animals that are often misunderstood, inadequately treated and poorly cared for. <p/> Although most people think otherwise, fish also feel pain and fear. In fact, they are quite complex creatures that experience the world in much the same way as we do. This means that we need to arrange their environment in a way that keeps them relaxed and healthy. But what kind of environment is suitable for fish? <p/> This question creates an ""Emmental effect"" - more cheese, more holes, i.e. it offers more new questions than answers. Aquaristics is a rather complex and very large field and it is impossible to answer such a question in a few short sentences. Therefore, this article is by no means an aquarist's handbook, but only a cursory attempt to encourage you to take a responsible approach to aquaristics. <p/> It is actually a matter of imitating as closely as possible the environment in which a particular species of fish is found in the wild. So, before setting up a new aquarium, we need to consider the needs of a particular organism or choose a species that we can make comfortable in our aquarium. So what are the characteristics of a 'good' aquarium? <p/> First and foremost, the aquarium must be the right shape and size. Here I can mention goldfish, which are a textbook example of aquatic organisms that are most often found in a totally inappropriate environment. The goldfish, Carassius auratus auratus, originates from China, grows as large as 30-40 cm, and is a schooling fish, which means that we need to stock at least 5-10 specimens in total. It logically follows that these fish are only suitable for large, outdoor ponds and that there are not many that can be suitably housed in an aquarium in an apartment. I should add that they have a very long life span, living for several decades, and they are also very intelligent and can be taught tricks. If they could talk, what would all those poor little goldfish crammed into too small containers have to say? Of course, it is understandable that we do not have unlimited space for huge aquariums at home, and there is nothing wrong with that. In this case, however, we simply have to choose a species of fish that is comfortable in a smaller aquarium. <p/> Water properties are also very important. Water can be hard or soft, basic or acidic. Hard water is water in which a lot of minerals are dissolved. Tap water in Slovenia is often quite hard (have you noticed how quickly limescale builds up in the bathroom?), but a large proportion of ornamental aquarium fish are soft-water fish - in nature they live in waters with few dissolved minerals. If a fish is living in water that is not of a suitable quality (for example, a soft-water fish living in hard water, or water that is not of a good quality due to insufficient filtration), this is stressful for the fish. Prolonged presence of stress hormones leads to failure of internal organs and metabolism. One example of a fish that most people are familiar with, at least in appearance, and which is often stocked in unsuitable aquariums is the Siamese fighting fish, the betta. This type of fish needs very soft, slightly acidic water and lots of the right plants, so water from our taps is not usually suitable for them. Before we introduce organisms, we need to check the parameters of our water and adapt it to the needs of our aquatic sub-tenants, or rather, choose ones that can live in the water we have. <p/> Another very important thing for any healthy aquarium is a biologically stable filter. Filtration in an aquarium is not as simple as most people imagine. It is not just a matter of dirt particles getting stuck in the filter material and then being washed off. Filtration must also, and above all, be biological, which means that the filter and other surfaces in the aquarium are inhabited by beneficial bacteria that break down food debris, fish poo and plant debris, thus improving water quality. This filtration does not happen overnight, of course, and the bacteria need time to multiply sufficiently. From the first day we start the aquarium, it will be at least two weeks or more before it is stable enough for fish to settle in. Changes in the water parameters should be monitored regularly (with tests for nitrite, nitrate, ammonia). The values will first rise and then fall back - at that point the aquarium is established, or as aquarists put it - sciklan. <p/> In addition to the above, the choice of decoration, plants and combinations of organisms that can coexist together is also important. Of course, plastics are largely avoided in favour of natural materials (wood, stone), but which ones and how much depends on the individual fish species. The right plants are also an important part of a healthy aquarium and it is generally recommended to keep the aquarium as overgrown as possible (except, of course, when you have fish that also live in a plant-free environment in the wild). Often, aquariums are decorated with boats, treasure chests, castles and similar kitsch, which, of course, have nothing to do with the fish and their natural environment. <p/> Like all other animals, we have a duty to look after fish and other aquatic organisms in a way that makes them feel good. This is not only a moral but also a legal duty for all animal owners. Unfortunately, our wishes and aesthetics are last on the list of priorities when it comes to aquarium design. If we cannot accept this fact, then we can consider another hobby. Let's ask ourselves what the fish would tell us if they could talk. <p/> Anyone interested in learning more about aquaristics, aquatic organisms, choosing and setting up an aquarium can find a lot of useful information online, for example on the Alfa in betta blog, and in various Facebook groups, such as Aquarstika Slovenia - Bojan Dolenc.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

When conducting penetration tests, an ethical hacker avoids doing any harm, stealing data or deliberately disabling services, because we know that there are types of attacks that can temporarily disable a website. <p/> More vulnerabilities every day <p/> The fact that the number of intrusions is increasing does not mean that ethical hackers have more work to do. Špehonja explains that there is another constant here, as companies, both large and small, are not even aware yet of what data loss means in concrete terms. ""There is a big step to be taken here to make companies more aware. There are more vulnerabilities every day, and if an administrator falls asleep, there's no need for anyone to go after that company specifically. There are Chinese, there are Pakistanis, there are Nigerians who automatically scan the internet, public IPs, all day long. As soon as they realise that a particular system is vulnerable, an automation is running in the background to exploit that vulnerability and cause your system to be used for further attacks to mask the real attacker."" <p/> The problem lies in the belief of those in charge at many companies, who often wrongly assume that their data is of no interest to attackers. What is interesting are their computers, which hackers then exploit as bots for further attacks, explains Špehonja, who adds that while security starts with passwords, it is the human factor that he believes should be better educated in computer security. ""Safe use of the Internet seems to be a given. This is why children in school and kindergarten are not given enough emphasis on safe use of the internet, and the trends of online scams and scammers are on the rise,"" he explains, adding that, after all, you can get one email, click on a link, open a little program, and you are already infected and can lose all your data or, in the worst case, even suffer financial damage. <p/> Don't use keys found on the ground <p/> In the case of attacks on large companies, such as the ones we have seen recently, these are well-planned attacks that take months to plan, and the attackers usually send an insider. Often the hackers' work is made easier by the ""human factor"", whether it is misconfigured fire security or users clicking on them, and often hackers leave USB sticks in car parks for example, which are then found and used by employees, even though, as the ethical hacker explains, the ISO 27001 security policy states that sticks found on the ground are not to be inserted into company computers. ""These are all methods that are tested by attackers and sooner or later someone makes a mistake that opens the door to the company,"" concludes Špehonja. <p/> Anonymous well paid from behind the scenes <p/> When asked about the workings of Anonymous, the ethical hacker believes that it is a group that is well paid and run by someone, just like there are various viruses that are written specifically for the Middle East, which after seven years are found to have been funded by certain governments. ""My personal opinion is that the main men are funded by a certain side to carry out certain attacks. Of course, this is also a trend among young people, to be Anonymous and to put a mask on Facebook. It's a subculture that is being exploited. Anonymous has a whole bunch of programmes of its own, but there is also a double-edged sword here. You decide as a teenager to be a member of Anonymous, you use their program, which really gives you some advantages, because they teach you how to ""shekat"" a certain thing, which you would otherwise also get on the Internet, but by doing that you put your computer at risk, because you don't know if that little program was clean and if maybe your computer is already in the process of being prepared for some DDoS attack that they are doing in the background,"" explains Špehonja. <p/> Hackers in movies and in reality <p/> The movie Hacker is currently playing in cinemas.Visualising an intrusion is always a particularly challenging task, often with user interfaces that are either very graphically sophisticated or a simple DOS window with opaque program code or numbers flying by extremely fast. Spehonja explains how far this is from reality by saying that ""those numbers, those codes flying around, are usually laughed at by those of us who are in the field."" The IP 352.612.x.x is nonsense, because there is no such thing as a number greater than 255. ""As far as critical infrastructure is concerned, the degradation of water, transport infrastructure, electricity, etc. I would be careful what to say here, but it is also a possible attack. Of course it is possible, but of course it is more difficult. Such an attack would, of course, take a long time to prepare for, but the theoretical possibilities are there. After all, some people say that everything can be faked. Some people spend all day just writing programs that hack into other programs,"" adds the ethical hacker, who sees the movie scenes as being mostly exaggerated.",Information/Explanation,dev

622,"My living room soothes me <p/> I decided to write a little about my favourite room. Since I am a man, it is definitely not the kitchen but the living room. Probably every one of us has a room in which we relax the best and easiest, and for me it's definitely my living room, which I have furnished to suit my needs. I remember that when I was buying a new living room, I spent an enormous amount of time, because I was quite a demanding buyer. Every man will probably agree that there is nothing better than half-lounging in front of the television in your living room and enjoying watching football, laughing while listening to politicians or simply watching one of the popular science channels. I have the habit of sometimes using my living room for reading, because I like to read a lot. It is also the case in our house that the living room is where we spend most of our time when we are not working, of course. But I am one of those people who does not like to visit my living room, because I am of the opinion that living rooms are in a way too private a place to invite friends into. After all, there is nothing more reassuring to me than being able to lie down in front of the television in my living room in just my underpants. <p/> Living room ideas <p/> Sometimes a friend asks me where I got the idea for my original living room. My living room is custom-made, and most of the time it's a collection of all the best ideas I've got from different furniture catalogues. I have to admit that I like the Scandinavian type of furniture because everything is made of wood, and that's what my living room is. Wooden living rooms are something special for me. It is the wood that gives the living room warmth and makes it feel homely. <p/> Sometimes you can get a good idea in the furniture showrooms themselves. Maybe you should go to a furniture showroom on a Saturday morning and see what kind of living rooms they have on display. Sometimes you will get an incredible amount of ideas. But I recommend you go to the bigger centres where there will be dozens of living rooms on display. <p/>This entry was posted in Home and Garden and tagged living rooms.

629,"""Smart working villages"" are now a new trend in Italy. And local authorities are trying to take advantage of the opportunities offered by internet access, which makes teleworking possible for anyone who only needs a computer. <p/> During the pandemic, teleworking has taken off, which means that many people work from home, on weekends or even somewhere on the coast on the other side of the world. Two Italian cities are even offering to pay anyone willing to move in and continue working remotely from a new address, CNN reports. <p/> The municipal authorities in Santi Fiori in Tuscany and Rieti in Lazio are willing to cover half the rent for anyone willing to move to the two cities for a long period of time to work remotely. Rents are already quite low, which makes the offer all the more tempting. But like any other, this one is not without requirements: anyone planning to move here must have a regular job. <p/> Italy - compared to other European countries - has been hit hard by the new coronavirus and the economic and tourism recovery will take several years. But with teleworking, Italians have also started to move to areas and cities that were previously facing out-migration. Smaller, almost deserted towns are now full of life. Italy has thus killed two birds with one stone - as well as revitalising certain areas, there are now fewer people in the larger cities, so the spread of the virus is slowing down, reports CNN. <p/> Santi Fiori, a town near the wine paradise of Val D'Orcia and Siena, is currently home to just 2 500 people. Mayor Federico Balocchi believes that modern technology and teleworking offer the possibility of revitalising his hometown. Rents in Santa Fiora currently range between 300 and 500 euros per month, and the municipality is willing to cover up to 200 euros of rent. This means that prospective tenants could live in the town for two to six months for as little as €100 a month. <p/> There is a choice of apartments in stone houses in the town centre and comfortable villas on the outskirts. The local authorities invite interested parties to visit their website to see all the properties currently available. The town has recently developed a good internet connection and several points where the World Wide Web can be accessed free of charge.

646,"The Secret World of Geisha <p/> A geisha is a Japanese artist who presents traditional Japanese arts. <p/> On our trip to Japan, we saw their dances and learned about some of the Japanese arts. <p/> The term geisha is made up of the words GEI (arts or arts) and SHA (person), comes from the Tokyo dialect and has been adopted from there into European languages. Geisha is called hangyoku (semi-precious stones) in Tokyo and maiko (dancing girl) in Kyoto during training. <p/> Geisha flourished most in the 18th and 19th centuries, when their services were in great demand. After Meiji came to power, their role in preserving traditional Japanese art changed. <p/> As early as at least the 7th century, Japan was known for female artists known as saburuke, or what might be called maids. They were girls and wives who were left alone, husbands and boyfriends lost in fights and battles. Somehow they had to survive, some selling sexual favours, while others, more educated, made a living entertaining guests at high society social gatherings. When the Emperor moved to present-day Kyoto in 794, the conditions were created for the start of Japanese geisha culture and soon afterwards these girls became synonymous with the beauty-obsessed elite. <p/> In traditional Japanese culture, men were not restricted from being faithful to their wives. The ideal wife, even of the upper classes, was a modest mother and head of the home. According to Confucius, love is of secondary importance. Men sought sexual pleasure and romantic liaisons not from their wives but from courtesans. From the 17th century, the shogunates had their pleasure quarters, outside of which prostitution was illegal. In these quarters, the yoyo ""actresses"" were ranked and licensed. The highest class of yujois, the forerunners of the geisha, were called tayuuje. They were both actresses and prostitutes, performing erotic dances and skits. <p/> In the 18th century, geisha appear. These pleasure quarters soon became glamorous entertainment centres offering more than just sex. The highly sophisticated courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing and playing music. Some became renowned poets and calligraphers. Gradually, they specialised in a new profession and pursued art and entertainment. The first geishas were men who entertained waiting customers to meet the most popular and talented courtesans. <p/> The rise of the geisha began at the end of the 18th century. Geishas worked in pleasure quarters, were actually imprisoned and were strictly forbidden to sell sexual favours to protect the business of courtesans. While licensed courtesans provided men with sex, geishas occupied a special niche as artists and learned female companions. <p/> At the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, geisha became a female profession and the notorious courtesans went out of fashion. Soon geisha developed their own style of dress and their trends were emulated by fashionable women from all walks of Japanese society. Geishas also began to rank, with some geishas still offering sexual favours, while others strictly entertained their guests with art. <p/> The geisha were dealt a severe blow with the end of the Second World War, when a general mobilisation was declared in Japan and everyone had to work in the fields and factories. Geishas also lost their reputation because some prostitutes pretended to be geishas when they met American soldiers. After the war, few returned to the geisha districts, rejecting the Western influence and returning to their traditional way of life and art, because the status of geisha was shaped by Japan's feudal past, and they maintain the traditional standards of their profession by this way of life if they want to remain geisha. <p/> There is no doubt that in the past, young geishas were also subjected to forced sexual relations and that their virginity was auctioned. After Japan lost World War II, the geishas were displaced and their reputation declined. With Japan's economic boom in the 1960s, the world and the status of geishas also changed. In modern Japan, young geisha are not forced to have sex and their sex life is a private matter. <p/> Is Japan a country where you would go on holiday?

The numerical program that determined the position of the mobiles was selected on the basis of all possible 11-digit combinations of the characters 0 and 1, with the condition that they are in the ratio 5:6 and that the rows so selected follow each other in the original order, starting with the most uniform combination (1010101010101) until the given space is filled. Odd rows of the programme are read from left to right, even rows vice versa. The mobiles consisted of four card-programmed series entitled ""Ear"", ""Rifle"", ""Matches"" and a series entitled ""Day"", which was also featured as a comic strip in Problems -PU, an issue devoted to programmed art. Part of the ""Programmed Ambient"" installation was also a ""Programmed Carpet"" on which a partial numerical programme was displayed. Programmed Ambient was first exhibited at the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana in April 1969, as part of the Atelier 69 exhibition. Iztok Geister described the notion of SERIES as: the Ohoian ideoagram as a network of two sets of things: the same and different. In the vertical, the same things are arranged in the horizontal into different things, into the most perfect and the simplest world at the same time. Text.",Information/Explanation,dev

745,"Well, come to my house for a visit...my child is currently a meat eater, so I'm almost worried, she's not interested in anything else...she eats sausages out of her sandwich, throws vegetables on the floor for the dogs, leaves potatoes and rice on the plate, and she happily munches on sausages and steak. And she has everything her heart desires at her disposal : <p/> +1 She wants no fruit, no pasta, no potatoes, no vegetables, no fruit ... And his mother eats almost only vegetables and fruit, and his father only starches. <p/> On a neighbouring forum someone was being persuaded not to buy a mix. I quote the part of the text that speaks against buying the mix: <p/> ""...both cavalier and pug breeds have heart problems and that no matter if the dog is a mix or pedigree that you have to know that treatment is expensive, I have a cavalier with pedigree and we have been keeping him alive for 3 and a half years now only with medication, how much did all the visits to the vet, all the medicines cost me, and I don't add it up, but probably about 2000 euros, and probably more, so buying a dog is the cheapest, but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at the age of say 8, 9 years..."" <p/> So why should I buy a dog with a pedigree? Why already? This writing certainly discourages me from doing so. <p/> Maybe you know which tests are mandatory for pugs and cavaliers for breeding? One, several,...? (I really don't know, that's why I'm asking) <p/> but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at say 8, 9 years old, and I know of a case of a non-breeding cavalier who has a grade 4 heart murmur at 4 years old (which mine had at 8 years old). <p/> ALL cavaliers have heart problems. If you buy from a proven breeder, problems will appear at 8,9 years, if not they can appear much earlier. <p/> (it's half a question why a person would want a dog that has heart problems from the start, but ok, to each his own) <p/> @salad Ever since user 007 asked a simple question on the ""neighbouring forum"", in the next 3-4 pages, the ""genealogical automaton"" kicked in and uncontrollably started spewing the same learned phrases, which are TOTALLY not the answer to the question asked, and started to savagely rape the person with its logic, which doesn't allow for a different opinion. Unfortunately, the ""automated slaves"" of the genealogy lobby are also on this forum, and here too they impose their beliefs on the users. <p/>Why? It is just a problematic breed in certain health aspects. Why hide it? I mean, if one paragraph is taken out of context, it's despicable anyway. This dog, if I am not mistaken, is about 9 years old. And it is quite right to warn a person who does not know what he is buying that both breeds can be risky, especially if the parent dogs have not had heart health tests. <p/> And this mix would do nothing to improve health, quite the opposite. And if it has already been used and the dogs are not under control, there is no need for the ""breeder"" to deceive the potential guardians of the calf puppies with silence. Or I suppose it is possible that he has told them, but given the general reaction, I don't think he has. <p/> Are you both saying that the problems should not be talked about? Given that traceability is possible, they can be talked about at all, but not in the case of a mixed breed, which doesn't mean it will be healthy <p/> And to be left in the dark... it is precisely through controlled breeding that things can improve. But without control, without tests, preferably with the first one around the corner, you really can't reduce the incidence of certain defects. Tests are definitely not everything, but they can help with many things, and there is always a risk. We are talking about living beings, not carbon fibre <p>An answer that tells a person what the characteristics and needs of BOTH breeds are and that's enough. But the man has been given a ""lecture"" which he did not commission and is not prepared to pay for. He pointed this out a couple of times and then gave up. <p/> To me, he looked like someone who wanted to buy the cheapest possible gift, and in general he got very comprehensive answers (although he did not expect them to be comprehensive) and even surprisingly he did not just get lessons about not buying animals as gifts. You can only make a conclusion from what is written... what the heck... that's the way it is on the forum... <p/> Yes. Functional illiteracy and/or intolerance of dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just like that on the forum. <p/> There are already too many of those. They were created when standardisation started, which if I'm not mistaken was in the Victorian era. You win ;-) Everyone has their own views on the world, animals etc. You don't have any. <p/> I would like to ask you something else. Maybe somebody lives in Vic. We could get together sometime and go I don't know to PST or the carob. We moved here recently so we don't know any or very few. We always need company:-) <p/> You know what saddens me the most? E.g. this: http://www.pesjanar.si/forum/index.php?topic=151.90 And right on the neighbouring forum, and elsewhere, they support so called ""controlled pedigree breeding"". What is controlled here? And this is not an isolated case, there are many, too many. Are they to be believed? They don't convince me... <p/>These defects are now being diagnosed, but that doesn't mean they weren't there before. <p/> Before, when you asked why you didn't have a dog anymore, they said, ""He was old"", and he was maybe a little over seven years old... One of the examples I have encountered in my life... And what do you say to them? (it was a village mixed breed) I am not saying that mixed breeds are more or less sick, but that you can't conclude from the number of visits to the vet how healthy they are. Because the one above must have died of old age, and yes, when you talk about the breed, there is the possibility of finding out a bit more about the history of the previous breeds, which is unfortunately not possible with mixed breeds, because nobody knows anything, unless they are all from the same village and people know them.... In that case they are usually much more closely related than some pedigree dogs. (villageinbriding) <p/> Hudma, he himself wrote that he was buying a dog as a gift, but he was actually looking for a pug...really gross illiteracy. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with this topic... Do you approve of buying a living creature for someone who has no idea what is in store for him? No one deserves that, not the giver and not the animal. If the recipient is younger, his parents are he he he <p/>salad, are you sad about the ultrasound? Aren't you in favour of the unsupervised? <p/> Yes, because it's clear to me that there are certain things you just don't want to know ....on the neighbouring forum all the ""evidence"" has been carefully deleted, that's how it's done here, I'm afraid. I will quote the following text: <p/> "" I am contacting you because I would like to warn potential buyers of my experience of [name and surname deleted at the request of the author, and the name of the kennel], which has been anything but pleasant. <p/> Around Christmas 2009 my partner and I bought a little bull terrier from her, who was just over 2 months old at the time. After much cajoling to hand over the papers, we went to her a couple of months later to get the pedigree, and then she asked, a little strangely, how much our Oscar was drinking, because one male from that litter had already died because his kidneys had failed because he was licking the salty snow by the roadside (which is, of course, a big stupid thing to do!). While nothing was clear to us at the time, we soon found out why she was asking such strange questions - we took the puppy to the vet, who diagnosed congenital chronic kidney failure and told us that his days were numbered. We informed [name removed] and asked her what she was going to do about it. She offered to buy another dog for a 'symbolic' price, but we refused and asked for a refund. She promised to send a reply by e-mail, but nothing happened for two months. In the meantime we met others who had bought dogs from the same litter and warned them about the disease. It turned out that out of the 6 dogs from the litter, 2 were already dead and 2 had severe kidney damage. I have no information on the other two. When we asked [name deleted] why she had not informed any of us that there might be something wrong with the dogs, she replied that she did not want to panic. Even after we had informed her about Oscar (so 2 puppies were already dead and one was sick), she did not warn anyone. <p/> As she had not emailed anything for two months, we called her and after many calls she did come back. In the meantime, Oskar had already been euthanised. When asked why she had not replied as promised, she said she had not had time. When my partner asked her if she was making a fool of him for not having had 10 minutes in two months to write an e-mail, she told him that if he meant to be rude, she would hang up. When he told her that Oskar was gone, she first asked ""How is he gone?"", but when he explained that we had had him euthanised, she was all amazed, as if she had not known that he was ill, and as if we had had the dog put to sleep just for a bit of a joke. And again she promised to send an e-mail. Today it is 14 days since that call, and I have not heard from her. I understand that puppies have unforeseen health problems, but for her to persistently proclaim herself a great dog lover, then hide the facts and react in this way to the fact that more than half of the litter is seriously ill or already dead, and yet tell no one and persistently avoid contact, to me clearly shows her attitude to animals. <p/> I would therefore caution anyone who may wish to buy a puppy from [name of kennel deleted, at the request of the author] to think carefully about it, because, while everything seems fine on their side, our experience and that of others who have bought puppies from this litter suggests otherwise. "" <p/> Will something be clearer now? This is how it is in the St. Florian Valley....this is what is supported here! <p/> Yes, my sorrow! You can find scum everywhere. And what doesn't convince you? Are you going to lump everything together because of some bad breeders? And purebreds without pedigree convince you, huh? The ones who haven't had a single test. Hehehe, you're the one who should believe the tests you're going to get from a breeder rather than from a home breeder! <p/>What to do with all the xy tests if such breeders are breeding? But nobody dares to comment on that? Why does such a breeder continue to breed? Why is he being advertised where they are the most vocal about supertruper honestly controlled pedigree breeding? Considering the number of ""renegades"" in slo, I doubt I can get a better (healthier) pedigree dog than a mix. And no, I don't trust our breeders. And I don't know what's funny here. <p/> Well, with all the xy tests (mandatory + desirable) that a breeder would show you, you could see that he actually cares about the health of the bitch, the puppies and the breed itself! Because if he didn't, he wouldn't even go to do them. A quasi breeder will never show you xy tests and you don't buy a dog from one! Simpl ko pasulj! <p/> I find your way of thinking funny. Let's say the bitch is having a fight with the neighbour's NO. She has a heart problem for example (when you come to see her she looks pure awesome) and he's a poor bastard who can barely walk and he's only 4 years old. You'd rather take the dog from me, because....... the puppies will be bursting with health because they are mixed-breeds? I can tell you fairy tales, but the one who has done the 5 tests has the proof <p/> Andreja, are you making fun of me???? QUOTE: Greetings, I am in the process of buying a dog, not for me, but I still need some advice. I am deciding to buy a pug, not a purebred, this one is a mix between a pug and a cavalier king charles. I would like to know if this dog is a lot of work, I have read a lot of things on the net, some people say that it is necessary to clean the fold every day, to comb it, that it is a special food, fruit... and that it is a quiet family dog, which is mainly intended for the house, I would like to have some more opinions from the owners who have this type of dog, thank you very much! <p/> I underlined his question, now you tell me where he is asking about my/your/our opinion on giving a dog away. PLEASE? The man is asking about the character traits and idiosyncrasies of a pug and a cavalier. BUT NO???? But is it so difficult to write a couple of answers to a SIMPLE question? <p/> The guy wanted to buy a dog as a gift. That's not how it's done. Regardless, he got the answers to his questions. He just didn't like them and didn't want to see them accordingly. He was told that he would not buy a pug (whose qualities he was interested in) nor a mix, but a cross between the two dogs. For which no one can predict what he will take from which parent (they are very different breeds in character and structure, the only thing they have in common is that they are not large (like crossing a Springer Spaniel with a Mastiff and wanting to know what you will get out). He was told that both breeds were medically demanding. Why? because most of the problems that afflict these two breeds are due to their physique. This problem is not due to standards, but both breeds have had this problem since God knows when - pugs are very old dogs, cavaliers a little less so, but both were around long before x-rays, ultrasounds...Be that as it may, the problems of cavaliers are such that it is difficult to weed them out of breeding, because there are no simple genetic or other tests to detect them before they occur. They do appear quite late in life. Now.... these problems are not hidden and are common knowledge. Anyone who nevertheless chooses to breed will look for parents who have their hearts checked regularly and those who have not had syringomyelia in a noticeable form in their ancestors. This is possible exclusively in pedigrees. Those who want a less risky breed will take a cockerel (which, unfortunately, is not so fancy). So the guy got the answer that a mix of these two breeds would be a risky purchase and that there was a high probability that the recipient would leave a hefty pile of money at the vets. OK? <p/> Hahaha oh how it was also conditioned by the standards (that the characteristics in the offspring are VERY similar from characteristics to looks). Quote from wiki:The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred(Means to breed within a single family or strain, so as to produce particular characteristics in the offspring) with flat-bred breeds. I created a bunch of new problems that nowadays complicate this breed but not only that mostly everything. Not to say that there weren't problems before, but in very minor ways. How many breeds have problems with joints, breathing, massive eyelids to congenital diseases like chronic kidney failure,etc. People this is sick what is happening to dogs and don't give me crap how some xy tests can solve them because they can't. <p/> If a dog is a butcher (anything in this case without a pedigree), it is not a priori immediately healthy because of that (most people don't see a vet because of bad owners, not because of their brilliant health!). <p/> Just because a dog is pedigree doesn't mean it will be healthy all its life. If the breeder is on the spot, i.e. cares about the dogs, he will do all possible tests to avoid doing the vets a disservice. So, if by means of tests (for which you only need to take blood or saliva - once in the life of the dog, because they keep these things and then you can order a new test every month and don't have to get rid of it all at once) you can breed in such a way that you don't get out affected dogs, I don't understand why not. (I partly understand all of you who have non-breeding approaches, because you don't want to admit mistakes (you turn a blind eye, you fool the ostrich...) i.e. you support stepparies and the torture of animals. (There are ""specimens"" among breeders too, but it also depends on what is a ""specimen"" for you.)) <p/> Pidog. I may have hit the antijack road with the mesan in terms of their health. It's just my opinion that they are one of the few dogs (percentage-wise) that are cared for like pedigree dogs of less common breeds (in short, tipitopi or as the law says - if there is something wrong with the dog, vet and not sus). <p/> Well, yes, the history of kcs is much more complicated, but so be it - some breed expert could give more precise information. The problem with the kcs is not so much that they have a short muzzle (nor is it extremely short like, say, a pug) but that the skull is too short in the temple. <p/>Now...the question was yes or no to the deliberate production of dogs. And it's not really a question of yes or no, but how. Because the question of breeding dogs is not so very simple that you can lump everything together. But to say that in general breeds are better/worse than mixes in any trait. Because breeds vary so much from one another, and there are often huge differences between types within a breed. You have a number of breeds whose typical representatives are distinctly vigorous, hardy and long-lived, and you have breeds that have more or less difficulty in this respect. In principle, any breed characterised by an exaggerated trait is more at risk. However, with clever planning and selection, even in these breeds you can get healthy dogs that function perfectly normally. <p/> Usually the biggest problems arise when a breed's trait is to be changed at short notice. Usually, unfortunately, because of a fad of one kind or another. A desire to ""improve"" rather than preserve the breed. What role does the standard play in this? A standard is nothing more than a description of a typical representative of the breed. The problem is that what is written can be interpreted in different ways. It says, for example, the ears are long - and then it starts to select for the longest possible ears. In the standard it says long hair, but they start selecting for dogs with hair that drags on the ground. Apart from the fact that no exaggeration is good in itself, you almost always get a surprise in the package when you go to select for one trait rather than the whole. Usually unpleasant. <p/> Having said the bull terrier - in that breed they have gone to changing the almost normal skull shape to a sheep skull. In a very short time. They have got so many problems in the package that the breed is in serious trouble and those who love the breed and would like to save it will have to think honestly about how to proceed, make a well thought out plan and probably take a big step backwards. The problem almost always arises when too much emphasis is placed on show results when selecting dogs for breeding and when selecting combinations. <p/> Mixes... whichever - but the fact is that even those ""true"" mixes that have had pedigree ancestors going back I don't know how many knees, or never at all, have all the hereditary problems that plague pedigrees. There are not even a few mixed breeds with various hereditary diseases, but until recently there have been a few who have even been diagnosed. <p/>A few years ago we had a lost blind mix, of the 'foxy' variety that has been around in villages here for ages, with no identifiable breed inside..... was diagnosed with two different hereditary eye diseases and a third that was the result of one of the two. In addition, he had chronic digestive and skin problems. But we also had a pretty healthy mix who couldn't hide the Yorkshire in his background, who lived to be just over 20 years old <p/> only he doesn't want a conformation, he wants a breed.... (or a chrysance between two problematic breeds) <p/> I also partly understand all of you who keep barking the same five half-truths endlessly, because you are just not able to comprehend those who think differently. <p/> After reading such and such threads, I realised that there are more and more people buying from breeders...I was sure that this would change over the years, but it has got worse...this forum has also become just a chatterbox, since some people have newly signed up and are just looking for a breeder to fill their free time.... <p/>If a different opinion is so unacceptable, you can ban me, of course. But in doing so you will confirm my point about not accepting dissent. <p/> Put it any way you like, no matter how badly a breed is doing, the non-breeding approximations of that breed are doing even worse.",Forum,dev

It also found that Klepčeva had obtained all the necessary information about the state of the company and the real estate, or had the opportunity to obtain it."" Klepčeva based her claim on allegations that Belčeva had not informed her of all the details of the company's business, including certain liabilities owed to employees, before signing the contract. The contract thus remains valid and, as previously reported, Hotel Diana has since ended up in bankruptcy. In addition to the annulment of the contract, Klepčeva's lawsuit also sought the reimbursement of the purchase price, claiming that it amounted to EUR 80 000 in total, although the contract, which was also notarised, stated an amount of EUR 30 000. <p/> Aleš Cipot <p/> Olga Belec <p/> Klepčeva claimed that, as agreed, on the day of the signing of the contract, 50 thousand euros were handed over to Belčeva in cash, allegedly by Matej Hofinger, a businessman from Velenje, who acted as an intermediary in the transaction, but they did not provide any evidence to convince the judge, Marjetica Škerget Logar, of their claims. Klepčeva says she is disappointed with the court's decision and will appeal it. Olga Belec welcomes the court's decision to the contrary, and believes that the allegations in the claim were fabricated. ""This proves what I have been saying all along, that the sale was transparent. I even went to help the new management for the first two months after the sale. I sold the company in good faith, because the buyers assured me that they would also buy the property, which I did not have enough money to do myself. So I was glad that someone who supposedly could save the company bought it, but if I had known that things would turn out this way, I would never have sold it to them."" As for the allegations of receiving cash, Belčeva reiterates that this never happened. She adds that she herself has thought a lot about how such allegations could have come about: ""I wonder whether Matej Hofinger might not have really received the money from Klepčeva, but gave it to someone else. In any case, the whole affair was about diverting attention to me, because I was State Secretary at the time, while the company was being financially drained.""",News,dev
781,"News archive <p/> Government issues decree on small-scale renewable energy installations. <p/> On 5 March, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia issued a Regulation on small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration. The Regulation defines the types, size and conditions for the installation and connection of small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration, which do not require a building permit in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of buildings. The Regulation is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 14/2020. <p/> The Regulation is issued on the basis of the provisions of the Energy Act, which establishes the legal basis for the adoption of a by-law to determine the types of simple installations for the production of electricity from RES or CHP that do not require a building permit and are installed on, in or next to an existing building or civil engineering structure built in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of structures, their size and the conditions for their installation and connection. <p/> These subjects were previously regulated in the Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which also contained Chapter IV.a ""Specific features and exceptions in the field of electricity generation"", which provided that the installation of a RES/SPHPP electricity generation installation in accordance with the building regulations was to be considered as investment maintenance work (which did not require a building permit), provided that certain conditions were fulfilled. The new Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which entered into force in April 2016, repealed this Regulation and does not contain any provisions related to such production installations. This means that under the current legislation on the construction of buildings, the installation of such installations generally requires a building permit, which, given the relative complexity of their installation, constitutes an excessive administrative burden and has a disincentive effect on investment in such installations. Taking into account the fact that the Republic of Slovenia has to achieve binding targets for the production of electricity from RES (otherwise it faces high fines), investments in such installations should also be encouraged by removing administrative barriers. As will be explained below, the current building legislation allows for this, but this area also needs to be regulated in more detail in the energy regulations. Among other things, the Building Act stipulates that a building permit is not required for simple structures and maintenance of structures (Art. 5 of the Building Act). What falls into this category is derived from the Regulation on the classification of buildings, which lays down the criteria for classifying simple, non-complex, less complex, complex buildings, other building interventions and maintenance works. Maintenance work, according to point 4 (Installation of installations in, on and adjacent to the installation), includes, inter alia, the installation of new installations and associated installations for the exploitation of RES. However, as this has already been regulated in the abovementioned Energy Infrastructure Regulation, it is necessary to regulate the types of installations in the energy legislation, including power limitations, and the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of the installation and the operation of such installations.

806,"Are you left without pressure in your heating system ? <p/> It has become uncomfortably cold in your home. This may be due to insufficient pressure in your system. In today's article you will find out all the possible causes and solutions. <p/> Insufficient pressure in the heating system is one of the most common causes of poor heating performance, and we receive the most calls from customers about it. <p/> Why is the pressure in your system too low? <p/> There can be several causes of low pressure. The most common causes are: <p/> Venting the system for too long: <p/> For radiators, we recommend venting before each heating season. Learn more about how to properly vent radiators. Often radiators are vented for too long, so only vent them for as long as air is coming out of them. Stop venting when water starts coming out. Venting for too long can cause a loss of pressure in your system. <p/> Safety valve too small: <p/> The safety valve protects your heating system from over-pressurisation. It opens above a certain value and starts to drain the water in your system. If the safety valve is too small, the valve will open too quickly and cause you to lose pressure in your system. This is why it is important to have a company with experience install your mechanical installations, many times boiler rooms are not sized correctly to achieve the lower prices offered on the market. <p/> Definitely the most common reason why the pressure in your system is too low. The expansion tank consists of two chambers separated by an impermeable membrane. One chamber contains the heating water - the other contains the gas, usually nitrogen. If the heating water expands as it is heated, the expansion tank regulates it: It absorbs the excess water and compresses the gas in the second chamber. If the gas pressure is incorrectly set or if the diaphragm is defective, the expansion tank will no longer work properly and the heating system will start to lose water. <p/> Water leaks from heating pipes, fittings, fittings and radiators: <p/> In rare cases, your system will leak water from a burst pipe, a fitting that is not tight enough, a radiator or even a fitting. Often the leak can be identified by puddles of water that appear at the very point where the water is escaping from the system. In the case of a burst pipe, for example, which is located under the plaster, the leak is more difficult to detect. Detection is aided by the use of a thermal imaging camera. <p/> For these reasons, it is even more important to choose a company with experience and references before deciding to install a heating system. This will ensure that you get a boiler room with quality and, of course, correctly sized materials. This will save you a lot of money and nerves :)",Information/Explanation,dev

He had to beat defending champion Grigor Dimitrov to win the title, but with new points for the ATP Race Rankings, he kept his chances for the final Masters alive. <p/> Tomas Berdych reached the final of the If Stockholm Open for the second time. In the final, he defeated Grigor Dimitrov, who won here last year, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. <Berdych, 29, does not yet have a ticket to the final eight, but he retained his 7th place today, which still leads him to London.

He could have saved the opening set in his favour when he served at 5-4, but Dimitrov had other plans. The Bulgarian stole a set from the Czech by winning four games in a row. Berdych did not make the same mistake in the second and third sets and took the break advantage safely to the end. <p/> ''I lost the opening set because Dimitrov played unbelievable. I was very happy with my serve in the second set, which helped me to finish well,'' explained the Czech. <p/> Tomas Berdych celebrates his second win in Stochholm and 10th of his career <p/> Grigor Dimitrov lost today, but is still in contention for the final in London.

854,"Text taken from the novel Three Reasons, page 220. The computer displays images inaudibly and lights flash on the titanium case. Where the light burns long at night, there are ideas. And that, we know, is wrong, heretical ... and dangerous ... <p/> There are no powerful plots in the novel, and it is nothing like The Da Vinci Code, I say to those who, like the writer, had trouble with that book and barely made it to the end. There is a chronological account of the various events in The Three Reasons. It is more like this. And in fact, in film, if you like, and literature, there are few things as dramatic as real life. Even though we all know life, it still tells us something new and special every day. And it is always more interesting to write about. The novel Three Reasons is a humorous slice of a year in the life of a mother of two Lilliputians, a wife and an interesting young woman. <p/> The story introduces different people through a first-person narrative (Xenia's). The negative Vlasta, the careerist Darja, the smeared Nika and the unhappy Veronika, Xenia's family and a wider circle of acquaintances through whom she paints her unusual images. Unlike many other authors, she takes refuge in reality at critical points, or so I understood her. This is very unusual. The author does not come across as naïve at all, I would rather say fresh and youthful. Despite her experience, she has, in my opinion, almost too much confidence in her environment and in other people. How damn wrong she is, she is yet to find out. Her whole generation will find that out. There can be no doubt about that. She is only distrustful of her partner, who probably of all people loves and respects her the most. That does not surprise me one bit. All the women I know are like that. <p/> Without a single exception. :) <p/> There is humour in Three Reasons, too. Good and beautifully written. We can laugh at Alexandra in many places. I found myself laughing the most when she describes the passionate lovemaking where Xenia and Marko have earned their butts on their heads on the same shelf. They switched positions, there is no doubt about that. Whether it was when her phone fell into a puddle or when she met her boyfriend from the machine. <p/> This is how she describes her weighing and makes fun of the fashion commandments. With the rarely seen self-irony of a woman with a slightly damaged self-esteem, which at the end very smoothly turns into a sympathetic sarcasm: <p/> I stripped naked to make the result as accurate as possible. I went to pee earlier, so that I wouldn't suffer at the expense of a few unnecessary grams. And then the fatal step. The thin plate seemed to be groaning under my weight. I blinked, told myself once again that the result didn't matter because I'd fix it soon anyway, then opened my eyes and looked down. 69 kilos. The dreaded seven was damn close. My stomach clenched, I immediately got down and then stepped on the scales again. Don't ever do that unless you're too skinny! I jumped down like I'd been burnt by nettles and resisted the instinctive urge to try again - maybe the result would be more normal after all, like a cute 62. It was clear that the scale was sensing my torment and deliberately adding salt to my tired bones. <p/> Through self-irony, she also makes a rueful mockery of a world in which Barbies are the ideal of feminine beauty, and things like that. <p/> Those Barbies you can talk to like you can talk to the telly ... :) <p/> 3. <p/> Language is special. It's self-described and not inspired by anyone. It's a little bit like Gosposvetsko polje, it's just more modern and quite unusual. It is apparent that Aleksandra also writes poetry, quite well, in the opinion of those in the know, to put it casually. The language is innovative in describing contemporary things and interspersed with less familiar words for decoration and delicacy. Sometimes even too much, even with paediatric and other medical terms. I did not understand it yet, but I studied medicine. Don't believe me? I really did, only that was a long time ago, when I was in the seventh grade of an eight-year school. Even then I was very talented, although not much appreciated, and only one classmate had any understanding for my studies. I read the medical encyclopaedia, all the entries on A and B. And I had the symptoms of all those diseases. Except for white current, or I didn't know how to recognise it in the first year. So I dropped out of that study. For health reasons, mostly. :) The structure of the text itself is also quite strange. The beginning and the end of the novel are symmetrical, the same words are repeated. The mantra of the three reasons appears throughout the text, which is why it's like a kind of theme or a literary musical theme. There are other structural and stylistic elements, but they are not the most essential for an amateur's experience and understanding of the content. That is why I leave them to the experts, so that they have something to write about. <p/> It is quite a good text. Will it win any prizes? I am thinking. Hardly. Just because it is written by a young woman, it doesn't stand much of a chance. Although ... Still, there's something going on with these awards. Something heretical. Something they're stirring up over there now, bossing and changing. That's good. At least that's what I was thinking on the Rožnik, listening to the cute Combine singing a song. The lyrics were written by Moss, in case you didn't know. That Vojnović gets more votes than Jančar? That is something! For Vojnović, of course. A little less for Jančar. That is heretical and different from what it was. So that the faces in the boxes sometimes get mixed up. That is also the point. To have something fresh for the daily news and not just last year's news. I have not read these two books to this day. I have no time. Except for a little bit in the sublist. If anything, I prefer to read Lainsztek and Mazzini. Or poetry, if I don't have anything more clever to do. <p/> For all these reasons, I hope that Alexandra has a chance with Three Reasons. She could do with some kind of prize, probably more than the aforementioned authors. And no one would be too much of a fool. They wouldn't have anything to bullshit about, at least in my opinion. There are more than three reasons for that, too. And her thirtieth anniversary is coming up soon, because she's in quite a hurry. Already at the age of four ... :) <p/> I would also like to draw attention to a particular atmosphere that emanates from the text. It seems Bulgakovian to me, although I can't explain it very well. There are no communist apparatchiks, and nobody's head is cut off by a tram. But there is something there, if not I would not feel it. Only, I cannot say it very well, because I am just a lover of literature and I am writing my opinion here mainly for you to pick up the book. <p/> That is all it is really about.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

Since it is fat soluble, it is recommended to consume it with some fat. When consumed, it is slowly converted in the body into vitamin A in the liver and also has antioxidant properties. The body converts it as needed, but in children this conversion is not as extensive as in adults, so vitamin A deficiency can occur. It plays an indispensable role in bone growth and building, skin repair, good eyesight, reproduction and is an extremely powerful stimulant of the immune system. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, eye problems, problems with blood formation, diarrhoea, skin diseases, susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Night blindness can develop into severe visual impairment. <p/>Who we recommend it for: <p/> To people who want to maintain good eyesight <p/> Before going on holiday to prepare the skin for sun exposure, and to anyone who wants to keep their tanned complexion a little longer <p/> To people who are deficient in Vitamin A <p/> Beta Carotene for good eyesight <p/> Beta Carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A; it can be converted by the human body into Vitamin A according to need. Vitamin A is a building block of the retina, an essential part of our eyes with an indispensable role in maintaining good vision. Vitamin A also contributes to the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes and healthy skin. <p/> Benefits of vitamin A <p/> As a powerful antioxidant, vitamin A protects the brain from premature deterioration, protects against the effects of UV rays and strengthens the immune system. The need for this vitamin is greatly increased in all intestinal diseases with consequent impaired absorption, chronic diseases and exhaustion. As it also protects the skin well against the sun, it is recommended to take it during sunbathing. <p/> It is recommended to start taking beta-carotenes at least 2-4 weeks before prolonged sun exposure and to continue during the sunbathing period, together with the use of a sunscreen with an appropriate SPF. <p/>Warning: The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. A food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. Keep out of reach of children! Store at temperatures up to 25 oC, protected from moisture and light. <p/>Warning: Smokers and persons working with asbestos should consult a doctor before use. Beta carotene is not a substitute for external UV protection. Prolonged use of high doses of beta carotene may cause staining of the hands and feet, which is perfectly normal and disappears after discontinuation of the supplement.",Promotion,dev

899,"Photovoltaics have regained momentum in Slovenia in recent years, as the construction of solar power plants for self-supply is on the rise. This means that we generate electricity solely for our own needs, and any surplus cannot be sold to distribution. The main principle of a solar power plant is to convert solar energy into electricity, and it does this using solar cells, which are the basic building blocks of photovoltaic modules. <p/> From an ecological point of view, a PV power plant is considered clean and environmentally friendly, as it does not produce any greenhouse or other gas emissions. Solar energy is the third most important source of renewable energy in terms of capacity, after hydro and wind power. More than 100 countries around the world use solar energy. Photovoltaics can be installed on the ground or mounted on the roof or walls of a building. <p/> In a solar power plant, the electromagnetic waves of the Sun are converted into direct current and voltage. The conversion process is completely inaudible, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly, and takes place in diffuse sunlight. Photovoltaics or photovoltaic systems can operate for many years and require little maintenance or intervention after their initial installation, so that after the initial investment costs, the operating costs of a PV power plant are very low compared to existing electricity generation technologies. <p/> What is PV - the PV module at the heart of the PV plant <p/> At the heart of any solar power plant or PV system (even for own use) are the photovoltaic modules, which are the generator of the solar power plant. Of course, the arrays, the mounting structure, the shielding and the metering point are also a necessary part of any solar power plant. <p/> A photovoltaic power plant consists of two sets of basic elements. The first is the photovoltaic modules, which are the heart of the solar power plant and play the role of converting the electromagnetic waves of the sun into direct current and voltage. The second set consists of the power elements, which serve to use the electricity generated for specific purposes. These include: rectifiers, supporting structure, connecting cables, DC and AC couplings, regulators, batteries, switching and protection devices and other installation materials. <p/> A PV module consists of identical solar cells connected in series. Depending on the types of solar cells installed, the PV cells (or modules) can be made of crystalline cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline modules) or amorphous silicon. A module consists of a number of solar cells in series (between 36 and 72 pieces/module), which are sandwiched between a toughened glass surface and a special EVA film. The edges of the so-called sandwich construction are then sealed with aluminium foil and a connection dock is mounted on the back of the module. The whole is then framed in an aluminium frame. <p/> Photovoltaics are virtually maintenance-free and operate extremely reliably. The regular maintenance that is required is to clean the surface of the modules once a year in case of major dust or dirt, and in the case of a stand-alone PV installation at home (for own use), we make sure that the surroundings are maintained and cleaned in case of overgrowth. <p/> Photovoltaic power plant - installation requires thoughtful planning <p/> The basic requirement for the installation of photovoltaics is a sunny, shade-free area. However, many of the challenges regarding the orientation of the building, its position and the pitch of the roof can be solved with module supports. The PV panels shall preferably be mounted on the sunny south side of the roof, or elsewhere if the south side is not possible, at an angle of 32 degrees. Deviating from the optimum angle by, for example, 20 degrees reduces the efficiency by about 5 %, while deviating from the southern direction to the east or west results in a loss of at least 15 %. Therefore, the deviation from the south direction should be as small as possible. The amount of solar radiation depends very much on the broad and narrow location of the building, and a lot on the time of year and the weather. In summer, the solar radiation is at a high angle - around 64 degrees, while in winter it is low - only below 16 degrees. Lower energy reflections, which require a larger solar cell area and a larger roof, must be taken into account, even in locations with lower solar radiation. These disadvantages, together with the intermittency and dependence on climatic conditions, must be taken into account in the design. The fact is that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the efficiency. In warmer places, solar radiation is much stronger, so the results are much more favourable. <p/> Self-use photovoltaics most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water <p/> Self-use photovoltaics, consisting of only a few (two to five) modules, most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water. The amount of electricity produced is quite low and you do not have to deal with the various paperwork that you have to do if you want to feed the energy produced into the grid. <p/> Larger or solar power plants, where the photovoltaics are made up of a larger number of modules, also produce a much larger amount of electricity.

906,"Honda's high-flying five-year plan <p/> Forecast. Honda has announced that it plans to double car production over the next five years, with a large number of new models expected to come to market, including in segments where it is currently absent. <p/>Honda's CEO Takanobu Ito said a few days ago that Honda plans to increase production to six million vehicles a year over the next five years from the current 3.1 million, with a number of new models planned, including in segments where it has not been present so far. <p/> Honda is therefore expecting a lot from the all-new generation of the Jazz, as well as from its smaller brother, the Brio, which will be aimed primarily at developing markets and will be a cheaper version of the aforementioned Jazz. To boost production, Honda plans to build new plants, one of which will be opened in Mexico by 2014, and will also focus on the Chinese market, where it plans to launch a maximum of 10 new models. <p/> The fate of the Accord in the European markets is still unknown, as Honda is not confident about the sales and profitability of the model in the old continent (photo: Honda) <p/> Much fewer new models in Europe <p/> While it is not yet known which of the new models will also enter the markets of the old continent, among the models announced are, in addition to the aforementioned brio and jazz, a smaller suv based on the latter, as well as a smaller sedan, which will be a replacement for the current Honda city. <p/> A sporty civica rally car has also been announced, which will, as usual, be given the Type-R nameplate, but enthusiasts will still have to wait until 2015 to get their hands on it. Much more numerous in terms of sales, however, will surely be the announcement of the new generation Accord, whose production for European markets is still in question for the time being, since the Accord has been a loss-making car in most European markets over the last few years, thanks to the strong yen. The same (unknown) fate in the European markets for the time being also awaits the A0 segment model, which will be called N-ONE in the Japanese markets. Among the models announced, we must not forget the NSX sports coupé, as well as the new sports roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study. <p/> For the US markets, the acura RLX is also confirmed for the Los Angeles show in November, and is expected to arrive in Europe later in the form of the honda legend. For 2015, Honda has also announced a production version of the fuel cell model for European markets, not the FCX Clarity, but an all-new and significantly cheaper model. <p/> The Honda NSX is due to arrive in showrooms very soon, and we can also expect a new sporty roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study, as well as a redesigned CR-Z hybrid coupé (photo: Honda). <p/> So, according to the announcements, the future of Honda on European soil in particular is still rather unclear, and not necessarily as rosy as it has been for quite a few years now.",News,dev

I have opened the key and looked for any cold spots, but everything looks fine. I would be grateful for any advice. Kind regards. <p/> What now, did you or did you not format it? If you have formatted it successfully then use programs ala Recuva, PCInspector FileRecovery, etc. If the explorer sees it (that it has a letter assigned to it e.g. X) then do a chkdsk in the Command Prompt window with the command: chkdsk x: /f If the format didn't go through then let me know what you report! Do you see it in DiskManagement? Give me a picture. Format it with Rufus (choose fast format, of course). Then save the data. Which OS do you have? Try in the second, third usb2.0 port and not the usb3.0 port, etc. <p/> I haven't formatted it because it won't let me. If I press cancel nothing actually happens, but the cloud recommending formatting keeps flashing at 2 second intervals. If I open the ""task manager"" and look at what is going on at that time, all I see is the same application multiplying. This multiplication starts the moment I connect the USB to the computer and ends when I switch it off. Everything I have described is happening to me on Win 7 Ultimate. I have also tried it on XP. There the matter behaves slightly differently. I don't get any warning when I plug in the key. The computer detects the key, but when I try to open it, I get a warning that the key needs to be formatted. I didn't do this in XP, but I'll try it there as you advised. <p/> So, to continue from my last post in this thread. I have tried to format the key with the aforementioned Rufus program on both OSes (Windows 7 Ultimate and XP), but to no avail. I also tried running the key on all possible USB ports as you advised. The case behaves as follows. When I connect the key to my computer and open Rufus, the window from this program starts flashing at 2 second intervals. Nevertheless, it allows me to select ""quick format"". Then I start the formatting and after a good second the message ""FAILED"" appears in the bottom frame of Rufus and in an additional cloud ""Error: Error while partitioning drive"". I tried to save the data with Wondershare's File scavenger. When I started the scan, it displayed ""No relevant data found! Please click Options on the right top and unselect Only scan unused sectors when scanning. Then try to scan again"". I also heeded this warning and repeated the scan. Unfortunately still no success. I also tried CMD's ""chkdsk"" command, but it says ""The type of the file system is RAW. Chkdsk is not available for RAW drives"". <p/> I assume the USB stick size is showing wrong or 0. In this case it is not possible to format in low level format or any other format. All you need is to download the chipgenius program: http://www.usbdev.ru/files/chipgenius/ It reads the USB stick, with a bit of luck tells you which controller it is and where to get the controller reset tool. If not, you can find the tool on the net via vid and pid number. All other attempts to format will be futile and a waste of time. <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> If I try to format a key with File scavenger, it shows me the size of its memory, but next to it it says Unlocated partition. If I insert a healthy key into the computer, it usually says ""Drive F"". <p/> Since the first post, I'm still waiting for an answer as to what DiskManagement sees... But ok, now you've come up with the word RAW yourself, which would be obvious from the DiskManagement image. And usually a right click on that grey box is enough to initialize the whole partition/size of the stick then the quick format and data rescue goes better with all the programs listed.

923,"The EPAR (European Public Assessment Report) lists VAED as an important potential risk to be monitored and reported. Neither is implemented in Slovenia, because doctors were not informed about it during the training sessions (and afterwards). <p/> VAED (Vaccine associated enhancement of disease) has been a major obstacle in the development of SARS and MERS coronavirus vaccines, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and some other vaccines against infectious agents. <p/> It is an immunological phenomenon, mediated by antibodies or immune cells, which causes a vaccinated person to become ill, often more severely than an unvaccinated person, after coming into contact with a wild virus. <p/> This phenomenon has caused illness and death in laboratory animals in the past. In the late 1970s, the RSV vaccine caused severe illness and even death in vaccinated children. <p/> This immunological phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated by Pfizer-BioNTech because: <p/> a) it did not use the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in preclinical animal studies, but a surrogate virus - with the explanation that it does not have BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3) (EPAR, page 43). The EMA-e reviewer wrote in his report that the use of a surrogate instead of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (in vaccine research) was not even discussed (!!!!). Also, for technical reasons (!!!), the manufacturer did not specify the ratio of neutralising to non-neutralising antibodies - which was also recommended in March 2020 by scientists gathered under the auspices of CEPI, explaining that it is an important 'indicator' of the possibility of VAED in vaccinated people. <p/> b) Phase 2/3 clinical testing was mainly conducted at a time when there was little or no presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the natural environment (the registration study for the provisional authorisation included data from May to the first half of October 2020); therefore, the majority of vaccinated people could not have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, which would have been the only way to test for the possibility of developing VAED in them. The problem of testing the vaccine in the absence of the virus in the natural environment has also been pointed out by scientists in the summer of 2020 <p/> c) From a professional and scientific point of view, given the known problems of the history of coronavirus vaccines, it is therefore only appropriate to include in the registration study (on the basis of which the vaccine received provisional marketing authorisation) data also from the period of increased presence of the virus in the natural environment, i.e. late autumn and winter 2020/2021, when coronavirus infections started to occur again and vaccinees had the opportunity to come into contact with authentic (wild) SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, as noted above, the registration study did not capture this data, but mass vaccination of populations around the world had already begun during the period of re-emergence of the virus. <p/> The EPAR lists VAED as a significant potential risk (page 115). It is stated that the possible occurrence of this complication will continue to be monitored even after the provisional marketing authorisation has been granted. <p/> The Pharmacovigilance (Product Side Effects) Plan states that side effects of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTecha Comirnaty will be tracked through a specific questionnaire, which will also include verification of vaccine ineffectiveness or the occurrence of VAED (page 116). In the section on additional pharmacovigilance activities (page 118, table, study C4591001), it is stated that the occurrence of an imbalance between the vaccinated and the control (unvaccinated) group in the number of cases, especially for the more severe form of the disease, kovid 19, could suggest VAED. The possibility of VAED should be monitored for 2 years after the second dose of vaccine, the EPAR states. <p/>The fact that this is an important immunological phenomenon that may have a detrimental effect on the health of vaccinees is also evident from the peer-reviewed literature. <p/> In March 2020, a group of experts in the field of vaccine and coronavirus immunology gathered under the auspices of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation), also funded by capital and philanthropy, to examine the situation and the opportunities and obstacles to the development of a safe vaccine for coronavirus 19 disease. The problem in developing a vaccine against the 19 metalloid disease was highlighted as the possibility of VAED, in which the vaccine causes a more severe form of the disease if the vaccinated person subsequently becomes infected with a wild virus. They wrote that VAED was first observed in the 1960s in association with an inactivated RSV vaccine. Participants at the meeting recalled a case where the RSV vaccine did not prevent infection and 80% of vaccinated children became so severely ill after contact with wild virus that they required hospital treatment; 2 out of 35 children even died. <p/>It was noted that similar pathology has been described in SARS CoV-1 vaccine candidates (the causative agent of the 2002/2003 SARS pandemic) and that there is concern that similar pathology (particularly in terms of Th2 immunopathology) could occur in humans vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of kovid-19 disease). The possibility of ADE (antibody disease enhancement), another immunological mechanism directly induced by non-neutralising or sub-neutralising antibodies that allow a more efficient entry of the virus into the cells, has also been raised. <p/>They wrote that their findings should guide vaccine manufacturers in the development and testing of vaccine candidates, with the intention of avoiding the risks to humans from the use of vaccines against Covid-19. They also provided very specific guidance on the proper conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and validation of the development of VAEDs. <p/> In April 2020, scientists also discussed and warned in peer-reviewed journals about the possible occurrence of VAED after the use of the vaccine against the disease Kovid-19. They discussed the possibility of disease promotion by both humoral (antibodies - ADE) and cell-mediated (Th2 immunopathology) immunity mechanisms. Prof. Baric, an epidemiologist and expert on coronavirus, thought at the time that Th2 immunopathology would be a bigger problem, as animal models had shown that it was mainly older animals that were at risk; he expressed concern about what this might mean if the vaccine were used in older humans. <p/>We now know that the polio vaccine was first used in the elderly population; and the manufacturer's EPAR shows that the registration study included only 5 people aged 85+ among just over 18,000 vaccinees, and 804 people aged 75+, representing 4.4% of the total vaccinated (page 76, table). Some other scientists were also of the opinion that ADE pathology should not be a major problem and that the reports from China concerning re-infected people were also not suggestive of an ADE problem. <p/> Dr Graham, Executive Director of the Vaccine Development Centre at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), also mentioned the possibility of Th2 immunopathology in particular, and was supported by Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who has worked, among other things, on the development of a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine. Dr Graham expressed concern about Th2 immunopathology, stating that an inappropriate T cell response would stimulate allergy-mediated inflammation and lead to the generation of poorly functional antibodies with consequent formation of immune complexes, leading to complement activation and the damage that could result. <p/> Dr Hotez pointed to the possibility of producing a vaccine on only part of the viral S-protein, i.e. the part that binds to the cellular receptor binding domain (RBD), which could possibly reduce the adverse immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech EPAR shows that the manufacturer also tested the vaccine candidate for the RBD component of the S-protein, which was later abandoned (page 58). Dr Graham, who worked with Moderna on vaccine development, said in April 2020: 'We need to get some answers by next winter to at least be better prepared for the winter of 2021-2022'. Well, the 'vaccine', including Moderna's, had already started to be used en masse 1 year earlier, much earlier than Dr Graham expected to 'get some answers'. <p/> Prof Perlman, an immunologist and microbiologist, said that a special commission had been set up at the WHO to look into the VAED issue. He expected that the commission would be able to report in a few months' time. In April 2020, the WHO and other health experts also stressed that it would take at least a year and a half before the vaccine would be thoroughly tested in both animal models and humans, and only then might it be put into wider, commercial use. In reality, things have been accelerated; within a year of his statement, some 3 billion people have been vaccinated with a poorly tested product called 'vaccine'. <p/> Despite the EMA's warning that VAED is listed as a significant potential risk and that it should be monitored and reported in terms of post-vaccination contracting of the symptoms of metal 19, we doctors were not informed of this during the training sessions on metal 19 vaccines held from December 2020 onwards, we did not receive any (subsequent) notification of this, nor is there a form to report this immunological phenomenon which, as past experience shows, can harm or even endanger the health of those vaccinated. <p/> In April 2020, doctors received an e-mail with an article by Prof Tomažič entitled ""Covid 19: what every doctor should know"". In the article, which is now published on the NIJZ website, on page 7, Prof. Ihan states: ""It is not yet clear what role antibodies play in protecting against the disease. In a few studies, patients with higher antibody production had worse outcomes - this could indicate the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). A similar phenomenon has been described in MERS, where neutralising antibodies (directed against the viral receptor) promoted viral entry into cells. Until we know the mechanisms of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development will be more speculation than science."" <p/> The problem of VAED is therefore also known to vaccine experts in Slovenia. However, it was not brought to our attention during the training sessions on metalloid vaccines, nor were we presented with the problems of the development of past coronavirus vaccines. We have been wondering why this is so for some time. Why VAED is not recorded in Slovenia is also not clear to us. This is, however, prescribed in the EPAR issued by the EMA. Despite the ISZ's appeal to the JAZMP and the NIJZ, nothing has changed in the recording of this phenomenon. <p/> The way in which VAED is checked in the manufacturer's registration study is very unprofessional. Why? Was the manufacturer 'afraid' of a setback in the development of the vaccine, as we have seen with the other two coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS? Why did the EMA agree to the manufacturer using a surrogate virus (VSV - Vesicular Stomatitis Virus with 'embedded information' for the S-protein; EPAR, page 43) in testing the vaccine's efficacy and safety? How is it possible that someone can produce billions of vaccines against a pandemic virus without using it in pre-clinical studies on the action and side-effects of a 'vaccine' against the virus that causes this pandemic? And on the banal excuse that it does not have BSL3? And how is it possible that the regulator (EMA) finds this acceptable? And that, as the EMA rapporteur states, the use of a replacement virus was not even discussed? And how is it possible that this is acceptable to (even our) vaccination experts, some of whom are also doctors? <p/> Vaccine research with a surrogate virus could be at least as dangerous and irresponsible as a car manufacturer testing the brakes with a machine that measures, for example, the optics of bicycles. Both brakes and optics have a common denominator, the car wheel, but we know very well who is responsible for braking. SARS-CoV-2 and vesicular stomatitis virus also have a common denominator, i.e. they are both viruses, and we know very well which of them is responsible for metalloid-19. <p/> We know from domestic and foreign practice that people become ill with signs of caries after vaccination. It started last winter with vaccinees falling ill in DSOs across Europe. After initial denial of this phenomenon, explanations started to emerge later that the elderly had fallen ill because they had been vaccinated at a stage when they were already infected but not yet symptomatic (asymptomatic); that the vaccine takes time to protect the vaccinee; that the vaccine is not 100% effective. We have listened to claims that the vaccine is made in such a way that it cannot cause cystitis because it does not contain the virus. The latter is true, but what has not been said is that the disease can be caused by an immunological mechanism that can be triggered after the vaccinee comes into contact with a wild virus. VAED could also be triggered in vaccinated elderly by subsequent infection with common coronavirus, explained renowned immunologist and microbiologist Prof. Bhakdi. In the spring, when younger people started getting sick after vaccination, the British (alpha) version of the virus joined the list of culprits. We now see that, despite its presence in up to 90% of the samples analysed, the disease is on the decline. <p/> Recently, we have heard that the delta variant is spreading from India to us; and in some places, the idea that unvaccinated people are to blame for the rise in infections is already germinating. However, the official EPAR states that if there is an increase in the number of cases after vaccination, this could indicate the development of VAED or possibly an ineffective vaccine. Is this even being investigated? <p/>We are hearing explanations that people will fall ill with Chlamydia in the autumn and that 'everyone who is admitted to hospital will be because they have not been vaccinated'. What about VAED in the vaccinated, ladies and gentlemen professors? Have you forgotten about it? You have written about this immunological phenomenon, it has been written about and pointed out by many who work on vaccine development, it is written about by the EMA in its EPAR. <p/> The EMA states that side effects, including VAED, should be monitored and recorded. So why is VAED not monitored and recorded in Slovenia? Why does the NIJZ not have data on how many people who were vaccinated against VAE 19 subsequently contracted VAE? Why is it not possible to see what proportion of hospitalised patients who have contracted kovid-19 are vaccinated? All this would give us important information on possible vaccine-induced disease acceleration that needs to be reported further to the EMA regulator. After all, this is about the safety of our people, our patients! <p/> Why is there silence about VAED? Will the post-vaccination metalloid symptoms be attributed to the new delta variant, which is announced to become widespread in our country in August? Will the silent increase in the number of vaccinees falling ill due to VAED possibly justify closing schools or locking people in their homes next autumn and winter? <p/>What will happen to people who were vaccinated in the spring, who are vaccinated now or who will be vaccinated in the autumn? What will happen after they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses in autumn/winter? Given the known immunological phenomenon, it is to be expected that those vaccinated in autumn/winter could contract a coronavirus. Did this already happen last winter, first after the vaccination of the elderly? Will the delta variant be to blame this winter? Will it be epsilon or some other variant that is on the WHO 'watch list'? <p/>Professor Ihan, you have stated in the Delo that if there is more disease among those who have been vaccinated, an additional, third dose of vaccine will be needed. What about VAED, Professor? Was it mentioned (antibody variant) in the April 2020 article? And also the EMA in the EPAR says that increased morbidity in vaccinees could mean that it is VAED, so characteristic of all failed coronavirus vaccines to date. We suggest that we should be vigilant and make a professional and scientific evaluation of the possible occurrence of VAED in vaccinees. Dear Professors Ihan, Beović, Tomažić, Jerala and Štrukelj: with your approach and interpretations, the epidemic will not end; this autumn and winter, for example, there will be a delta strain, and in the future, perhaps some other strain? For how long? Until we inoculate 7 billion people, as we have been hearing the plans since the summer of 2020 (2:20 min)? <p/> Ladies and gentlemen, professors: is this science? Is this medicine with its principle: above all, do no harm? You are telling us that health and life are paramount. You assure us that all measures are solely for the good of the people. So let us collect data on VAED! We all want to offer people a safe vaccine. <p/> Reportedly, vaccine manufacturers have been given permission to disclose data (unblinded) and offer vaccination (crossover) to the unvaccinated in a registration study after six months. There is therefore a strong possibility that at the expected end of the Phase 3 clinical trial in May 2023, there will not be enough people left in the control group (unvaccinated) to make an objective comparison between the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in terms of side effects and therefore VAED. Will we then have an explanation in 2023 that, because of the lack of a control group, the results are only valid for a period of 6 months after the last dose of vaccine? Also, given the high possibility of the control group 'disappearing', it is all the more important that VAED is monitored and recorded now that mass vaccination of the population is taking place. <p/> How are we going to monitor and report on the development of VAED after vaccination in Slovenia, in accordance with the EMA-e guidance, if you have not informed the medical staff or the people who have been vaccinated about the possibility of VAED? You have not even given them informed consent to sign, informing them that there is a possibility that they may fall ill despite vaccination, and possibly even more seriously than those who have not been vaccinated - because this is a phenomenon that has been known about for a long time, and which was discussed by experts at the beginning of the development of coronavirus vaccines. <p/> We all know that monitoring even the smallest side-effects that could be temporally or causally related to vaccination is very important, including VAED. <p/> All the more so when we recall that the manufacturer drew its conclusions on the safety and efficacy of the product based on a mere 170 metalloid cases (0.47%) among the reported 36423 clinical study participants (EPAR, page 89, table). In fact, 0.884% (162/18325) of the unvaccinated group and 0.044% (8/18198) of the vaccinated group became ill. The difference between the incidence of the unvaccinated and vaccinated, expressed in absolute risk, was only 0.84%. 1 person among the vaccinated and 3 among the unvaccinated developed severe form of pertussis; far too small a difference to draw any meaningful conclusions. And some persons were observed for as long as 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (EPAR, page 90, Table 13). This is also why we need to improve reporting systems, follow the EMA-e guidance and inform healthcare workers, DSO caregivers and vaccinees about VAED. <p/>We are doctors.

926,"Slovenia: The famous Barcaffè magenta colour protected in Slovenia <p/> Atlantic Droga Kolinska has received a decision from the Office for the Protection of Intellectual Property (OIPP) to protect the Pantone 214C (magenta) colour, which has been used by Barcaffè for 50 years, on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> Registering a colour as a trademark is a lengthy and demanding process, as the protection of a colour as a trademark grants the exclusive right to use it. <p/> Many conditions have to be fulfilled in order to be registered, one of which is that the consumer must associate a particular colour with the origin of the goods, i.e. the product. <p/> In a study carried out in cooperation with the Centre of Business Excellence of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana, Atlantic Droga Kolinska obtained data showing conclusively that consumers associate Pantone 214 C with the origin of the goods, i.e. the Barcaffè brand. <p/> It was found that the highest proportion of consumers correctly recalled Barcaffè when seeing the magenta colour Pantone 214 C, 92.3%, which indicates a really high level of recognition among the public and is also extremely high when compared to brands at the tapestry level. <p/> All other conditions for the registration of Pantone 214 C as a trademark have also been met. <p/> Data show that in the EU last year, out of almost 154 000 registered trade marks, only 20 were protected as colour. This represents a small 0.01% of all registrations. The most famous colours protected as trademarks are Milka, Manner, Burberry, Louboutin, Whiskas.",News,dev

We would also like to thank Sasha Kumer, Secretary General of the SDPZ, who also supported the taxi drivers' union at the meeting and gave the SDPZ's position. We would also like to thank the SAB, the Left Party, the LMŠ and the SD for their support. <p/> Despite the efforts of the union to raise the issue of changing the law in favour of Uber, unfortunately most of the cons did not want to hear it, they are all just making excuses, saying memorised sentences and avoiding real answers. <p/> With the efforts of taxi drivers and the help of the state, the quality of taxi services has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Taxi meters have been made compulsory (annually certified and calibrated), a licence is required, a tourist examination, no criminal record, adequate financial standing - fixed assets, a roadworthiness test twice a year, special insurance for passengers, the introduction of cash registers, etc. <p/> With the current law, the State strongly regulates the taxi business and makes fraud impossible. However, by changing the law, the taxi business will be set back 30 years, so years of effort will be wiped out in a matter of months. Why? Simply because Uber has a different business model and cannot operate under our laws. <p/> The current government is silent on the fact that Uber will not pay a cent in tax on their profits. The current government is silent on the known facts of the problem of Uber drivers appearing abroad. The current government is silent on the fact that wherever Uber is present, there are major problems, read - robberies, rapes, beatings and even murders. The current government is silent on how it will protect consumers and the potential disputes and problems that will arise with the arrival of Uber, how and in what way the government will protect consumers and who consumers can turn to in order to resolve them. The current government is silent on the fact that a ride that today a consumer pays €5 for on the taximeter when Uber arrives will, according to their algorithms, also be €20 or more if demand is high at that moment. The current government is silent that the change in legislation does not do any good, not for the country, not for the taxi drivers, and least of all for the consumers. <p/> Despite the fact that we did not win the session and the change in the law was approved in the session, we will not stop, we will work for all taxi drivers and residents and their better future. We are concerned about the future and the safety of our citizens, that is why we are NOT against ""competition"", but we are against changing the law. <p/> Unlike the current government, we in the union are happy to see the cooperation and listening of local authorities. We are happy about the warm and positive reception at the MOL, we are happy that in the future in Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Mayor Mr Jankovič, we will bring the taxi business to the highest possible level, both with vehicles, drivers and prices that will be accessible to any user, regardless of the arrival of foreign platforms.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

932,"After Empire <p/> Why is America now generally perceived as a self-righteous, violent warmonger? How has a country that until recently played a vital role in shaping the international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder? Why is America no longer the world's leading example of liberal democracy, international security and economic prosperity? Is the United States, the world's only surviving superpower, in danger of becoming marginal - of finding itself in a world that no longer needs it? <p/>After Empire, a critically acclaimed European bestseller, is a provocative and ultimately sobering look at America's changing role in the international community. Emmanuel Todd shot to fame when, in his first book, La Chute finale, he accurately predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union by analysing the country's fertility rates, infant mortality rates, marriage rates and literacy rates. Now - with the diagnosis that America's supremacy is weakening, which he made on the basis of demographic and economic factors - Todd offers an interesting re-evaluation of American superiority. <p/> Todd shows that at a time when the rest of the world is finding that it can get along without America - more and more countries are becoming educated, democratic and economically stable - America is slowly realising that it cannot get along without the rest of the world. Burdened by a huge domestic and foreign trade deficit, the falling value of the US dollar, the unexpected bankruptcy of several important companies and the fact that it can no longer support itself with its own production, America is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign money. This dependence is steadily eroding its political and economic influence, which is unprecedented in history. <p/> Readers' views <p/> In 2017, it is no longer possible to talk about a unipolar world order. What seemed unbelievable to the superficial observer in 2014 has become a reality. It is no longer possible to take decisions in the Eurasian area without the involvement of Russia or China. But let us go back a step further. The brief war in 2008, when Georgia sought to annex the separatist republic by force, was one of the first harbingers that the balance of power had changed. The Russian army was still clumsy at the time - compared to the annexation of Crimea - but it defeated the Georgian army, equipped and trained by the Americans, in a mere five days. <p/> In 2008, however great an optimist he was, he could not - however much he wished to - say much good about the Russian economy. Today, Russia has become the largest grain exporter, a self-sufficient food producer, and a force that is reviving and revitalising the automotive, aerospace, petrochemical and electronics industries. It has shown that it can no longer be blackmailed economically. <p/> The book 'After Empire' was published in 2006, but its basic idea must have been laid no later than 2005, when we were all still deeply asleep and unaware of the tectonic changes that were about to take place. One could say that the book was visionary, which makes it an extremely interesting read, because how is it possible that the author could have had a hunch in 2005 - when we were calling the Russian army 'old iron' and making fools of its economics - about the direction in which the world was moving? - Matej P. <p/> A look into the book",Opinion/Argumentation,dev

Recent media reports that fires on buildings with solar power plants cannot be extinguished are incorrect. <p/> The Slovenian Fire Brigades Association (DFB) has drawn up recommendations for firefighters based on the intervention guidelines of the German Fire Brigades Association (DFB). The BISOL Group, the only domestic manufacturer of photovoltaic modules, has contributed its extensive experience and expertise to the development of these recommendations. In other parts of the world, the procedures for extinguishing fires at solar power plants are clearly defined, and BISOL has been familiar with them and has been following them from the outset. <p/> With many requests for advice from regional fire brigades coming to the BISOL Group, the Group is pleased that the Fire Brigades Association of Slovenia did, however, issue recommendations for firefighters last December and forwarded them to all the fire brigades associations across Slovenia. The recommendations clearly set out what to do in the event of a fire at a solar farm. The fire may be extinguished with water, subject to the prescribed minimum safety distance, which is 1 metre for medium-voltage energy installations extinguished with a water mist extinguisher and 5 metres for water jet extinguishing. Fire flames can also be stopped with a dust extinguisher, a CO2 extinguisher, and a foam extinguisher can only be used to extinguish non-energised appliances. <p/> As of 1 January, the amended Fire Regulations also finally came into force, requiring a fire plan to be drawn up for buildings equipped with a solar power plant connected to the public electricity grid. The fire plan must be displayed in a conspicuous place and brought to the attention of the regional fire brigade. All solar power plants of the BISOL Group shall be installed in accordance with the applicable regulations. <p/> In view of the success of photovoltaics on the global market, the BISOL Group firmly believes in the long-term viability of generating electricity from solar energy and looks forward to cooperating with the Slovenian Fire Brigades Association in the future.",Other,dev

Homemade washing powder is highly recommended, not only to save money, but also because the ingredients are natural and easily available.

Pour the soap into the container while it is still warm, before it starts to harden, but there should still be some space left in the container. It is recommended that the container you are going to use has room for about four litres of liquid. <p/> Place the container in a cold place to allow the washing powder to cool down, and stir it in between to make sure that the liquid does not harden completely. If you do, just stir the detergent again to make it runny again. <p/> Once it's cooled, add 30 drops of any essential oil you like to make your laundry smell the way you want it to smell and add a tablespoon of vinegar to make your laundry soft without any additional softeners. <p/> Stir it all together again and your homemade laundry detergent is ready to use.",Instruction,dev

1000,"The debate often brings to the surface first those values that people in the kindergarten, school, organisation think they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to be respected as much as possible by themselves and the organisation. <p/> We know that the values people express publicly can be very different from the values they express in their own actions and behaviour. People's behaviour often seems to 'violate' values that they claim to hold important and sacred. Such ""double morality"" is a commonplace phenomenon, reflecting the disconnect between one's actual values, what one really values and cares about, and how one would like others to see one. <p/> If this phenomenon is so typical of human beings, it is logical that it cannot be avoided when discussing values within an organisation. Such a discussion often brings to the surface, in particular, the values that people feel they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to make themselves and the organisation as attractive and respected as possible. <p/> If the values that are written down do not match those that the organisation and its people express in their actions and behaviour, they cannot have a positive impact on employees and users. <p/> Just as the ""double morality"" of the individual is unattractive, the ""double morality"" of the organisation, or the wide gap between its stated values and what its actions express, is an ideal breeding ground for cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule and other negative phenomena. Written values that are literally at odds with what happens in the organisation cannot possibly have a positive impact on its employees and users. On the contrary, they often become a source of further dissatisfaction. It is therefore all the more important that the debate on the values of the organisation really goes deep, not contenting itself with superficial answers, and that it examines and tests the values it evokes. <p/> For example, if the debate points out that what matters most to employees is ""good relations with users"", it is important to ask whether this is really being implemented in practice. Does the day-to-day behaviour of the organisation and its people really reflect this concern? Do their actions and procedures really reflect this? <p/> In summary, it is useful to talk about, discuss, clarify and define values. But in doing so, organisations should be as careful as possible to avoid the tendency to ""sugarcoat"" the truth, to portray values ""as they should be"" rather than ""as they are"". Otherwise, the debate on values can quickly turn into its opposite, which instead of having positive consequences, encourages cynicism, sarcasm and dissatisfaction, and has a negative impact on employees' motivation, work zeal and morale.",Opinion/Argumentation,dev
