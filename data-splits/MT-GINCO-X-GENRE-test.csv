2,"Project INNOVAge and the Oreli Institute <p/> The Oreli Institute responded to an invitation from the Development Centre of the Heart of Slovenia, which, in the framework of the INNOVAge project, had the task of bringing external experts in the field of elderly care, telecare, e-health, eco-innovations in housing and houses adapted to the elderly, to a study visit in Helsinki, Finland. 13 European partners are involved in this project, including the Heart of Slovenia Development Centre as the only Slovenian partner. <p/> The main objective of the INNOVage project is to transfer good practices in Europe in the field of active ageing and independent living of older people in their own homes, supported by smart ICT (information and communication technologies). <p/> So, from 10 to 12 June 2013, we visited the activities and the current situation in Finland. We prepared a presentation of our innovative model of helping the elderly in their homes, which we developed in Kamnik. After the successful presentation and after organising networking events and networking with partners and external experts of partners, we held several meetings. We received confirmation that the Slovenian - Kamnik project is innovative, of high quality, grew out of the needs on the ground, supported by expertise and interesting to implement in other settings. <p/> We found it interesting that a lot of experts are developing ICT to a very high level, but we heard little or nothing on the subject of support systems that would enable the concrete use of ICT in practice. At the Oreli Institute we are aware that it is necessary to have not only the tools, but above all the knowledge and infrastructure to use a well-developed tool.",Promotion,test
3,"In November, the month of addiction prevention, members of the Local Action Group for Addiction Prevention will hold a series of expert lectures for parents of primary school children in Celje... <p/> The lectures, which will be organised this month at nine primary schools in the municipality of Celje, are aimed at parents of pupils in grades 6 to 9. The lecture programme is financially supported by the Municipality of Celje. The lectures will focus on the protective factors of education that can help to prevent drug use. Drugs, both licit and illicit, are increasingly being used by children. The lectures will also provide parents with information on what behavioural and physical changes to look out for when they suspect that their child has used drugs. Although the topic is topical, shedding light on effective parenting skills and communicating with children in conflict situations in addition to addiction problems, only 160 parents attended last year's series of lectures in eight primary schools. This time, the organisers hope for a better response. The series of lectures will be delivered by experts in medicine, psychology, social work and criminology.",News,test
12,"Bullshit detector! <p/> Ekola, they told me to write a blogpost about something that happened at the conference! The most interesting talk, in my opinion, was given by Gustav Martner, Executive Creative Director of CP+B Europe (Crispin Porter + Bogusky Europe) <p/> Mr. Martner lectured about advertising, internet, media, his mom, cable TV, kids, about how the microphone crashes - yes it's true, a couple of times the microphone failed while he was lecturing, but what I liked the most was that he got the audience on his side when he said that the microphone is a bullshit detector (for those who don't count, the microphone stops working when Gustav is loading the microphone). Audience relaxed, attention gained. <p/>What did he say about the Internet as a medium? To sum it up in a few lines and a few more photos. I would like to point out that, in general, the conference did not discover hot water, as they say, in fact they did not say anything so new, but they presented it in an interesting way. This applies to the minority of lectures in English! Unfortunately, I do not know if they said anything more specific in the Spanish-speaking lecture theatres. <p/> Gustav Martner during his lecture <p/> Let's have a slide to rest your eyes, and I'll rest my fingers: <p/> Why don't sales people like this? - Because technology is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because digital distribution is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because anyone can be an agent (an ambassador for a product) - Because dialogue and conversation are being mass-produced - Because control is increasingly being lost <p/> The creativity of the advertising product, the culture it creates, is no longer as controllable as it used to be. <p/> Does this mean that traditional media such as TV, radio or print, as well as conventional online advertising, have a competitive opponent? Does it mean that there is an end to the traditional advertisements that are collected from a few people and that are advertised with the brute force of online or offline marketing? For such campaigns, we have to pay a lot of money, we call it 'bought media' - because we have paid to have a new product flogged to us on the web! <p/> Gustav Martner says NO! NOT AT ALL! <p/> He proved it with the example of Burger King T-shirts, just look at the Gustav Martner - OMExpo Madrid slides. If it is good advertizing, it is quickly used by the onlinecommunity and the issue goes viral! Which is genius! Two things are the only things that matter! <p/> The first is that there is no such control over what goes viral. It takes good foresight and planning to offer the communitiy what you want them to grab. Bait! ;) The second is that clients are afraid of the negative image and connotation of the product or service that viral content would bring.",Opinion/Argumentation,test

26,"In the fashion world, there are supposed to be rules of dress that real fashion enthusiasts do not follow. What is right and what is wrong has recently become even more of a subjective decision for the individual, so it is right that we should also debunk some of the fashion myths that we have blindly followed up until now. Why is this happening? Because fashion history is unfolding in such a way that what was once fashionable, which has become unfashionable, is now ""in"" again. But with an innovative twist. <p/> Rule No.1 - Same shoes and same handbag <p/> Once such an important rule that we held sacred, but nowadays you can safely forget it. Where we used to be on the lookout for shoes that matched our handbag, now we look for shoes that complement, contrast or even just match in a small detail. Give yourself a break and treat yourself to a crazy combination of a neon handbag and floral sandals. <p/> Rule No. 2- Don't mix patterns <p/> Mix them up to no end! If the designers of famous brands and fashion gurus can mix them, then so can you. You can look for inspiration from designers like D&G, Betsey Johnson, Preen and Mary Katrantzou, and many more. If you can't find your own designs on the shelves of the more affordable clothing brands, there are fabulous designer goods available in metro stores where they can make you the garment you want. <p/> Rule No. 3 - The older you get, the more you ""cover up"" <p/> It's like life after 40 is over! The vast majority of women look much better in their 40s than many women in their 20s. And if you have all the attributes of youth, why hide them? If you still have perfect legs at 45, treat yourself to a knee-length skirt and heels. Just make sure you don't overdo it and don't dress in clothes designed for 20-year-olds. Mini-skirts only suit 20-year-old girls anyway. <p/> Rule No 4- Never wear tights or open-toed socks <p/> If you had dared to step out on the street in such an outfit a few years ago, you would have been met with a lot of ridicule and strange looks. But nowadays, many women are wearing this very combination! Take Rihanna or Alexa Chung, who have taken the fashion world by storm with their unique styles. Now it's time to pair your favourite tights with summer open toes and a short skirt. <p/> Rule No. 5 - underwear must never show through your clothes <p/> Remember when we used to hide our bra straps with fervor? Or better still, the whole bra, just so it wouldn't show. And when we came across the sheer material of a beautifully tailored blouse, we were in for a big surprise, precisely because of the visibility of the underwear. Fashionistas don't even remember that myth anymore, let alone follow it! For peace of mind, you can have a sheer white blouse and your favourite coloured bra.

29,"First memory book <p/> A first memory book is the most beautiful gift at the birth of a child. New subscribers to My Toddler magazine receive it as a gift! <p/> How quickly it's forgotten which baby name suggestions were made by mummy and which by grandma, exactly when baby first rolled over on his side, which toy was his favourite at eight months, who came to celebrate his first birthday, what the toddler called the bottle when he was very small.... Wouldn't it be nice to capture some of those sweet memories forever? <p/> Baby Memory Book <p/> When there is a baby or a young child in the house, young parents certainly have no time to spare. That's why many young parents don't even think of writing down the small and big events of their baby's earliest years, because they are so tired every day that they can hardly wait for a good night's rest. And yet... How quickly childhood passes and how we love to go back to it! Little bigger children want to know everything about their early childhood - what toys they played with, what shoes they wore, what their first bedding was like... We could listen to stories about this for hours. But it's amazing how quickly these tiny everyday details slip from parents' and grandparents' memories! <p/> And it's not just the little kids, teenagers and adults alike love to go back to their first childhood. It is as if they want to reconstruct a time that they remember only vaguely, only in a hunch. It is only when their parents or grandparents put it into words for them with their own memories that they seem to have linked their feelings and memories into events that make sense and can be explained. The satisfaction they feel in doing so is certainly worth the effort of writing and editing their first memory book. Why not give it to them? Such memories bind adults and children together with a warm bond of love, knowing how much we have always loved them and also - what they have done for us over the years. Isn't that worth writing a line here and there in the first memory book or sticking a photograph in it? <p/> Support for parents What should we write in the first memory book? No, the problem is not that nothing important happened in the baby's life. Too much is happening, because in the first year a baby grows from an almost helpless newborn into a toddler who is already taking his first steps. And in the next year he starts to talk more and more, and better and better, and by the age of three he can do almost ""everything"" - talk, run, fall asleep on his own, catch and throw a ball, draw... The child just needs to deepen and sharpen his knowledge. There is indeed much to write about in the first three years of a child's earliest childhood. <p/> The first memory book is therefore designed so that in each month from birth to the child's third year, the developmental path of the average child is described - his physical development, his motor development, the development of his ability to communicate, etc. And then there is enough space to write down, for each month, information about your own child, an exceptional, beloved and inimitable individual. It is not a question of comparing the average child, or what a child 'should' already know, with our own child, because every child is an inimitable being who is loved for who he or she is, not for what he or she has already achieved. Each child develops at his or her own pace and has every right to do so. The description of developmental characteristics covers only what is common to all children. What young parents want to know is what they can expect in the coming months. <p/> The average developmental characteristics of each month of infant and child age will give parents enough support to also assess what is worth writing about their child. In addition, there is enough space in the first memory book to stick baby's photos, first drawings, descriptions of first funny events, a list of birthday party invitees and so on. <p/> What was it like when I was little? They hardly speak, children want to know what it was like when they were little. They are not at all bothered by the thought that they are, in fact, still small. And they are right - why not look forward to every new step in their development? Just watch a child proudly comparing their 'big' hand with the tiny handprint and sole you have glued in their first memory book! A photo of his first cot will spark a conversation about how he used to sleep and how big he is now. And the photo of him lying next to his first teddy bear will remind you how tiny his body used to be... Children will also love looking at their memory book because each page features cute and playful characters from his childhood - teddy bears, ladybirds, butterflies, elves, Santa Claus, pets... <p/> Jealousy of the baby Such memories, written in the book and in the photographs, can also help a child facing the arrival of a baby brother or sister, a baby who is not difficult to be jealous of because he or she needs so much love and care from their parents. In the conversation around his first memoir, we can show him that, even though he is now a ""bigger"" child, he needed and received all that love and attention too. Perhaps it will be easier for the child to understand that a sibling will one day be as big and independent as he or she is now, that he or she will become a playmate and companion. <p/> If we also write and furnish the baby's first memory book for a sibling, the older child will be able to keep up-to-date with how his or her sibling is developing. Parents will also benefit from such a comparison, because it is nice to know that a child's development always ends the same way, even if at times the moments seem to drag on forever, and at other times time seems to pass at an unbearable speed. <p/> First time at sea, first Christmas and New Year... Children find it difficult to understand the dimension of time - what was six months ago and what will be two years from now. They live primarily in the present moment, which is why it is so difficult for them to wait, even if ""just a little"". At three years old, last summer, when we were at the seaside, seems infinitely far away. Don't be surprised if he doesn't remember anything more than if he had never been to the seaside at all. Because for him, last summer really is very far away. It happened in the previous third of the child's life. If you are thirty years old, that would mean to you that it happened ten years ago... Joking aside. It's much easier for children (and adults too) to reminisce when they see photographs. That's why the first memory book has a special space dedicated to records and photos of your child's first Christmas and New Year, first trip to the seaside and first birthday. Looking at the photos together often brings back memories that you have not kept, but that grandma or grandpa, or sometimes the child, may surprise you and tell you something else that can take you back to happy times. <p/> A gift for a child or grandparent? You can also write and furnish your first memory book almost in secret. Perhaps one day you could give it to your child as a very special gift, telling him or her how much you have always loved him or her and how much you have cared for his or her happiness. You could give it to your child when they come of age, when they get married or when their first child is born. <p/> Or your first memory book can be a nice gift for your grandparents. It will be nice if you write it and give it to them already completed. Or you can give it blank, unfilled. Grandparents usually have more time than a young family, and they are very eager to have contact with their child. They may enjoy filling out their first memory book. The grandparents will also find the record of their child's development in the book helpful, because many grandparents, after many years of being young parents themselves, have forgotten what it is like to have a baby and how babies develop into toddlers. It is a great pleasure for them to recall this old knowledge, and also the memories of their own children that come to mind. <p/> A gift at birth It is also a good idea to give a first memory book to the parents-to-be or the new parents. You don't always have to give knitted slippers and two bodysuits, and there are bound to be a few teddy bears before the new parents can buy the first one to their liking. It is much better to be original and give a first memory book that the young family will enjoy for years after they have received it. <p/> Get your first memory book as a gift with a new subscription to My Toddler magazine.",Promotion,test

57,"Jerry is leaving <p/> If you wanted to add symbolism to the script for the end of Andre Jerman's career, you would actually have only two options: win or lose. Unfortunately, fate chose the latter. The best Slovenian downhill skier of all time and still the only winner of a World Cup race on the men's side did not want to take much time to think about the next steps after his recent accident in Kitzbühel. <p/> As if he wanted to get rid of the burden as quickly as possible and push the stone away from his heart, he announced his appearance in front of the seventh force shortly after his return to Tržič. Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision.

Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy for him. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much.

For a long time, after all, Slovenians were considered to be only technical skiers with a daring excursion into the supervelles slalom. Jerman, on the other hand, made history in downhill, the fastest and for many the royal discipline. He will always be remembered as the first Slovenian winner of a World Cup downhill event. He was not a one-day flyer either, winning twice and finishing second and third, proving his quality and showing his mettle on a variety of terrain. His stability and excellence are also reflected in his breakthrough into the elite seven of the World Cup. He has finished two seasons in a row among the fastest. With a slight time lag, his skiing transformation was followed by his progression in the Super-G, where he never reached the podium, but finished fourth twice. <p/> His pioneering achievements paved the way for his compatriots. Already when he was breaking through, the national team formed a team for the fast disciplines under the leadership of Jože Gazvoda, his father, who was also a skier. After a few flashes from Peter Pena, Gašper Šparovec and before that Ales Brezavšek, ""Jerry"" was the first to prove that it is not an end in itself and that it is worth investing in the ski ranks. The ""speedsters"" were getting bigger and better, and as a result, the technical defector Andrej Šporn, Rok Perko, Alek Glebov, Gašper Markič and finally the promising Boštjan Kline started to make their way to the World Cup. <p/> It started very early, far away from the cameras. At the age of 13, he ended his skiing on the Soriška planina mountain when he collided with a spruce tree and broke both his legs. But it was at that point in his career that his stubbornness and perseverance came to the fore. A year later, he won the traditional Ponochio Cup and went on to show his talent in all age categories. Unfortunately, along with his skiing skills, he then brought a wave of injuries to the competition. The recent fall in Kitzbühel was not his only one at Streif. He paid the price of youthful enthusiasm and perhaps too little respect in his first encounter with the famous slope. He left the Rooster Ridge with damaged knee ligaments. Shortly after his rehabilitation, he broke it again, this time on the Zermatt glacier, and once again his knee was struck. Then, just when it looked like he had fulfilled his injury bonus, he fell again in 2004 and injured his knee for a third time. With all these injuries, the wrist fracture and the shoulder pain after falling off the chairlift are marginal. <p/> More fatal for Jerman was a fall at the start of the 2011/12 season, when he was already contemplating the end of his career after crashing into the guardrail of the Birds of Prey track in Beaver Creek. But he decided to rehab his injured knee and return to the World Cup caravan. He went ahead with his plan, but another fall prevented him from completing it. This time in Kitzbühel. Although it was ""only"" a concussion, and fortunately the ligaments and bones remained intact, it was the last one of his career. <p/> Martin Pavčnik, Siol.net <p/> Biggest successes: 2 World Cup ski race wins (Garmisch 2006/07 and Bormio 2009/10) and two more top 3 finishes.

He also has occasional outbursts (like yesterday in the kitchen he kicked the door and broke it), he doesn't get on our nerves. I don't know what to do anymore because I can't even see him anymore, that's how much I hate him (I really hate him)! !!! <p/> I have told him so many times that he will ruin all our lives, but he is not moved by it and goes to the pub and drinks it instead. <p/> just recently my mum lost her job and now we will mostly depend on his salary. but I am worried that he will lose his job too, because usually when he is drunk for a couple of days in a row then he just doesn't go to work for a couple of days (I'm surprised they haven't fired him yet). but I am a student and I have lectures all week and I would work very hard. when I can I go to earn money for myself. <p/> my mother and I can't live like this anymore because she is at her wits end and I am also scared for my life because I notice that I have changed a lot in the last 2 years-I am closing myself in. And we were thinking of moving away but I don't know how we would support ourselves, because now my mother will only receive 300€ of social assistance. And it will be very difficult for her to get a job because she is 51 years old and has no education. Even if we moved out I don't know what would happen with this flat as it is in both our names (half half). <p/> I have had a boyfriend for almost 4 years but he doesn't know anything about it because I am so ashamed to tell him and I hide it from him and his whole family and even when we are together we are always at his place. I don't know how he would react to it. I have thought many times about telling him but I am too ashamed because he thinks everything is ok at my house. <p/> I really don't know what to do anymore... who to turn to... because my mum and I just want to have a peaceful life. <p/> I apologise for being so rash but I was really feeling very down about this. <p/> Greetings <p/> Dear! <p/> Your situation is really not simple. Apart from the fact that your father is an alcoholic with all the attendant bad behaviour, both you and your mother are materially dependent on him. They also share a flat. <p/> Given that you are studying and are now 22 years old, you can really count on not being alone in this home for much longer, and probably for some time to come. <p/> Your mother's situation has, of course, worsened with the loss of her job. <p/> The first thing I think is important: that you see your situation as something that is transitory, that will not last forever. You will finish school and you will be able to leave, as my sister did. You will also be able to help your mother in one way or another. <p/>Now it would also not make sense for the mother to just give up, that she will not be able to earn anything more and that she will be totally dependent on the father. <p/> For your present mental distress, it is really urgent that you both seek help. I do not know what part of Slovenia you are in, but today we have groups in all the major towns and cities that could help you in this respect. Individual counselling is also possible. I enclose some addresses. <p/> This is not just about helping to get your father into treatment, but for the relatives of an alcoholic who are in need of help. <p/> And this: you have a boyfriend and you are ashamed to tell him how it is at home. I think it would be a great comfort to you to be able to share your pain with a man who means something to you and who would, of course, also have a proper understanding of it. I imagine that you will be able to share your worries with your boyfriend much more easily if you have talked about them somewhere else before. There is a very good opportunity for this in groups where relatives of alcohol addicts gather. <p/> So I would really encourage you to look for the possibility of such group and/or individual counselling. <p/> Hello, Anica <p/> AA - Alcoholics Anonymous can help you if you have found that alcohol is also a problem for you. <p/> www.aa-drustvo.si <p/> 01/433 82 25 <p/> AL-ANON - A community of family groups where family and friends of alcoholics come together.

78,"Advent is a time of anticipation. Preparations for this year's Christmas are upon us. Preparation requires a certain amount of cooperation and commitment on our part. We do not wait with our arms crossed. Only children behave like that, not knowing what to do and therefore bored. If I personally want to prepare for the holiday and also get the most out of the holiday, then I have to make a programme of what I want to achieve and then work hard to really achieve the goals I have set. I will not dwell on those for whom Christmas is just a nice family holiday, when they are at home more, when they are doing the gift-giving, when they are perhaps having a Christmas holiday together on the white slopes, but we will not see them in church for the holidays because they have no faith, or because they think they have done enough by putting up a Christmas tree and an artistic nativity scene at home. I will leave aside those things that have no connection with the Christian faith and instead dwell on the Slovenian traditional Christmas celebration. What goals can I set myself in preparation for Christmas? For some, Christmas will be a time to reminisce about old times, to think about childhood and time with parents and family traditions. So they will put up the nativity scene and the Christmas tree, bless the premises in the old way, say a prayer and have a good dinner. At midnight, they will probably attend a midnight feast. It will be a really nice revival of an old tradition, and many will enjoy it. With this revival of old customs and traditions, the question that comes to my mind is: What benefit will this bring me? To what extent will these old traditions change and transform me? What will this new preparation for Christmas bring me that will make my everyday life different, richer, calmer and more meaningful? The beautiful old traditions are certainly necessary because they speak of our historical memory, which is necessary and we should not be ashamed of. Beautiful traditions are the wealth of a nation, and it is right to preserve and revive them. However, it seems to me that this will not bring into my daily life the new things that will challenge me, because they will offer me new content, because they will require me to bring into the Advent preparation for Christmas the novelties that are part of me, linked to my thinking and feeling. In this way, Christmas will no longer be just a nice old folklore, but will have a touch of the contemporary, of my personal life. Analysts have noted that man, especially Western man, and thus also Slovenian man, is increasingly losing his soul because he has allowed himself to be so drawn in by materialism that he can no longer shake it off. Materialism is like a terrible anaconda, a serpent that wraps itself around its victim and squeezes him so that he can no longer escape from its embrace. This squeezing of the serpent gets worse and worse by the moment, as it breaks the victim's bones, and in the end she suffocates, all numb. To live a more free life worthy of man, it is necessary to get out of this embrace and to put a limit to materialism. We must realise that money must not be our master, but on the contrary, we must be its master, we must put a limit to consumerism. Advent preparation for Christmas therefore consists first of all in making a careful analysis of my ordinary life. I must see clearly and evaluate my desires and expectations, but I must also be aware of my limits and my delusions. Both need to be put on the scales and to see which way the scales tip: if there are too many negative things, action needs to be taken immediately. Any delay will only lead to a growing alienation from oneself, from one's neighbours and from God. Any persistence in negative things leads to more and more dependence. At a certain point, you have to tell yourself that the time has come to get rid of all that weighs you down, takes away your freedom and harms you. It is necessary to remove all these things and say loud and clear to yourself: 'Why should I harm myself! I don't want to see this anymore! ""The strong will that is awakened by this then needs to be strengthened more every day. It is necessary to reckon with God, it is necessary to reckon with the power of prayer, and above all it is necessary to deepen faith. Only he who believes in God is then able to throw himself into God's arms, to confess his guilt and sins and to forgive first himself and then his neighbour. This is the only way we can purify ourselves and free ourselves from the past that presses us to the ground and does not let us breathe freely. We must first forgive ourselves, gain respect and trust, so that we can then forgive our neighbours and finally be reconciled to God. This is the only way to breathe more freely. Any search for any other means that does not take into account man's guilt and purify it with God's forgiveness and mercy is doomed to failure. So let us not fall for the various Internet offers that promise a quick solution. This is just a waste of money without any real effect. Why not rather cling to God, who demands no payment for Himself. His love is free, everything we receive from Him is free. Why not make the most of the opportunity that is given to us. Why not make something beautiful out of our lives that we will always be proud of and others will be richer for our change. Above all, we must remember what the prophet Jeremiah told us in the first verse: ""The days will come when I will keep my promise! ""For God keeps His covenant: what He promises, He keeps. Perhaps we do not see this in our own lives because we have not yet allowed God to come in and put our lives in order. Perhaps we have relied too much on ourselves and our own abilities, and so we do not recognise the miracles that are happening today. Perhaps we have been so tempted by money that we have bet everything on this one ticket, and so we are constantly afraid and trembling about what will happen to our savings, which have been severely depleted by the recession. Yes, we need to get rid of this fear and build our confidence on new foundations that are not destroyed by the moth. So today we set out on the road to prepare for Christmas this year. May this holiday truly be a challenge to everyone to make this Christmas different. Christ came as our Saviour to be reborn, so that we might become new people. So now is the chance for each of us to make that happen. There is no exception. For me, too, this feast is a challenge, even though things may be clearer to me in theory. Theory is not life. That is why the preparation and the celebration itself must leave an impact on our emotional sphere, on our attitude to life and to everything that surrounds us. When this happens, we will indeed look at Christmas very differently. It is certainly true that Christmas is the most romantic of all the Church festivals, but it must also bring new content to our lives. Let us therefore enter boldly into the Advent season and use it for our personal renewal and the renewal of our parish community. <p/> Contact us <p/> Spiritual reflection",Opinion/Argumentation,test

88,"Coronary heart disease <p/> Share: <p/> Coronary heart disease is a condition that develops when the coronary arteries, the main blood vessels that supply the heart with food and oxygen, become damaged or diseased. Coronary artery disease is most often caused by plaque deposits (plaques), which contain cholesterol. <p/> Plaque on the walls of the arteries narrows the artery and reduces blood flow, which means that the heart receives insufficient oxygen and nutrients. Reduced blood flow can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. When a blood vessel is completely blocked, a heart attack can occur. But this never happens from today to tomorrow. In fact, coronary heart disease is a disease that takes years and decades to develop before it shows its teeth. For a long time, the patient has no symptoms and is not even aware of it, which is why it is so dangerous. Because it develops slowly, the patient is also unaware of the changes in his or her lungs, which he or she most often attributes to ageing. Then, suddenly, he is struck by a heart attack (another name for myocardial infarction). That is why it is important to protect ourselves against coronary heart disease while we have time, while our actions will be most effective. The recipe for this is well known: healthy living or lifestyle changes: a healthier diet with less fat, good quality fats, more fresh vegetables and fruit, lots of smaller meals, chewing food for a long time, more fish and less red meat, but also less alcoholic beverages, no smoking and as much exercise as possible. It's a recipe we all know, but it can be hard to follow. <p/> If the coronary arteries are narrowed, they cannot supply the heart with the blood that gives it oxygen. When the heart is beating strongly, for example during physical activity or if we are under severe stress, this lack of oxygenated blood is particularly dangerous. In the beginning, poor blood flow will not cause any major problems. However, as the plaque builds up and the coronary arteries have less and less flow, the patient will have various health problems. One of the best known is chest pain, a tightness or squeezing, as if someone were squeezing your chest. This pain is usually caused by the physical or mental stress mentioned above. Women typically feel the pain slightly differently from men: as a stabbing and very sharp pain in the abdomen, back or arm. A fairly typical warning sign is shortness of breath. If we walk up some stairs that not long ago we could jump up and down without any problems, but now we are short of breath, we should be alert and tell our doctor. Extreme tiredness, exhaustion, can also be a sign of illness. <p/> When the pain is very severe, do not wait. You should see a doctor immediately. It will be best if such a patient is taken straight to the emergency room. Time is very precious in such cases and timely and correct action can save a life.",Information/Explanation,test

The Austrian High Command decided that the Renče church bell tower and the chimneys of the surrounding brickworks should be demolished so that they would not serve as an orientation point for the Italians. After the fall of Gorizia in the Sixth Battle of the Soča on 9 August 1916, Renče found itself in close proximity to the military operations on the Soča Front. The Austro-Hungarian line of defence ran only a few kilometres away from Renče: over St. Mark's Hill above Šempeter, the hills of Vrtojben and Biljen, crossing the Vipava River at Miren and ascending to the Karst past Miren Castle. The Italians wanted to cross the relatively low hills into the Vipava valley.

127,"Why a GTi when there's an XY <p/> Peugeot has offered two special versions of its little 208. Choose the GTi, or the considerably cheaper XY, which, despite its slightly weaker power unit, meets the needs of dynamic drivers. <p/> Nomen est omen, a name is a sign, goes the Latin proverb. Janez Novak is the name of a hard-working Slovene who does not take the right to spend his holidays on a towel by the sea, who is willing to change all his nails for the victory of our basketball players, who is happy with two beers, now and then, he also manages, following the example of ""the rich ones"", to outsmart the state on a levy or squeeze reimbursement from the insurance company for the damage caused to his car by a stranger in the car park in front of his best neighbour. <p/> Not a cliché <p/> With the car code XY, similar clichés might be in the foreground. Ixipsilon it is. But they aren't. The Peugeot 208 XY is actually a very nice refresher, and something of an example that there is still a reserve even in the classic B-segment and that taking buyers between crossovers is not necessarily the right solution, not even for their wallets. The special equipment and extras of the little Peugeot give it a considerable boost on the street. Different front light cues with distinctive white daytime running lights, 17-inch wheels, rear spoiler, chrome inserts including logos, a bold choice of purple for the name... <p/> Parallels with the chunky GTi <p/> Inside, the premium sporty feel is also very much in evidence thanks to the seats, the led lighting and trim, the large screen of the powerful, at times over-complicated infotainment, the dual-zone climate control, the self-dimming mirror, the metal gear lever (a very uncomfortable feeling in weather extremes)... there are plenty of other parallels with the chunkiest of the litter, the GTI. <p/>Both are three-door only, both have wider tracks and a stiffer chassis. And both have unusually positioned gauges for the sake of clarity, so you sit up high, higher than is appropriate for a car inspired by its illustrious predecessors, because, like the GTI, the XY has an ancestor in one of the more civilian versions of the little ripper from 25 years ago. <p/> 156 hp the right choice <p/> So the 208 XY has plenty of sporty driving talent, so despite the diesel option, it's a real sin not to be powered by the (cheaper! ) 1.6 THP engine. Fortunately for the tester, it is. You could say that the powertrain was very lively most of the time, i.e. during normal journeys and during known distances. Good consumption, torque at low revs, good cooperation with the gearbox. When it had to, the car left the figure in the drawer and became a little wrecker, 115 kilowatts at low weight is just not that easy. It didn't shy away from corners either, the chassis and small steering wheel making it easy to handle even close to the limits of physics. It's almost a sin to write, but in a corner it was even more unrelenting than the much sportier RCZ. <p/> A thoroughbred aristocratic underclass yet very talented, this XY.

The Decree, which was discussed and adopted separately by the municipal councils of the three founding municipalities, represents an additional element of cooperation between the three municipalities. With the establishment of the joint municipal administration, the three municipalities of the Sopo region have also formally established cooperation in areas where it makes sense and, above all, is rational. <p/> With the aim of reducing costs and streamlining operations, the Inter-Municipal Inspection was established as an internal organisational unit within the Inter-Municipal Administration to perform the administrative and professional tasks of the municipal administrations of the founding municipalities. It performs the tasks of municipal inspection, municipal road inspection and municipal policing for the founding municipalities, as well as other tasks in accordance with the regulations of the respective municipalities. Due to the nature of the tasks performed for the municipalities by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate is also the infraction authority of the founding municipalities, and its authorised persons conduct the infraction proceedings and decide on infractions defined as such by laws and municipal ordinances, according to the local jurisdiction of each municipality.

165,"Resources <p/> Genealogy discovers and records personal information about individuals and, according to their relationship to each other, groups them together in family links in a specific time and place. In this study, the genealogist intervenes in history and relates family history to the general history, so he or she must at least be familiar with its landmarks and characteristics, such as: <p/> The language and scripts used in the archival material. <p/> Coats of arms and emblems used e.g. on seals, medals, coins. <p/> State and church arrangements. <p/> Customs and customs of society. <p/> Written and other sources of information (e.g. gravestones, votive stones, monuments). <p/> There is a very wide and varied range of genealogical resources and tools of all kinds on the web. You can find them by searching for general keywords such as: genealogy, genealogy, family tree, etc., or by narrowing your search to more specific search terms. Genealogical research generates a large amount of data which, without software support, is difficult to organise into meaningful wholes shortly after the genealogist has researched his or her immediate family. <p/> In Slovenia, Brother's Keeper is still the most popular genealogy software. It has the advantage over others of being translated into Slovene and of supporting the special characters of our alphabet. Among the more modern programmes, the more modern Family Tree Builder (FTB) My Heritage meets these requirements, and there may be others. The procedure for downloading a BK programme from the web is presented in two parts - downloading and adapting. The procedure is also described on the Slovenian Genealogy page, where there are many other useful links. <p/> A pointer to many genealogical resources has been provided by some of the more active genealogists on their websites. For example, colleagues Fonda and Zavodnik. The most complete worldwide genealogical signpost is certainly www.cyndislist.com. Among the domestic resources, we should mention SiStory, where some special issues of the journal Trees have been published, DLib, where, among others, the Lexicon of the Drava Banovina is published, and Kamra (Digitised Cultural Heritage of Slovenian Landscapes). <p/> For searching for persons abroad, there are worldwide genealogical data repositories such as Ancestry. A similar site is FamilySearch. Among European sites, the French Geneanet site and the German Association site are probably the most popular. However, to support the search for ancestors via the World Wide Web and the permanent storage of personal data specific to genealogy, web giants such as Google and Facebook are increasingly getting involved, storing a lot of personal data about their users, which will be the source of future genealogists. <p/> Genealogy is not a young science. The oldest genealogical works are the books of the Bible of the Old Testament. However, most of the old genealogies survive from the ancient world for the royal families and nobility. Genealogical research is another thing that is accessible to everyone in the modern age. May the guidance on our website serve you well.",Information/Explanation,test

186,"Zdenko Matoz, kultura Fri, 27.05, 22:29 The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain is usually received with reluctance at first, but by the end of the concert the audience is enthusiastic. The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain was formed 25 years ago and is mainly made up of BBC announcers Dave Suich, Peter Brooke Turner, Hester Goodman, Richie Williams, Kitty Lux, Will Grove-Whit, Jonty Bankes and George Hinchliffe. <p/> Known for their eclecticism, the band love to play punk classics such as the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, grunge classics such as Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, pop classics such as Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and classics such as Wagner's Hedgehog Valkyrie, and will be performing at Ljubljana's Križanke tomorrow, 29 May, at 8.30pm. We spoke to founding member and leader George Hinchliffe about this unusual orchestra and its musical approach. How do people react when they first hear your ukulele orchestra? <p/> Usually audiences hearing us for the first time have some preconceived ideas of what they're going to hear. They usually expect old swing music to clap their fingers to. We do put some hot jazz standards on the programme, but also rock, even grunge and classical music, and a lot of music that is hard to define stylistically. <p/> We're one of those bands for whom word of mouth does most of the publicity, or at least it has so far. Everyone who has been to one of our concerts comes to the next one with their friends so they can see how they react. Usually people expect our concert to be pretty okay, but then they overlook it and say - aha - get rid of their preconceptions, relax and enjoy the concert. <p/> Does it open up a new musical world for them? <p/> That's right. A well-known theatre producer was brought to our concert by his wife. We met after the concert and he said that he didn't actually want to go to the concert, but after the concert he was delighted because it was immensely entertaining. He pointed out that even though we only use the ukulele and voice in our concerts, we showcase our talent and our ability to entertain and communicate with the audience at a high level. <p/>I don't think there is anything wrong with our concerts, we love the ukulele, we love the music even more and of course we love a good time. And if we are having fun, the audience is usually having fun with us. <p/> How do other musicians see you when they see you playing these toy-like guitars? <p/> We've had a lot of compliments from musicians. We try to make sure that there is something for everyone at our concerts, from a wide range of musical styles and performance styles. <p/>We notice that some people can appreciate certain approaches and song arrangements, especially our famous mixing of musical styles, sometimes even in one song, while others cannot. Some like the humour, others enjoy uncovering the musical layers and pieces of the song that we mix. <p/> Is it difficult to stay serious with instruments like that? <p/> It's possible to be serious with any instrument. The ukulele is just an instrument. It can be played a lot, like an organ, a string quartet or a mobile phone. <p/> Sometimes we play with the misconception that the ukulele is a toy or a joke. Although we try to present our music in a fun way, it is played well and bouncy, ecstatic, sometimes even reaching to the heart. <p/> You travel and perform a lot around the world. How do audiences react when they see and hear you? <p/> As a rule, the audience reacts the same everywhere, in Japan, in the US, in New Zealand... Our concert at Carnegie Hall was rated by the New York Times as one of the five best concerts that year in that prestigious hall. We usually get a standing ovation and calls to play an encore or two. I wonder how our style of music will be received by the Slovenian audience. <p/> How do you go about reworking classical and pop pieces for the ukulele? <p/> We play all kinds of music. Classical pieces are first approached with arrangements, usually written by me, then it's the orchestra's turn. We have to find the right way to translate the symphonic orchestral sound into the sound of the ukulele orchestra - for example, the sound of the harp in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and the sound of the brass in Jezza Valkyrie were a particular challenge. Usually with special and not always easy techniques we successfully convey the spirit of the music. Sometimes the notes fit, as in a military march, but sometimes reinterpretation is necessary. Because we mostly respect the music and the lyrics, we take more freedom in the arrangements and the choice of musical genre. Have any authors ever been offended when they heard your version of their song? <p/> A few times it really came to our ears that some composers or record companies were not impressed with our version. But most of them like it because we pay them the copyright. (Laughs. ) <p/> Because we write our own songs and we are a record label, we can do anything. We've done live shows with Yusuf Islam, who used to be known as Cat Stevens, with the Kaiser Chiefs, and we were special guests on the Madness album. David Bowie said we're fun and clever, and Brian Eno said we could be the turning point or the end point in the history of modern popular music. That is a joke that only works in English. (Laughs. ) Has anyone been very impressed by your version? <p/>When we appeared at the same festival as Wheatus and they found out we were going to play their hit Teenage Dirtbag, they insisted that we join them on stage and we sang that song together. Your performances need skilled ears that know the history of both popular and classical music. Sometimes you combine a number of fragments of different songs into one piece. <p/>I am sure that someone who doesn't know much about music will easily enjoy our concert, but the music connoisseur will of course find additional pleasure and a range of undertones. You don't need any special knowledge to listen to our music, but if you have a little more knowledge, you can get more out of the concert. Many people say that our work is multifaceted, which means that the enjoyment can be multifaceted too. What kind of programme have you prepared for the concert at Križanke? <p/> A delightful, stomping, clapping, singing, dancing and enchanting journey through the history of music. As we say in English - ""one plucking thing after another"". We are on a world tour, travelling with hand luggage only, and we hope to give the audience at least some of what they expect, some of what they need, and some surprises they don't know they need.",Other,test

Yoghurt is one of the foods that has the most positive effect on our digestion, so make sure you include it regularly in your diet. <p/> 3. Yoghurt also boosts the immune system as it contains cultures of living organisms. These boost our body's defences, so when we are stressed or it is cold outside, we should eat yoghurt to protect our bodies against illness. <p/> 4. Some people find milk very difficult to digest because of the lactose. Yoghurt contains much less of it and scientists have shown that this makes it easier to digest.

223,"I suspect that there are at least a handful of us who remember all too well the days when Ray Cokes used to roll the Slayers unreservedly in prime time and when, in the admittedly slightly later hours of the night, MTV Europe used to play a lot of what we still throw into the drawer of alternative and not overly commercial brass bands and brass bands were listened to, not just watched. I wouldn't really debate the diversity of tastes here, but there was a lot to be heard on that channel in its day, especially if you were persisting in a late-night ambush or suffering from insomnia. It would be difficult to judge the current state of mind of all the various derivatives of this brass band institution; I have not been following it for some time, but judging by the words of my younger colleagues, the spirit of the eighties and early nineties has got a bit stuck and has gone on holiday somewhere unknown. <p/> Why such a butch introduction, anyway? Simply because Arrested Development is one of those bands that, without MTV and its inventions like Unplugged, would almost certainly not be known here. This predominantly black collective came to our country in the first half of the nineties on the waves of the aforementioned TV channel with their debut album, etched themselves in our little brains for eternity and then somehow disappeared from our consciousness, so the announcement of CUK in Šiška came as quite a surprise to me. I have to admit, I was almost convinced that AD had disbanded a long time ago, so I was quite happy to see them in Šiška, almost as happy as the fact that last year they released a quite decent and listenable album Strong, which, although it doesn't bring any particular surplus, is a quite pleasant read and the hiphop-funky-Motown inspired melodies easily crawl under your skin, which has been AD's virtue from the very beginning. All in all, a show that would be a sin to miss. <p/> If talking about the fact that the performers wowed the assembled crowd is usually as predictable as possible, I can say exactly that about Arrested Development's performance in Šiška. I haven't seen so many happy and satisfied people per square metre in a long time. Although Šiška wasn't bursting at the seams, it was exactly so full that one could comfortably move around, raise one's hands and sing a little here and there, although it was obvious that the majority of the crowd hadn't come any further than their debut album and, understandably, they were mostly tripping on those good old shtick that had gotten under our skin, or on the musical interludes of the legendary Bob Marley or the slightly less legendary 4 Non Blondes. AD are obviously well aware that their reach in Europe, where they have come after many years, was quite limited and that their brass band alone is just a bit too little to get people up on their feet, but on the other hand, it is a commendable act that the collective did not descend to the level of musical aspirations, although it was just not possible without the most famous shtick, especially in the finale. The intensity of the concert itself was at a high level from the very beginning and it got a bit higher towards the end, also thanks to the drum, bass and karaoke interludes, which, although they cheapened the overall impression a bit for my taste, then in a long encore, perhaps better said in the second part of the concert, they brought the show perfectly to the grand finale, when the brakes were released and the chemistry between the band and the audience worked so well that we can already speak of perfection. <p/> As they like to point out, AD play brass music for the people, by the people, and it would be really hard to find a better demonstration of this principle, especially if we're talking about big concerts, or concerts where at least a hundred or so heads are packed in and there's no question of an intimate atmosphere. There is no doubt that the ADs are well tuned and well tied and know exactly what and how to do to ensure that entertainment, mixed with a good-natured knock on the all-embracing human consciousness, achieves its aim and purpose. Truth be told, AD haven't come up with anything too revolutionary in the last fifteen years, but they make up for it perfectly with the sincerity they put into their music and, apparently, their performances, so it seems they are still that fresh band that exploded in our ears in the early nineties. There wasn't as much of a throwback in their performance as you might expect, more a kind of timelessness caught up in the here and now and a fascination with it, just as the band themselves seemed fascinated by the response they were getting. Look at the photographs and it might be clearer to you what I am trying to say. <p/> In short, the AD concert was simply an uninhibited, relaxed experience of an unpretentious brass band trying to please a wide audience, but not quite everybody and not exactly at any price, which is of course good for the audience, but a little less grateful for the performers themselves, who somehow remain in the shadow of the brass band, which in one way or another, not even necessarily a bad one, stands out and the whole. It's certainly fine and dandy to hear something new and unusual, but even simple entertainment, which nevertheless has a message and is not entirely shallow, is not superfluous and comes in handy now and then. AD are masters at this and it was a real pleasure to listen to them here for the first time, and I hope not for the last time.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
224,"I propose to the Government of Slovenia that, in the event of any illiquidity or insolvency, it should call in a popular loan of EUR 5 billion at 5% interest per annum. The moratorium on payment is 5 years and then payment of principal and interest in 5 annual instalments. <p/> The above-mentioned People's Loan shall be duly presented in the mass media and in all media in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and citizens shall be called upon to do their utmost to help preserve the financial sovereignty of the country. <p/> All citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and all legal entities with their registered office in the Republic of Slovenia are eligible to contribute. <p/> We know from the past that we have already had similar people's loans (the Skopje earthquake, the Austro-Hungarian road loan, the famous war loans, etc.). <p/> Having said that, I would like to point out that the first way to save the banks is to sell their own assets (redundant offices, business premises, union tourism facilities in spas and by the sea and in the mountains) and to pledge and secure the claims of legal and natural persons (flats, houses, businesses, etc.), and then the state should come to the rescue. It is also necessary to limit the salaries of managers in all state-owned companies and institutions to no more than the salary of the President of the country, the Prime Minister... No one can have more, least of all the quasi-experts. For example, the director of NKBM last year reported an annual income of over 270 000 euros, the bank is in the red, Mr Kramar from Izlak has a 1 million euro bonus for 5 years of management plus salary, and NLB has almost 2 billion bad loans, which it is utopian to believe will ever be repaid. If we are playing such games and delusional thinking, all the measures taken by the government and the savings made by all the employees are meaningless. Or the recently published report by the Court of Auditors that the investment in 2 blocks for 170 prisoners at Dob Prison has risen from EUR 6 million to EUR 87 million. Of course, no one will be held accountable, and we will not show the door to any of the 'experts'. It just happens. As long as we do, we will be in for a dive. Do you remember that the Yugoslav Royal Government fled to London in 1941 with tens of tonnes of the country's gold reserves. Today, of course, I do not mean the government, which is doing its best (a few years too late, unfortunately, because we all dreamt of a success story), but individual entrepreneurs, managers and directors. Where will you go, gentlemen? <p/> When the Austrian lands (of which today's Slovenia was a part) were threatened by the Turkish menace, they took away the bells and the silver and gold mass chalices and ritual utensils from the churches, they burned the mass coats in which the gold and silver threads were knitted, they introduced an anti-Turkish tax. The Tlacian Raj, as well as the local feudal lords, groaned under the weight of the burden imposed on them by the imperial office in Vienna. But we escaped the Turkish threat and the Ottoman yoke, with enormous human and material losses that would be felt for decades and centuries to come. So today, if we come together as we did in 1991, we are able to preserve the financial sovereignty of the R.S.S.R. Look, Greece has received and will receive more than €100 billion in aid (I don't know how it will pay it back, probably never! ). Its richest citizens alone have almost €200 billion invested in foreign banks. No comment is needed here. <p/> For me, the financial sovereignty of our country is not something that I would be prepared to sacrifice for. I am sure that the gentlemen from Brussels will manage our money better than our politicians do. As for the Greeks and their money, they are usually successful businessmen, and they are by no means stupid enough to buy in bulk the bonds of a country that is likely to go bankrupt within a few months. <p/> There are more than enough funds in the accounts of R Slovenia residents to sort things out (at least for now! ) on our own without asking for foreign help. But our citizens also have bank accounts in banks in Austria, Liechtenstein, etc. If everyone contributes as much as they can, the matter is solved. We can also guarantee our citizens the eventual sale of Telekom, Petrol, etc., so that they know that they will get their money back in any case. Bonds could be subscribed for at the counters of banks, post offices, administrative units, etc. This is not quite the same as buying treasury bills and the like. With my proposal, we would be buying our country's financial independence and, therefore, our future. Why have money in a sock or in the bank at 2% interest and know that you have done something good for yourself, your children and the whole country of R Slovenia by paying into the People's Loan. That's how it is. This should be an all-Slovenian action, like the signing of the May Day Declaration or something similar during the Austro-Hungarian period. But as I said, no one in state-owned or majority state-owned companies can have a salary higher than the President of the Republic, the Government, etc. (that's 65 pay grade). If we do not solve this problem too, we will have done nothing. There will always be leeches who will try to suckle at the state teat. I would not discuss the professionalism of these gentlemen, otherwise we would not be where we are, which is nowhere. The way they have run things, they would be any economics graduate who takes up his first job as a trainee. I think that he would have been driven by his profession and the professional challenge, whereas these gentlemen were driven solely by the drive for money. <p/> The Government regularly issues bonds. Any EU citizen or company can open a company here and buy the bonds mentioned in the proposal. So they would be no different from other bonds. This government, which is now ""trying its best"", has only recently blocked the much-needed reforms of the previous government through referendums.... in some cases practically the same laws as it is now proposing. Let's not forget this.... Given the way our politicians view the benefit of the state, in fact, coercive administration by Brussels seems to me to be a better idea by the day.

231,"Human resources management <p/> That human resources are a key source of a company's success and that managing them is a priority may sound like an empty phrase, if not an annoying wisecrack. But it is very true, because without the commitment of both employees and management, long-term business success is simply not realistic. So the challenge is how to engage and enthuse employees in the shared story, whatever it may be. A success story or an exit story.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
238,"Address by Dr Dimitrij Rupel, President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia, at the meeting of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) - presentation of the results of the Gymnich meeting <p/> Spoken word counts! <p/> Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament! <p/> Allow me to present some highlights from the discussions of the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers - Gymnich, which took place on 28 and 29 March in Brdo and Bled, Slovenia. On the agenda of the meeting were: the role of Syria in the Middle East, EU-Russian Federation relations, the European perspective of the Western Balkans, intercultural dialogue and Tibet. <p/> THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE ROLE OF SYRIA <p/> The first topic of the Gymnich was a discussion on the situation in the Middle East and the role of Syria. The timing of the discussion on the Middle East peace process and Syria was appropriate given the widespread perception that the Annapolis process is slow or stalled, that there is no change on the ground, that Israel continues to take unilateral measures and that there is a crisis in Gaza. <p/> I briefed colleagues on the assessment and results of my recent visit to the region, where I had the opportunity to exchange views with PR Mubarak of Egypt, MFA Al-Gheit, Arab League GA Moussa, PR Abbas, FM Fayyad, MFA Al-Malki, Israeli PR Peres, FM Olmert, MFA Livni, Netanyahu, Serry and other interlocutors. The talks or assessments of the peace process were dominated by scepticism on the Arab side and moderate optimism on the Palestinian and Israeli sides. <p/> We agreed that a final solution to the BVMP should include Syria. We agreed not to isolate Syria but rather to consider including it. In the past, Syria has taken advantage of our disunity, and we decided to pay more attention to coordinating EU Member States' and EU institutions' contacts with Syria. <p/> We decided that we should not reward ""bad behaviour"" <p/> Solidarity with Lebanon and the Siniora government is needed. <The EU will continue to support the Annapolis process and looks forward to a positive outcome in Moscow. <p/> EU-RUSSIAN FEDERATION <p/> Another important item on the first day of the meeting was the exchange of views on current developments in the Russian Federation and on EU-Russia relations, including in the context of the preparations for the June Summit. The complexity of EU-Russia relations in the political, security and energy fields was underlined. At the same time, the fact that Russia is our largest neighbour and an important strategic partner was highlighted. The June summit is an opportunity to strengthen political dialogue at the highest level and to convey messages to the new Russian leadership. The strategic partnership with Russia needs to be developed as a whole, ensuring EU unanimity and solidarity. Cooperation with Russia also needs to be strengthened in joint ESDP missions and in addressing international issues in the common neighbourhood with a view to ensuring security, peace and security. <p/> We also discussed the negotiating mandate for the new EU-Russia Framework Agreement (PCA). The majority of countries support the early approval of the negotiating mandate and the start of negotiations for a new framework agreement. This means during the Slovenian Presidency. <p/> Lithuania has also expressed its support for the conclusion of a new PCA. Minister Vaitiekunas said at Gymnich that Lithuania will be the first to benefit from a regulated relationship between the EU and the RF. Because of the particular problems they have with the RF, they want to add to the mandate for a new agreement: (1) the issue of the closure of the Druzhba oil pipeline and the Ignalina nuclear power plant (at the end of 2009 Lithuania will thus be fully dependent on the RF) (2) the mention of the disappeared Lithuanian entrepreneur (3) the resolution of the frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood and (4) the guarantee that negotiations can be suspended at any time. They propose that the Secretariat and the EC prepare an analysis on how to boost EU-RF relations. They also advocate relations with the RF at ministerial level. <p/> Incidentally, the UK and French Foreign Ministers Miliband and Kouchner have also written to the Presidency on this issue. In it, they wrote, inter alia, that ""Russia's foreign, security, economic and domestic policies have been a cause for concern in recent years. Perhaps influenced by its new-found value, Russia has questioned the international commitments it made in the 1990s. This has made Russia a more difficult partner. We need to find the right joint response. ... We must underline that we welcome and support President-elect Medvedev's plan to promote the rule of law in Russia. We will certainly judge Russia by its actions, not just its words, and the EU must insist on Russia's compliance with its international commitments on the rule of law and human rights, including those arising from United Nations and Council of Europe documents"". <p/> Ensuring the diversification of energy routes and sources must remain a priority for the EU. The new Framework Agreement should also include a chapter on energy, which is particularly important for the EU in view of the importance of the Russian Federation as an energy supplier. <p/> Realism needs to be brought to relations with Russia. Russia often brings issues into relations with the EU that cause disunity between Member States and increase tensions between them (the issue of frozen conflicts, its attitude towards Kosovo, its opposition to the entry of Ukraine and Georgia into the NATO Membership Action Plan). <p/> The Foreign Ministers underlined the desire to make Russia a trustworthy and transparent partner, which will also be achieved through Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. <p/> The Presidency, together with the Commission, will ensure that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of progress in the negotiations. <p/> WESTERN BALKANS <p/> I am extremely pleased that at Gymnich we have formulated a positive message on the European perspective of the Western Balkans. We have met all the representatives of the Western Balkans, including the Serbian Foreign Minister Jeremić and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Mr Thaci. <p/> A general overview of the situation in the Western Balkans shows that much progress has been made in recent years: greater stability, democratic reforms, economic growth, improved regional cooperation, progress towards the EU through the Stabilisation and Association Process. These achievements now need to be consolidated and built upon, and the Western Balkan countries must work to consistently meet the commitments and conditions within the Stabilisation and Association Process. <p/> Already last December, we agreed in the Council that the Commission would prepare a Communication on the Western Balkans and that we would hold a debate on its content early this year. <p/> Fostering direct contacts between the Western Balkan countries and the EU, especially among the younger generation, is crucial for the internalisation and consolidation of European values by the citizens of the region. This applies in particular to citizens of the former SFRY, who were able to travel freely throughout Europe before 1990. In this context, I would like to highlight the dialogue on visa facilitation that we have already started with Serbia (31 January), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (20 February), Montenegro (21 February) and Albania (7 March). At Saturday's meeting, I and my colleagues called for the early completion of the so-called ""roadmaps"" containing realistic criteria for the introduction of a visa-free regime for the countries of the region. We also discussed the possibility of introducing free visas for the countries of the Western Balkans as part of the roadmaps already mentioned. <p/> We also discussed how to further strengthen regional cooperation and economic development in the Western Balkans, both of which are key to further stabilising the region and bringing it closer to the European Union. In this context, the EC Communication highlights a number of important areas and proposes some new initiatives, e.g. in the field of energy and transport (launch of negotiations on a transport agreement), a new initiative to set up an Investment Fund for the Western Balkans, and an initiative for enhanced cooperation between the Western Balkans region and the EU in the field of civil protection. <p/> The establishment of the Regional Cooperation Council (27 February in Sofia) represents another achievement in the field of regional cooperation and an expression of greater regional ownership. <p/> There is unanimity within the EU that the existence of a strong and active civil society is crucial to accelerate the implementation of political and economic reforms, and to strengthen democracy and promote reconciliation in the Western Balkans region. In this context, we at Gymnich welcomed the establishment of a special fund for the development of civil society, as proposed by the EC in its Communication. <p/> Concretising the European perspective of the Western Balkans <p/> The region is specific and needs special encouragement, especially in those countries where the EU integration process is faced with weak political will or low administrative capacity. The EU therefore needs to act with particular determination and courage in the region. The Slovenian Presidency will work to reaffirm and further concretise the European perspective of the countries of the region. <p/> At the meeting, we underlined that significant progress in the accession negotiations is possible in the current year, provided that Croatia meets the ""benchmarks"" and other conditions contained in the EC's March communication. <p/> Despite its difficulties, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has established a positive example of a multi-ethnic society. It needs further support and affirmation to strengthen internal cohesion. We sincerely hope that Skopje will meet the conditions (""benchmarks"") set out in the Accession Partnership as soon as possible, which, on the basis of a positive assessment in the next EC Annual Report, would allow a date to be set for the start of accession negotiations later in 2008. <p/> Montenegro and Albania have recently made significant progress in fulfilling their obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, which constitutes an important incentive for other countries in the region. In the Brdo Declaration, we called on both countries to accelerate the implementation of the Interim Agreement and to step up efforts to build institutional capacity, public administration and an independent judiciary as a condition for upgrading relations with the EU. <p/> As regards Bosnia and Herzegovina, the implementation of police reform remains a condition for the signing of the SAA, and we underline that BiH's future in the EU is only possible as a united, comprehensive, functional and multi-ethnic state. <p/> Politically and economically, Serbia plays a key role in the region and is currently facing strategic choices about its future. Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are key to Serbia's continued progress towards the EU, and Serbia is well placed to play its role as a regional locomotive in this area. <p/> In line with the conclusions of the December European Council, we reiterated at the Gymnich meeting that it is possible to accelerate Serbia's EU approximation, including the granting of candidate status, but that all this depends above all on the will of the current political leadership and of the future one that will take over the helm of Serbia after the May elections. <p/> We stress that we want to separate the EU perspective from the Kosovo issue, but Serbia must ensure that it does not close its own path to the EU or cut all bridges to the EU by taking actions that may threaten the security of the wider region. Statements and/or actions that threaten the stability of Kosovo are not acceptable. <p/> Once again, we have focused a great deal of attention on Kosovo. We have stressed that Kosovo, like the region as a whole, has a clear EU perspective. The EU will continue to work closely with UN KFOR, OSCE and other international actors to consolidate stability. In this context, I would like to underline my conviction that the full and effective deployment of EULEX and the ICO throughout the territory of Kosovo will be an expression of the success of our commitment to Kosovo's stability and the success of the CFSP as a whole. The maintenance of the UNMIK presence and the full implementation of the mandate under UNSCR 1244 throughout the territory of Kosovo is a key prerequisite for the stabilisation of the situation. In this respect, we consider it of the utmost importance to initiate the EU/EULEX/ICO political dialogue with the Kosovo Serbs. The stability of Kosovo is crucial for the stability of the entire region. <p/> INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE <p/> Intercultural dialogue was the final theme of the Gymnich. The discussion focused on an assessment of the latest developments in Tibet and on the question of attitudes towards Islam, including in the light of the recently released film by Dutch MP Wilders. <p/> Concerning Tibet, we reiterated our concern about the latest developments, condemned the violence and expressed our solidarity with the victims. We called for an end to the violence and expressed our expectation that the Chinese authorities ensure transparency of information and free media access to Tibet. It was stressed that the Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. In this context, we stressed the demand for the preservation of the Tibetan language, culture, religion and traditions. We agreed to pay particular attention to the human rights situation in Tibet. <p/> On the relationship with Islam, the debate was focused on the recent release of a film by Dutch MEP Wilders on Islam. The principle of the right to freedom of expression was stressed, but it was also pointed out that Islam cannot be identified with violence. Most Muslims reject extremism and violence, and the victims of extremism and violence include members of the Islamic faith. Freedom of speech, which is and remains a fundamental value of the EU, must respect the faith and beliefs of others. <p/> Concerns were also expressed, among other things, about the ongoing legal proceedings against the Turkish AK Party and its members. If banned, this would be the first case of a political party winning a democratic election being banned, which would also be contrary to the opinion of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.",Other,test

262,"News <p/> Archive <p/> Data protection with second-generation deduplication technology <p/> Monday 13 August 2012 <p/> Proper data protection is like an insurance policy. Most of the time it is not cashed in, but it is crucial if problems or damage actually occur. The cost of ""insurance"" in data protection is not only the cost of the equipment and its maintenance, but also the negative impact on business processes if, for example, archiving or restoring data takes too long, if data in remote locations of the company is not adequately protected, or if things are simply not regulated according to the law. <p/> As a direct response to these issues, technologies emerged a few years ago that have had a significant impact on improving archiving processes. In addition to the significant cheapening of hard disks, the development of data deduplication technology has been crucial. While the first generation of this technology brought some benefits to users, it was known even then that most of its potential still lay ahead. HP's deduplication development strategy was launched in 2010 and today the second generation of deduplication delivers improvements in areas such as performance, scalability and data management. StoreOne technology, as it is called, is based on a single deduplication algorithm developed in HP labs and runs on all HP hardware and software data protection solutions. In other words, deduplication technology can be implemented on the HP B6000, HP D2D2500 and HP D2D4000 series of products, and is fully supported by HP Data Protector archive software. A quick look at the main competitor, EMC, quickly reveals that its solutions are based on three mutually incompatible platforms (Data Domain, Avamar, Celerra) (Edison Group report, 2011), which is a stark difference to the single, unified architecture offered by HP.<p>Where does the shoe pinch the hardest when it comes to data protection? <p/> There is a general consensus that the following areas are particularly critical in relation to data protection, and that they weigh on users in one way or another: <p/> Time windows available for archiving <p/> The biggest challenge is to archive more and more data in less and less time. HP is responding to this with what it calls a ""scale-out"" architecture, which allows users to buy only the capacity and performance they really need, rather than having to buy both categories in stock. At the moment, HP's scale-up ends with 768 TB of gross capacity and an archiving speed of around 100 TB/hour. <p/> Data recovery after catastrophic events <p/> It is essential that data is stored in locations that allow it to be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event. There are a number of options for data replication over low bandwidth data links, as only deduplicated data travels between sites. StoreOnce technology allows data deduplication to happen wherever it is desired, either directly at the application or source where the data originates, at the archive server, or directly on the device where the data is stored. Deduplication can, of course, happen before the data is transferred from one location to another, so multiple copies of the same data can be archived in multiple locations at the same time. <p/> Protecting data in remote locations <p/> For companies that operate in multiple locations or even in multiple countries and continents, data is widely dispersed and often not sufficiently protected. With StoreOnce technology, data can be accessed or restored from a central location, no matter where it is. <p/> Data recovery capabilities <p/> Investing in archive solutions means nothing if data cannot be recovered in a reasonable time. Most vendors still focus mainly on archiving capacity, but forget about recovery and usually do not even publish this information to avoid embarrassment. HP's solutions are very much at the forefront here, offering speeds of up to 30 TB/hour, the highest among comparable solutions. <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst (API toolset) is a new enhancement to archive solutions and allows deduplicated data to be moved directly from the archive application between StoreOnce systems, without the need to ""rehydrate"" it first, i.e. bring it back to a baseline state. StoreOnce Catalyst also allows replication of data from one location to multiple locations simultaneously and cascading of data between locations in a deduplicated format (leveraging narrow bandwidth connections). StoreOnce Catalyst technology is also integrated into HP Data Protector 7 software, making it particularly suitable for smaller businesses. <p/> Integration into your environment <p/> StoreOnce technology is widely supported (it is supported by a growing number of market-leading archiving software solutions), so you don't need to change archiving software if you don't want to, for example, when you buy a D2D2500 system. But if that's not a barrier, there are a number of good reasons why you should take a closer look at HP Data Protector. HP Data Protector uses the StoreOnce deduplication algorithm, which makes it easy to transfer deduplicated data to any StoreOnce hardware. <p/> 2. Data Protector supports contextual search of archived data, which means that data with specific content can be recovered, not just data with a specific naming convention (filename). This is made possible by the integrated ""Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL)"" from Autonomy, which has been under HP's umbrella for some time. <p/> What about archiving to tape? <p/> For long-term data archiving, tape drives continue to be offered in a wide variety of configurations, as there is still a significant demand for them in the market. The fact is that long-term archiving to tape is still by far the cheapest option.",Promotion,test

274,"First documentary by Natalia Gros <p/> New Partisan Cinema in cooperation with Film Servis presents a new documentary on sport climbing, directed by Jureto Breceljnik, entitled Chalk & Chocolate. The film tells the story of Natalia Gros, one of the best climbers in the world, who takes on one of the most difficult routes in the country: Histerija (8c) in Mišja Peča. About a year ago, she became the fourth woman in the world to climb this difficult route. The camera follows Natalia's story both during the conquest of Histeria and during the competition season (training, competitions, injuries, testing). The filming started in December 2007, when Natalia first set out on the route, and the crew was with her from day one until the day she climbed the route. It shows both the tears and the joy, with the background of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Natalija started her climbing career at the age of 7 and has been one of the world's top climbers for many years. In 2007, she achieved the European title of her career, and became the most successful female sport climber of the season. Now that she has made her first film, she is thinking of swapping the climbing world for Hollywood when her career is over! <p/> The film has already been previewed at the 3rd International Mountaineering Film Festival 2009 at Cankarjev dom, where it received great applause and two awards. The jury awarded the film the Best Climbing Film prize for its concise and effective portrayal of the work, highs and lows of top climber Natalia Gros, and the Audience Award for Natalia's honest confession and perseverance. <p/> The documentary is also a success online. A clip from the Hysteria climbing film was uploaded to www.videoclimb.com, where it was voted the second best climbing clip of 2008 in the world. The trailer has been viewed by 120,000 users on www.vimeo.com/jure to date. <p/> Chalk & Chocolate has also conquered the screens of the city's Kinodvor cinema twice, on 10 May and 25 May.

276,"Memories <p/> Memories <p/> After the war we lived on food, textile and other necessities. But just because you had a card didn't mean that you could get the goods you needed. Our mothers were queuing outside the shops long before they opened. Hardly expected and essential goods for families were not always in perfect condition. The flour was often (as we used to say) ""alive"". <p/> This meant that moths had invaded it. We did not throw away such flour either. My mother would fry the flour in a large pan on a hot fire to kill the animals, then sieve it on a thick sieve and that was how we used it later. <p/> I also remember what underwear was like in those years. There was no elastic in the underpants, just a plain ribbon, and we had to tie our underpants with it. When the underwear got proud and tore, it would be patched up. It was also often the case that double underpants became single underpants. Men's shirts were also mended. The bottom part was cut off and the collar and cuffs were redone. <p/> Socks that could no longer be mended were also cut above the ankle and a part of the other socks was added. So, once again, a new pair was made from the double worn-out socks. <p/> The dresses were not ready-made, but were made for us by seamstresses who may or may not have been trained in this profession. The dresses were sewn for the children in such a way that the length could be extended by at least 10 cm. We children grew quickly and a dress sewn in this way could grow with us for some time. When we outgrew the length of the dress, a new piece of fabric was inserted into the sleeves, usually in a different material and pattern to the original dress. <p/> Coats were made in the same way. When we outgrew them, despite the lengthening, they would fray and the cloth would turn the other way and be sewn into a new coat for the next child... <p/> Without spots and without cards, we could buy tennis shoes on Partizanska Street near Borovo. These were summer shoes that were made of rubber underneath and canvas on top. They were usually grey in colour. We children brightened them up by painting them with white chalk. I don't know how we got the paint to stay on, we must have got the chalk wet. <p/> In the summer we also wore special summer slippers, which were made of cornhusks. We could get them for free (no tickets). The slippers were so sharp that we often had bloody toes. <p/> In the summer we also wore ""spaghetti shoes"", which were made by a shoemaker. They were made of felt (strong felt), grey in colour. The felt was connected to the sole by a shoelace. The children also wore such shoes for special occasions - for example, for confirmation. <p/> The shoemakers put metal rings on the toes and heels so that we could wear the shoes.",Information/Explanation,test

293,"I am the mother of 21-month-old Rene, a very lively and persistent boy who loves to play football whenever and wherever possible. He is very playful, sociable, smiley, puts even the most serious and sad people in a good mood and captivates everyone who sees the sparkle in his eyes. Rene was born with a congenital deformity of the right leg called fibular hemimelia - a lack of the fibula bone that holds the foot and knee in the correct position. I found out about the deformity when I was pregnant, as I was regularly monitored in Ljubljana due to the loss of two children in previous pregnancies. Given the bad experiences I had had before, I was prepared for the worst-case scenarios, which fortunately did not materialise and Rene is otherwise perfectly healthy and without any other problems. At the moment we are solving the height difference with the help of adapted shoes and orthosis, which are regularly custom-made at the URI Soča in LJ, but this has become increasingly difficult since sometime in the new year, as the leg has become quite bent in the foot and knee due to the increased load. The doctor expects that walking with such a leg will soon be impossible and that Rene will end up in a wheelchair, and advises early surgical treatment. At the Orthopaedic Clinic in Ljubljana, where we have been treated since birth, they suggested amputation of the leg as the only possible solution. I got myself active online and on FB and got in touch with Dr Dror Paley, a doctor from the USA who has his own clinic in Florida. He has been dealing with fibular haemimelia for 30 years and has successfully operated on more than 200 such children. We visited him at the beginning of April and he promised us a full recovery. It takes 3 operations, which are recommended to be done at the age of 2 years, which together with rehabilitation and surgery to remove the fixator cost 180.000. There is a possibility of an operation in Milan and a follow-up in Florida, which would bring the total amount down a little. The date he proposed us is 20.6.2014. As Dr. Paley is only in Italy 1 x a year, we decided to try in every possible way to raise the necessary funds and catch the opportunity. I immediately submitted an application to the Health Insurance Fund, but the process is quite lengthy and, according to the experience of parents with similar problems, most of the time only partially approved, if at all. Therefore, I would like to ask everyone who has been touched by our story and would like to help Rene to continue to walk and play football, to donate any amount to his TRR SI 56 2900 0003 2052 246 at UniCredit Banka Slovenija d.d., Rene Muhamed Talić, Martinuči 2, 5292 Renče.

317,"Since we were extremely lucky to have Boštjan Romih visit us at the faculty and give us a very entertaining lecture on oratory and public speaking, here are some pointers that I found most useful and interesting. <p/> As we know, eye contact is the cornerstone of contact and there are two principles to be observed in relation to it: uniformity and randomness. It is therefore necessary to be careful to look at each listener for approximately the same amount of time. At the same time, we need to avoid patterns that could be picked up by the listeners. <p/> When speaking, we should also not apologise in advance (e.g. I apologise in advance for not having had time to prepare well for the talk. ). It is very likely that listeners/viewers will then only be more aware of our mistakes. When public speaking, we also avoid smiling to show fear and discomfort (no smile is preferable to being forced). <p/> When speaking in public, we often don't know where to put our hands. It is best to position them at belly button height (more chance of actually using them than if they are hanging by the body). Markers, power point remotes, sheets of paper (but they should be smaller - e.g. A5, and the notes should be legible and in a large enough font) can help as a fixation point. But then we have to make sure that we gesticulate with the hand that is free, and that we are not holding these tools. <p/> If you want to practise speaking with distinctness, try speaking with a pencil between your teeth.",Instruction,test

Insulin has a short half-life, so as glucose falls, its concentration in the blood falls rapidly. <p/> Which cells does insulin act on? <p/> Insulin acts on virtually all cells in the body, as insulin receptors are present on all of them.

332,"How is sex marketed? <p/> Adjectives that traditionally market sex well are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and especially tantric <p/> In the early 1990s, massage parlours sprouted up all over our young homeland, where ""professionally trained"" masseuses kneaded the bodies of men, most of them bed-ridden and stressed, eager for invigorating exotic massages: Thai, Chinese and Malay, ordinary and specialised, hand and foot. Was it really in the perfumed, dimly lit rooms that the oldest craft was practiced? The lion's share of the clientele would answer this question with a hand on the Bible, in the words of former US President Bill Clinton: ""We did not have sex with those women. ""The hired girls did, in fact, massage the clients to the best of their unprofessional abilities, and if a part of the client became unexpectedly stiff, they would simply do what was in the job description manually to relieve the client's tension. And that was it. Massage parlours did not, in principle, engage in conventional sexual intercourse, but that does not mean, of course, that what the lay public understands by the technical terms of blow jobs, hand jobs, spankings and whisperings did not take place there. In short, the owners of Slovenian massage parlours behaved in accordance with the political correctness of Western Christian civilisation, which tolerates many things, but not calling it fucking. Or it tolerates the presence of sex in its midst only if you put it in an artistic, installation, authorial, artisanal, institutional, aesthetic, cosmetic or spiritual context. Sex as such is not desirable. Hence the circus around pornography, prostitution and similar phenomena, which are not really about anything in terms of substance. <p/>The adjectives that traditionally market sex well, together with its side-effects, consequences and problems, are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and, in particular, tantric. Tantric sex is a hit. It has infiltrated the terminology of the psychiatric profession, it has taken over the tabloid media, it has possessed dissatisfied housewives who dream of nirvanic continuity and dissatisfied gentlemen who muse at the thought of eight-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour erections, even though they have no idea what they could achieve with their stream limbs in that time. One thinks of His Holiness Guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh, whose revolutionary approach to tantric themes forced him to leave his spiritualised mother India in 1981 and settle in Oregon, USA, with a vast fleet of custom-built Rolls Royces. His Holiness set up a Tantric commune in the middle of Oregon, which traded heavily in enlightenment, and became famous for not granting quantity discounts to even the most wholesale buyers. When names from the music and film show business lined up, many paid obscene sums just to stand in line. And it was only a matter of time before the epicentre of practical Tantric philosophy would move to sunny California, where believer-friendly religions were springing up on a daily basis, and then, like all American fads, it would come pounding down on the old continent and, by extension, Slovenia.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
345,"Description <p/> How do Dawn Journey lollipops work? <p/> Dawn Journey lollipops contain ginger and peppermint extracts. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) helps to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with using a means of transport, while peppermint (Mentha piperita) contributes to the normal functioning of the digestive tract. For best effect, we recommend taking the lollipop half an hour before travelling. <p/> What is travel sickness? <p/> Seasickness, or travel sickness, develops as a result of conflicting information being sent from the senses to the brain. The senses are adapted to collecting information from an environment that is more or less stationary. When this suddenly starts to move when travelling in a boat or driving a car, the information reaching the brain via the optic nerve does not match the information transmitted by the balance organ in the inner ear. <p/> Travel sickness is much more common than it may seem at first sight. It is more common in children, but becomes less common with age. <p/> Tips for travel sickness in a child <p/> In the morning before travelling, your child should eat a light, warm meal. This prevents irritation of the stomach lining and contraction of the stomach walls due to hunger. <p/> Make sure the car is well ventilated before travelling, as bad air and heat aggravate travel sickness. <p/> If the journey is short, do not give the child food or drink during the journey. If he/she is very thirsty, he/she should drink plain water. Do not overdo the food. <p/> Place the child in the central part of the boat, bus or plane, on the centre line, facing the direction of travel. <p/> Do not give the child books or games, do not let him/her watch cartoons or films on DVD. When sailing on a boat, work and general lingering below deck is discouraged. <p/> Try to distract the child as much as possible during the journey. Try to actively engage the child in conversation or play word games with the child that require close observation of the environment as the vehicle passes by. You can also play a fairy tale on CD to distract the child. <p/> Try to remain as calm as possible. Children often feel nauseous precisely because they sense their parents' fear of nausea. <p/> HOW TO USE: <p/> 1-3 lollipops a day. The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. The food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. A varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle are important. <p/> WARNINGS: <p/> Lollipops are suitable for children over 4 years of age. All ingredients in the lollipops are suitable for younger children, but younger children should lick the lollipop under parental supervision. <p/>STORAGE: <p/> Keep out of reach of children!

But he said it was difficult to expect them to decide on ""any radical measures"". <p/> It is very bad for Slovenia that we have two people at the top of Slovenian politics who ignore the practice we want to introduce in the country, i.e. that politicians have transparent finances, that they are able to explain where their income comes from, and if they are not able to do so, that they leave their posts, Lukšič said in response to the findings of the anti-corruption commission. <p/> He hopes that ""this is the drop over the edge that will finally mean the introduction of a new practice in Slovenian politics"". Asked specifically whether Janša and Janković should resign, he said that the right thing to do would be ""to think the matter through and then do what the majority expects"". <p/> However, he does not want to talk about the options that would follow a possible resignation - whether he himself would opt for a technical government or for early elections. First, he says, they both have to make the right move, and only then will there be time to think about the way forward. <p/> He adds that ""there is no point in getting ahead of ourselves, because unfortunately experience shows that in such situations, people in Slovenia have so far, as a rule, not decided to do what they should have done"". <p/> What is important for Slovenia, he says, is to get a government that is credible. Lukšič points out that the government has 18% support and that this is a key problem. He also problematises the fact that a government with 18% support is going to sell Slovenian assets. ""We simply know that this will not be done credibly, it cannot be,"" he concludes. <p/> "" If these deals are run by people who cannot explain how 200 000 came into their account, how will they be able to explain where these huge billions will go. 12 billion are at stake,"" the SD leader added. <p/> The Anti-Corruption Commission found that SDS President Janez Janša and Positivna Slovenije President Zoran Janković had violated anti-corruption legislation when auditing the assets of party presidents. According to the Commission, Janković failed to declare assets worth at least €2.4 million, and part of the financial inflows into his personal bank account came from a chain of transactions that started in Grep.

The equipment is more modern, more powerful and more compatible with other devices, so that bronchoscopies can be performed at the highest professional level. Bronchoscopy (an invasive method for examining and removing tissue from the lower respiratory tract and lungs) is one of the most important tests used in the diagnosis of various diseases (lung cancer, sarcoidosis, other diseases of the lung tissue, etc.). The Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies performs around 700 such tests a year. The equipment needed for these tests wears out over the years and also becomes obsolete, which is why Bankart's donation is extremely important. The state-of-the-art equipment will also allow them to carry out pleuroscopies - an examination of the ribs. <p/> The representative of Bankart, d.o.o., Mrs Maja Usnik, Director of the Financial and Accounting General Sector, expressed her satisfaction at the handover of the donation that the equipment will make a significant contribution to the quality of bronchoscopy. She concluded by expressing her wish to continue to meet in this way in the future. <p/> The donation was first acknowledged by the professional director, Prof. Dr. Saša Markovič, MD, PhD, Senior Counsellor, who congratulated the staff on obtaining the title of Clinical Department or Tertiary Status of the Department. <p/> The employees of the Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies are proud of the new title of their unit, which was awarded to them by the Ministry of Health at the end of 2008. When the Golnik Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies moved from UKC Ljubljana ten years ago, the Centre for the Treatment of Patients with Pulmonary Diseases was established in UKC Ljubljana, initially primarily to meet the needs of UKC Ljubljana. Initially, only three doctors were employed to provide a consultancy service for UKC Ljubljana, treating patients in 15 beds. With a great deal of enthusiasm and self-denial, together with the nursing and non-medical staff, they have achieved significant development over 10 years. In addition to hospital activities, they have started a specialist outpatient clinic, which sees 8,000 patients a year. Invasive diagnosis of lung diseases has been redefined. Research activities have been developed. They have published a large number of articles in the foreign and national literature. They lecture at national and international professional meetings. They have made a significant contribution to the educational activities of the Faculty of Medicine. The most important areas of their work are: diagnosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with diseases of the ribs, patients with sarcoidosis and patients with pulmonary hypertension. Last but not least, they are the main Slovenian centre for the management of patients before and after lung transplantation. Of course, they also treat patients with all other lung diseases from the Ljubljana region, of which there are not a few. <p/> At the closing ceremony, Erna Kos Grabnar, Chief Nurse of UKC Ljubljana, emphasised that the staff would certainly not have been so successful if they had not worked so well together, as they are considered a friendly and highly qualified team, where the cooperation between doctors, nursing staff and others is at an enviable level.",Other,test

""<p/> Does this decision of yours entail any additional costs? <p/> "" No. "" <p/> Have you checked? <p/> "" This discussion is at least as old as the country ..."" <p/> ... your predecessor also thought about this, but had to change his mind. <p/> "" It was always thought that a guard of honour would be permanently stationed outside the palace. It would be there every day between 8 am and 6 pm. That would certainly not be financially neutral, as will the fact that it would - at least for the time being - only apply on public holidays. We shall see how our people react to this. ""How do you think they will react? <p/> "" I think very well. Because it is not about cost, but it is also an expression of sovereignty. Paradoxically. This decision comes at a time when there may be a suspension of that sovereignty with foreign help, although my thesis is that there will not be a suspension, that we will solve the problems ourselves, albeit through the eye of the beast. "" <p/>What do you mean? Since you are in Maribor, let me ask you this: is the troika already at Šentil? <p/> "" No. It is still in Brussels. The European Commission will issue a report on 29 May, which will go to the European Council for a decision at the end of June. The government has sent a strong signal that it is committed to consolidating public finances and to measures to stimulate economic growth, with some measures such as higher VAT and the successful negotiation of public sector wage cuts. But if I may take the liberty of assessing these measures, without prejudice to the competences of the government... I am missing two things. One is a much more active role for the state in the creation of the bad bank, where there is a series of activities in the transfer of bad debts. This would have let the European Commission know that we are serious about the rehabilitation of the banking system, which is a major stumbling block in our economic and financial regeneration. Secondly, and I may be wrong because I am not informed, I think that politics these days is significantly under-preparing for the end of the month, when Parliament will decide on the new referendum regime and the golden fiscal rule. The European Commission and the European Council are watching very closely what is happening here, particularly with the referendum legislation. You will recall that already on 14 February, at a meeting with the party presidents, which I hosted and chaired, it was agreed that the issue of the referendum regime would go through, but then one of the opposition parties (SDS, op. cit.) said that the fiscal rule had to be decided on before that. There is really no need to argue here about whether this party has that right or not. Without it, there is no two-thirds majority. However, the golden rule for two-thirds decisions is that the opposition sets the rules. That has always been the case. What is more, I believe that the year 2015 could have been written into the Constitution when the fiscal rule was introduced."" <p/> It is not possible. The coalition, especially the ruling party, is firmly in favour of 2017. That is when the rule should be implemented, that there is no way to a balanced budget before then. <p/> "" The Fiscal Compact allows for a transition period, which in our case would be made possible by an implementing law. No one expects the government to have to resign if it does not achieve a deficit of 3% in 2015. Anyone would understand that this cannot be achieved if the macroeconomic circumstances are actually deviating, if, for example, even a third major recession were to break out. Other countries are also familiar with such deviations. Therefore, I find this quibble about the year to be superfluous. I would have preferred to see a focus on the conditions of the transition period. I well understand the government and the Prime Minister that it would be inappropriate for the government to decide, at the price of rapid deficit reduction, to intervene brutally in the social fabric of the population, thereby also hurting the prospects for economic recovery in the long term. I have spoken about this during my visits to Berlin and Paris, and they understand our dilemma. ""Is it true that you went to Berlin and Paris convinced that the changes to the referendum system to reduce the possibility of referendums when it comes to reform issues would be faster and that the fiscal rule would come into force in 2015? That you promised that to Paris and Berlin, and then there was no meeting on 6 May on these two topics? You did not know? And another thing: during the campaign, Mr President, you were all betting on the involvement of politics. Only together we can do it, you said. Now, however, your cooperation with the Alenka Bratušek Government has not exactly got off to a good start. <p/> ""The cooperation between the government and the President's Office is still exemplary ..."" <p/> ... still exemplary? <p/> "" It is exemplary. But the fact is that after 14 February, when I personally took responsibility for ensuring that the parties were united on three issues - ratification of the accession treaty, labour market reform and referendums - all the parties were no longer in favour of me as President taking a similar role on constitutional change, but felt that it would be better if this process remained within parliamentary life. This means that I can encourage party dialogue, but I cannot lead it and bring it to an end. I went to Paris and Berlin after talking to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. I was confident that on 6 and 7 May Parliament would approve the decision on referendums and the fiscal rule. I have told you frankly that I am concerned that this decision, which may also be complicated, has been postponed until the end of the month. I also believe that the parties should already be talking intensively about this now, but I am not informed that they are. If the parties consider that I can help, I am prepared to do so. But I can see their adherence to the February agreement on changes to the referendum arrangements slowly melting away. It would be irresponsible of me to ignore that, and I think that people voted for me also because I have the experience of being Prime Minister. We can get out of the crisis, but we also need to agree on the fiscal rule and referendums."" <p/> Excuse me, the people also voted for you because you made a firm promise to bring the warring political forces together. Now you are telling us that the parties will not even allow that? That was your key election promise. <p/> "" You must admit to me that I have fulfilled it sooner than I thought. February. More as a joke than for real, we calculated that it took me 25 and a half hours just to coordinate with the parties to reach an agreement. ""Already, already, but the result you want is not there. At least not yet. <p/> ""Back in February, one of the party presidents (Igor Lukšič, op. a.) said that the February meeting was legitimate, but that he was not in favour of the President of the Republic interfering in party life. Until this position changes, I have no mandate to impose myself on the consensus of the political parties. I cannot impose myself, and the Prime Minister knows exactly that I always tell her that I am also here to help her if she thinks that my help is needed. You should know that I put the joker on the table in Paris and Berlin. I said that I would pledge my word that this government would succeed in meeting the expectations of the financial markets and the financial institutions. That no aid would be needed. Do not think that such visits can happen every month, because they cannot. And do not think that you can say that if the facts put you in a different light. If the parties have a clear interest in enforcing the fiscal rule and changes to the referendum regime, they need to start talking about it now. I take the opportunity of this interview to call on the parties themselves, or with my help if they think they need it, to find a solution to get the fiscal rule into the constitution and changes to the referendum regime. "" <p/> "" No, because it does not affect my work and the commitment with which I do it. But I think that the Office has calculated that my salary will be reduced by 263 euros as a result of the agreement with the public sector unions. ""It will not stop there. You will also pay higher taxes. <p/> "" Yes, and that is right. "" <p/> How do you feel when you read in Večer, when your salary is going to be lower and your taxes are going to be higher, that Zoran Janković has obtained a loan of EUR 250 000 from a bank that is not a state bank to cover a EUR 300 000 overdraft, which is something that someone without a real surname cannot obtain? How, Mr President? After five years of crisis and debate, what is there to give up, even for anomalies that, at the end of the day, we all pay for. <I will not comment on this particular case, and you will understand very well why. I will, however, remind you that I was not among the last to say that the value focus of this crisis is a sense of injustice. The only good thing about the crisis is that it has ended a dangerous process of transition that would have wrecked our society to the core, because the trend towards rampant privatisation and looting would have continued. It is also true that the nation's defence mechanism has been awakened. The people are even braver to act than the politicians at the moment. They have come to the common-sense realisation that this crisis is going to take us down, so politics now has more room for decisive action than it is taking. ""But the government has gone ahead with the announcement that it will sell 15 state-owned companies, including the bank. NKBM. Thanks to the SD, the hysteria called national interest may happen again. <p/> "" Please do not let there be anyone among your readers who would like the Troika to sort things out in the country. These are very crude decisions, purely in the direction of austerity and nothing in the direction of promoting growth. We will not be asked anything about privatisation either, about any interest. We are in Maribor. You mentioned NKBM. I have to say this to be credible. When my government's term of office was coming to an end, contrary to my opinion, AUKN misjudged things. It ordered state-owned companies, in the name of the national interest, to recapitalise NKBM at a share price that no sale today will achieve. We have lost a lot of money by doing so, and today we will sell NKBM at a much lower price than it was possible to recapitalise it with private capital at the time. And do not forget the small shareholders who believed in the bank and bought shares. There will be a lot of discussion about this in Maribor."" <p/> Also lawsuits, probably. <p/> "" Particularly in the case of NKBM, it is important to listen to small shareholders when selling. "" <p/> So you are in favour of selling state shares? <p/> "" Yes, absolutely. "" <p/> We recently heard in the German-Slovenian Chamber of Commerce that a German investor was ready to build a factory and create 200 new jobs in the north-eastern part of Slovenia, which is being battered by the crisis. Do you know why not? Because the municipality was not prepared to negotiate seriously on the price of the land. In the end, the investor walked away. To Slovakia. Is this the Slovenian way of creating jobs and attracting foreign investors? <p/> ""In Paris, French businessmen told me that Slovenia is an absolutely attractive country for a number of reasons - geopolitical, transport, value, security. But it has such a complex bureaucratic structure that it takes courage in the middle of the road. Then they go to Slovakia, where everything is simpler. But I am not in favour of going to the other extreme, of giving up all the regulations that protect the environment and the Slovenian worker, for example, but there are a whole series of completely unrelated regulations that are being abolished by all governments, but at the same time they are being redone. Simplifying the legal system is one of the essential tasks of the current government. We need to realise that we have made the country too expensive and too complicated. At a meeting with the mayors in Oplotnica, the mayors told me that investors end up coming to them too, and they cannot even explain what an investor has to do in order to be able to do business and employment in their municipality. "" <p/>You also said in that meeting with mayors that municipalities are an important pillar of stability in the country. Really? All 211 municipalities? <p/> "" The cost of discussing which municipality should be abolished will be much greater than the savings. It will be a political cost, it will be a material cost, and you will upset people. And you know that I have been a supporter of fewer municipalities all these years ..."" <p/> ... because that is exactly why. <p/> "" But today I have to estimate that if the question of reducing the number of municipalities were to be raised, we would also raise the question of which municipality to abolish, how many municipalities to abolish. We would be fighting people, we would be fighting parties, and the savings would not outweigh it. "" <p/>To draw the line slowly. We have had a crisis for five years, and you have been Prime Minister for three years in that time. Your most fatal wrong decision, which we are all paying for today, was? <p/> "" You were there when I said that. When neither you nor your colleagues expected such a sincere confession. That I realised too late what a fatal problem the banks are. I admitted it, I think, in January 2012."" <p/> No. I remember that. It was just before the presidential election. After you fell off the horse. <p/> "" Exactly. After the holidays, in September. I did not pay enough attention to the bailout of the banking system because of the preoccupation with Croatia. Even then, Minister Lahovnik proposed a bad bank, and I agreed with him, but both on condition that the bad bank would be made by NLB itself, not imposed by the state. Whereas, for example, Minister Gaspari advised against the creation of a bad bank at the behest of the state. At that time, we had about three per cent toxic claims in the banks, now it is about one fifth. I told the Prime Minister frankly that I knew she had reservations about the bad bank, that when the PS was still in opposition she was considering a referendum on the bad bank, but that now the bad bank had to be set up. Do we have a better solution than the recapitalisations that have already been tried and have failed? Beware, this is fatally linked to corporate over-indebtedness. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Bank of Slovenia also let off all the brakes on lending. No one considered whether these companies would be able to repay these loans. In 2009, however, we ran aground on over-indebted companies, which were further hollowed out by the crisis for their development."" <p/> "" You are now taking advantage of my poor character to make sure that I do not miss an opportunity to be quiet. I would not be surprised if the Commission said that it was giving Slovenia extra time to implement the things that it had announced but had not yet implemented. That would be a relatively favourable outcome. "" <p/> Do you expect a lower score? Alarm? <p/> "" It could be worse if the decisions on the referendum regime and the fiscal rule do not go through. A relatively favourable outcome on 29 May would reassure financial markets and the other two rating houses (S&P and Fitch) would not follow Moody's. But we have to be honest. But if the Commission had proposed to the European Council fines for Slovenia, which would have cost €35 million or a percentage of GDP, and a programme to correct macroeconomic imbalances, perhaps another rating house would have been moved. This would mean that Slovenia would virtually no longer have access to international financial markets. """,Other,test

416,"SLOVNI: Kylie, happy birthday! <p/> 28 May 2014 <p/> We are launching a special section on the Bansi website, featuring both local and foreign celebrities (actors, singers, directors, athletes and others). The feature will be launched by Australian singer, Kylie Minogue, who celebrates her birthday today. <p/> Kylie Minogue was born on 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia. She rose to fame as an actress with her appearance in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. In 1987, she began her active music career in earnest, with her first released song ""Locomotion"" becoming a huge hit. Other tracks on her first album Kylie also became big worldwide hits (you can listen to the album here). <p/> She went on to sign a deal with a group of hugely successful producers, launching her to stardom and worldwide fame. <p/> Locomotion has been sung and danced all over the world. After a career spanning more than 25 years, Kylie is still often singing in concert. In a special classical (orchestral or acoustic) guise, she included it along with 15 others on the album "" The Abbey Road Sessions "". It is an album of her greatest hits, released in 2013, the 25th anniversary of her career. <p/> Kylie is a versatile artist, singer, actress, music video director, songwriter and has had around 6 perfumes released under her name. She is also a huge fashion enthusiast. This photo shows the launch of the book Kylie Fashion, which collects some of her outfits and costumes throughout her 25-year career. The book was published in October 2012. Did you know that Kylie was thinking about becoming a fashion designer when she was in her teens? In an interview, she said that her grandmother taught her how to sew and that fashion means a lot to her. When she started performing, singing and acting on stage completely took over and she was able to successfully integrate her love of fashion into her life. <p/> Kylie was and still is hugely popular throughout her native Australia, Asia, America and of course Europe. She has lived in London since the beginning of her music career, where she is ""literally crazy"", she is extremely popular in France, Spain and is often invited to perform on Italian television. She has already had eleven huge world tours and has performed practically everywhere in the world (Japan, China, Mexico, all over Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.). She has not yet visited Slovenia, although she has many fans here too. What is very interesting about Kylie is that she has never been too shaken by her worldwide fame, e.g. she has lost touch with reality, used illegal substances, been known for some strange affairs, etc. She is always very straightforward in interviews and does not give the impression of being unapproachable or shabby. She is also known for being called "" Cute Kylie "" by her friends, the presenters of the radio shows she regularly appears on, journalists and members of her team. <p/> She also has the characteristic that she "" keeps on recording "". No sooner has she released her "" official studio "" album than she has already released the accompanying singles, which are not included on the album, but her fans quickly find them and these songs also become big hits. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, which she celebrated throughout 2013, she played a total of five concerts in her native Australia (in Melbourne and Sydney) and in the UK (two in London and one in Mancherst), singing her best-known songs for her biggest fans, as well as those that have never been officially released on albums or as singles. The concerts were presented under the title Anti Tour and sold out immediately. <p/>A song that was a huge hit with her fans, yet was never released - Cherry Bomb i from the Anti Tour. <p/> In 2005, in the middle of her big (eighth in a row) Showgirl tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which devastated her immensely. Kylie underwent surgery and chemotherapy in Paris at her request. She recovered successfully from the disease and spoke about it very often in interviews, sometimes even crying during them. She returned to the stage with a major concert on 11 November 2006 in her native Australia (Sydney). <p/> Just in those days (26 May 2014), Kylie released a special single called "" Crystallize "", the proceeds of which go to the French cancer foundation Aprec. Kylie is also very often charitable, especially after her illness. <p/> The first single, "" Into the blue "", is from her latest twelfth studio album. <p/> Kylie's first album also features a duet with Jason Donovan. The song "" Especially for you "", which was a huge hit and is still considered one of the most romantic songs today. In this video, Kylie jokes around a bit and sings the song with Kermit the Frog from the Muppet Show. <p/> Kylie was one of the judges on the third series of The Voice (in 2013), a BBC TV show broadcast in London. It's a show that searches for new musical talent. Before that, she had performed in many countries (her native Australia, Italy, America, France, other British shows and more) in just such shows as ""Talent Search"". In this video from 2007, she is seen singing the song ""I believe in you"" with one of the (future) musical talents on the Star Academy show on French TV. Even today, Kylie does not ignore these invitations to appear on talent search shows and appears regularly. <p/> Her extremely extensive Aphrodite World Tour was the singer's eleventh concert tour, organised in promotion of her eleventh album, Aphrodite (2010). The tour took Kylie to Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and North America. This tour was technically of an extremely high standard, with the entire set of songs acting as a sing-dance-theatre show lasting around two hours. Kylie and her extensive team had around 80 concerts scheduled for the tour. The focus of the tour was Kylie as Aphrodite (goddess of love and beauty). The tour lasted from 19 February 2011 to 14 July 2011, almost day after day, with very few days off in between. A recording of the entire concert is also available online. <p/> Another performance from 2008 in one of the shows looking for new musical talent (Star Academy on French TV). Together with Mathieu, they sang one of her biggest hits "" Love At First Sight "". <p/> Anyone who hears Kyie's name is likely to immediately think of the song Kyie jokingly refers to as "" La, la, la "", the first single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" from her eighth studio album Fever. The song was a hit worldwide and reached number one in more than 40 countries, including the UK, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and many other European countries. It has sold more than 4 million copies. Here we see a presentation of this song from the Brits Awards 2002, where Kylie won the award in the category "" International Female "" (Best Female Artist) in 2002. <p/> Another memorable performance with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". The performance received a lot of positive reviews, but it is from the 2011 MTV EMAs (MTV Europe Music Awards). <p/> Appearance on the X Factor in 2010, which is also one of the UK's shows looking for young musical talent. Kylie Minogue's sister, Danii Minogue, was one of the judges on the show. Kylie also made a music video for the song "" Better Than Today "", which she directed herself. <p/> Kylie and Danii Kylie sisters with the song Kids (originally sung by Kylie with Robbie Williams). The clip is from the Showgirl homecoming tour, a concert held in her hometown of Melbourne on 11 December 2006. It was one of Kylie Minogue's first major full-length performances after her treatment and diagnosis. <p/> Either way, Kylie is extremely active and successful. In an interview, she said that diligence is her most recognisable virtue and that she finds inspiration in every single thing. Today she celebrates her 46th birthday.

439,"The Bologna Renewal <p/> The central objective of the Bologna Declaration (BD) is the creation of an open Common Higher Education Area (CEEA), allowing European students and higher education staff to move freely within it, to have comparable skills and competences, and to be employable. <p/> The Bologna Process takes its name from the Bologna Declaration, signed in Bologna (Italy) in 1999 by ministers responsible for higher education from 29 European countries, including Slovenia. The document set the guidelines for the development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process (BP) is to be implemented in the signatory countries (and other countries later associated) by 2010. <p/> The objective is to be achieved through various measures such as the establishment of comparable and transparent higher education structures and levels, mutual recognition of relevant and comparable higher education qualifications, the establishment of mutually recognised credit and quality assurance systems, the promotion of student and teacher mobility, the development of the European dimension in education and the increased competitiveness of European higher education in the world. <p/> The BP Guidelines also link to one of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, which foresees that by 2010 Europe will be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. <p/> The path to the BE is also represented by previous documents, reflecting in particular the aspirations for university autonomy, comparable qualifications and their recognition within the ERA, and their standardisation. <p/> Despite the scope opened up by the BD, it is not a comprehensive document specifying implementation and serving as a ""how-to guide"", but leaves a large degree of autonomy to HEIs and partners. Nevertheless, the CBD highlights some key points: <p/> the central role of universities in the development of the European cultural dimensions <p/> the independence and autonomy of universities <p/> the ERA as the main route to mobility and employability of EU citizens and the overall development of the continent <p/> the adaptation of higher education systems to constant social change and the evolution of scientific knowledge <p/> the international competitiveness of European higher education. <p/> The main objectives of the BD Declaration are: <p/> the adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees, including the ""Diploma Supplement"" form - in order to foster the recruitment of European citizens and the international competitiveness of the European higher education system <p/> the adoption of a system with two main levels of study, the Bachelor (minimum 3 years) and the Postgraduate (Master, PhD) degrees awarded after the first level, is also relevant for the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification <p/> establishing the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) as an appropriate means of facilitating greater student mobility Credits could also be obtained through lifelong learning <p/> promoting mobility <p/> promoting European cooperation in quality assurance, by developing comparable criteria and methodologies <p/> fostering the necessary European dimension in higher education, in particular in relation to curriculum development, inter-institutional cooperation, mobility schemes and integrated study, training and research programmes. <p/> Ministers of the signatory countries meet every 2 years to assess the state of implementation of the BP in the individual Member States and in the ERA as a whole. Each ministerial meeting is followed by a communiqué with proposals for further development. The number of associated countries has increased significantly since 1999, to 45. <p/> What does the reform of higher education bring you? <p/> At the end of May this year, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted an amendment to the Law on Higher Education, and in mid-June the Law on Recognition and Valuation of Education was adopted. These two laws constitute the basis for the implementation of the higher education reform, which is based on the guidelines of the Bologna Process, or the process of creating a single European Higher Education Area. The reform will be introduced gradually by higher education institutions (faculties, academies, etc.), and the following innovations will be the most visible for students: <p/> 1.

Bachelor's degree, which lasts three or four years and is run as a higher professional degree or university degree * Bachelor's degree, or Master's degree, which lasts one or two years (so that together with the first bachelor's degree in the same field of expertise, it lasts five years) * Bachelor's degree, or Doctoral degree, which lasts three years. <p/> Exceptions are study programmes for professions regulated by European Union directives, which may be structured differently. <p/> b) Conditions for admission to the higher degree <p/> To be admitted to the second cycle, you must have completed a first cycle degree in a relevant professional field. If it is not in the same field of study (e.g. if a student wishes to continue his/her studies in economics at a second level after completing a first degree in mechanical engineering), a maximum of 60 credits of additional study may be prescribed for this transition. These can be taken as part of the electives in the first bachelor's degree, or through examinations and courses prior to enrolment in the second bachelor's degree. <p/> Admission to the third cycle is open to anyone who has completed the second cycle, who has completed programmes in professions governed by EU directives which are worth 300 credits or more, or who has completed a four-year programme at level 1 and who has demonstrated specific achievements which can be assessed at 60 credits. <p/> As a general rule, 60 credits will be awarded for admission to the new two-year programmes at the second cycle to those who have completed the old bachelor's degree programmes in the same or related fields of study. <p/> The completion of a specialisation may be used for admission to the third cycle only if there has been a notable success in research or professional work, which may be assessed at 60 credits, or if additional study requirements of 60 credits have been set. <p/> Those who have completed a master's degree under the old system shall be awarded 60 credits of study requirements on entry to the third cycle (doctoral studies). <p/> c) Deadline for the introduction of the new structure and transition period <p/> The first academic year in which enrolment in the new degree programmes should be possible will be 2005/2006, and the last academic year for the introduction of the new study structure will be 2009/2010. <p/> Students enrolled in higher education before the introduction of the new study programmes will continue and complete their studies under the conditions in force at the time of their enrolment, up to the end of the academic year 2015/2016. If a student repeats a year and the programme in which he/she enrolled is no longer available, he/she shall continue and complete his/her studies under the new study programmes. <p/> 2. Diploma Supplement <p/> All students will receive a Diploma Supplement free of charge together with their diploma, which will be issued in Slovene and one of the official languages of the European Union. The Diploma Supplement is an integral part of the diploma which includes information about the higher education system and the student's performance (grades), as well as a unified description of the nature, level, content and status of the study programme. Students will benefit from the introduction of the Diploma Supplement, as all the skills and knowledge they have acquired during their studies will now be recorded in the Diploma Supplement, which will also make it easier for them to find a good job and to enrol for further studies. <Study requirements in the study programmes will now be evaluated in terms of credit points (ECTS), which means that each student's workload in the official programme will be credited (the work a student puts in to complete the requirements, including seminars, tutorials, independent study, lectures, the preparation of a thesis, etc.). Each year of the study programme will comprise 60 credits. The first cycle will be 180 or 240 credits (three or four years), the second cycle will be 60 or 120 credits (one to two years, but in such a way that, in the same field of expertise, together with the first cycle, the programme lasts for five years), and the third cycle will be 180 credits (three years). <Joint study programmes <p/> Higher education institutions will be allowed to establish and run joint study programmes with other Slovenian and foreign higher education institutions. This means that students will study at different higher education institutions within one study programme and will obtain one joint degree at the end of their studies. <p/> ... will now be cheaper, shorter and simpler and will replace the nostrification system used until now. <p/> 6. Tuition fees and access to studies <p/> No tuition fees can be charged for full-time studies at public higher education institutions at the first degree level. Free studies at the second cycle will be provided to at least 30 % of students, with social status, regional representation and the scarcity of professions being taken into account as criteria for determining the proportion of students to be included in this ratio, in the ratio 70:20:10. <Co-governance and student participation will be increased <p/> Student membership of higher education bodies has been increased from one in seven to one in five, and students now have one in five votes in the election of university rectors. Student surveys will also be given greater importance in the area of student co-governance. Students will also be represented in the Public Agency for Higher Education, which will carry out external evaluations of higher education. <p/> 8. Foreign students: <p/> can receive scholarships in Slovenia, but only if the principle of reciprocity is applied <p/> lectures will be able to be organised in a foreign language, even if the lecture is not also organised in Slovene.",Information/Explanation,test

451,"US urges Romania to defend independent judiciary <p/> Bucharest, 11 January (STA) - The United States today urged Romania to defend the rule of law and expressed concern about attacks by politicians on the independent judiciary. Victoria Nuland, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, criticised the Romanian authorities and warned that ""an independent judiciary is essential for a strong democracy"" during a visit to Bucharest. <p/> After years of total impunity, several high-ranking Romanian politicians, including former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, have been convicted of corruption and landed in prison in recent years. This shows, according to analysts, that the independence of the judiciary in this Balkan country, which has been an EU member since 2007, is strengthening, albeit slowly. <p/> ""You have made great strides forward, especially in the last five years, and I call on all Romanians (...) to fight even harder to defend the independence of the judiciary and to keep it out of politics,"" the high-ranking US guest stressed today in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean, the French news agency AFP reports. <p/> The Austrian news agency APA adds that the Romanian authorities, expecting harsh words, had already warned the US before the visit not to raise the issue of Romanian justice and reminded that Romania is not an American colony. But this did not seem to stop Nuland. <p/> Her words referred to the Romanian Parliament's attempt to provide a kind of ""super-immunity"" to MPs and local politicians by amending the Penal Code and the law on amnesties and pardons. This would also protect incumbent politicians from possible corruption charges. In addition, politicians already convicted of corruption could be pardoned, APA writes. <p/> The US immediately branded the attempt at the end of December as ""a step away from transparency and the rule of law"", while the EU and several of its members, including Germany and France, also expressed concern. In the end, Bucharest only caved in under pressure and postponed the adoption of the law until February, but it has not yet been abandoned. <p/> Further discontent was caused by statements by Socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a sworn opponent of the conservative President Basescu, in which he accused the special prosecutor for the fight against corruption, DNA, and the integrity body, ANI, of being subject to the ""Basescu regime"" and of ruling unfairly. Last week, the Prime Minister even compared the recent second corruption conviction of Nastase to the imprisonment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine. <p/> The situation in Romania was most acute last year, when Ponta's centre-left coalition tried to oust Basescu by referendum. In attempting to do so, it, among other things, blatantly interfered with the independence of the Romanian Constitutional Court.",News,test
454,"Closing ceremony of the Fabula Festival <p/> To close the successful Fabula Festival, which this year was crowned by the visit of Scottish literary star Irvin Welsh and his performance in front of a packed CD Club, the organisers invited three Slovenian authors and one female author to speak (and read). Stanka Hrastelj, Milan Kleč, Marko Sosič and Dušan Šarotar talked about myths, their influence on our everyday lives, their importance for literature and our (un)conscious involvement in mythical worlds. On this occasion, a collection of short fiction Myths of Our Everyday Life was published with one story from each of the invited authors. <p/> It is not entirely clear why these four authors were invited to participate. Were the organisers guided in their selection by the intrinsic and substantive merits of the selected writings, or was it more than a random selection? Given the diversity of the four stories collected, which sometimes have almost nothing in common with myths or are simply a negation of them (Stanka Hrastelj), the second option seems more likely. Nevertheless, at least for Dušan Šarotar and Mark Sosič, judging by their reflective answers, the subject of myths is not alien to them and served as a good starting point for the emerging story. <p/> Dušan Šarotar pointed out that interpreting myths is something he does all the time, because myths are nothing but memory, and we are all made of memories. Myths, he said, also connect people in time and space, define a community through time and give it meaning and solidity. Marko Sosič agreed that in the field of the unconscious as well as the conscious, we are entwined in Slovenian folk traditions and ancient myths. However, he stressed that we need to develop a critical attitude towards the mythical images of Western society that serve as models and ideals. In order to face the present time and ourselves, Sosič said, we must acquire the distance necessary for critical reflection. <p/> Stanka Hrastelj focused on the female characters that define the Slovenian mythological field. She reflected on two in particular: the beautiful Vida, who seems to be the obvious choice, and the figure of the Cankarjan mother - a suffering mother and wife who sacrifices herself for a man and expects his eternal gratitude in return. This figure - as the author has rightly observed - is still very much present in our society. In writing the short story, however, Hrasteljeva did lean on the character of the beautiful Vida, but added a twist in the form of a happy ending. The author also pointed out that myths serve as a mirror to explain our behaviour, because they are rooted in the behaviour of humanity. <p/> Milan Kleč did not say much. During Šarotar and Sosič's debate, he provided a comic interlude with a story about a skylark that had wandered onto his balcony and was persistently making noises there, disturbing his (peace of mind), as such a squawking was supposedly a harbinger of death. The tale of a heroic confrontation with a winged peace-builder in a residential neighbourhood and its subsequent removal - combined with Kleč's tormented appearance, as he acted as if he would rather be anywhere else than on the stage of the CD Club at that moment - gave the hundred or so visitors to the evening a good laugh. Tina Kozin, who asked the same questions to all the guests, did not let herself be confused and, when it was Kleč's turn to answer again, she cleverly adapted the question to the author's narration (and situation). <p/> At the end, each of the invitees read an excerpt from his short story, with the exception of Milan Kleč, who decided to read a poem by the recently deceased Matjaž Kocbek instead of his own story. Marko Sosič chose the legend of the Lady of Devin as the basis for his story ""Contempt"" and set it in the currently very topical theme of unemployment and the resulting feeling of shame Milan Kleč's story ""Krakow"" describes the fulfilled wish of a poor student and waitress who pays her way to this Polish city and a supernatural exchange, which happens at the end of the story Dušan Šarotar, in the story ""Among the High Clouds That Will Sing"", set the action in Sobota and framed it with the fascination with the stars and the many folk beliefs about the stars that are still present today Stanka Hrastelj - as mentioned above - told a modern story about the beautiful Vida with a happy ending. <p/>Myths are an extremely broad and rewarding subject, and there is, of course, much more that could be said about them. As Marko Sosič pointed out, myths are born out of man's attempt to understand the world, but despite the remarkable scientific advances of recent centuries, man remains essentially the same, as does his need for stories to make sense of the world. <p/> The Fabula Festival 2013, which celebrated its tenth anniversary, has come to a close. It is a pity that the tradition of awarding the Dnevnik Fabula, Slovenia's only literary prize for the best original short fiction collection, has come to an end this year. As we know, it is much easier to continue such traditions than to resurrect them. <p/> Email notifications",News,test
457,"@ PJ. I will briefly repeat my reply to your comment: congratulations and good health to you in the future. I wonder if you have written down the diagnosis "" lame from the waist down "", and the cure somewhere. Do you keep this knowledge you have gained to yourself or are you interested in sharing it with someone else who is dealing with a similar intractable problem. <p/> For me it is a little different. A very aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis (in terms of percentage cured) was contracted by a family member. Unexpectedly, while she was waiting for surgery, I gave her a month of therapy using the procedure or technique carried out by Zdenko Domančič and his team. For 30 days, 2x a day. I did the therapies exclusively at her request, it is difficult to explain how this came about. On the third day her condition started to improve. She was able to start walking up stairs again, she hadn't been able to do it before, she had a cold all winter, she had difficulty breathing, sinus problems, chronically blocked nose, she hadn't smelled for a year. No antibiotic was helping her effectively anymore. In the meantime, while she was waiting for the operation (she had to undergo a few more tests), she was not receiving any medication to treat her cancer. When she was operated on, it was found that, of the five tumours, four had disappeared and one had gone from 15 mm to about 5 mm. I admit that I am not foolish and I do not know what we managed in the long run. Time will tell. I am still continuing with the therapies, following the advice of the people in the bioenergetician's circle. <p/> That is why I was interested in your description of the effect of the energy flow on the diseased tissue. <p/> @David: as I have said before, and I feel you are realising yourself, vanity can be a problem here and difficult to overcome. So I will just say this: the conclusion is that you are on the right path. It might be worth familiarising yourself with the content on stimulating the pituitary gland. <p/> @david: I do not know if we have understood each other correctly. I can imagine what it is like for you in the situation you are in ... We too were diagnosed with cancer three years ago with the youngest in the family. Unfortunately, at that time I was not yet aware of the therapy that was being researched in the 1960s and was supposedly achieving excellent results. <p/> As I said, it was roughly about (electromagnetic) stimulation of the pituitary gland. This resulted in the formation of bodies that fed on the malignant cells, which reduced the tumour. At the same time, the inhibitors, in turn, inhibited the development or proliferation of stem cells into malignant cells... <p/>I'm sorry I didn't go into the details, but if I had another chance, I would have. We said goodbye to the youngest in our family a year ago. I suspect, however, that what you are describing is exactly this model of treatment. <p/>David, now a word of caution: P.J. obviously brings spices that the dish does not need to tickle you in the first place, and then writes about inferring that it is a crowd that is supposed to be on the right path. This makes you an information broker for others and no longer just for yourself (different levels of responsibility, after all...). <p/> I did not follow your dialogue and I have no idea what it is about ... but I am naturally cautious about similar transitions from singular to plural. <p/> Ah, that post cut off part of the communication - but as far as I'm concerned, it's still the case that a person should give partly different information on his/her own behalf than if he/she gives it on behalf of a group (even if it's the same joint project of whatever). <p/> @ niko: thanks for the warning. It should have used a colon. I'm sprinkling myself with ashes for that mistake. <p/> As for responsibility, I have to agree with you. In caring for the patient, we (each individual who accepts this role - not to get bogged down with interpretation again) are about to take (again, each individual) full (co-) responsibility for the outcome. <p/> P.S.: Perhaps a clarification on why the change from singular to plural (or, as written, more correctly - dual). <p/> In most treatments there is a patient and a therapist. The course of treatment and cure also depends on the patient and not only on the therapist. Hence the sentence that both of you (all involved), judging by the results described, are (are) on the right path. <p/>@PJ. Now I understand. I can see that you have had quite a few difficult ordeals. Actually, this technique that I am using is the work of Zdenek Domančič. Personally, I think that this therapy has a holistic effect on the patient's immune system (I have seen it myself in several patients after only a few days) and that the body may (or may not, depending of course on the patient's condition) react positively and fight the condition more easily. Although the very act of laying on of hands makes the cancer cells feel unwell. Anyway, if you are interested in more, go to youtube and type in the name of the bioenergetician mentioned, there is a lot said there and research has also been done at various institutions around Slovenia (jozef stefan, I think also at the oncoloske) ... <p/> @Niko, thank you for your concern, but I no longer worry about being unfairly grouped somewhere or thrown in some trash can. I've been called everything from a janissist, to a right-winger, to a pro-Russia, left-winger, and so on, on blogs <p/> @Niko, I don't resent anyone. We're all just human, which is why blog-level resentment is absurdly fucking ridiculous. Which ends up being cruel when someone keeps slandering and moderating you. And yet absurd if the cause is ""virtual"" <p/> I'm not saying I don't resent things too, I do, but it has to be related to a greater amount of money, time, and consequently unattained planned goals. <p/> Man, you weren't disciplining anyone - you were just defending yourself. There was no talk of overstepping the bounds of power. , <p/> There is a note somewhere here among the older posts about how it came about that I put Dajana in spam (etting) and she no longer has access to this blog - the only one and it really wasn't my intention to oppress anyone in such a way, but with her all the normal solutions fall away (the woman is polluting all over the place for absolutely no reason). She only understands that one step too far towards the abyss. <p/> I forgot to leave this link here, under this heading, which was the trigger for the end-to-end, over-amplified and predictable clichéd parroting with the noticeable manifestations of dementia of the blogger Dajana and of the gentleman who has sovereign mastery of the knowledge and functioning of the egos of bitches, Mr Ervinatro. <p/> For your amusement, nobody has given me as much publicity as these two have done on the siol! <p/> werner, you must be very young, I can tell by your naive euphoric conclusions, hehe ... <p/> but I find this strange: in all the American films, the Russians are Americans - well, sometimes Yugos In no time at all, all the ""Russians"" speak English <p/> and then they make the film in such a way that the Russians are made to look like cowards. ------- similarly with the commentators on the net ... ........................ . hint: for me, the ""smart"" person is the one who gives me money and pays me for it - all the others are ballast that I shake off <p/> You don't know, but my teachers know that there is so much of what I do in me - purely from within, without reading, imitating or going anywhere to get knowledge ... , I just like to go and test what is in me.

Because she is hateful and labile. Not even Abraham helps her! ! Maybe I will - because I do everything with love. I will show love to her too. In a slightly different way. ******************** Actually, I feel sorry for her. She's deprived of everyone she expected anything from. But that's her own fault. When she realises that she is doing injustice to countless people by slandering them and spreading lies about them, she will be on the right path to realising love. ************************************************** And when she does, I will be the first one to embrace her. I promise. *************************************************** P.S. If a man wants to get something, he has to give it. And if a man wants to get love, he has to give it. *************************************** But if a man sows hatred, he gets back only hatred. ********************************************* And here the guspa is enormous. ******************* The mind will meet it when it knows what love really is. ******************************************** <p/> My dear Dragica, publicity is only for the benefit, hehe, not for the detriment. ************************************** Many people want to meet me, and you too, and NIkota, because of what is written about us. which is a plus for us. ********************************* And whoever wants to have a clear and clean picture, and a mirror, comes to us, isn't it?

The type and quantity of pollutants in rainwater varies temporally and spatially depending on a number of factors that are non-linearly interrelated: climate, road surface, traffic, land use and other local specificities. Slovenia does not yet have a methodology for sampling rainwater, nor is there a comprehensive long-term monitoring study of rainwater quality. In the first part of the thesis, we have collected literature on the topic of rainwater harvesting, with a focus on Slovenian literature. The experimental part consists of the selection of rainwater treatment facilities suitable for sampling, the determination of the sampled parameters, and manual sampling of the influent and effluent during rainfall events between October 2009 and August 2010. In the first phase, we captured single instantaneous samples within the first wave of the rainfall event, and later we increased the frequency of sample collection.

604,"Digital Marketing Essentials and Activities <p/> Today, it's harder than ever to stand out from all the competition. But you've never had as much chance of success as you do today. With all the options available, choosing services and tactics is an even more complex task. Strategically planned, results-oriented activities, a smart digital strategy with the optimal combination and design of solutions, tactics and campaigns, will deliver surprising results, especially for companies that are just starting to approach digital marketing professionally, strategically, comprehensively and purposefully, with thoughtful and modern results-oriented approaches. <p/> Due to the many myths, inaccurate or misleading claims, innovations on the one hand, and the real opportunities in digital marketing on the other, companies, individuals and even ""experts"" are still too often making superficial choices about where to focus their energy and resources. Providers often offer what they know how to do, rather than what customers actually need. That's why in the following lines we take a closer look at the basic activities of digital marketing, and the details that set effective digital strategies apart from the crowd of mediocre ones. <p/> 1. An engaging and responsive mobile-friendly website <p/> Your website has long since ceased to be just a business card. It's your central online presence and your company's first salesperson. No one employee can do it. That's why you need a bespoke website that generates new business and customers under any circumstances. In today's digital reality, more and more of us are accessing and interacting with brands via smartphones and tablets, so it's vital that visitors are able to view your website and content in a unified, personalised way across all devices. The user experience on the site must be just as efficient, equally and quickly transparent, and everything must be in its place, whether the content is accessed on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. Those of you who are still neglecting mobile technology, flexible display methods and customers in the moments when they have their phone in their hand may long regret it, because you are neglecting them in those intimate moments when the deepest connection with your followers, potential customers and readers can be made. <p/> 2. Website optimisation and search marketing for lead generation <p/> Anyone who thinks that SEO no longer exists, or no longer delivers the right results, has a bad sense of humour. Search engine optimisation is alive and well, now more than ever, as long as it is adapted to new SEO methods. It is, however, much more difficult to implement than in the past, thanks to Google's sophisticated, sometimes annoying, search algorithm, which is being refined on a daily basis. Together with on-page optimisation, online advertising on search engines (e.g. Google AdWords) allows us to attract more new customers more easily and more quickly. All digital marketing activities must also be continuously monitored using web analytics tools, data collated, analysed and your website optimisation strategy continuously updated. <p/> 3. Email marketing <p/> It is amazing how many people still turn a blind eye to the usefulness and effectiveness of email marketing. Even though we are already in 2017, sending emails to your target audience has always been one of the more effective tactics to increase traffic and conversions on your website. We also call email marketing the ""evergreen of digital marketing"". In addition to its direct impact on sales, email marketing plays an even more important role in building and nurturing a loyal follower base that is ""fed"" with content, which in turn increases repeat purchases and subsequent conversions. <p/> Just think how many emails you receive in your inbox every day. But do you think there would really be that much if it didn't work? <p/> Of course, our goal and yours is not to fill inboxes all the time, but sending targeted messages to a segmented population (who have given permission) works wonders. The need to automate all these processes also makes it necessary to use tools and integrate email marketing and other databases, tools. For all of you who have not yet integrated email marketing into your business, you have now learned where you have been making a basic mistake all this time. <p/> 4. Using social networks <p/> Today, people find it difficult to trust and are overwhelmed with information, questions, obligations; but we are demanding and informed customers who make decisions and buy emotionally. We strive to have and achieve everything at the click of a button or a click. The reality is not so simple. Our decision-making is also influenced by our relationships with people, brand representatives, their support service, the information given and other subliminal brand messages. <p/> Social networks are a place where we can manage all of this and delight our followers with expected or unexpected attention, replies, interesting content, rewards to reinforce our brand and showcase our values. If we implement all of the above effectively up to this point, our social media activities will only further expand and strengthen our visibility and recognition. <p/> 5. Content marketing as a link <p/> The link between a smart and successful digital marketing strategy is the content strategy and the publishing calendar. Thus, content marketing, blog articles, images, infographics, e-books, videos, reports, etc., represent an increasing share of digital marketing investment. How could they not, when digital content has become the most important means of communication today. There are more and more reasons to plan, organise and produce content that wins the hearts of readers according to a specific publishing calendar.

The vast majority of caracinids are characterised by their vibrant colours and peaceful cohabitation with other aquarium inhabitants. However, they are also a highly predatory species, characterised by aggressiveness, as they generally do not tolerate competition in their vicinity. They breed freely, which means that they deposit their eggs freely in the water.They usually do not care about their offspring and most often eat most of the eggs themselves.If we want to breed them, we have to make sure that the parents do not get to the eggs.In professional breeding, special nets are used for this purpose, but it is enough to put a little thicker aquarium sand at the bottom of the spawning aquarium, among which the eggs fall after spawning. <p/> Serpa is a fiery red colour, the colouration depends largely on the conditions in which it lives, in darker aquariums its colour is more pronounced.It is a pronounced schooling fish, which grows up to 4 cm. <p/> A beautiful fish that has been known in the aquarium trade since 2007 and overnight became the No.1 fish in the aquarium world.",Information/Explanation,test

In addition to the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Borut Pahor, important Turkish investors were also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Mitja Mavko, a representative of the Slovenian Compensation Insurance Company and the Director of Spirit Boštjan Skalar. In his opening remarks, the President of the Republic stressed that Turkey and Slovenia have a long-standing friendship and respect, which is also very important for economic cooperation on both sides. He described Turkey's goal of becoming one of the ten strongest economies in the world in the next 10 years as inspiring and admirable. ""Turkey is of strategic importance for Slovenia and we need to strengthen cooperation at all levels. Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia,"" the President said. Addressing more than 80 Turkish investors, President Pahor presented Slovenia as a dynamic, open and export-oriented country and invited potential investors to come to Slovenia. He highlighted Slovenia's human potential and its exceptional geopolitical position as a meeting point between Central and South-Eastern Europe. In this context, he recalled that he and President Gül had agreed at their meeting yesterday on the utmost importance of the Brdo Process initiative for the stability of the Western Balkans. There are many opportunities for strategic investment in Slovenia, President Pahor said, underlining that Slovenia is very interesting for Turkey, as the two countries have well-regulated contractual relations and have concluded all the most important agreements in practically all areas of common interest. Among the most important of these is the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Yesterday afternoon, the President attended the 6th Annual Conference of Ambassadors of the Republic of Turkey, where he gave a short lecture. After the lecture, the President also met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Ali Babacan. Late yesterday afternoon, President Pahor met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During their talks, President Pahor and Mr Erdoğan noted that the effects of the strategic partnership signed two years ago are already visible and committed to further cooperation. Prime Minister Erdoğan welcomed President Pahor's willingness to open an investment conference in Istanbul today to present concrete opportunities for Turkish investors to invest in Slovenian companies, for more vibrant cooperation between the economies of the two countries, and for a possible joint appearance on third markets. The two also discussed some aspects of the Syrian crisis, which has led to over 600,000 refugees fleeing to Turkey in recent months.

643,"Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest for the most part, so it makes sense for countries to encourage it through various measures. <p/> Finland's wood building promotion programme is already showing results <p/> The use of wood in construction has become more popular again in recent years, with some countries promoting it through specific measures. This is also the case in Finland, where a seven-year wood building promotion programme is already showing results. According to Petri Heino, administrator of the programme, key measures include changes in legislation and financial incentives. <p/> Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest, so it makes sense for countries to promote it through various measures, said Petri Heino of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. ""Governments can provide, among other things, changes in legislation, financial incentives and the dissemination of good practice examples to promote sustainable construction,"" he said. <p/> In Finland, he said, it is by combining these three measures that progress has been made. ""We have been able to involve a wide range of stakeholders in promotional activities,"" he said, recalling the size and indirect positive effects of the construction sector. <p/> Finns have had subsidies for the construction of wooden houses for several years, and since the beginning of this year the government has increased them further. The amount varies depending on the region; for example, in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the subsidy is €15,000. <p/> In Finland, a specific programme is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment to promote timber construction in the period 2016-2022, which aims, among other things, to foster the growth of an internationally competitive timber construction industry, both in terms of know-how and domestic production, and to support the sustainable use of forest resources. <p/>The programme's objectives include a ten per cent annual growth in the construction of wooden residential buildings, as well as an increase in the carbon sequestration potential of wood products, the share of wood in public buildings and the export of wood products. ""The mid-term review of the results, carried out in 2018, showed that the activities have had a positive impact in most of the target areas,"" Heino pointed out. <p/> The use of wood in construction is commonplace in Finland, he said, as they have extensive forests that are producing more annual growth than ever before. It is currently at around 110 million cubic metres, of which between 65 and 70 per cent is felled. <p/> Young Finns are also aware of the importance of wood. According to Hein, a recent study showed that 69 per cent of girls between the ages of 14 and 23 support the idea of increasing wood use. <p/> Slovenia is also working to further promote wood as a renewable resource and an opportunity to enhance the added value of products. Among other things, the country aims to achieve a 30% share of wood in public buildings and to increase domestic log processing to three million cubic metres per year. <p/> Heino said that while the starting points are encouraging, it will be useful to further address these issues in the future through changes in legislation, educational content and various policies. <There are also opportunities for cooperation between the two countries.

645,"Japan - Kyoto and Geishas <p/> The English writer, explorer, photographer and naturalist Isabella Bird once wrote that Japan offers as much novelty as a trip to another planet. From imposing shrines surrounded by fairy-tale forests, to snow-capped Mount Fuji, to shy and agile geishas, to neon-lit skyscrapers, to punctual and fast trains, Japan conjures up many associations... Japan is a unique synthesis of the traditional and the modern, where ancient gods, traditions, skills and arts meet cutting-edge modern technology, futuristic fashion and the latest style and design. Japan is a country that is a feast for all the senses. Japan was still feudal in the second half of the 19th century, but at the end of that century, rapid industrialisation began. But after the Second World War, Japan emerged as a true economic giant. <p/> Kyoto <p/> The former imperial capital boasts many temples, palaces, shrines and gardens. Kyoto is also famous for its highly developed traditional arts and festivals. Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan from 794 until 1868, when Meji moved it to Tokyo. Nevertheless, Kyoto retains the primacy of Japan's cultural sophistication. In a way, Kyoto is complementary to Nara, where the foundations of traditional Japanese culture were laid, culminating in Kyoto. Kyoto has a huge number of attractions, so I will concentrate only on the most important ones. <p/> Kiyomizudera <p/> The Temple of Pure Water - Kiyomizudera - is one of the most important temples in Japan and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 778 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in eastern Kyoto. The main temple as we see it today was built in 1633 by the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, who, among other things, expelled all Europeans and Christians from Japan and closed the borders of Japan, which lasted for more than 200 years afterwards. The temple was built without a single nail. Kiyomizudera Temple is best known for its 13-metre-high wooden platform, which offers visitors a fine view of the many cherry and maple trees as well as the city of Kyoto in the distance. Below the temple is the Otowa Waterfall, which is divided into three smaller waterfalls. The water from each waterfall has its own health and well-being benefits. You can drink the water from a cup located on a long wooden pole. The water of the first waterfall is good for long life, the second for success in school and life and the third for happiness and love in life. But don't be partial, you can only drink the water of one ""waterfall"". <p/> Behind the main hall of the Kiyomizu Dera Temple stands the Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the deity of love and matchmaking. In front of the temple there are two stones 18 metres apart. If you can find your way from one to the other with your eyes closed, you will be lucky in your search for love, but if you need someone to guide you from one stone to the other, you may also need an intermediary in your search for a life mate. <p/> The Higashiyama district is one of the best preserved old areas of the city, located between Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka Shrine. Walking through the narrow streets, between the wooden buildings and traditional shops, it's easy to feel the flavour of the old capital. Many small shops and restaurants have catered for locals, tourists and pilgrims for centuries. On a walk through the quarter, we also caught a geisha going about her business, and she was happy to pose for us. <p/> 1 of 3 <p/> Kodaiji Temple, founded in 1606 in memory of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan's greatest historical figures, and commissioned by his wife Nene, is also remarkable. <p/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a warrior, politician, samurai, general and daimyo - a nobleman subject only to the shogun - who had 26 famous Christians crucified, known as the Japanese martyrs. Kodaiji Temple belongs to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism. The temple is surrounded by gardens and we also walked through a beautiful bamboo grove. <p/> One of Kyoto's most famous shrines, Yasaka, is only a good half hour's walk from Kiyomizu Temple, but of course the walk takes a while, and we could easily have stayed here for an hour longer. The shrine was founded around 650 AD. In front of the main shrine there is a stage with hundreds of lamps that light up in the evening. Each lamp bears the name of a local company that pays a donation. <p/> Fushimi Inari Shrine <p/> Fushimi Inari is an important Shinto shrine in the southern part of Kyoto. It is famous for its thousand orange or brilliant red torii, which lead through the forest to the 233-metre-high Inari Sacred Mountain, an integral part of the shrine. <p/> Fushimi Inari is one of the most important of the thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto goddess of rice. The shrine is also full of statues of foxes, which were the messengers of the goddess Inari. Fushimi Inari Shrine is of ancient origin and existed before Kyoto became the capital of Japan in 794. <p/> 1 of 4 <p/> Arashiyama <p/> Arashiyama is a pleasant tourist district on the western outskirts of Kyoto. The area has been a popular destination since Japan was given its first permanent capital, Naro, in 710. The capital at the time flirted with the Chinese capital. Large Buddhist temples were built at this time. Chinese influence was diminishing, although it was still great, or rather many things were submerged. Perhaps the first association we have with Arashiyama is the extremely attractive bamboo forest. <p/> The most important temple in Arashiyama is Tenryuji. It is one of the five great Zen temples of Kyoto and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This temple also has its own Rinzai Zen school of the Rinzai sect of Japanese Buddhism. The temple was built as early as 1339, when the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji ruled, and was dedicated to the then deceased Emperor Go-Daiga. A walk along the pond and through the temple's tatami trees is a real Arashiyama experience. <p/> Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji <p/> The Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji is a Zen temple whose upper two floors are entirely gilded with gold leaf. Previously known as Rokuonji, the temple was the resting villa of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according to his will, after his death in 1408, it became a Rinzai sect Zen temple. In front of the temple is a beautiful pond. The temple has burned down several times in its history, most recently in 1950 by a fanatical monk, but was rebuilt again in 1955. <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence of the Japanese Imperial Family until 1868, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo. It is located in Kyoto's Imperial Park, along with the Sento Imperial Palace and several other landmarks. <p/> The present Imperial Palace was rebuilt in 1855 after it burnt down. The complex is surrounded by walls and ramparts, with halls and gardens inside. Only the current Emperor Akihito was crowned in Tokyo, the previous ones in Kyoto. <p/> Of course, there are more temples and sights. Kyoto is also famous for its geishas, of which there are around 300, including at least two Europeans.",Opinion/Argumentation,test

659,"Does algae generation mean the beginning of the end of your aquarium? <p/> Freshwater algae are a threat to aquatic life in aquariums. Algae are extremely tough when it comes to surviving and spreading throughout the aquarium tank, so you will need to be persistent to get rid of this problem. If you don't keep it under control, the aquarium will become a toxic water production system, which will be very harmful to your fish. You can prevent this by getting to know what is happening in your aquarium and what to do about it. With algae, it is best to prevent them from forming in the first place. This can be done by changing the water every week, as algae cannot thrive when there is new water in the aquarium, and by keeping up with other maintenance work. Some species of algae are edible, like much other marine vegetation, and are a food source in many parts of the world. There are hundreds of edible species containing vitamins and minerals. They are also used as fertiliser and food for livestock. In freshwater aquariums, there are quite a few species of algae that survive on nutrients in the water. In some cases, aquarium algae serve as food for aquarium inhabitants such as shrimps and snails, but if their growth is not controlled, they can be a threat to other aquarium life. Brown algae are often found in newly installed aquariums. They also thrive in poorly lit aquariums where phosphate levels are high and nitrogen levels are low. They are slimy and soft algae found on aquarium glass, in the substrate and in decorations. Brown algae will disappear in the presence of strong light, but may still remain in darker areas of the aquarium. In contrast, green algae thrive in aquariums with strong light. They appear as green spots on aquarium plants and on the aquarium glass. Hairy algae and filamentous algae appear as threads in the water. They thrive in aquariums if there is too much iron in the water. They are easily removed by wrapping a stick around them. Filamentous algae grow on the leaves of plants, are found at the tips of the leaves and can reach a length of 30 cm. Hairy algae usually grow at the base of plants, on the substrate and sometimes on the decoration. They are green-grey in colour and grow to about 4 cm. Most aquarists do not bother with this algae as some fish feed on it. However, freshwater shrimps such as Caridina Japonica feed on filamentous algae. A type of algae that enhances the look of an aquarium is the bearded algae. These algae form a carpet, usually covering rocks and plant leaves. They form closer to the light source. They are soft and slippery and grow quickly to a maximum of 3 cm. Bearded algae need a constant light source and are common in aquariums without plants and are quite difficult to remove by hand. By putting algae-eating fish in the water, you are constantly reducing the effect that algae can have on the aquarium. Fish such as Indian minnows, algae-eating foxtails and spotted armadillos are a great help in reducing them. Before introducing them to other fish in the aquarium, make sure they can be kept together in the aquarium, otherwise they will not do a good job of cleaning the algae. In small proportions, algae add colour and vitality to the aquarium. As well as providing food for some of the creatures in the aquarium, they can also provide shelter for small fish. They are also a good indicator of imbalances in the system. Algae show when there are too many nutrients in the water. Too many nutrients indicate that you may be feeding the fish too much and that some plants may be excreting nutrients. Algae can also indicate that you need to pay attention to the aquarium water, as it can be harmful to the fish and plants. The growth of freshwater algae depends on the existing conditions in the aquarium. Algae growth is dependent on three conditions: water, light and nutrients. Controlling these three sources is the main step in preventing them from growing and causing damage. Light can be controlled by placing the aquarium away from sunlight and artificial light should not be used for more than eight hours a day. Artificial light should not be too strong and it is a good idea to install an automatic timer switch. The feeding habits of fish vary from species to species. In order to control phosphate levels, which serve as food for algae, it is important not to overfeed the fish, as this will increase phosphate levels. If the fish have eaten and there are bits of food left in the aquarium, remove them immediately. In addition, regular water changes are important to prevent phosphate and nitrate levels from increasing. Change at least 10 to 15% of the water once a week and scrape off any algae clinging to the glass. Testing the water will also allow you to control algae build-up. Products to help you control algae: <p/> Amtra algenmaster - Works by damaging the algae metabolism and eliminating the formation of algal blooms <p/> Amtra system clean - An important product when changing the water.

Be ruthless and get rid of all the ballast, both in terms of stuff and information. Only delay tasks if you know they require more than two minutes of your time. In this case, put each task on a list, archive it, but get on with it as soon as time permits. Plan <p/> 2. Plan <p/> At the beginning of each week, on Monday morning or even on Sunday evening, decide on one to three most important goals and put them in your weekly schedule. These should be major tasks that - when completed - will make you feel proud. Similarly, divide each day into smaller tasks. From a psychological point of view, it is best to do the most important tasks in the morning, as this will take most of the burden off your shoulders when the day is just getting off to a good start. Make your scheduling system as easy to use and understand as possible - there is no need to waste time familiarising yourself with Outlook or other software on your computer. <p/> 3. Focus <p/> We all know that it is difficult to do every task with complete focus and without interruptions. But this is one of the most basic habits you need to learn, as it ensures good time management. Exclude all possible distractions: e-mail, mobile phones and, if necessary, the Internet. <p/> This way of working may not be so easy if you have a distaste for a particular task. In this case, first consider the positive aspects of the task. For example, it may lead to a new project, a promotion to a better job, or you may just learn something new and interesting. Then break the task into mini-tasks, each of which will take you no more than five minutes. Once you've done the first one, we guarantee the others will flow like clockwork. Reward yourself by completing the first three or four mini-tasks - for example, by reading an email or web portal for five minutes. Then get on with the job. <p/> 4. Organise your work and living space <p/> The perception of being stifled by commitments can also be influenced by the messiness of the environment in which we live and work. Spring is a good time to start reorganising our living and working environment and putting all the things that surround us on a daily basis in their place. First, define a system to store similar things together (e.g. bills, documents). Even if some of us work well in functional clutter, it is systematised for the individual, we just have to find a (dis)order that suits us. Then follow the system, give each item a proper place and start keeping all the related items in a real-time storage. <p/> 5. Review <p/> Regularly review both the newly established storage system and your progress in terms of meeting your objectives. Review your notes and draw a line at the end of the week to assess how well you have done in meeting your commitments. This is important to reaffirm success to yourself or to learn from your mistakes in the future. After the review, set yourself tasks and goals for the coming week based on your past shortcomings and the things you failed to tick off the list. Focus on the most important ones or simplify the ones that are not the most urgent. <p/> 6. Find your passion <p/> Do those things that you really enjoy, that - even if they are professional in nature - you enjoy and that you feel you could enjoy for the rest of your life. The fact that finding the perfect job is difficult is an understatement. But it is worth finding, and we recommend that you never give up the search. Think how easy it would be to do the tasks listed above if they were related to an activity or topic that you are passionate about! If you can't turn your passion into a job, make sure you do something about it, at least in your spare time, because that's how you can regain some confidence or motivation. <p/> Finally, it is important to create your own comfortable routine. Routines are considered by many to be boring and can kill the spirit. To a certain extent this is true, but in times when you are overwhelmed it can make your daily efforts and life in general much easier. It is therefore advisable to develop routines in the area of work habits and patterns - if you make it a part of your blood to collect your thoughts, set goals and plan how to achieve them on a weekly and daily basis, your life will be much easier. <p/> We wish you to enter this spring with focus and determination. <p/> Article by Elvira Leka, translated and edited by Katarina Cvikl.",Instruction,test

674,"Trampling on the Constitution instead of taking responsibility <p/> The Information Commissioner has caught the police illegally obtaining data on the readers of online portals. Instead of taking responsibility, the ministry wants to legalise the actions of the police. Even though they are against the Constitution. <p/> If someone is warned that his actions are breaking the law, if he is reasonable, he will stop those actions. The police and the Ministry of the Interior see things slightly differently - instead of stopping illegal activities, they would legalise them. Even if this legalisation is contrary to the Constitution. <p/> But let us take it in turn. In January this year, we published a report by the Information Commissioner on the podcrto.si website, which found repeated illegal behaviour by the police in obtaining data from web portal operators. In the vast majority of cases, the police have requested information on the identity of readers and commenters on online portals from portal operators without a court order. However, the Act on Electronic Commerce on the Market stipulates that the police can only obtain such information with a court order. However, according to the Information Commissioner's findings, in 2012 the police obtained information on readers only four times with a court order. In the remaining 31 cases, it requested it bypassing the courts. <p/> Much of the media did not pay attention to these findings. This is understandable - in 23 cases, the media operating online portals provided the police with the identity of their readers, even though they did not have a court order to do so. In this way, they themselves were complicit in breaking the law. <p/> What is more surprising is the reaction of the police and the Ministry of the Interior, which is the superior authority of the police. Instead of holding the police accountable and punishing the guilty for repeatedly breaking the law, they have responded to the Information Commissioner's findings by creatively interpreting the law, which may, after all, allow them to obtain information bypassing the courts. This is how they brought to light Article 149b of the Criminal Procedure Act. The third paragraph of this article gives the police the possibility to request from operators, only at their written request, information on the owner or user of a particular means of electronic communications traffic which is not published in the subscriber directories. The intention behind the legal latitude is simple: the legislator wanted to make the police's job easier in cases where the police have the telephone number of a suspect but cannot find out his name because the number is not in the telephone directory. However, the police and the Ministry of the Interior have interpreted the provision creatively: operators of online portals could also be considered operators, and therefore they are obliged to provide data even without a court order. <p/> This lifeline of the police was eventually broken by the latter, after a series of correspondence between the Ministries of Justice, Economy and Higher Education, Science and Technology to establish the definition of an operator. It said that the Electronic Communications Act defines an operator as someone who manages a communications network. This, of course, is not what the web portals do. The MoI has now run out of excuses, and so at the end of February it admitted to the Information Commissioner that in almost all cases of data extraction the police had acted illegally. <p/> But the story does not end here. The MoI has decided to legalise the illegal activities of the police. By amending the Criminal Procedure Act (ZKP). The proposed amendment to the CCP, which is currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination, would thus include service providers in the aforementioned Article 149b(3). According to the interpretation of the MoI, this would also require operators of web portals to provide information to the police only upon written request. This would make the hitherto unlawful practice legal. <p/> But there is one problem with this argument - the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. As the Information Commissioner points out, Article 37 of the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of letters and other communications, and only the law may prescribe that, on the basis of a court decision, the protection of the secrecy of letters and other communications and the inviolability of human privacy may be waived for a certain period of time if this is necessary for the initiation or conduct of a criminal proceeding or for the security of the state. Furthermore, in its 1997 decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is not only the content of the communication, i.e. the content of a letter, that is guaranteed, but also the circumstances of the communication, i.e. who communicated with whom and when. Thus, information about who accessed or commented on an internet portal is also constitutionally protected communication data. The police can therefore only obtain it by court order, no matter what law they write. This is because the Constitution, as the supreme law, is above the law. And given the experience of the Yugoslav secret services, it is understandable why the Constitution is so strict about obtaining communications data. <p/> The intentions of the police or the Ministry of the Interior in amending the Criminal Procedure Act are therefore worrying. Not so much from the point of view of the authorities' desire to make it easier to obtain data on the readers of online portals, but because of the intention to blatantly flout constitutional provisions. The latter are the cornerstone of the rule of law, and trampling on them puts us as a society in great danger. <p/> Therefore, if law enforcement authorities wish to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, they should pursue this desire through legal channels. By proposing an amendment to the Constitution. This route is, of course, infinitely more difficult than amending the law - it requires the consent of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. But it is the only permissible one. And it is the only one that would trigger a proper public debate on the proposed amendments. <p/> If the proposed amendment to the CPC were nevertheless adopted, and the police then started to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, in violation of constitutional provisions, we would face another problem. Evidence obtained in this way will not be taken into account by the courts, as it will have been obtained illegally. For example, the actors in the Balkan Warrior case were acquitted because of illegally obtained evidence. In court, the police were unable to explain how they obtained the telephone numbers of the defendants, who were then wiretapped. The numbers were not made public. Under the Constitution, it would have had to prove that it had obtained them legally - either by court order from the mobile phone operator or by some other legal means, such as from police colleagues. The judges then ruled as they were obliged to do under the Constitution and the law. They threw out the illegally obtained wiretaps and acquitted most of the defendants. According to the then Director of the Criminal Police Directorate, Jurij Fermet, the police were ""shocked"" by the verdict. Well, history is repeating itself now, and new shocks seem to be just around the next corner.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
675,"When is it time to renovate the roof? <p/> The roof is a key structural element that protects the building from the elements (rain, snow, hail, sun, wind). The quality of the roof has a direct impact on the durability of the building and the living conditions inside, which is particularly important for living in a loft. <Once it no longer meets these requirements, it is time to renovate. But every leak does not mean that the whole roof has to be replaced. What to do if the roof starts leaking? <p/> Reasons to renovate your roof <p/> Making repairs due to inadequate construction or renovation work <p/> Major roof damage due to natural disasters (windstorms, hail, etc.) <p/> Rehabilitation or reconstruction <p/> We can only repair part of the roof covering. However, if the roof is worn out or requires work such as modification of the roof structure to make extensions (to gain additional roof space) or to change the appearance of the roof for aesthetic reasons, reconstruction makes the most sense. <p/> How much will a roof renovation cost <p/> The price of a roof renovation depends primarily on the type of roofing material and its price. Prices for roofing material without installation start at: <p/> €7/m2 for concrete and bitumen roofing, <p/> €8/m2 for brick roofing, <p/> €10/m2 for metal roofing <p/> Installation costs €15-20/m2. If the roofing has to be replaced in its entirety, in addition to the price for the roofing and the installation, we have to take into account the additional works that affect the price of replacing the roofing: dismantling, removal to a landfill, the condition of the wooden structure, the other roof elements (flashings, gutters, vents, etc.). <p/> Example of a roof replacement price calculation <p/> For a 150m2 gable roof replacement (brick tiles), we will charge approximately €30/m2 for materials and installation, i.e. a total of €4500/m2. <p/> If the replacement also includes the installation of a vapour barrier, dismantling and removal of the old roofing material, this means an additional cost of at least €1000. <p/> Don't forget about the building permit <p/> Replacing the roof and roofing is maintenance work and therefore does not require a building permit, as long as it is a structural renovation that does not change the size and shape of the building.

The remainder of the appeal is dismissed and the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance is upheld in part and unchanged. <The parties are ordered to bear their own costs of the appeal. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the applicant seeking an order that the defendant account to her for the gross amount of EUR 3 505,04 in respect of the underpayment of the salary allowance, pay the prescribed taxes and contributions and then pay to her the net sums, together with statutory default interest on the net sums on the gross basis, as set out in paragraph I/1 of the operative part of the judgment. Dismisses the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings (paragraph I/2 of the operative part of the judgment) and orders the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings in the sum of EUR 729,96 to the defendant within 15 days (paragraph II of the operative part of the judgment). <p/> The applicant timely appeals against the judgment on all grounds of appeal under Article 338(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Gazette of the RS, No 26/99 et seq.) and requests the Court of Appeal to uphold its appeal and to alter the judgment under appeal by granting the application in full and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment is based, according to the applicant, on an incorrect and incomplete finding of fact and on an error of substantive law. In the light of the clear statutory provisions, the applicant should have been paid 100 % of the allowance for the time spent waiting for homeworking. The defendant issued the applicant with an order to wait for work at home because it did not have suitable work for her. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 or the defendant's decision of 25 May 2001, she cannot, in her view, be denied the right to the difference since, during the period at issue, that is to say, from April 2005 to July 2007, the compensation for the time spent waiting for work was governed by the Labour Relations Act (LSA, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 42/2002 et seq.). The decision of 31.1.2003 of the ZPIZ did not, by anything in the operative part of the decision, decide that the compensation was 80 %, but only that it was compensation for the time spent waiting for work from 7.7.2001 onwards in the amount of SIT 71 011,61. The 80 % allowance was decided by the defendant by decision of 25.5.2001, against which decision the applicant had no grounds for appeal, since ZDR-02 was not yet in force and, moreover, that decision was not based on the provisions of the Social Insurance Act or the Social Insurance Act, but on Article 34 of the sectoral collective agreement. <p/> The appeal also challenges the decision on costs. The Court of First Instance held five main hearings, at which it took evidence and heard both parties on two occasions, and it was only after that that it decided that the claim was unfounded and could therefore have ordered that each party should bear its own costs. However, if the applicant had to pay any costs to the defendant, the Court of First Instance could have awarded the defendant only one award for the proceedings under No 3012, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance had reopened the main hearing, and the appellant therefore proposes that the Court of Appeal should make a decision as to the costs of the proceedings in such a way that each party should bear its own costs or that the costs awarded to the defendant should be reduced. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant contested the grounds of appeal as unfounded and requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal and to order the applicant to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal. <p/> The appeal is partly well founded. <p/> The Court of Appeal examined the judgment under appeal within the limits of the grounds of appeal raised, taking into account, on its own motion, the substantive breaches of the provisions of Article 350(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No 26/99 et seq.) 1.points 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11, with the exception of the existence and correctness of the authorisation to proceed before the court of first instance, and points 12 and 14 of the second paragraph of Article 339 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the correct application of substantive law. In that examination, the Court of First Instance found that the Court of First Instance had not committed any of the substantive infringements of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure which the Court of Appeal is required to take into account of its own motion. It also correctly applied the substantive law to the facts correctly and fully established and only the decision on costs was partially erroneous, as will be explained below. <p/> The Court of Appeal fully agrees with the legal and factual grounds of the contested judgment of the Court of First Instance (with the exception of the decision on costs), and therefore does not repeat them and, as regards the grounds of appeal which are of decisive importance pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 360(1) of the ECHR, the Court of First Instance does not rely on them in the present case. <p/> The Court of First Instance correctly found that the applicant was entitled, in view of her ability to work, to a wage allowance for the period of waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-1, Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, No. 1, item 360, as amended). No ... of 4 October 2000, in conjunction with the decision of the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A. No ... of 27 March 2001, she was classified in category III of disability due to the effects of the disease and with the right to assignment or employment in other suitable work of a physically lighter nature from 29 September 2000 onwards. The applicant was awarded compensation by decision of the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A., No ... of 31 January 2003, which provided that the employer was to pay the applicant's salary compensation at its own expense. The Employment Relations Act (ZDR, Official Gazette of the RS, No 42/2002) had indeed entered into force before that decision was issued, but the essential point is that the applicant had already acquired the right before that date, and that decision therefore conferred on her the right to wage compensation for the period of her waiting for assignment to another suitable job as from 7.7.2001, on the basis of the provisions of the ZPIZ-1 and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos 12/92 to 54/98). Pursuant to Article 397 of the ZPIZ-1, beneficiaries of rights on the basis of residual capacity for work established under the regulations applicable until the date laid down in Article 446 of this Law, which is 1 January 2003, shall retain those rights after that date, with the proviso that the cash benefits shall be adjusted as pensions are adjusted. The applicant has always been a category III invalid, but it was only by decision of 26.10.2009 that she was classified as a category I invalid as a result of illness from 9.4.2009 and was granted the right to an invalidity pension from 1.5.2009. The appellant's claims that the Court of First Instance failed to establish the facts in full and erred in the application of the substantive law are therefore unfounded. <p/> The Court of Appeal adds that even an appeal by the applicant against the decision of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 would not alter the fact that the applicant has acquired the right to a benefit under the rules on pension and invalidity insurance and is therefore not entitled to a benefit under the ZDR. The appellant's submissions that the amount of the applicant's allowance was fixed by the defendant by decision of 25 May 2001 are also unfounded, since the amount of the allowance was fixed by a decision of the ZPIZ of 31 January 2003 in the amount of SIT 71 011,61 per month. In accordance with Article 137 of the ZPIZ, in conjunction with Article 48 of the ZPIZ-1, the minimum pension base was taken as the basis on which the salary allowance for the period of waiting for employment or assignment to other suitable work was calculated, at a rate of 80 %, and the allowance thus calculated was adjusted in the same way as the pensions and amounted to SIT 71 011,61 as from 7.7.2001. <p/> On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of First Instance correctly rejected the applicant's claim for payment of the difference between the amount of compensation received for the period of waiting for work, which was 80 % of the basic amount, and 100 % of the amount of compensation under Article 137 of the Labour Code. <p/> The appellant, however, submits that the Court of First Instance erred in its assessment of the defendant's necessary legal costs, which the appellant is liable to reimburse. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance reopened the main hearing, the defendant is entitled, pursuant to Tariff No 3012 of the Law on the Tariff of Lawyers (Law on the Tariff of Lawyers, Official Gazette of the RS 67/2008), to only one hearing fee, and the Court of Appeal therefore reduced the amount of the costs awarded to EUR 513,00, namely one hearing fee of EUR 190,80 and VAT of 20 % on that amount. However, the Court of First Instance had no basis for deciding, as the appeal suggests, that each party should bear its own costs, since the applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings. <p/> In the light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal in part in so far as it related to the decision on the costs of the appeal and reduced the amount awarded to EUR 513,00 (Article 351(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 358(5) of the Civil Procedure Code), dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance in the remaining part (Article 353 of the Civil Procedure Code), without any change in that amount. <p/> The applicant was only partially successful in its appeal and the Court of Appeal therefore decided, pursuant to Article 154(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the same Act, that it should bear its own costs of the appeal. The defendant is ordered to bear its own costs of the response to the appeal, since it did not contribute substantially to the decision (Article 155(1) in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the CPC).",Legal,test

Mathematics is a big problem for many schoolchildren and they may need help from an expert to learn it. Maybe it is just a particular subject that is giving him difficulty, or whatever, and we are not confident enough in our own knowledge to be able to help him. And so we decide to use tutoring, which is usually the best possible solution and the appropriate help in this kind of situation. The great thing about tuition is that the instructor pays individual attention to the child, takes the time to look at what the difficulties are and makes a learning plan so that the material becomes clear and is understood as soon as possible. Whether the child is in primary school, secondary school or perhaps already studying. It is definitely a great way to help your child to get the knowledge they need and are currently lacking. What's also good about tuition is that the instructors identify the needs of the child and also have the right way or approach to teach them the most in a relatively short time. Of course, this is a great opportunity for those whose knowledge is deficient in a particular subject. When a child attends primary school, maths is usually the most pressing problem and, in general, if it is a child who is not good at maths in general, we will look for maths tuition for primary school. If we take on the task ourselves and want to help our child, we will surely find that primary school is not as easy as we once thought.

Now that I see you're not as stubborn as lightning, please send me more bullets and David and I will give you an unbiased first hand assessment of the quality after a thorough examination... <p/> (16-01-2017, 21:11)apple Written by: I'd pretty much forgotten about those Arma bullets...but the early findings are this. The bullet has a harder core and consequently there is less copper coating, Los abandoned this some time ago and has the opposite...Tolerances, weight within normal limits, but on every bullet in the box, there is a matrix imprint at the transition of the radius to the tip, this is yet to be corrected, Los had the same problem and now it is solved, because such a bullet can not go abroad................................................................................. Nothing special in shooting, loading, of course for something more I would use rest, but for ipsc not even...as a type of bullet RN clean ok product. Price of bullets...wins the Moose, bold <p/> And this is the thorough test for you that you were raving about a page back? Ma dej... A 25,000 shus/year man is expected to have a concrete test, not to wash you. <p/> Mozakar has no time or else he won't reach the 25,000 norm this year <p/> Otherwise, a month and a half ago I found about 45 rounds of 147 grain in a package of 124 grain LOS 9mm kugels, FP. So even the LOS big-bore will probably have to learn, if nothing else, how to pack kugels. Price for mortals through official channels-> I don't know if LOS wins. 32€ vs 34€, at Rebec. <p/> Yeah well it says if you read it...conclusions at a glance I don't know what you expect, the point is said I have no intention of bothering with this really...why don't you give it a try yourself <p/> Great no...you'll have to learn a lot too, until then buy Arma bullets.... <p/> No I didn't buy them, if you're interested. I've bought quite a lot of LOS already, and I'm not going to stop because of this mistake. It just happens. You don't have to be a smartass like you to praise one, you probably get a ton of it for free. And especially in the Armaforce thread, when someone asked about those bullets, not the LOS. I get on LOS' nerves sometimes just because of your stupid crap. <p/> Just a quick comparison of one and the other was made, I gave my findings, but if you take that as bragging I can't help you, a hundred people are a hundred wonders <p/> Yeah well, it says here, if you read....you're the one bitching about a thorough test not me.So don't throw your fake tests at me. <p/> But you're not happy with the whole world, come on, be a little positive sometime, what is it man, what do you want to prove... I gave my findings, wrote that I had no intention of dealing with it and suggested that you find out for yourself if it's in your interest... my answer was not to your liking, you gave me a minus, you got it back... here's the way it goes in the new year <p/> The Master made the only sensible comment. The others are well below the level. I thought this was typical of jagras. But I see you are cutting us down. Armaforce made a big mistake by posting the LOS pictures. These are just marketing ploys of modern entrepreneurs. Any publicity is good, even if it is negative. It is naive to think that this was a mistake. If they know how to package the bullets (excellent packaging) then they should know how to present them to the shooters. This work was then done free of charge by Tine. You are asking for a detailed test from Apple. Why would the competition test their bullets at all? You are the top experts here on the pile. And yet you dispute Apple's brief quick findings. I am happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers my questions. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you? <p/> Ah, I told you why ipsc is considered the king of marksmanship...because of the strict adherence to the rules and the immediate DQ at the slightest violation of them...the marksmanship of the individual has nothing to do with it, the shooters who take part in these competitions are all kings, as you rightly pointed out, thank you thank you...they know how to handle their weapons according to the accepted rules, because there is no other way to do it. I know that for someone who hasn't been to these competitions it's completely alien, how else to understand posting an unacceptable video where you have your finger on the trigger when loading and unloading the gun.... Ps the video is under...[adjustable sights for rexs] but it would be better if it wasn't... if you're still wondering what you're hoping for the kings will explain :))) <p/> Apple if you look very well the finger is not on the trigger.. So I don't see anything controversial..look well the finger was not on the trigger But I told you that you are the only ""king"" who is bullshitting about IPSC being oh and all.. If you were shooting a precision shooter this discipline would be the King of Shooting... As for Los...I see that whoever comes to the market with bullets you spit on them and bullshit them with nonsense comments....You could behave more appropriately for your age...You better be respectful to others on the market,because if David behaved like that the picture would be quite different...Sometimes you really throw shit on the forum and you mumble something but it would be better to bite your tongue...So think a little if your behaviour is ""royal""...You'll have to think about that...<p/> (18-01-2017, 12:36)alojz1 Posted: I'm happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers to me. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you have them? <p/> You're already happy, but Apple is not...So far he has spat on everyone and acts like he's the big i batina at Los... Unfortunately he can't stand that others are trying to launch their bullets on the market... When MiHec started making their bullets it was the same...Only Apple was throwing shit around the forum and acting smart about bullets...as if only Los knows how to make bullets and everyone else is a loser... Come on.... That's why Tine you will never make anything of yourself,because you don't know how to accept competition... You will always be just a man who knows how to screw people over very well,instead of giving some useful information for your years.. <p/> 18-01-2017, 15:06 (This post was last modified on 18-01-2017, 15:12 by alojz1.) <p/> Sandi, about the competition, just this. Everyone has their favourites. The thing with the Jags is that they are always looking for something new, something better. In short, a bullet that always hits without damaging the roast, and the game falls on the spot. And every new one is the best until it happens..... I also have good experience with both other manufacturers here. If anyone asks for an opinion I always praise them. In my opinion they are better than the much vaunted Barnes TTSX. I myself have been using LOS since the beginning. I recently killed an 80kg pig in the thick of it. Drop on the spot. Hit through the heart. Why would I buy an expensive one when this bullet has everything I need. You just have to hit it. But if I'm shooting at paper, it's hard to find a cheaper and more accurate one. And as long as that's the case, this bullet will be in my gun. You guys can keep switching all you want. <p/> I'm not picking on anyone :-P But if folks don't accept my thinking and can't argue back...that's not my problem. Me? prove it? I have nothing to prove. You are already proving yourself...day by day... Yes, you have made the points...but you haven't made the points...that you wrote about...that David and you are going to ""debunk"". In the end, all that comes out of your side is one big....bla....bla....bla....bla... ...blah. <p/>Ma what a clever comment, please. I don't think you can do it. Sessions can't stand anything but his own opinion....some of the sheeple cheerfully follow his lead. He can be a great shot,when he has a gewehr in his hands and has great results, but when he gives answers,he shoots goats....He usually speaks in terms of LOS is the law, or 25,000 shushes/year, IPSC, etc...etc...and that too many times when he has nothing to do with the topic. Let me know, did anyone force him to test? Well, no. Did he force himself to take the test? Well, he did. Someone who is supposed to have a clue about bowling pins, because he works in a bowling pin company, is expected to make a test according to his ""tongue-twister"", not to make a test like one of the yagers in the pub behind the bar would make it. <p/> 18-01-2017, 17:55 (This post was last modified 18-01-2017, 18:02 by alojz1.) <p/> Have you removed the Master's comment? I did mention it, 765Br quotes me now but I can't find it anymore. Did I misread something or are there strange things going on here? <p/> 18-01-2017, 18:12 (This post was last modified: 18-01-2017, 18:36 by apple.) <p/> Precision...will never be a royal discipline because doing things like yours seems to be common there and I started with precision I am no stranger to it...I still hope for every match unlike you who strictly reject ipsc but it would be to your advantage if I learned to behave SAFELY with a weapon. It won't stick...what you're doing in the video is pure DQ. The rule is that your finger must be visibly away from the trigger, it's not with you. It has to be VISIBLY extended at the bolt...with a hook like that you get an instant DQ on the ipsc...not to mention where the finger is after the gun is cocked...on the TRIGGER it could only be there when you are in the target sight The rest I don't care about...I don't have the ability to read people's minds, so I just don't comment on who's who... as for the Arma bullets, I wrote what I observed and I don't see anything else flying in there... <p/> (18-01-2017, 17:55)alojz1 Wrote: Did you retract the Master's comment?

718,"What is it, apart from the understaffing and the overburdening, which is also or mainly administrative, that has broken the bottom of the primary health care barrel? <p/> The 2019 General Agreement exacerbates an unsustainable situation <p/> The 2019 General Agreement sets a new (increased) ceiling for registrations in family medicine outpatient clinics, which are already bursting at the seams with no systemic solutions. And this is very bad news indeed. <p/> The General Agreement, whereby the health 'partners' each year redefine the financial pie for the provision of health services and programmes, does not really have a partnership character, because the strength of the professional arguments is repeatedly undermined by the arguments of power, which in the end seem to have a single denominator: politics, which has nothing to do with health care. Controversial issues are always decided by the government. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions has proposed an annex to the General Agreement ... <p/> That is why the Association of Health Institutions of Slovenia has proposed the adoption of annex number one to the general agreement for this year. With regard to the overload in family medicine clinics in primary health care, where doctors in some health centres are announcing the termination of their employment contracts because there is no other solution on the horizon, this association has proposed a solution quite comparable to the conclusions recently adopted by the annual conference of the Fides doctors' and dentists' trade union. The proposed annex thus, rather surprisingly, puts doctors, their unions and the management of health care institutions on the same side. <p/> The proposal was made by the Association in accordance with the agreement on the suspension of strike activities signed by the Fides union and the government - and already in force in the general agreement for the 2017 and 2018 contract years. According to this agreement, primary care doctors can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach the national average of the headache ratios for each specialty, while family medicine doctors and paediatricians can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach a headache ratio of 1895. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions drafted the annex in accordance with the agreement on the temporary suspension of strike action. <p/> ... the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal <p/> Doctors may decide to take such a step if the employer has not exhausted all the human resources and organisational possibilities that would allow the definition of insured persons - tenders for new recruitments, proposal of the need for new specialisations, subcontracting of doctors, including retired ones, redirection of insured persons of full age from a paediatrician to a family doctor ... <p/> However, at yesterday's meeting, the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year. We are now in a situation in Slovenian healthcare where there is virtually no room for manoeuvre - for the time being in family medicine, but similar stories are unfolding in other branches of medicine too. And since this serious, complex problem is being pointed out not only by doctors or nurses and their unions, but now even by the management of health care institutions, this is a sign that the existing system is not, and can no longer be, a guarantee for the sustainable, high-quality, professional, comprehensive and safe operation of health care - a sign to which we urgently need to react and take immediate action to remedy the situation that has arisen. <p/> The proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year was rejected by the ZZZS Board. <p/> The association is convinced that the agreement between the government and the Fides trade union, enshrined in the agreement on the suspension of strike activities, should be respected - and that if the timetable for reaching the target norm had to be changed in this sense, the signatories to the agreement would have to resume negotiations and redraft the agreement. So what next - apart from the announced activities of primary care doctors? <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted. One is to continue with the annex procedure, but this kind of search for a solution is time-consuming and could drag on until the autumn. There is also another way. The new Minister for Health will have to deal with these problems as soon as he is appointed - and it is not impossible that the partners who are agreeing on the content of the general agreement will not be able to come up with a coherent, possibly even new, proposal to alleviate the acute situation we are witnessing at the moment. I can assure you that the association will be cooperative, because it wants to contribute to a reasonable solution - but if we find ourselves in a situation where emotions and other motives prevail, it will be difficult to find a solution,"" said Marjan Pintar, Director of the Association of Health Care Institutions, speaking to Health Portal. <p/> And what is your message to the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabedr? <p/> What do you expect from the new Health Minister Ales Šabedr?

725,"Change municipality <p/> For a healthier lifestyle and mental health <p/> New health promotion centre in Celje For a healthier lifestyle and mental health Interest in group workshops and individual counselling <p/> Celje, 28 September 2016 - The Together for Health project was implemented at the National Institute of Public Health in 2015 and 2016 with funding from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism. One of the results of the Together for Health project is a new health promotion centre in the Celje Health Centre and the health posts Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna. The centre is aimed at people who are at any risk due to lifestyle, chronic non-communicable diseases or mental health problems. It offers a wide range of free workshops and individual counselling on physical activity, healthy eating, risky drinking, smoking cessation, living with diabetes, relaxation and stress management, and coping with anxiety and depression. This year, from January to mid-September, more than 1600 individuals were involved in health promotion workshops and individual counselling in Celje, Štore, Vojnik and Dobrna. The oldest participant was 96 years old and the youngest 16 years old. <p/> All services are free of charge for the participants, as they are covered by their health insurance entitlements. At the Health Promotion Centre of the Celje Health Centre, participants receive professional support, relevant information and knowledge, and above all, they form attitudes, acquire skills and develop new behavioural patterns for a healthier lifestyle and mental health. Along the way, they can progress and empower themselves, eventually making some lasting changes in their lives in terms of giving up risky habits. And if they are already ill (for example, diabetics), they can live better with a chronic illness with the experience and knowledge from the workshops. ""We provide preventive check-ups in family medicine referral clinics for all adults over 30 years of age. We aim to detect risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases (e.g. high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood sugar, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, risky alcohol consumption) early enough to prevent the onset of the disease. The Together for Health project has provided the Celje Health Centre with a Health Promotion Centre, where appropriately trained professionals provide group workshops and individual counselling to help adults change unhealthy lifestyle habits. We have focused on implementing a community-based approach, especially trying to reach vulnerable groups of the population and reduce inequalities in health care,"" said Dr Jana Govc Eržen, Head of the Expert Group for Prevention and Health Promotion at the Celje Health Centre, Coordinator of the Celje - Healthy City project and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. Marjana Iršič, Head of the Health Promotion Centre at Celje Health Centre, explained. At the Health Promotion Centre in Celje, we have noticed that we have attracted people's interest in our non-medication programmes. Compared to the previous organisation, the new work design also includes vulnerable groups of people in an organised way, for whom some health services were harder to access. As one of the innovations, we have also tested the cooperation with an intercultural mediator for the Albanian-speaking community in Celje."" Vulnerable groups in terms of accessibility to the health system and involvement in prevention programmes include the unemployed, precarious workers, migrants, homeless people, people who use illicit drugs, people with mental health problems, Roma, people with various disabilities and all others who face different barriers to taking care of their health. <p/> The results and benefits of the Together for Health project were presented by health experts and programme users on Wednesday 28 September at the National House in Celje. The new community-based integrative approach to health promotion and prevention was presented by. Alenka Obrul (Director of the Celje Health Care Centre), Dr Jana Govc Eržen (Head of the Prevention and Health Promotion Expert Group at the Celje Health Care Centre and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention), Jožica Maučec Zakotnik (Head of the Centre for Management of Health Promotion and Prevention Programmes at the National Institute for Health Promotion and Health Care and Head of the Together for Health for Adults Project), Dr. Mgr. Polonca Truden Dobrin (Head of the Together for Health project for children and adolescents), Marjana Iršič (Head of the Health Promotion Centre at the Celje Health Centre), Nuša Konec Juričič (Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases Group at the Celje Regional Unit of the NIJZ), Alenka Rumbak (Director of the Celje Unit of the Employment Service), Martin Kač (Karitas), Suzi Kvas (Director of the Socio Health Care Centre). Stanislava Ferjanc (participant in the programme) and Vera Haliti (intercultural mediator) also presented their experiences. <p/> Users of the Celje Health Centre and the health stations of Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna therefore have the opportunity to take part in one of the three basic workshops: Healthy Living, Am I Fit and Relaxation Techniques. There are also modules on high blood sugar, high fats, type 2 diabetes and physical fitness. These workshops and modules are followed by a variety of in-depth sessions. Among the possible programmes are three in-depth psychoeducational workshops to support mental health: Coping with Stress, Support for Coping with Depression and Support for Coping with Anxiety. ""The workshops provide participants with information on the link between physical and mental functioning, why certain problems occur and what they can do to improve their own health. In a small group, they have the opportunity to share experiences and ask what they are interested in. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to physical or mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to mental health that makes it harder for many people to seek help - but I think that is slowly changing too. More and more people are recognising the importance of getting information and skills for their own health,"" said Maruša Naglič, psychologist and psychoeducational workshop leader at the Centre for Health Promotion. <p/> Health Promotion Centres, like the one in Celje, are already operating in Sevnica and Vrhnika. In the Together for Health project, led by Jožica Maučec Zakotnik in the field of adult health, the National Institute for Public Health upgraded the existing health education centres both in terms of organisation and content. The approaches are designed to respond to people's needs, with a practical focus on empowerment for long-term lifestyle changes that can lead individuals to better health and well-being. The new design, based on community engagement and the coordinated mobilisation of a wide range of local partners, makes it possible to strengthen care for individual and public health, optimise the use of resources for health promotion and prevention, ensure the quality of staff and programmes, and improve health indicators for the future. The National Institute of Public Health stressed that the experience gained so far from the pilot programmes confirms the rationale for introducing health promotion centres in other health centres. Following the completion of the Together for Health project, the Health Promotion Centre in Celje is fully supported by the National Health Insurance Fund. <p/> *** <p/> Additional information.

The solution is HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a treatment that uses focused high-intensity ultrasound technology to heat tissue at a specific depth with extreme, surgical precision, resulting in a direct lifting effect. It is the world's first wrinkle smoother, and depending on the depth of the wrinkle, it is possible to lift the eyelids by 3-4 mm, reduce the pores on the face, firm and lift cheekbones, etc. However, in cases where the eyelid is drooping due to nerve damage or is congenital, the device cannot achieve the changes and surgery is required. Even very pronounced under-eye bags can be reduced, but they cannot be completely eliminated with one treatment. <p/> The excellent results of the HIFU treatment cannot be achieved with any other device or treatment, nor with radiofrequency, mesotherapy or dermapen. However, realistic expectations are necessary, because the kind of taut face you see on Hollywood celebrities is the result of expensive surgical procedures, without which such extreme results cannot be achieved. <p/> The HIFU treatment is performed by a trained beautician who also provides training on this treatment for beauty salons throughout Croatia. So far, she has ""beautified"" more than 150 women from Croatia and Slovenia, so you too can find out why it is worth visiting the Tajna ljepote salon for facial rejuvenation. <p/> This revolutionary and unique device can: completely remove forehead wrinkles, lift eyebrows by 3-4 mm (by lifting the upper eyelids), soften or completely remove wrinkles around the eyes, soften or completely remove under-eye bags, tighten enlarged pores, firm and lift cheekbones, soften or completely remove nasolabial folds and nasolabial folds between the nose and the lip, tighten the skin of the neck, tighten and remove the chin, tighten the skin of the décolletage. <p/> Ultrasound Rejuvenation Treatment High-intensity ultrasound generates large amounts of collagen.

All of this takes place on the server where all the information that will be displayed on our website is located. This information can be in different sizes, shapes and formats - but it all adds up to the content of our site that we will show to the whole web. If you're new to web hosting, this article will introduce you to the most basic elements that are good to know. <p/> Table of Contents <p/> It all happens on the server <p/> First, let's take a look at what a server is. It's a powerful computer that has only one purpose - to host our website to which we connect via a domain. When buying web hosting we will have a few options to choose from. These options are: <p/> Server type <p/> Server capacity <p/> Server location <p/> Buying a domain <p/> If you are just starting out in business you may not be aware of all of the options listed above. We can get lost in all the different types of web hosting or server because we have never come across these concepts. It is important to realise that we need the right power and bandwidth of a hosting package to handle the traffic to our website. <p/> Different types of hosting <p/> Web hosting and servers come in many configurations. These configurations are made for different website profiles. The most common are: <p/> Shared hosting <p/> The most common way of running websites that do not need much power. In this case, the server hosts dozens or hundreds of different websites, all sharing the capacity of the server itself. This is most recommended for small webshops and projects where high power is not required. <p/> VPS hosting <p/> By far the most popular way of hosting websites. VPS hosting means that our website runs in a virtual environment. It is similar to shared hosting, except that we lease our own server capacity, but we don't share it with anyone. In addition, our files are completely secure because, although they are on the same system, they are physically separated from other users. <p/> Dedicated hosting <p/> Large companies and projects that have a lot of traffic need dedicated web hosting. Here, we lease an entire server for our use, putting all the power at our disposal.

During its existence, it has hosted some of the leading names in high-tech, science and art, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro, Honda Robotics, Stelarc, Victoria Vesna, as well as local artists such as Robertina Šebjanič, Srečo Dragan and Laibach. <p/> The tenth anniversary was also an opportunity to take stock of the work done and to look to the future of the festival, which is one of only three of its kind that the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia recognises as being of high quality and renown, and for this reason also provides financial support for its implementation. In the spirit of the times and the development of both visual culture and technology, the festival's management decided to focus on virtual worlds and 3D environments. <p/> One of the flagship projects this year is the Brain Computer Hackathon, the first event of its kind in Slovenia. In addition, the Tree project, jointly developed by American artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter, is also worth mentioning. The project uses new technologies and 3D environments for an engaging approach to a very topical issue, which environmental protection and climate change certainly are. Using 3D environments, haptic interfaces and sound effects, the artists put us in the position of a tree in a tropical rainforest. We can feel how the tree grows in its environment and how it is affected by climatic conditions. The project was presented at the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos and attracted a lot of interest among the influencers gathered there. <p/> Also working with virtual worlds is British artist Nicola Plant, who will be presenting her project Parallax at the festival, which shares the thoughts of individual visitors in a virtual environment with all other visitors by sensing their movements and facial expressions, testing the possibilities of non-verbal communication between people in a world that is increasingly moving towards virtual reality. Borders in the digital environment are also being broken down by Bulgarian new media artist Ivan Petkov, who will present his installation My Country, Your Country, which allows visitors to draw the borders of real or fictional countries on the screen themselves, highlighting the fact that borders are in fact an artificial construct of the human mind and not something natural. <p/> While showcasing global productions, the festival does not neglect local new media artists. This year, among others, Saša Nemec, with the project Inside/Outside, and Boštjan Čadež, with the VR installation PD4, will be presented.",News,test
761,"Interview published in the professional magazine Isis, the newsletter of the Medical Chamber of Slovenia, January 2008 (27) <p/> On the occasion of the two-thousandth issue of the ZIB Bulletin <p/> Interview with Anka Štrukelj Fras, Editor <p/> Question. What is your experience? <p/> Answer. We can still write down what we did at the beginning when we invited readers to subscribe: the ZIB Bulletin is a daily online publication for healthcare needs. It is original, up-to-date, transparent, concise and independent. The motto of the ZIB Bulletin is Saving Time. It has been our experience that ZIB, as a miniature electronic publication consisting of short articles and lists of relevant documents and media releases, without images and enticing graphic supplements, has gained weight over the years. The more the pages of the World Wide Web are literally whittled down by these additions. In the face of the latter, content often becomes secondary or, even if it is good, awaits the reader locked behind a magic web door that takes time and money to open. Our readers, in particular, do not have time to spare. They include almost all the managers of Slovenian national, regional and local health institutions - hospitals, health centres, pharmacies, health care institutions and companies. They receive the daily ZIB in the form of an e-mail at night and usually read it in the morning. Or as Igor Vuk, Director of the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia's regional unit in Novogoriz, told us on the occasion of the 1000th issue: 'For some people, drinking coffee is their first and favourite morning task. For me, it's checking out your condensed health care and health insurance news."" An encouraging greeting and we wish it still applies. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. For example, for the 1000th issue, we rewarded readers with a slightly redesigned page and made it possible to read the content in a single column, which makes it easier to read the bulletin on the screen. We then started to offer a Little ZIB in the mornings with a selection of media articles, which brings together selected media stories of the day and is a ""preview"" of the Media section of the forthcoming Bulletin, which will be published the following day. Ahead of the 2,000th issue, we have given readers direct access to public procurement documents and the Official Journal. And there will be more in the future. <p/> Question: Healthcare is often surrounded by affairs, which the media construct in different ways, from objective reporting to the presentation of less and more spicy facts or even interest-biased supplements. How do you bring the reporting of these affairs into the otherwise calm and sometimes even a little dignified ZIB? <p/> Answer. The editor is too much of a journalist to manage such a thing. It is made up of facts, respect and knowledge of the field of health and the people involved in it in a variety of ways. These three things - facts, the field and the people - are interwoven in complex patterns that are not always invented by individual people, but ripple through the times in which they are created. <p/> To put this into words, the ZIB editorial team consistently avoids using pejorative words and phrases in published articles. Very often, it is with bad language that affairs are glossed over in the media. They invite exotic reading as exotic exotica, obscuring or even distorting the essence of the actual phenomenon or event. And when you shake off the ""leaves"", what remains is what it is. Facts are not always pretty, and the problems we report on are not, as a rule, pretty. But if they are presented as they are, they are more likely to be solved or eliminated by those to whom they refer. <p/> Question: A particularly topical issue in healthcare at the moment - and one that ZIB has written about on several occasions - is that of information related to medicines, where there is a necessary, but not easily identifiable, boundary between information and advertising. Is it even definable? <p/> Answer: There is no precise boundary. There is good information in good advertising and there is bad information in bad advertising. The inner self can judge what is important, even in this respect. At Zib, we help ourselves by consistently citing the sources of information for each article. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. Well, we have also made a little Zib advertising duck, with a yellow beak, inviting people to read information about what ZIB offers and who it is for. The printed Health Calendar also bears our logo. That's all there is to it in terms of publicity. As the Health Calendar is constantly expanding, the latest version is kept up-to-date in the Materials on the subscription page. For the two-thousandth issue, the Health Calendar has gone to the open page as a gift to potential subscribers and readers. <p/> Question. Just like, for example, in a TV diary there is a whole world day. How do you fit this increasingly loud and multi-sensory event into a few pages? <p/> Answer. This is the simple secret of Zib's Time Saving motto. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer: They are not raining. They come in drops, but they do not dry up.",Other,test

817,"""The police, with their dedicated work in unenviable conditions, continue to prove that the almost impossible is still possible."" <p/> To commemorate the determined resistance of the militiamen and to protect our own country and our people, we police officers have chosen 27 June as our national day. Police Day is celebrated every year. This year's main ceremony, which commemorated the independence role of Slovenian militiamen, took place today, 27 June 2014, at the Police Academy. <p/> The ceremony was attended by the Police leadership, award recipients and distinguished guests, as well as by the families of fallen police officers who lost their lives in the war for the independence of Slovenia, and by police officers who were wounded at the time. <p/> Today, the Slovenian Police is celebrating more than twenty years of history. ""In all these years we have become a well-organised and efficient institution. But today, unfortunately, without modern equipment, without sufficient staff, in old vehicles and facilities, it is stagnant. /.../ Despite the fact that the police have been driven by the reserve for quite some time now, we have recorded good operational successes in the past period,"" said Stanislav Veniger, Director General of the Police, in his speech. <He added that ""we are living in a time when the demands of global security require us to move more decisively beyond the 'security in your own backyard' mentality. The world is getting smaller and smaller and borders are no longer impermeable. /.../ Fortunately, Slovenia is still considered a country with a high level of security. But security is not a given and it does not come for free. It takes a lot of hard work by dedicated, under-rewarded and stressed police officers. No one entered the police ranks with the idea of getting rich. But the motivation to work, derived solely from a sense of belonging and mission, is slowly losing its power. /.../ The police are certainly an important link in ensuring security, but they are not the only link. I am pleased to see that other authorities, also responsible for security, have begun to play their part more vigorously."" <p/> The Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, also addressed the gathering. He said that today, twenty-three years after independence, we could say that Slovenians are more satisfied with our police than we are with our country in general. ""The police do not have the ups and downs of the state, but they are a bird in the sky. For many years it has enjoyed a high reputation among citizens, providing people with a sense of order, stability and security. Recently, more than before, it must be admitted, there is also a feeling that we are all really equal before the law. <p/> Today, the police are not afraid of anyone, but all those who have robbed the Slovenes and stolen Slovenia from them tremble before them. The police is a stable institution with tradition and quality leadership. As an expert on the state administration, I can say this. /.../ I have to say that one of the things that surprised me most positively was the extremely modern approach to governance and management. I have come to realise that there is, in fact, positive selection in the police in the choice of management staff. /.../ Modern methods of leadership and management, the introduction of good practices, the elimination of bureaucratic matters within the system, the establishment of smart performance indicators. These are all successes of which any organisation can be proud. Therefore, the leadership of the police force deserves a lot of respect and thanks for leading the police in the right direction. But leaders cannot achieve their goals without capable and dedicated colleagues, and the credit for the success of the police goes to every police officer who puts in the effort and achieves the expected results. So congratulations to all of you."" <p/> This year we are celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Europol, and the Ljubljana Mounted Police Station, which we recently celebrated, is celebrating its anniversary. For the 66th year, the Police Orchestra has been delighting us with its delicate sound. Under the baton of Tomaž Kmetič, it once again enriched our ceremony. <p/> At ceremonies held throughout the country these days, meritorious police employees are awarded in their respective police units for their contribution to the promotion of safety culture and for their merits and contribution to the development and strengthening of safety, and individuals from other countries and other organisations are presented with police badges of cooperation. The highest police awards were presented at today's ceremony by the Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, and the Director General of the Police, Stanislav Veniger. <p/> The Golden Police Cooperation Badge was awarded to Josef Erhard of the German Police for excellent cooperation in the field of car crime over many years and to the Slovenian Armed Forces for excellent cooperation over many years, which undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the readiness to carry out the operational tasks of the police. The award was received by the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, Major General Dobran Božič. <p/> The Golden Police Shield was awarded to Martin Poharc from the Celje Police Directorate, Dean Jurič from the Koper Police Directorate and Vojko Rupnik from the Kranj Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with a Bronze Star was awarded to Marjan Anzeljc from the Police Specialities Administration, Simon Velički, Director of the Kranj Police Directorate and Mag. Stanislav Vrečar, Director of the Ljubljana Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with the Silver Star was awarded to Andrej Rupnik from the Office of the Director General of the Police. <p/> The Great Shield of the Police with a gold star was awarded to the Special Police Unit of the General Police Directorate, on whose behalf the award was accepted by its Commander Rado Abutovič, <p/> while the highest award of the Police, a firearm, was awarded to Franc Sablič, Director of the National Forensic Laboratory. <p/> We would like to congratulate all the award winners for their outstanding contribution to the safety of citizens and the reputation of the Slovenian Police. <p/> Today was also the Police Open Day, where we prepared an attractive presentation of the Slovenian Police for all participants and visitors. There was great enthusiasm for the passing parade of mounted police officers and their noble assistants, as well as for the demonstration of helicopter rescue, such as that carried out on many occasions by the crews of the Air Police Unit, who took part in the rescue of people in the recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a police helicopter. <p/> Later, it was possible to see up close what a police helicopter looks like, as well as how a crime scene investigation van is equipped, and what the so-called ""blinda"", which is used to transport protected persons, looks like. We also displayed a mobile police station and a Schengen bus, as well as a speed enforcement vehicle on the motorway, the so-called provido. <p/> The children were particularly interested in the equipment of the police officers of the Special Police Unit. They were fascinated by their helmets, shields and attractive stories from the protection of various public events. <p/> The younger visitors, in particular, were most excited to see the motorcycle police officers and to take photos on their white and blue motorcycles, as well as the police service dog handlers with their trained four-legged friends, and the mascot of Constable Leon.",News,test

But only by a percent or two. But it's true that Mafia is an older game than VC. Maybe the next GTA will even catch up. But for once, Mafia is better for me. <p/> yes, in mafia it's a pain in the ass when you shoot a thomson for half an hour to kill a mafioso with a shkifarska and then shoot three times to kill him!!! cars go like tractors but it's true that mafia has the advantage that you can learn how to steal cars first!!! and when you walk by a bayti you'll see that everything is a bit strange but when it comes to GTA you can copy bayti!!!not to mention the fact that you drive a car in a skiff, and when you're not in the car, the skiff can see exactly how much you're driving when they had radar even back then!!! and you don't even have to get on a boat, but you still drive around!!! if I had more time, I'd be happy to discuss what mistakes there are in the mafia, and besides, GTA isn't without its faults!!!!!! so that you don't think that I'm defending GTA when you're at the beginning of the game and when you're on the phone, the phone is huge and when you're on the phone, you can also k**** into cars after having sex, and you can k**** it !!! so I like GTA better!!! maybe mafia 2 will be better than GTA and probably it will be!!! but when there will be a new GTA, it seems to me that mafia will be a lot of slapstick!!!!!!! we'll see!!!GTA IS THE LAW <p/> yeah you forget that sometimes the cars were really so slow and after the end you get better and very fast cars if you turn mafia 100% you get one car called crazy horse and it's impossible to drive because it's fast... besides you can put it on the back tyres... CRAZY <p/> yes angel you are right,if you turn around the game itself and the Lucas Bertone quests and Free Ride Extreme the game is even more interesting <p/> gee I can't stand to see your pointless posts comparing mafia to vice city. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. each has its own story and each takes place in a different time, which also explains the cars and their speeds. bOy; no spiel is without its faults, and mafia is also an older spiel, about 1 year old, so please. not with such meaningless comments!!!! <p/> didn't you even read it or did you lose your glasses???? i wrote that in GTA their phone is huge so before you write anything you can even read it!!!!and i didn't say that GTA is bug free but we are at the end of 2003 not 2222!!!!",Forum,test
826,"I would like to know a couple of things about cat acne, if anyone has any more experience. mainly I know about the so called black dots under the chin, which are supposed to be cat acne or fungus? I know it can be done elsewhere on the body. <p/> I have seen the occasional spot on the chin in one of our cats, but now I have a different problem. fergie has these spots just under her nose, just on one side, and on her nose, mostly on the same side. around her nostril, if you can imagine. let me say that she eats quite stump-eating, and a lot of the time her nose helps with things, so it seems to me that this could be the cause of this outbreak around the nostril.... <p/> yesterday I cleaned that area with splivasept and water and it all went away under the snout, the skin was red there, today it's better... it's healing. there's one part on the snout that remains. instead of having a nice coat there, she has a small scab that doesn't come off with washing. of course I don't think to rub it too much, because it's extremely uncomfortable for her if I do that. <p/> I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to proceed? of course I can take her to the vet, that's not a problem... but I understandably try to avoid it if I can, because I don't want to upset the cat if I don't really have to. <p/> In my opinion it's just dirt, and when it dries it can stick so firmly to the skin that it's yikes. I just find it odd that it's so noticeable, because Fergie isn't white around the snot. I suggest just tapping the spot several times in a row with a soaked cotton wool, waiting a little each time, and then gently removing. A one-off treatment will almost certainly not get it all off, so keep repeating it, but preferably not on the same day, so that you forget the maca a little in between. <p/> yes, it's black up there, yes, I looked at it so close I could see it when you put your finger over it, but you can still feel that little spot. <p/> I think it will go slowly, yes, at least it hasn't gone back to where it was before <p/> When I still had temporaries, I used to dab their acne (even in the spot you described, it was usually) with colloidal silver on a cotton wool a couple of times a day...then the scab came off, peeled off and everything was ok underneath. <p/> u yeah, I didn't think of it right away, but it's good stuff! i'll try to get it now <p/> but otherwise it's pretty good! one little thing is still on the top of the snot, the rest looks good. i was actually thinking that there's a chance that they scratched each other and that's what caused the scab and the acne... what do i know. <p/> now I have another problem, because she scratched her ear too fergie doesn't scratch very gently, if she gets scratched she usually scratches it clean to the fullest, so she slaughters herself if she has to <p/> she gets rid of them for a couple of months. And they do it again. And then we repeat the treatment again and it's ok, until next time. They don't bother him, they don't hurt, they don't spread. They always appear on his chin. We haven't had more than 4 months of peace from them since he was caught. He is a special little guy who needs a little more ""maintenance"", he is just worth it.

839,"Home - Ski Jumping - News - Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> 17.03.2021 <p/> Ahead of the Ski Jumping World Cup season finale, which will take place at the Goriška Brothers Aerodrome next week, the representatives of OK Planica have summarised their thoughts and views. <p/> Enzo Smrekar, President of SZS and President of OK Planica <p/> After three successful World Championships in Slovenia and after all three World Cup competitions, we are now looking forward to the end of the season with the final in Planica. We are expecting all the teams, a great finish and a top organisation. Unfortunately, there will be no spectators again, hopefully for the last time. What is important is that we are working hard to partially cover the loss from the cancelled race last March. The expectation is that this event will also work with a positive zero and will partly contribute to covering the seasonal shortfall. <p/> I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal sponsors. Without them, it would not have been possible. Thanks also to all the workers and staff who work with great enthusiasm to ensure that our matches are held to a high standard. And of course, thanks to OK Planica, which oversees all of this and takes care of the event itself. I am sure that the media and all the teams will feel welcome, even though the precautions are strict. They are dictated by the profession on the one hand and by the precaution that has marked us this year as one of the top World Cup race organisers where there have never been any infections or cancellations. <p/> As we were wrapping up the World Championships in December, our minds were already somewhat on the World Cup in March. At that time, we imagined that we would now be able to welcome the first live spectators in the valley below Ponce. Unfortunately, even after all these months, and especially after the intense discussions in recent weeks, we can only conclude with sadness that we will not be welcoming spectators this year either, and that the measures that were in place in December are still in force. This means that everyone taking part in this competition will be staying in a so-called snow hut. Two areas will be set up, the so-called green area and the grey area. Protected areas in which the competition will run as smoothly as possible. The media regime will be similar to that in December. It applies both to work in the media centre and in the mixed zone. <p/> We have also worked quite a lot on the idea, which was already alive in December, of spectators watching the Alpine Skiing Competition from vehicles. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this here today either. Not only the large amounts of snow we have received this winter, but also the epidemiological situation in Slovenia and in wider Europe is not yet good enough to make this possible. With our loyal sponsor, Zavarovalnica Triglav, we have once again prepared the so-called virtual fan stand, which will be located at the exit of the Goriška Brothers Airport. There, virtual spectators will be able to tune in to the competition itself via a remote meeting tool. I would already like to invite all interested parties to register on the triglav.si/planica website. There they will then wait for the call to watch the match. <p/> Planica will be different from everything we have already tried in December. These experiences have been very rewarding. The regime will be similar, but we learned a few things then. Despite the stricter requirement in Slovenian law that all participants in sporting events must be tested every 48 hours, we will stick to it. The extra day of competition makes the risk of infection even greater. We do not want this to happen at the start of the season. We want to maintain our reputation as a good, excellent organiser and that is why this decision has been taken. The rules for World Cup ski jumping competitions in the FIS family are slightly different and in some points even stricter than we are used to elsewhere. <p/> At the moment we have 16 teams registered. Approximately 186 people are on the accreditation list. Access to the valley will be restricted from this weekend. Initially there will be a partial restriction, but from Monday onwards the valley will be virtually closed to all outside visitors. Access will be restricted to accredited persons only. <p/> Preventive measures against covid-19 remain in place. Call for distance, wearing FFP2 masks at all times and disinfection! This is absolutely in place. Please adhere to it, everyone. <p/> As a point of interest, if we hosted the games under floodlights in December, the games during the week will be held in the afternoon, but still in daylight conditions. And with TV Slovenia's TV coverage, we will once again provide additional attractive spots, so this time the coverage from Planica will also be something special. I can say that I have a proof copy of the book that will be published on the occasion of this year's Plania competition. I am sure it will be very well received by everyone. The Goriška brothers are fatally linked to Planica and Planica to them. This is one more moment of this year's Planica. <p/> The budget this time is a few euros short of EUR 1.5 million. If we compare this with the classic finals in previous years, it is as much as half as much. We have had to work very hard to turn every euro around and spend it as economically as possible so that the final calculation shows a positive zero. Unfortunately, the absence of spectators has resulted in a loss of approximately 35% of revenue. If we add to this the loss made last March, the situation is not enviable, but it is not unmanageable. We and our team at OK Planica will do our utmost to successfully eliminate this loss. In addition to our loyal sponsors, who have stood by us all these years, I would like to thank the Ministry of Defence, the Slovenian Armed Forces and, of course, the Slovenian Police, who, with their members, always make sure that Planica is as it is, as we are used to it, and I believe that it will be special this time too, although it will be different, because the spectators will not be able to come to the valley below Ponce. <p/> Aljoša Dolhar, Competition Manager <p/> I feel a certain amount of responsibility. This year, from the very beginning, the preparations have been a bit different than usual. We had a specific situation and we had three types of snow on the airfield. We had about 4000 cubic metres of snow left over from the March event, which we stored and then used in December. A lot of natural snow fell on top of that. We estimate the quantity to be around 12 000 cubic metres. In addition, we produced about 5,000 cubic metres of artificial snow. During the winter races, in cooperation with NC Planica, we kept the ski jump and the run-off area tamped, the snow compacted, mixed and, above all, prevented from sliding. On the downhill run, we also kept the ski from December. Only this one had to be cleaned and re-cut. The situation at the moment is such that today we have started removing the spare snow that we had stored in the run-out. We are spreading the snow on the runway with a tamping machine. We have the skis practically ready, so we are just waiting to open them and start using them. We will be ready with the machine work on Friday afternoon. We are planning a big operation on Saturday and Sunday with our team to get everything ready for the test on Tuesday. <p/> Today and tomorrow in Planica there are optional training sessions for the pre-competitors. After tomorrow we will form a team of 20-25 jumpers who will jump next week. On Tuesday at 15:30 we expect the first series of the aerodrome test. The second series is planned for 17:00, so that we can test the visibility and conditions at the same time. As far as the weather forecast is concerned, I have to say that it is quite favourable at the moment. From Tuesday onwards we expect stable weather, with moderate temperatures. At night it will be -5 to -8, which will make our work easier. Daytime temperatures will range from 2 to 8 degrees. The weather will be partly clear to mainly cloudy, which is better than very clear. I hope this forecast is accurate. Wind conditions should also be very stable. The weather is also very good for us at the moment. Who will jump first will be known after tomorrow's practice. <p/> This year in Planica the whole jury of the competition will change, not only the competition director. There is also a change of TD and ATD. We will see what this means on Sunday after the competition. The Technical Delegate will be Ivo Greger from the Czech Republic, who I understand has no experience with flying, but is an experienced TD. His assistant is my assistant on the flights, Thomas Hasselberger from Germany. We have worked well together at all the airshows and I hope that this will make a difference and that we will work harmoniously as a jury.",Opinion/Argumentation,test

957,"Case-law: Admissibility of a revision 05.10.2015 According to settled case-law, if the claimant does not state the value of the object at issue for each individual claim, but only states the total value, this is not sufficient for the admissibility of a revision. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the claims that the defendants were obliged to enter into a contract of sale with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which they would sell the property to them and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the defendants the unpaid part of the purchase price. The applicants also claimed that the defendants were obliged to deliver possession of the property to them and to pay them a monthly fee until delivery. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal. The applicants lodged an appeal against the final judgment, raising all the grounds of appeal and seeking an amendment of the judgment under appeal to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> The review was not allowed. The applicants brought three claims against the three defendants. The claims for the conclusion of a contract of sale and for the delivery of immovable property are non-monetary claims for which the right to review depends on the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Notwithstanding Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (CPL), the value of the contested part of a final judgment is to be determined by adding together the values of the individual claims or parts of those claims which are still in dispute, where the decision on the review depends on the resolution of legal issues common to all those claims or where the individual claims are so interrelated that the decision on one claim depends on the decision on another claim (Article 367(5) CPL). However, in the case of the first two claims (for the conclusion of the contract of sale and for the delivery of the immovable property), there is not only an objective cumulation, but also a subjective one. There are three defendants. <p/> Where a claim is brought against several defendants, it is incumbent on the plaintiff, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, to state the value of the object of the dispute for each defendant individually and not for all the defendants jointly. If the plaintiff fails to do so and in such a case states only one value of the subject-matter in dispute for all defendants together, this is a so-called undifferentiated value of the subject-matter in dispute. <p/> The defendants are not united co-defendants, since they are not in such a substantive community that only the same decision for all three would be possible. Since they are co-owners and can dispose of their co-ownership interest in the immovable property independently, the defendants are ordinary co-defendants within the meaning of Article 191(1)(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and the aggregation of values under Article 41(1) in conjunction with Article 367(5) of the Civil Procedure Code is therefore not applicable in such a case. <p/> Moreover, the claimants are also ordinary co-claimants, since they claim the conclusion of the contract and delivery of possession each for themselves in accordance with their share of the joint ownership. In view of the co-partnership relationship on both sides, the Supreme Court found that there were six claims, each of which could share a separate legal fate. The admissibility of the revision would therefore be judged on the value of each individual claim. <p/> However, since the applicants did not indicate the value of the subject-matter at issue for each individual claim, but only one, aggregate value (EUR 135,000) was indicated, this is an undifferentiated indication of the value of the subject-matter at issue, which, according to settled case-law, is not sufficient for the admissibility of the revision. It is not possible to determine to which of the claimants and to which of the defendants the total value of the disputed object referred to in the application relates, so that the situation is the same as if the value of the disputed object had not been mentioned at all, which means that the revision is not admissible. Since the value of the pecuniary claim also did not exceed the threshold of EUR 40 000, the review is not admissible in that respect either. In accordance with Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Review dismissed the unauthorised revision.",Legal,test

Various pistachios, peanuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and more. I make them by hand, so they come in different sizes, big and small. And when they've been cooked, I'll salt them according to size. But I will use the first one, cracked from cooking, to feed them. Tomorrow and all week they will dry in the wind.
